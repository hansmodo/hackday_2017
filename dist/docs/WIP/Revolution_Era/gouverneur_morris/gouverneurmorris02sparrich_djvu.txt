CORRESPONDENCE, 

RESPECTING A NEGOTIATION WITH THE 
BRITISH MINISTRY. 



GEORGE WASHINGTON TO GOUVEIINEUR MORRIS. 

New- York, 13th October, 1789. 
Sir, 

It being important to both countries, that the treaty of 
peace between Great Britain and the United States should be 
observed and performed with perfect and mutual good faith, 
and that a treaty of commerce should be concluded by them, 
on principles of reciprocal advantage to both, I wish to be as 
certained of the sentiments and intentions of the Court of Lon 
don on these interesting subjects. 

It appears to me most expedient to have these inquiries 
made informally, by a private agent ; and understanding that 
you will soon be in London, I desire you in that capacity, and 
on the authority and credit of this letter, to converse with his 
Britannic Majesty s Ministers on these points, viz. whether 
there be any and what objections to performing those articles in 
the treaty, which remain to be performed on his part ; and 
whether they incline to a treaty of commerce with the United 
States on any and what terms ? 

This communication ought regularly to be made to you by 



4 NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 

the secretary of state, but that office not being at present filled , 
my desire of avoiding delays induces me to make it under my 
own hand. It is my wish to promote harmony and mutual sat 
isfaction between the two countries ; and it would give me great 
pleasure to find that the result of your agency, in the business 
now committed to you, will conduce to that end. 

I am, Sir, Your most obedient humble servant, 

GEORGE WASHINGTON. 



Gl?f)RGE WASHINGTON TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

New-York, October 13lh, 1789. 

Sir, 

My letter to you, herewith enclosed, will give you the cre 
dence necessary to enable you to do the business, which it com 
mits to your management, and which I am persuaded you will 
readily undertake. 

Your inquiries will commence by observing, that, as the pre^ 
sent constitution of government and of the courts established in 
pursuance of it, removes the objections heretofore made to 
putting the United States in possession of their frontier posts, 
it is natural to expect from the assurances of his Majesty and 
the national good faith, .that no unnecessary delays will take 
place. Proceed then to press a speedy performance of the 
treaty, respecting that object. 

Remind them of the article by which it was agreed, that 
negroes belonging to our citizens should not be carried away, 
and of the reasonableness of making compensation for them. 
Learn with precision, if possible, what they mean to do on this 
head. 

The commerce between the two countries you well under 
stand. You are apprized of the sentiments and feelings of the 
United States on the present state of it, and you doubtless have 
heard, that in the late session of Congress, a very respectable 
number of both houses were inclined to a discrimination of du 
ties unfavorable to Britain, and that it would have taken place, 



NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. b 

but for conciliatory considerations, and the probability that the 
late change in our government and circumstances would lead 
to more satisfactory arrangements. 

Request to be informed, therefore, whether they contemplate 
a treaty of commerce with the United States, and on what 
principles or terms in general. In treating this subject, let it be 
strongly impressed on your mind, that the privilege of carrying 
our productions in our vessels to their islands, and of bringing in 
return the productions of those islands to our own ports and 
markets, is regarded here as of the highest importance ; and you. 
will be careful not to countenance any idea of our dispensing 
with it in a treaty. Ascertain, if possible, their views on this 
point ; for it would not be expedient to commence negotiations 
without previously having good reasons to expect a satisfactory 
termination of them. 

It may also be well for you to take a proper occasion of re 
marking, that their omitting to send a minister here, when the 
United States sent one to London, did not make an agreeable 
impression on this country ; and request to know what would 
be their future conduct on similar occasions. 

It is in my opinion very important, that we avoid errors in 
our system of policy respecting Great Britain, and this can on 
ly be done by forming a right judgment of their disposition and 
views. Hence you will perceive how interesting it is, that you 
obtain the information in question, and that the business be so 
managed, as that it may receive every advantage, which abili 
ties, address, and delicacy can promise and afford. 
1 am. Sir, Your most obedient humble servant, 

GEORGE WASHINGTON. 



TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Paris, 22d January, 1790. 

Sir, 

I received from Major Hosgiil, who arrived here on the twen 
ty first instant, the two letters which you did me the honor to 

2* 



(5 NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 

write upon the thirteenth of October. I shall, in consequence, 
set off for London as soon as I possibly can. When last in 
thai city, I saw the Duke of Leeds twice at the French Ambas 
sador s, and from some slight circumstances was induced to 
believe, that the British court are better disposed towards a con 
nexion with the United States, than they were some eighteen 
months ago. The principal difficulty will, I imagine, arise from 
the personal character of the King, which is that of persever 
ance, and from the personal dislike, which he bears to his for 
mer subjects. I have the honor to be, &tc. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO THE DUKE OF LEEDS. 

Froome s Hotel, Covent Garden, 28th of March, 1790. 

Mr Morris had the honor to wait upon his Grace, the Duke 
of Leeds, this morning, but had not that of seeing him. He 
presents his most respectful compliments, and will be happy to 
know the time when it will be most convenient for his Grace to 
receive certain communications, which Mr Morris is directed 
to make to his Majesty s ministers, by the President of the Uni 
ted States of America. 

DUKE OF LEEDS TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

Whitehall, March 28th, 1790. 

The Duke of Leeds presents his compliments to Mr Mor 
ris, and will be glad to see him at the office tomorrow, at half 
past two. 

TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

London April 7th, 1790. 
Sir, 

I arrived in this city on Saturday evening, the twenty- 
seventh of March, and called the next morning on the Duke 



NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 7 

of Leeds, minister of foreign affairs. He was not at home ; 
I therefore wrote to him a note, a copy whereof is enclosed, as 
also his answer received that evening. On Monday, the 
twenty-ninth, I waited upon him at Whitehall, and after the 
usual compliments presented your letter, telling him that it 
would explain the nature of my business. Having read it, he 
said with much warmth and gladness in his appearance, I am 
very happy, Mr Morris, to see this letter, and under the Presi 
dent s own hand. I assure you it is very much my wish to 
cultivate a friendly and commercial intercourse between the 
two countries ; and more, 1 can answer for that of his Majesty s 
servants, that they are of the same opinion. I am happy, my 
Lord, to find that such sentiments prevail, for we are too near 
neighbors not to be either good friends or dangerous enemies. 
* You are perfectly right, sir ; and certainly it is to be desired 
as well for our mutual interests, as for the peace and happiness 
of mankind, that we should be upon the best footing. 

I assured him of our sincere disposition to be upon good 
terms, and then proceeded to mention those points in the 
treaty of peace, which remained to be performed ; and first, I 
observed that, by the Constitution of the United States, which 
he had certainly read, all obstacles to the recovery of British 
debts are removed, and that if any doubts could have remained, 
they are now done away by the organization of a federal court, 
which has cognizance of causes arising under the treaty. 
He said he was happy to receive this information ; that he had 
been of opinion, and had written to Mr Adams, that the articles 
ought to be performed in the order in which they stood in the 
treaty. Not choosing to enter into any discussion of his 
conduct in relation to Mr Adams, I told his Grace that I had 
one rule or principle for public and private life, in conformity 
to which I had always entertained the idea, that it would con 
sist most with the dignity of the United States, first, to perform 
all their stipulations, and then to require such performance 
irom others ; and that in effect, if each party were on mutual 
covenants to suspend its compliance, expecting that of the 



8 NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 

other, all treaties would be illusory. He agreed in this sen* 
timent. Upon which I added, that the United States had now 
placed themselves in the situation just mentioned. 

And here I took occasion to observe that the Southern States, 
which had been much blamed in this country for obstructing 
the recovery of British debts, were not liable to all the severity 
of censure, which had been thrown upon them. That their 
negroes having been taken or seduced away, and the payment 
for those negroes having been stipulated by treaty, they had 
formed a reliance on such payment for the discharge of debts 
contracted with British merchants, both previously and subse 
quently to the war. That the suspension of this resource had 
occasioned a deficiency of means, so that their conduct had 
been dictated by an overruling necessity. 

Returning then to the main business, I observed that as we 
had now fully performed our part, it was proper to mention that 
two articles remained to be fulfilled by them, viz. that which 
related to the posts, and that regarding a compensation for the 
negroes ; unless indeed they had sent out orders respecting 
the former, subsequent to the writing of your letter ; and I took 
the liberty to consider that as a very probable circumstance, 
He now became a little embarrassed, and told me that he 
could not exactly say how that matter stood. That as to the 
affair of the negroes, he had long wished to have it brought up, 
and to have something done, but something or other had always 
interfered. He then changed the conversation ; but I brought 
it back, and he changed it again. Hence it was apparent that 
he could go no farther than general professions and assurances. 

I then told him that there was a little circumstance, which 
had operated very disagreeably upon the feelings of America. 
Here he interrupted me. * I know what you are going to say 
our not sending a minister I wished to send you one, but 
then I wished to have a man every way equal to the task, a 
man of abilities, and one agreeable to the people of America ; 
but it was difficult. It is a great way off, and many object on 
that score. I expressed my persuasion, that this country 
could not want men well qualified for every office .5 and he 



NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 9 

again changed the conversation. Wherefore, as it was not 
worth while to discuss the winds and the weather, I observed 
that lie might probably choose to consider the matter a little, 
and to read again the treaty, and compare it with the Ameri 
can Constitution. He said that he should, and wished me to 
leave your letter, which he would have copied, and return it to 
me. I did so, telling him that I should be very glad to have 
a speedy answer, and he promised that I should. 

Thus, sir, this matter was begun ; but nine days have since 
elapsed, and I have heard nothing farther from the Duke of 
Leeds. It is true that Easter holidays have intervened, and 
that public business is in general suspended during that period. 
I shall give them sufficient time to show whether they are as 
well disposed as he has declared, and then give him a hint. 
Before I saw him I communicated to the French Ambassador, 
in confidence, that you had directed me to call for a perform 
ance of the treaty. He told me at once that they would not 
give up the posts. Perhaps he may be right. I thought it 
best to make such communication, because the thing itself 
cannot remain a secret ; and by mentioning it to him we are 
enabled to say with truth, that in every step relating to the 
treaty of peace we have acted confidentially in regard to our 
ally. I have the honor to be, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

London, 13th April, 1790. 
Dear Sir, 

My letter of the seventh will have communicated what 
passed with the Duke of Leeds respecting the business you 
committed to rne. I take the liberty to mention here, that from 
his countenance and manner on the perusal of your letter, he 
seemed to derive from it that sort of pleasure, which a man 
feels at the removal of something, which every now and then 
brings to his mind disagreeable ideas. I do not exactly see 



10 NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 

from what cause this emotion was produced. By the eagerness 
of his subsequent expressions, I conjectured that the critical 
situation of Europe had excited some disquietude respecting 
the part, which the United States might take in case of a gen 
eral war. What strengthened that idea, and perhaps led me to 
form it, was that in a chamber to which I was introduced previous 
to the audience, there was a large book of maps open at that 
part of Poland. But the silence since observed leads to a sus 
picion, that his satisfaction was derived from another source. I 
am told that in a late debate the ministers committed them 
selves by throwing out in pretty clear terms the idea, that some 
sort of treaty was on the carpet with America. And if so, the 
opening now given must have relieved them from the fear of 
future contradiction. 

I trouble you, my dear sir, with all this conjecture, because it 
is not impossible that circumstances may turn up on your side 
of the water, with which it may be useful to compare minutely 
what passes here. I am, &c. 

GoUVERNEUR MoRRIS. 



TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

London, 13th April, 1790. 
Sir, 

This will accompany the duplicate of what I had the honor 
to write on the seventh by the packet. I am still waiting for 
intelligence from the Ministers, who (to judge by appearances) 
slumber profoundly upon the application made to them. Yes 
terday the two houses of Parliament again entered on business, 
after their recess for the Easter holidays ; and Mr Pitt has 
announced the budget for next Monday. Some rational con 
jectures, as to their dispositions and intentions, may perhaps be 
formed from the business of that day. I have the honor to 
be, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS- 



NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND, 11 

DUKE OF LEEDS TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

Whitehall, April 28th, 1790. 
Sir, 

I should not have so long delayed returning an answer to 
the letter you received from General Washington, which you 
had the goodness to communicate to me last month, had I not 
heard you were in Holland. I received some time ago a 
note from you, which I should soon have acknowledged, but 
was at first prevented by a multiplicity of engagements, and 
since by illness. 

The two subjects contained in General Washington s letter 
are indisputably of the highest importance, and I can safely 
assure you, that it has ever been the sincere and earnest wish 
of this country to fulfil her engagements (contracted by the 
treaty of peace) with the United States, in a manner consist 
ent with the most scrupulous fidelity. 

We cannot but lament every circumstance, which can have 
delayed the accomplishment of those engagements, (comprised 
in the treaty) to which those States were in the most 
solemn manner bound ; and, should the delay in fulfilling them 
have rendered their final completion impracticable, we have 
no scruple in declaring our object is, to retard the fulfilling 
such subsequent parts of the treaty as depend entirely upon 
Great Britain, until redress is granted to our subjects upon the 
specific points of the treaty itself, or a fair and just compen 
sation obtained for the non-performance of those engagements 
on the part of the United States. 

With respect to a commercial treaty between the two 
countries, I can only say, that it is the sincere wish of the 
British government to cultivate a real and bond fide system of 
friendly intercourse with the United States ; and that every 
measure, which can tend really and reciprocally to produce 
that object, will be adopted with the utmost satisfaction by 
Great Britain. 

I am, Sir, Your most obedient humble servant, 

LEEDS* 



12 NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND., 



TO THE DUKE OF LEEDS. 

Covent Garden, 29th April, 1790. 

My Lord, 

When I had the honor of an interview with your Grace at 
Whitehall, on Monday, the twenty-ninth of last month, I left, at 
your request, a letter from the President of the United States 
to me, which you promised to return after you should have had 
it copied. As your Grace seemed to be particularly pleased 
with the contents of that letter, I took the liberty to request 
that I might be speedily honored with the communication of 
your sentiments on the subjects of it. This you were so kind 
as to promise. Your subsequent silence led me to apprehend, 
that this affair might have been overlooked in the attention to 
matters of more apparent moment. I took the liberty there 
fore to recall it to your Grace s recollection by a note of the 
nineteenth instant, which was delivered at Whitehall, and to 
which no reply has been received. 

Permit me now, my Lord, to request that the President s 
letter may be returned, and excuse me for expressing at the 
same time a wish, that you would enable me to transmit the 
evidence of those friendly dispositions towards America, which 
you were pleased to express. It flows from the sincere desire 
that more perfect harmony may be established between the 
two countries, and a solicitude to obviate unpleasant circum 
stances. I have the honor to be, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO THE DUKE OF LEEDS. 

Covent Garden, 30th April, 1790, 

My Lord, 

I was honored by your Grace s letter of the twenty-eighth 
late last evening, and take the earliest oprortunity to acknow 
ledge it. Be assured, my Lord, that I regret much the indis- 



NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 13 

position which suspended your answer, and sincerely wish that 
it may be speedily removed. 

I am happy to be assured by such respectable authority, that 
it has ever been the sincere and earnest wish of this country 
to fulfil her engagements with the United States in a manner 
consistent with the most scrupulous fidelity. This indeed 
has never admitted of a question in my mind, because I would 
not harbor a doubt of the national faith of Great Britain ; and 
I have the pleasure to observe to you, my Lord, that sentiments 
of this kind induced the Congress at their last session to 
reject, by a considerable majority, some regulations which 
might have appeared hostile, and proved injurious to your 
commercial interests. I am perfectly convinced from this, and 
from many other circumstances, that the United States have a 
constant determination to perform in the fullest manner every 
stipulation which they have made ; for this is not only in itself 
a moral duty peculiarly binding upon every sovereign power, 
but it is specially secured by that constitutional compact, which 
the people of America have made with each other. Since 
both parties therefore have the best dispositions, and are influ 
enced, by the purest motives, I indulge, my Lord, the hope, 
that every obstacle to a complete performance will be speedily 
removed. And in this hope, without going into an inquiry 
as to the causes of former delay, which might not perhaps 
tend towards conciliation, I must entreat of your Grace s 
goodness to be informed in what respect, and to what degree, 
you consider the final completion of those engagements, to 
which the United States were bound, as having been rendered 
impracticable ; for I must own that the idea is new to my 
conception. 

The candor, with which your Grace avows the intention to 
retard a fulfilment of such parts of the treaty as depend upon 
Great Britain, meets, as it merits, my utmost acknowledgment. 
I am very far from questioning the policy, nor will I presume 
to doubt the propriety, of a caution which is, I trust, unnecessa 
ry, and which might indeed be unpleasant to the feelings of 
3 VOL. ii. 



14 NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 

Americans, if they could be affected with punctilious senti 
ments in the discussion of national interests. But it becomes 
my duty to ask of you, my Lord, the nature and extent of the 
redress expected for the subjects of his Britannic Majesty, 
upon the specific points of the treaty ; and, in the supposed 
case that this should have become impracticable, the kind and 
the measure of compensation to be required from us, as pre 
liminary to the fulfilment of those stipulations which remain to 
be performed by you. 

I trust that 1 am mistaken in that part of your Grace s let 
ter, which relates to a commercial treaty, because it really 
appears to me as expressive only of the wish to cultivate 
merely an amicable intercourse, founded on commercial good 
faith, and as implying some disinclination to the securing of 
that intercourse by the force of treaty. I should be very 
unhappy to convey a false interpretation of the sentiments of 
this government upon an object of such importance. This 
might be prejudicial to both countries, and therefore T shall 
indulge the expectation that, if I am wrong, your Grace will 
have the goodness to set me right. I have the honor to be, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

London, May 1st, 1790. 

Sir, 

Herewith I have the honor to transmit a duplicate of my last 
letter of the thirteenth of April. Not having heard from the 
Duke of Leeds I wrote him a note on the nineteenth. To 
this I received no reply ; wherefore, on the twenty-ninth, I ad 
dressed him again by a letter of which a copy is enclosed. 
This was delivered at his office, Whitehall, between eleven and 
twelve in the morning of the twenty -ninth, and at half past ten 
in the evening the letters were sent to me. You will observe, 
that his letter is dated the 28th, and of course takes no notice 
of that to which it is in fact the answer ; but the style and gen- 



NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 15 

eral complexion, as well as the circumstances attending the de 
livery of it, clearly show that it was not written until the even 
ing of the twenty-ninth. 

I might in reply have made some strictures upon the infor 
mation that I was in Holland, &c. &c. I might also have con 
trasted the expressions of good faith with the conduct of the 
administration, and have observed upon the idea that the Uni 
ted States were bound in the most solemn manner, while from 
the subsequent parts of his letter it would seem that Great 
Britain is not bound at all, or at most but loosely. There is 
also a confusion of language, which resembles the stammering 
of one, who endeavors to excuse a misdeed, which he resolves 
to commit. Thus on the supposition that completion of the 
treaty by us is impossible, he insists that we shall complete it, 
or make compensation. The expressions in the last clause are, 
if possible, more vague than all the rest, and the reply might 
have been proportionately more pointed. 

My letter of yesterday contains nothing of what is just stat 
ed, although perhaps it ought to have noticed some parts. I 
must rely on your kindness, sir, both to interpret favorably 
what I have done, and to excuse my omissions. I thought it 
best to heap coals of fire on their heads, and thereby either bring 
them into our views, or put them most eminently in the wrong. 
It was moreover my wish to draw forth specific propositions, 
because these will admit of discussion, or else, if manifestly un 
just, they may not only be repelled, but they will serve to show 
a predetermined breach of faith by them, which will justify 
whatever conduct we may afterwards find it proper to adopt. 
If, as is not improbable, they should give us no answer, or one 
so vague as to mean nothing, I shall pursue, according to cir 
cumstances, my object of compelling them to speak plainly, or 
refuse absolutely. 

It seems pretty clear, that they wish to evade a commercial 
treaty, but not peremptorily to reject it ; and, therefore, I have 
construed into rejection his Grace s abstruse language, leaving 
him the option to give it a different interpretation. I do not 



16 NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 

expect that he will, though he may perhaps write an explana 
tory comment, more unintelligible than the text. 

I have some reason to believe, that the present administration 
intend to keep the posts and withhold payment for the negroes. 
If so, they will color their breach of faith by the best pretexts 
in their power. I incline to think also, that they consider a 
treaty of commerce with America as being absolutely unneces 
sary, and that they are persuaded they shall derive all the benefit 
from our trade without treaty. It is true that we might lay them 
under restrictions in our ports, but they believe that an attempt 
of that sort would be considered by one part of America as 
calculated by the other for private emolument, and not for the 
general good. The merchants here look on it as almost im 
possible for us to do without them ; and it must be acknowledg 
ed that past experience, and the present situation of neighboring 
countries, go far to justify that opinion. Whether the ministers 
shall act according to their own ideas, or consult mercantile 
people,, they will equally, I think, repel advances from us ; and, 
therefore&gt; it seems more prudent to lay the foundations of fu 
ture advantage, than attempt to grasp at present benefit. I will 
not pretend to suggest any measures for the adoption of con 
gress, whose wisdom and whose sense of national honor will 
certainly lead them to act properly, when the proper moment 
shall present itself. It will naturally strike every mind, that 
while the legislature of this country continues to invest the ex 
ecutive authority with great power respecting the Ameri 
can commerce, the administration here will have advantages 
in treaty, which can only be balanced by similar confidence on 
the part of congress, in the executive of America. 

But very much will, I think, depend upon the situation of 
France. If appearances there should change, and so much 
vigor be infused into the government as would enable it to call 
forth the national efforts in support of their interest and honor, 
a great revolution would be produced in the opinions here. 
From the conduct of the aristocratic hierarchy in the low coun 
tries, who are instigated and supported by Prussia, I have long 



NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 17 

been thoroughly convinced that the alternative of war, or the 
most ignominious terms of peace, would be proposed to the 
imperial courts. Counting upon the absolute nullity of France, 
and supposing that this country can at any moment intimidate 
that into abject submission, Prussia and Poland will, I think, join 
themselves to Turkey and Sweden against Russia and Austria, 
which are both exhausted, and one of them dismembered. 
Probably the war will be commenced before this letter reaches 
your hands, and then Britain and Holland are to be the um 
pires, or rather dictators, of peace. 

I have taken the liberty to touch thus far upon the general 
system of European politics, as it may tend to show that for the 
present, Great Britain will rather keep things in suspense with 
us, being herself in a state of suspense as to others. I will not 
go into conjectures about the events, which will take place upon 
the continent. They will, 1 believe, as is usual, disappoint 
the projectors ; but be that as it may, our affairs can derive no 
advantages now from what shall happen hereafter. 1 presume 
that a dissolution of parliament will take place shortly, although 
many of the best informed people think, or at least say they 
think, otherwise. But it is clear to my mind, that the admin 
istration will wish to have before them a prospect of seven years 
stability to their system, be that what it may, and they will not 
at the moment of a general election expose themselves to criti 
cism by any act of doubtful construction. This forms with them 
an additional reason for being evasive in regard to us. Perhaps 
there never was a moment in which this country felt herself 
greater, and consequently it is the most unfavorable moment to 
obtain advantageous terms from her in any bargain. But this 
appearance is extremely fallacious. Their revenue is not yet 
equal to their expenditure ; money is indeed poured in upon them 
from all quarters, because of the distracted situation of affairs 
among their neighbors, and hence their stocks have risen great 
ly since the peace, so that they can borrow at an interest of 
four per cent ; but supposing they should not be obliged to en 
gage in the war, still there are two events, either of which would 
3* 



18 NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 

overturn the fabric of their prosperity. If France establishes 
a solid system of finance, then capitalists will prefer five per cent 
with her, ^p four per cent from Britain ; for, all other things be 
ing equal, there is no shadow of comparison between the re 
sources of the two countries. If France commits a bankrupt 
cy, the disorders consequent thereon will doubtless be violent, 
but the storm once passed, she would be able to make greater 
exertions by her annual resources, than Britain could compass 
by every possible anticipation of credit. There is a middle 
situation between sinking and swimming, in which the French 
finances may flounder on for some time to come, but even this 
state of wretchedness will produce rather evil than good to 
Great Britain ; for she has already reaped all the harvest, which 
could be gathered from the distress of her neighbors, and must 
necessarily lose the benefits of the famous commercial treaty, 
in proportion as the resources of her customer are cut off. 

Under the various contingencies, which present themselves 
to my contemplation, and there are many which I will not trou 
ble you with the perusal of, it appears clearly, that the favorable 
moment for us to treat is not yet come. It is indeed the mo 
ment for this country, and they seem determined to let it pass 
away. I must again entreat your indulgence, sir, for this long 
and desultory letter. Accept, [ pray you, the assurances of 
that respect with which I have the honor to be, &ic.

TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

London, May 2d, 1790. 

Dear Sir, 

You will find enclosed the copy of what I took the liberty 
to trouble you with on the thirteenth of last month. On Satur 
day, the seventeenth, I dined in company with Mr Fox. The 
state of French politics formed, of course, a large part of the 
conversation. The situation of other countries was then pass- 



NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 19 

ed in review, and it became a question how far Britain might 
be engaged in the affairs of the continent. At length I took 
an opportunity to ask what system the administration had 
adopted respecting America. He told me that he could not 
tell, but he believed they had none, and would in all probabi 
lity be governed by events. That he did not believe Mr Pitt 
would trouble his head about the matter, but would probably 
leave it to Lord Hawkesbury and Mr Grenville, who are both 
of them indisposed to us ; whereas Pitt himself is, he supposes, 
rather friendly than otherwise. Mr Fox said further, that he 
and Burke are now almost alone in their opinion, that we 
should be permitted to trade in our own bottoms to their 
islands, and that this opinion loses ground daily ; though for 
his own part he persists in it. 

I find that the ministers apply for information respecting 
America, and particularly American commerce, to a Mr Irvin, 
who long resided in America, and is now in the customs ; a 
mighty sour sort of creature, and one who seems to have a 
mortal aversion for us. I met him at dinner one day, and he 
took pains to let me know, that he was doing all he could to 
prevent any encouragement from being given to our exports, 
by the corn bill, which is now on the carpet. He declared 
that he would, by the force of starvation, oblige the people of 
Britain to raise corn enough for their own consumption, and 
that even the supply of the West India Islands ought to be 
provided in this country. 

You will readily perceive, sir, from this rude sketch of influ 
ential characters, that there is but little disposition for treating 
with us at present. I am, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



20 NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND, 



TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

London, 29th May, 1790. 
Sir, 

I do myself the honor to inclose a copy of my letter of the 
first instant. On the night of the fourth there was a hot press 
here, which has continued ever since, and the declared object 
is to compel Spain to atone for an insult offered to Great 
Britain, by capturing two vessels in Nootka Sound. Permit 
me to mention, incidentally, that it would not be amiss for the 
American captain, who was a witness of the whole transac 
tion, to publish a faithful narrative. 

The general opinion here is, that Spain will submit, and that 
Spain only is the object of this armament. But I hold a very 
different faith. If Spain submits, she may as well give up her 
American dominions ; for the position advanced here is, that 
nations have a right to take possession of any territory unoccu 
pied. Now, without noticing the inconsistency between this 
assertion, and those which preceded the war of 1755, when 
France built Fort du Quesne upon ground unoccupied by 
British subjects, it cannot escape the most cursory observation, 
that the British, sitting down in the vicinity of Spanish settle 
ments, will establish such a system of contraband traffic as 
must ruin the commerce of Cadiz, and the revenue now 
derived from it by the Spanish monarch. 

In former letters I have communicated in some measure my 
ideas upon the second opinion. I shall not therefore recapitu 
late them, but only in general notice, that the armament against 
Spain, should Spain shrink from the contest, will undoubtedly 
be sent to the Baltic, with decisive effect. You will observe 
also that the ministers count upon the nullity of France, of 
which I shall say a word presently. 

In consequence of the orders for impressing seamen, a num 
ber of Americans were taken, and the applications made for 
their relief were in some instances ineffectual. On the morn 
ing of the twelfth, Mr Cutting called to inform me, that he was 



NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 




appointed agent to several of the American masters of ships. 
I gave him my advice as to the best mode of proceeding, and 
particularly urged him to authenticate all the facts by affida 
vits, assuring him that if he was unsuccessful, I would endea 
vor to obtain the assistance of such persons as I might be 
acquainted with. On the seventeenth, Mr Paine called to tell 
me, that he had conversed on the same subject with Mr Burke, 
who had asked him if there was any minister, consul, or other 
agent of the United States, who could properly make applica 
tion to the government, to which he had replied in the nega 
tive ; but said, that I was here, who had been a member of 
Congress, and was therefore the fittest person to step forward. 
In consequence of what passed thereupon between them, he 
urged me to take the matter up, which I promised to do. On 
the eighteenth I wrote to the Duke of Leeds, requesting an 
interview. He desired me to come at three o clock the next 
day ; but his note was delivered after the hour was passed, 
and very shortly after it, came another note, giving me an 
appointment for the twentieth. 

Upon entering his closet he apologized for not answering 
my letters. I told him that I had in my turn an apology to 
make for troubling him with an affair^ on which I was not au 
thorized to speak. He said I had misunderstood one part of 
his letter to me, for that he certainly meant to express a 
willingness to enter into a treaty of commerce. I replied, that 
as to my letter I supposed he would answer it at his leisure, 
and therefore we would wave the discussion. That my 
present object was to mention the conduct of their press- 
gangs, who had taken many American seamen, and had en 
tered American vessels with as little ceremony as those 
belonging to Britain. I believe, my Lord, this is the only 
instance in which we are not treated as aliens. He acknow 
ledged that it was wrong, and would speak to Lord Chatham 
on the subject. I told him that many disagreeable circum- 
ces had already happened, and that there was reason to ex 
pect many more, in a general impress through the British 



22 NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 

dominions. That masters of vessels, on their return to Ameri 
ca, would excite much heat ; c and that, my Lord, combined 
with other circumstances, may perhaps occasion very disa 
greeable events. 

He then repeated his assurances of good will, and express 
ed an anxious wish to prevent all disagreement ; observing at 
the same time, that there was much difficulty in distin 
guishing seamen of the two countries. I acknowledged the 
inconveniences to which they might be subjected by the pre 
tence of British seamen to be Americans, and wished there 
fore that some plan might be adopted, which, founded on good 
faith, might at the same time prevent the concealment of 
British sailors, and protect the Americans from insult. As a 
means of accomplishing that end, I suggested the idea of cer 
tificates of citizenship to be given by the admiralty courts 
in America to our seamen. He seemed much pleased, and 
willing at once to adopt it ; but I desired him to consult first 
the King s servants in that particular department ; and having 
again reminded him that I spoke without authority, took my 
leave ; but at his request, p&gt; omised to visit him again the next 
day. 

The morning of the twenty-first I found him sitting with Mr 
Pitt, to whom he presented me. The first point we took up 
was that of the impress. Mr Pitt expressed his approbation 
of the plan I had proposed to the Duke, but observed that it 
was liable to abuse, notwithstanding every precaution which 
the admiralty offices in America could take. I acknowledged 
that it was, but observed, that even setting aside the great polit 
ical interests of both countries, it was for the commercial inter 
est of Britain rather to wink at such abuse ; for that if they 
should be involved in a war with the House, of Bourbon, our 
commerce with Britain must be in American bottoms ; be 
cause a war premium of insurance would give a decided 
preference to the manufacturers of other countries in our 
markets ; but that no wages would induce American seamen 
to come within the British dominions, if they were thereby 



NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 23 

liable to be impressed. Mr Pitt replied to this, that the 
degree of risk, and consequently the rate of insurance, must 
depend upon the kind of war. Not taking any direct notice 
of this expression, I observed, that notwithstanding the wretch 
ed state of the French Government, there still existed much 
force in that country, and that the power of commanding 
human labor must also exist somewhere ; so that if the gov 
ernment would not arm their fleets, there would still be many 
privateers, and that in effect, the slenderest naval efforts must 
involve merchant vessels in considerable danger. 

Returning then to the consideration of the principal point, 
we discussed the means of carrying the plan with effect, and 
for that purpose I recommended that his majesty s servants 
should order all their marine officers to admit as evidence 
of being American seamen, the certificate to that effect of the 
admiralty in America, containing in it a proper description of 
the person, &c. ; but without excluding, however, other evi 
dence ; and observed, that, in consequence of the communica 
tion, if such orders were given, the executive authority in 
America, without the aid of the legislature, by directions to 
the several admiralties, might carry the plan into effect, so 
far as relates to those seamen who should apply for certifi 
cates. I am induced to believe that this measure, if adopted, 
will not only answer the desired end, but be productive of 
other good consequences in America, which I will not now 
trouble you with the detail of. 

This affair being so far adjusted, we proceeded to new matters, 
and they both assured me that I had misapprehended the Duke s 
letter in regard to a treaty of commerce. I answered cooly, that 
it was very easy to rectify the mistake, but it appeared idle to 
form a new treaty until the parties should be thoroughly satisfied 
with that already existing. Mr Pitt then took up the conver 
sation and said, that the delay of compliance on our part had 
rendered that compliance less effectual, and that cases must 
certainly exist where great injury had been sustained by the 
delay. To this I replied that delay is always a kind of breach, 



24 NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 

since as long as it lasts it is the non-performance of stipulations. 
I proceeded then to a more exact investigation of the question. 
And first, as I knew them to be annoyed with many applications 
for redress by those who had, and those who pretended to have suf 
fered, I attempted to show what I really believe to be the fact, 
viz. that the injury was much smaller than was imagined, be 
cause among the various classes of American debtors, those 
only should be considered who had the ability, and not the will, 
to pay at the peace, and were now deprived of the ability. 
These I supposed to be not numerous ; and as to others, I stat 
ed interest as the natural compensation for delay of payment, 
observing that it was impossible to go into an examination of all 
the incidental evils. 

In the second place, I desired him to consider, that we in 
turn complained, that the British government had not, as they 
ought, paid for the slaves who were taken away. That we 
felt for the situation they were in, of being obliged either to break 
faith with the slaves whom they had seduced by the offer of 
freedom, or to violate the stipulations they had made with us 
upon that subject. That we were willing, therefore, to wave 
our literal claims ; but had every right to insist on compensa 
tion ; and that it would not be difficult for the planters to show, 
that they had sustained an annual loss from the want of men to 
cultivate their lands, and thereby produce the means of paying 
their debts. Mr Pitt exclaimed at this, as if it were an ex 
aggerated statement. I at once acknowledged my belief that 
in this, as in all similar cases, there might be some exaggeration 
on both sides ; but, sir, what T have said tends to show that these 
complaints and inquiries are excellent, if the parties mean to 
keep asunder ; if they wish to come together, all such matter 
should be kept out of sight, and each side perform now, as 
well as the actual situation of things will permit. Mr Pitt then 
made many professions of an earnest desire to cultivate the 
best understanding, Stc. &tc. On the whole, he thought it 
might be best to consider the subject generally, and to see if, 
on general ground, some compensation would not be mutually 



NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 25 

made. I immediately replied, ( If I understand you, Mr Pitt, 
you wish to make a new treaty, instead of complying with the 
old one. He admitted this to be in some sort his idea, I said, 
that even on that ground I did not see what better could be 
done, than to perform the old one. As to the compensation for 
negroes taken away, it is too trifling an object for you to dis 
pute, so that nothing remains but the posts ; I suppose, there 
fore, that you wish to retain those posts. Why, perhaps we 
may. ( They are not worth the keeping, for it must cost you 
a great deal of money, and produce no benefit. The only rea 
son you can have to desire them, is to secure the fur trade, and 
that will centre in this country, let who will carry it on in Ame 
rica. I gave him the reasons for this opinion, which I am sure 
is well founded, but I will not trouble you with them. His an 
swer was well turned. If you consider these posts as a trivial 
object, there is the less reason for requiring them. Pardon 
me, sir, I only state the retaining of them as useless to you, but 
this matter is to be considered in a different point of light. 
Those who made the peace acted wisely in separating the pos 
sessions of the two countries by so wide a water. It rs essen 
tial to preserve this boundary, if you wish to live in amity with 
us. Near neighbors are seldom good ones, for the quarrels among 
borderers frequently bring on wars. If is, therefore, essential 
for both parties that you should give them up ; but as to us it 
is of particular importance, because our national honor is inter 
ested. You hold them with the avowed intention of forcing us 
to comply with such conditions as you may impose. Why, 
sir, as to the consideration of national honor, we can retort the 
observation, and say our honor is concerned in your delay 01 
performance of the treaty. No, sir, your natural and proper 
course was to comply fully on your part, and if then we had re 
fused a compliance, you might rightfully have issued letters of 
marque and reprisal to such of your subjects as were injured 
by our refusal. But the conduct you have pursued naturally 
excites resentment in every American bosom. We do not think 
it worth while to go to war with you for these posts ; but wt 

VOL. II. 3 



26 NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 

know our rights, and will avail ourselves oj them, when time 
and circumstances may suit. 1 

Mr Pitt asked me if I had powers to treat. I told him I 
had not, and that we could not appoint any person as minister, 
they had so much neglected the former appointment. He ask 
ed me whether we would appoint a minister if they did. I told 
him that I could almost promise that we should, but was not 
authorized to give any positive assurance. The question then 
was, how to communicate on this subject. I suggested, that 
since much time might be unnecessarily consumed by reason 
of the distance and uncertainty of communication, it would per 
haps be expedient for them to appoint a minister, and delay 
his departure until we should have made a similar appoint 
ment. Mr Pitt said they might communicate to you their in 
tention to appoint, &c. I told him, that his communication 
might encounter some little difficulty, because you could not 
properly hear anything from the British Consuls, these being 
characters unacknowledged in America. His pride was a lit 
tle touched at this. I should suppose, Mr Morris, that atten 
tion might as well be paid to what they say, as that the Duke of 
Leeds and I should hold the present conversation with you. 
4 By no means, sir, I never should have thought of asking a con 
ference with his Grace, if I had not possessed a letter from the 
President of the United States, which you know, my Lord, I 
left with you, and which I dare say you have communicated to 
Mr Pitt. He had. Mr Pitt said they could in like manner 
write a letter to one of their consuls. Yes, sir, and the letter 
will be attended to, but not the consul, who is in no respect differ 
ent from any other British subject ; and this is the circumstance 
which I wished you to regard. He said in reply to this, that 
etiquette ought not to be pushed so far as to injure business, 
and keep the countries asunder. I assured him that the rulers 
of America had too much understanding to care for etiquette ; 
but prayed him at the same time to recollect, that they (the 
British,) had hitherto kept us at a distance, instead of making 
advances. That you had gone quite as far as they had any 



NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 27 

reason to expect, in writing the letter just mentioned, but that 
from what had passed in consequence of it, and which, as he 
might naturally suppose, I had transmitted, we could not but 
consider them as wishing to avoid an intercourse. He took up 
this point, and expressed again his hope that I would remove 
such an idea, assuring me that they were disposed to cultivate 
a connexion, &c. &c. To this I replied, that any written com 
munications which his Grace of Leeds might make should be 
duly transmitted ; but I did not like to write mere conversation, 
because it might be misconceived ; and disagreeable questions 
afterwards arise, whereas written things remain and speak for 
themselves. They agreed to the propriety of this sentiment. 

I observed further, that our disposition towards a good un 
derstanding was evidenced, not only by your letter, but also by 
the decision of a majority of the House of Representatives, 
against laying extraordinary restrictions on British vessels in 
our ports. Mr Pitt said, that instead of restrictions, we ought 
to give them particular privileges, in return for those which we 
enjoy here. I assured him that I knew of none, except that of 
being impressed, a privilege which of all others we least wished 
to partake of. The Duke of Leeds observed, in the same 
style of jocularity, that we were at least treated in that respect 
as the most favored nation, seeing that we were treated like 
themselves. But Mr Pitt said seriously, that they had cer 
tainly evidenced good will towards us, by what they had done 
respecting our commerce. 1 replied, therefore, with like se 
riousness, that their regulations had been dictated by a view to 
their own interest ; and therefore, as we felt no favor, we own 
ed no obligation. The subject being now pretty well exhaust 
ed, they promised to consult together, and give me the result 
of their deliberations. This I am yet to receive ; but I learn 
that Mr Greenville has this day consulted some persons skilled 
in the fur trade, and that from his conversation it seemed 
probable that they would give up the posts. My information 
is good. 

J have already said that the Ministers here count upon the 



28 NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 

nullity of France. They do not however expect that she will 
violate her treaty with Spain, and therefore they are rather. 
I believe, in hopes that Spain will submit to such terms as 
they may impose. How far they may be bound to aid Prussia 
seerns as yet to be doubtful ;. but for my own part I believe, 
that a war is inevitable, and I act on that ground. If it does 
not take place, they will, I think, desire such things of us, in a 
treaty of commerce, as we shall not be disposed to grant ; but 
if it does happen, then they will give us a good price for our 
neutrality ; and Spain, I think, will do so too ; wherefore this 
appears to be a favorable moment for treating with that court 
about the Mississippi. 

Before I close this letter, already too long, I must entreat 
permission to make one or two explanatory observations/. It 
is evident that the conduct of this government towards us, from 
the time of my first interview with the Duke of Leeds, has de 
pended on the contingencies of war or peace with the neigh 
boring powers ; and they have kept things in suspense accord 
ingly. When, therefore, they came a little forward, it proved 
to me their apprehension of a rupture* I have some reason 
to think, that they are in greater danger than they are them 
selves aware of, and I hatfe much cause to suspect that they 
meditate a blow in Flanders, in which it is not improbable that 
they will be foiled and disappointed. Believing, therefore, 
that I knew their motives, it only remained to square my con 
duct and conversation accordingly. And here you will con 
sider, that the characteristic of this nation is pride ; whence it 
follows, that if they are brought to sacrifice a little of this self- 
importanee, they will readily add some other sacrifices. I 
kept therefore a little aloof, and did not, as I might have done^ 
obtain an assurance that they would appoint a minister if you 
would. On the contrary, it now stands on such ground that 
they must write a letter, making the first advance, which you 
of course will be in possession of. And to that effect I warn 
ed them against sending a message by one of their consuls. I 
am, &c.

TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

London, July 3d, 1790. 

Sir, 

This letter will accompany copies of those, which I had the 
honor to write on the first, and twenty-ninth of May. I have 
heard nothing since from the Duke of Leeds. On the tenth 
of June the King prorogued the parliament, which was dis 
solved on the eleventh. The election will be completed in 
about ten days, and then the ministers will feel themselves 
more at liberty to avow their intentions, than they are at pres 
ent. They will have a great majority, though perhaps weaker 
by half a dozen, than in the last house ; but the immense pat 
ronage, which must result from a war, will soon overbalance 
that difference. 

I was told on the tenth, that the Duke of Leeds is to leave 
the office of secretary of foreign affairs, and is to be succeed 
ed by Lord Hawkesbury, formerly Charles Jenkinson. He is 
an able man, strongly opposed to America, and it is said from 
inclination ; but perhaps it is from the desire to please his roy 
al master. Such an appointment would look like a bar to 
any friendly communication with us ; but I incline to think 
otherwise. He will at least be an efficient minister, and what 
ever he agrees to will go smoothly through the cabinet ; 
whereas the present man is evidently afraid of committing him 
self, by saying or doing anything positive. 

On the seventeenth of June I learnt a conversation, which 
had recently passed with Mr Greenville about the posts, from 
the complexion of which I conclude that they are nearly de 
termined to give them up. In the course of that conversation, 
(in which the minister was collecting information from a gen 
tleman acquainted with the country and its trade,) he said that 
the Americans had m-ade some overtures for a commercial 
treaty, which might, perhaps, take place ; and that he wished 
to be prepared, in case that matter should be brought forward, 
which appeared however to be uncertain. 
4* 



30 NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND: 

He mentioned at the same time, but merely as matter of 
common report, that the Spaniards had agreed to give us the 
navigation of the Mississippi. I am therefore confirmed in my 
opinion, that, if they get engaged in a war, they will be glad to 
form a friendly connexion with us. And as to the contingen 
cy of war, I was informed on the twenty-first of June, that 
about three weeks before that period, they had sent an express 
over land to India, probably with instructions to prepare for, if 
not to commence hostilities. This, added to many other cir 
cumstances, leaves but little room to doubt of their intentions. 
Prussia has been arming and negotiating, and seems as if de 
sirous to gain time, till this country can act. 

The fleet which lay at Spithead had sailed some days 
since for Torbay, and is to be joined, it is said, by a Dutch 
squadron, which came forward in the quality of an ally to 
Great Britain. The idea of calling upon an ally to assist 
a British against a Spanish fleet seems to be a little extraordi 
nary. But it would not be extraordinary, that a Dutch squad 
ron should go into the Baltic, and assist the Swedes against 
Russia. 

We are now so near the moment when the curtain is to be 
drawn up, that I will not trouble you with my conjectures 
about the scenes which are to be displayed. France, I 
am persuaded, will not remain an idle spectator. I am, &c,

This letter will be short ; the intention of it being little more

THOMAS JEFFERSON, SECRETARY OF STATE, TO GOUVERNEUR 

MORRIS. 

New York, August 12th, 1790. 
Dear Sir, 

Your letter of May the 29th to the President of the United 
States has been duly received. You have placed their propo 
sition of exchanging a minister on proper ground. It must 
certainly come from them, and come in unequivocal form. 
With those who respect their own dignity so much, ours must 
not be counted at nought. On their own proposal, formerly, 
to exchange a minister, we sent them one. They have taken 
no notice of that, and talk of agreeing to exchange one now, 
as if the idea were new. Besides, what they are saying to 
you, they are talking to us through Quebec ; but so infor 
mally, that they may disavow it when they please. It would 
only oblige them to make the fortune of the poor Major, whom 
they would pretend to sacrifice. Through him, they talk of a 
minister, a treaty of commerce, and alliance. If the object of 
the latter be honorable, it is useless ; if dishonorable, inadmis 
sible. These tamperings prove, that they view a war as very 
possible ; and some symptoms indicate designs against the 



32 NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND, 

Spanish possessions adjoining us. The consequences of their 
acquiring all the country on our frontier, from the St Croix to 
the St Mary s, are too obvious to you, to need developement. 
You will readily see the dangers which would then environ us. 

We wish you, therefore, to intimate to them, that we cannot 
be indifferent to enterprises of this kind. That we should 
contemplate a change of neighbors with extreme uneasiness ; 
and that a due balance on our borders is not less desirable to 
us, than a balance of power in Europe has always appeared to 
them. We wish to be neutral, and we will be S6, if they will 
execute the treaty fairly, and attempt no conquests adjoining 
us. The first condition is just ; the second imposes no hard 
ship on them. They cannnot complain, that the other domin 
ions of Spain would be so narrow as not to leave them room 
enough for conquest. If the war takes place, we would really 
wish to be quieted on these two points, offering in return an 
honorable neutrality. More than this, they are not to expect. 
It will be proper that these ideas be conveyed, in delicate and 
friendly terms ; but that they be conveyed, if the war takes 
place ; for it is in that case alone, and not till it be begun, that 
we would wish our dispositions to be known. But in no case, 
need they think of our accepting any equivalent for the posts. 

I have the honor to be, with great respect and esteem. 
Dear Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant, 

THOMAS JEFFERSON. 



TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

London, August 16th, 1790. 
Sir, 

I had the honor to write to you on the third of July, of 
which letter I now enclose a copy. I have patiently waited 
since that period for the answer, which had been promised on 
the twenty-first of May, to my letter of the thirtieth of April. 
Had any circumstance turned up, which would in my opinion 
have justified a new application, it should have been made ; 
but this has not been the case. 



NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 33 

You will have seen the declaration, and counter declaration, 
of the Spanish and British courts, exchanged at Madrid the 
twenty-fourth of last month. These leave the material ground 
of controversy in its original state, and the armaments go on 
with unremitting diligence. The event seems to turn upon 
the ability and inclination of France, whose condition is far 
from desirable ; but I shall not attempt to describe it, because 
I have no doubt that Mr Short, being on the spot, will transmit 
much better information than I can pretend to. The poor 
king of Hungary, pressed by Prussia, and distracted by the 
interior commotions of his various dominions, and unsupported 
by France, has been obliged to accede to terms of pacification, 
by no means desirable. This leaves Britain and her friends 
more at liberty to press the other powers. The proceedings 
of the congress have of course been very secret, and if they 
had not, a mere private individual in this country could not 
acquire an early knowledge of them. There is, however, one 
circumstance which, let things terminate as they may, will, I 
conceive, have considerable consequences. The king of Prus 
sia has endeavored to obtain from Poland the cession of Thorn 
and Dantzic. These countries are, you know., already sur 
rounded by his dominions, except towards the sea ; and if he 
had succeeded, or should succeed, he will not only become at 
once a naval power, but will hold in his hand the key to the 
great granary of Europe. This, at a period when from the 
extension of commerce and manufactures in other countries, 
the want of bread is often feared, and sometimes felt, will give 
him immense advantages both in peace and war, besides those 
of rendering his dominions more compact, and of increasing 
his revenue. It is, I think, hardly possible that Britain and 
Holland should have wished for his success, and if his failure 
should be owing to their resistance, it may at no distant period 
give rise to new connexions and alliances in the north. la 
the Baltic they have been very busy. The seasons give but 
little time there for any other naval war. than that which man 
must wage with the elements. They make therefore the best. 



34 NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAN0. 

or, if you please, the worst use of their time. Little, however^ 
has been effected, except the havoc of the human race, which 
is not over numerous in that quarter. The king of Sweden, 
with infinite gallantry, places himself in situations where he 
can gain little, and may lose all. Hitherto he has extricated 
himself by downright fighting, and as it is too late for effectual 
interference from England or Holland, probably both sides, 
having sung Te Deum, will take breath, and may, perhaps, be 
content to try what negotiation can do next winter. 

I have little doubt but that the ministry here would have 
agreed to comply with the treaty of peace, had they found 
themselves engaged in a war, which they have been upon the 
brink of for some months ; and I presume, that in proportion 
as the clouds shall disperse, they will be less tractable. I have 
taken patience, and remained here, though I had many private 
reasons for going to the continent; but as I believed that by 
being on the spot, I might be useful, especially if a favorable 
occasion should offer, I thought it my duty to stay. 

From some circumstances, too slight to be worth mention 
ing, I incline to think that such occasion is not far distant ; but 
never, perhaps, were the affairs of Europe in a situation which 
admitted so little of forming any solid opinion ; and this from 
the spreading of what is called the French disease, in other 
words, revolt. Hungary, part of Germany, Italy, and Savoy, 
with France and Flanders, are already in different stages of 
that disease. Poland is constitutionally afflicted with it. In 
Sweden and Holland slight circumstances would bring for 
ward seeds, which have long been sown, and no man can tell 
or even guess how far it may extend, or what may be the 
consequences. This country is free from the contagion, and 
likely to continue so. Indeed the English seem in some re 
spects to have changed sentiments and manners with the French. 
They are as far gone in loyalty as their neighbors in repub 
licanism. Happy America, where alone, I verily believe, both 
freedom and virtue have their real and substantial existence* 



NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 35 

I wait with anxious expectation to hear what congress may 
have done in relation to this country, as well as upon the im 
portant subject of finance ; for that also would have no small 
influence on the British cabinet. Having long been in the habit 
of contemplating public credit as the most certain and abundant 
national resource, they will naturally, and indeed necessarily, 
take up their opinion of us on that ground. And if at the same 
time their mercantile interest should fed that we have a govern 
ment, it might produce a general conviction that we are not to be 
trifled with. Incidental circumstances among foreign nations 
may give us momentary advantages, and doubtless it is the du 
ty of all public servants to watch those moments, and turn them 
to the best account. But it is by the solidity of our domestic 
system alone, that we can become permanently and intrinsical 
ly respectable. Consequently, it is by that alone, that we can 
hope for permanent and useful connexions. And although we 
ought not from such considerations to become supine or inat 
tentive to the measures of the greater maritime powers, which 
would indeed be very imprudent, yet we may certainly repose 
with greater confidence on the good faith of others, when they 
see, and above all when they feel the value of our friendship. 

I pray your kind excuse, sir, for giving vent to these ideas, 
which are as much the sentiments of my heart as the dictates 
of my understanding. As conclusions of reason, they have nat 
urally been adopted by every thinking man in America ; but 
he must come out of it, perhaps, if he would have their impor 
tance deeply impressed by the impulsion of daily experience. 
I am, &tc. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

London, August 30th, 1790. 

Dear Sir, 

It may perhaps be proper to mention one or two things, 
in relation to the objects treated of in my letters of last 



36 NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 

January. And first, of a commerce with the French Islands. 
Nothing has, I believe, been done in France, which may be 
favorable to our views ; but the commotions in the Islands 
themselves will, I presume, operate like liberal regulations of 
police, and probably the colonists will eventually demand as a 
right, what some time since they would have accepted as a favor. 
I am led to believe that we should not be over anxious on this 
subject just now, because circumstances will perhaps serve us 
better than we can serve ourselves. 

My predictions respecting the Turk have been so far veri 
fied, as that he has got rid of one of his enemies upon tolerable 
terms, for he loses no dominion worth a contest. How far 
the intercessions now making to the Empress of Russia will 
produce the desired effect, seems not to be clearly ascertained. 
If a squadron of Dutch or English ships had arrived in the 
Baltic last May, it is more than probable that the peace of the 
north would have been restored ; but there are many events 
which would enable the Empress of Russia to carry on suc 
cessful operations against both the Turk and the Swede. 
The armies of the former, which opposed those of the Empe 
ror, cannot suddenly be transported to the quarter where they 
are now wanted ; neither will the expense of them cease dur 
ing the campaign. It appears to me that the season is too 
far advanced for anything Prussia can do, let the inclination of 
the king be what it may ; and Sweden, unprotected by naval 
superiority, is exposed to the land force of its enemy, 
without much chance either of aid or diversion. Finland, 
which will probably be the object of the Czarina, cannot main 
tain forces needful to defend it, if the sea communication be 
cut off. Therefore the whole Prussian army, could it be 
transported thither, would be worse than useless. And thus 
the withdrawing of Austria from the war will have less influ 
ence than might have been expected. 

The people of Flanders seem to be given up, after having 
been used to distress the House of Austria. Heaven knows 
what desperation may prompt them to ; but it appears to me 



NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 37 

that a wise conduct on the part of France would have acquir 
ed for her the dominion of that country ; and if ever that 
should happen, France having at the same time a good con 
stitution, the consequence of this island is gone. Antwerp 
seems intended by nature for the emporium of European 
commerce, and the navigation of the Scheldt would undoubt 
edly be opened if it belonged to a great naval power. That 
river and the Thames being nearly opposite to each other, 
mutual visits might be expected, and in these the superiority 
at land must at length prove decisive. 

The situation of France, however, seems at first sight to 
preclude all effort. The national bank, which was in contem 
plation, has never taken effect. After deliberating about it and 
about it, the thing dropped, and they expected to have made 
out with their new paper currency (the assignats ;) but my 
predictions on that subject seem to be verified. Still, how 
ever, the situation of their finances is not desperate. But 
their AssembUe is losing ground daily in the public opinion. 
The army, long encouraged in licentious conduct, is now in 
revolt. All the bands of society are loosened, and authority 
is gone. Unless they are soon involved in a foreign war, it is 
impossible to conjecture what events will take place. For 
sometime past the ministers have been threatened with the 
Lanterne, and they would gladly get out of office. The 
great difficulty is, to find successors, or rather substitutes. 
Lafayette has been contriving an intermediate ministry to last 
for a few months, till, by the dissolution of the assembly, who, 
you know, passed a self-denying ordinance, a set could be taken 
from among the present members of that body. But this will 
prove a bad business ; for if the intermediaries are not able, 
then they will make things worse ; and if they are, they will 
not give up their places. 

We are in hourly expectation of hearing the decision of the 
JlssembUe upon the family compact. The Spanish. Ambassa 
dor has required, in pointed terms, a compliance on the part 
of France. This, I have good reason to believe, was in con- 

VOL. II. 4 



38 NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 

cert with the French administration. If it were possible to an 
swer for such a body as the JlssembUe^ and so placed as they 
are, I would pronounce in favor of their adherence to the terms 
of that compact. If so, the tone o f the British ministy may 
be a little lowered. In the meantime, both the Spanish and 
English fleets are out, and were approaching towards each other. 
Probably each side means only to terrify at present; but Spain 
will not recede any farther, except in the last necessity. 

In a day or two I expect to learn something of their inten 
tions here respecting us ; and if I do not hear from them, I shall 
make a final address to his Grace of Leeds. 

It is very flattering to me, Sir, that you are so kind as to ap 
prove of my communications with the ministers of this country, 
so far as they had gone in the beginning of May. I earnestly 
hope that my subsequent conduct may meet the same favora 
ble interpretation. This you may rely on, that if in any case 
I go wrong, it will be from an error of judgment. I am, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MoRRIS. 



TO THE DUKE OF LEEDS. 

London, September 10th, 1790, 

My Lord, 

At the close of a conversation with your Grace, and the Right 
Honorable Mr Pitt, on the twenty-first of May last, I was told 
that you would confer together, and transmit a reply to the let 
ter, which I had the honor of addressing to your Grace on the 
thirtieth of April. In expectation of that reply, I have pa 
tiently waited in this city to the present hour, though called by 
many affairs to the continent. But my departure cannot be 
much longer delayed, and therefore it becomes necessary to 
intrude once more on your Grace s attention. 

I was led to believe, my Lord, that a friendly connexion 
might have taken place between this country and that of which 
I have the honor to be a citizen. How far it might be use- 



NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 39 

ful to Great Britain, I presume not to conjecture ; being per 
fectly convinced, from the wisdom and extensive information of 
his Majesty s ministers, that the best rule for private judgment 
must be derived from their conduct. But, my Lord, I candidly 
own, that such connexion appears to be of great consequence 
to America ; and therefore the hope of becoming instrumental 
in the accomplishment of it was most pleasing ; nor am I asham 
ed to avow my concern at the disappointment. 

Your Grace will readily recollect the purport of the letter, which 
you did me the honor to write on the twenty-eighth of April, 
and that mine of the thirtieth entreated a communication of the 
nature and extent of that redress, which his Majesty s ministers 
expected upon the specific points of the treaty of peace, and the 
kind and measure of compensation they would require in case, as 
had been supposed, the specific performance on our part were 
now impracticable. Months having elapsed in silence, your Grace 
will, I hope, pardon me for observing that the pointed avowal of 
a determination to withhold performance, unless upon certain 
conditions, the communication of which is withheld, might be 
construed into unconditional refusal. Your personal integrity 
and honor, my Lord, the acknowledged justice of his Majesty, 
and the pride of British faith, prohibit me from harboring that 
idea. But it may perhaps be entertained by my countrymen, 
and if it should, it may lead to measures, which in their conse 
quences may eventually induce the two nations to seek rather 
the means of reciprocal injury, than of mutual advantage. I 
humbly hope that this may never happen. The sentiment of 
America has long been conciliatory, and I should feel inexpressi 
ble satisfaction if your Grace would supply me with the means 
of restoring activity to her friendly dispositions. 
I have the honor to be, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS, 



40 NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 

DUKE OF LEEDS TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

Whitehall, September 10th, 1790. 

Sir, 

I have just received the honor of your letter of this day s 
date. I well remember the nature of the conversation you allude 
to, as well as the particular points upon which the two coun 
tries mutually complain of a non-observance of treaty. Each 
party may perhaps have reason for complaint. I can assure you, 
Sir, 1 sincerely lament it. I am not entering into a ministerial 
discussion upon the subject of our not being already further ad 
vanced, in what we are both interested in, a real bond fide in 
tercourse of friendship, but am only acknowledging, confidential 
ly, my own private opinion, and what it has not been hitherto in 
my power to remedy. 

I shall, I trust, be enabled very soon to address myself upon 
a new subject to General Washington ; and in the mean time, 
shall be very happy to see you, Sir, before your departure for 
America. I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient hum 
ble servant. 

LEEDS. 

TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

London, September 18th, 1790. 
Sir, 

T had the honor to address you on the sixteenth of August, 
and stated as nearly as I could the situation of Russia and Swe 
den. This situation has produced a very natural effect. Swe 
den being unsupported by her allies, and Russia having nothing 
to gain by farther fighting, but a part of the Finland deserts, 
not worth fighting for, they have struck a bargain of peace 
immediately, without the interference of any one else. This 
leaves the Russian and Turk to pursue their game single hand 
ed. The ministers of Britain are by no means well pleased, 
that they were not consulted by the Swedes; and I think it 
probable, that if Russia makes peace with the Turks, it will be 



NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 41 

without the mediation of Prussia or England. For, as things 
are situated, it seems impossible for those powers to do the 
Empress any mischief before next spring. 

The National Assembly of France have also adopted, as a na 
tional compact, the old family compact with Spain, and they 
are arming as fast as their disjointed condition will admit. At 
the same time, the general opinion of this country seemed to be, 
that the ministry would obtain very honorable terms from Spain, 
whereas the ministers themselves were, asl believe, much em 
barrassed as to the line of conduct which they should pursue. 
To support the high tone in which they first opened, would 
probably bring on a bloody war for an empty sound. To re 
cede, would expose them to severe animadversion at home, 
and a loss of reputation abroad. These circumstances appear 
ing to me favorable, I wrote the letter of the tenth instant, of 
which a copy is enclosed. It is calculated first, to operate up 
on an administration, which I believed to be divided in regard 
to America, and a sovereign who hates the very name, while 
he prides himself upon his piety and moral fame. Secondly, 
it was intended as a ground of future justification for any meas 
ures, which congress might think proper to adopt ; and thirdly, 
it had, I own, a special view to the nature of this government 
and people ; for if they do eventually get engaged in war, and 
feel a little from our coldness, and if, in addition thereto, the 
commercial men find any ground of complaint, it will make 
them so eager to rectify their mistake, as to give us considera 
ble advantages. 

In answer to this letter I received his of the same date, a 
copy of which is likewise enclosed, This was written in his 
own hand writing, and as it is said therein to be not ministeri 
al, but confidential, we must so consider it. Consequently it 
is not a public paper. The inference to be drawn from it is, 
that the council could not agree as yet upon the answer to be 
given. Hence I concluded, that those who, pursuing the in 
terests of Great Britain, wish to be on the best terms with 
America, are outnumbered by those, whose sour prejudices and 
4* 



42 NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 

hot resentment render them averse to every intercourse, except 
that which may immediately subserve a selfish policy. These 
men do not yet know America. Perhaps America does not 
yet know herself. They believe that British credit is essential 
to our commerce. Useful, it certainly is, at present ; but let 
our public credit be well established and supported, and in a 
very few years our commercial resources will astonish the 
world. We are yet but in the seeding time of national pros 
perity, and it will be well not to mortgage the crop before it is 
gathered. Excuse, I pray Sir, this digression. The matter 
of it is not wholly inapplicable. 

I waited upon the Duke of Leeds by appointment on the 
fifteenth instant, and I saw at once by his countenance, that he 
felt obliged to act an awkward part. I waited, therefore, for 
him to begin the conversation, which he did by saying he un 
derstood I was going to America. I told him he had mistaken 
my letter, for that by the continent I meant the continent of 
Europe. After some pause he said, that he hoped soon to fix 
upon a minister to America. That they had a person in contem 
plation, who was not however absolutely agreed on. I did not 
ask who it was. After a farther pause he said, that in order to 
save time, and obviate difficulties, the intention was to send 
over a gentleman with a common letter of recommendation, but 
having letters of credence in his pocket. I expressed my per 
fect approbation of this expedient. He told me that he was 
earnestly desirous of a real bond fide connexion, not merely by 
the words of a treaty, but in reality. I met these by similar 
professions, but took care to confine them to a commercial in 
tercourse for mutual benefit on liberal terms. 

He told me, that as to the two points of the treaty, there 
were still difficulties. He wished they could be got out of the 
way. He then hesitated a little, and dropped the conversation. 
Having waited sometime for him to resume it, and being con 
vinced by his silence that it was intended to hold a conference 
and say nothing, I determined to try for information in a differ 
ent way, I began, therefore, by expressing with an air of se- 



NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 43 

rious concern my conviction, that their detention of the western 
posts would form an insurmountable barrier against a treaty with 
us. Knowing so well as he did the nature of popular govern 
ments, he would not be surprised, that some in America should 
oppose a treaty with Britain from serious doubt as to the policy 
of the measure, and others from private reasons ; and he must 
see that holding those posts would form an argument for one, 
and a pretext for the other. Finding that he felt this, I added, 
that their conduct in this respect gave serious alarm to reasona 
ble well meaning men. Some believed their design was to de 
prive us of our share in the fur trade, which they considered as 
a serious injury, but others were convinced that holding those 
posts was attended with great and useless expense to Britain, 
which the benefits of the fur trade by no means compensated, 
and even that she would derive those benefits whether that trade 
were carried on through the medium of Canada, or of the Uni 
ted States. Hence they inferred some other, and consequent 
ly some hostile views. So that every murder committed by the 
Indians was attributed to British intrigue ; and although some 
men of liberal minds might judge differently, their argu 
ments would have little weight with the many, who felt them 
selves aggrieved. He owned that there was force in these reflec 
tions. I told him further, that I did not presume to judge of 
the great circle of European politics ; but according to my lim 
ited comprehension, I was led to suppose, that they could not 
act with the same decisive energy towards their neighbors, 
while they doubted of our conduct. 

He said I was perfectly right; and he said so in a manner 
which showed, that this had been urged and felt during the late 
negotiations. I proceeded, therefore, a little farther, premising 
that this conversation was merely from one gentleman to 
another, and prayed him to consider, that in a war between 
Britain and the House of Bourbon, (a thing that must happen 
at some time or other,) we can give the West India Islands to 
whom we please, without engaging in the war ourselves, and our 
conduct must be governed by our interest. He acknowledged 



44 NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND, 

that this was naturally to be expected, and it seemed from his 
manner, that the same thing had been represented before, but 
not in such strong colors. I observed, that those preferences 
which we had a right to impose would have a most extensive 
operation ; assured him of my sincere belief, that their exclu 
sive system, as far as it related to the commerce of their islands, 
had a tendency to injure that navigation, which it was their ob 
ject to increase, because if we met them on equal ground of 
restriction, they would lose more in one way than they gained 
in another ; that they had many large ships employed in car 
rying the single article of tobacco ; and if we should pass a nav 
igation act to meet theirs, they could not bring us a yard of 
cloth which contained Spanish wool, and so of other things. I 
thought I could perceive, that considerations like these had al 
ready given them some alarm. I therefore said, that I suppo 
sed his people had transmitted information of the attempts 
made in congress to adopt such regulations. He said they had. 
I observed that not having yet received the laws passed by 
congress I should not say exactly what had been done. That 
I hoped things were yet open for treaty. That doubtless there 
were many persons in this country, who, to gratify the resent 
ment occasioned by losses or disappointments in the American 
war, would be glad to urge on a state of commercial hostilities ; 
but this would prove, perhaps, a losing game to both. He 
really thought it would. 

Having gone as far in that line as was useful, I took a short 
turn in my subject, and said I had waited with great patience 
during the negotiations they were carrying on, because I sup 
posed they would naturally square their conduct towards us by 
their position in respect to other nations. 1 made this obser 
vation in a careless manner, as a thing of course ; but immedi 
ately fixing my eye upon him, he showed that it was exactly 
the circumstance they had wished to conceal. 1 added, that 
finding the northern courts were at peace, and supposing they 
had come to their final decisions with respect to the House of 
Bourbon, I thought it probable that they were prepared to 
speak definitely to us also. Here I waited for his answer, 



NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 45 

which, indeed, I did not expect to receive. He was suffi 
ciently embarrassed, and from his look and manner I collect 
ed quite as much as he was willing to communicate. 

After some little sayings of no consequence, he asked me 
what the United States would think of the undefined claim of 
Spain to America. Having no objection to take that informa 
tion from his questions, which could not be drawn forth in his 
answers, I told him that it would make no impression on our 
minds. That the Spaniards, being in fact apprehensive of dan 
ger from us, were disposed to make sacrifices for our friend 
ship. That the navigation of the Mississippi, hitherto the bone 
of contention, was, I believed, given up by them already, or 
soon would be so ; and as for their claims, they never could 
affect us, and therefore we did not care anything about them. 
That the reason for withholding that navigation, hitherto, was 
the fear of contraband trade, and for the same reason they 
must, in my opinion, sacrifice the last man, and last shilling, 
upon the question about Nootka Sound. He said he had al 
ways thought the danger of contraband ought to be considered 
in dealing on this subject, for that nations, like individuals, 
ought to treat with candor and honesty. We had a good deal 
of conversation on that, and other topics, in which America 
was not directly concerned ; and then I told him, that if they 
came to any determination in regard to us speedily, I should 
wish to be apprized of it. He assured me that 1 should, and 
offered to make his communications to you through me, and 
for that purpcse to address his letters to me in Paris ; but for 
reasons communicated in a former letter, I thought it best to 
decline this offer, and therefore observed, that his own packets 
would give him a speedier and more certain means of con 
veyance. I then took my leave. 

I have troubled you, Sir, with the leading features of this 
conversation, that you might the better judge of the conclusions 
I draw from it. I think the cabinet is divided on the question 
of war or peace. If France appeared strong enough to excuse 
a retrograde manoeuvre, I believe they would discover all at 



46 NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 

once that Spain has better reasons to urge, than they had been 
before apprized of, and therefore, on principles of justice, and 
having received the strongest assurances of brotherly love from 
the Catholic King, the Defender of the Faith would disarm. 
His ministers will not treat with us at present, unless they can 
see their way to an offensive and defensive alliance, which we 
shall be in no hurry to contract. Should war break out, the 
anti- American party will, I believe, agree to any terms ; for 
it is more the taste of the medicine which they nauseate, than 
the quantity of the dose. Mr Pitt, T believe, wishes a con 
tinuance of peace. Observe that he is rather the Queen s 
man than the King s, and that since his Majesty s illness, she 
has been of great consequence. This depends in part on a 
medical reason. To prevent the relapse of persons who have 
been mad, they must be kept in constant awe of somebody ; 
and it is said that the physician of the king gave the matter in 
charge to his royal consort, who performs that, like every oth 
er part of her conjugal duty, with singular zeal and persever 
ance. He, and all those who are in possession of his entire 
confidence, wish, it is said, for war ; which gives, you know, 
great patronage, and, by the increase of taxes and offices, in 
creases the influence and power of the crown. The king, and 
his friends, are also violently indisposed to America. 

Things being so situated, and having business on the conti 
nent, I shall leave this city in a few days, and shall perhaps 
write a further letter of lamentations to the Duke of Leeds be 
fore I go. I intend to write such a letter to you on the whole 
business, as may, in case of need, be laid before the legislature, 
and consequently before the public. 

I long since expressed my opinion to you, Sir, that the ap 
pearances of prosperity here were fallacious. In nothing are 
they more so, than in the affairs of the India Company, which 
are deplorably bad ; and they are now engaged in a war with 
Tippoo Saib, which, terminate how it may, must make them 
worse. 

It is time to close this long epistle. Let me therefore en- 



NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 47 

treat you to receive the assurances of that sincere respect and 
esteem, with which I have the honor to be, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO THE DUKE OF LEEDS. 

London, September 24th, 1790. 

My Lord, 

An application which has been made to me by a Mr Sam 
uel Makins, master of an American ship, and which I have 
formerly transmitted to Mr Burgess, brings forward some points 
on which I find myself, most reluctantly, obliged to trouble 
your Grace. 

It appears, first, that the American ship was stopped on the 
high seas, and detained by a British vessel of war, which took 
away several of the crew, and kept one, who was a British sub 
ject. Secondly, it appears that seamen taken in this port from 
an American ship, who have sworn before a magistrate in Amer 
ica that they are American citizens, are nevertheless detained, 
unless the master of the ship will swear that they were born 
in America. And thirdly, it appears that American seamen, 
who have entered on board of a British ship of war, are detain 
ed, notwithstanding the claims made by the master to whom 
they are bound by the usual articles. 

On the first point, I am obliged to mention, my Lord, that 
interrupting vessels in their voyages, and taking away those 
who navigate them, may have disagreeable consequences ; and 
by reminding your Grace of that sentiment, which was excited 
by the conduct of a Spanish frigate in Nootka Sound, I render, 
I am sure, all comments unnecessary. 

On the second point, I must take the liberty to observe, that 
the very circumstance of being on board an American ship 
ought to raise a presumption of citizenship ; but when that is 
Strengthened by the oaths of the men taken in America, proof 
should be required to overturn, not to corroborate it. But, my 
Lord, it must be impossible to obtain the evidence required, in 



48 NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 

many cases, unless the master will hazard a deposition to facts 
not in his knowledge. Another circumstance of a most del 
icate nature is, the insisting that none but persons born in 
America shall be privileged from the impress. I humbly 
conceive, my Lord, that previous to the year 1775, those born 
in America were equally subjects of his Majesty, with those 
born in England, and many of them, I believe, still continue 
so. By the treaty of peace, the sovereign of this country re 
linquished all rights over those then in America, who chose to 
take the benefit of it ; and if the compact can be set aside in 
the case of a mariner, I fear that many others will no longer 
rely upon it. This idea, my Lord, presses much upon my 
mind. 

On the third point, I pray leave to submit to your Grace, 
whether it is consistent to claim British seamen, who have con 
tracted to serve in American vessels, and yet withhold Ameri 
can seamen, who have contracted to serve in British vessels. 
Pardon me for adding, that this would justify a practice, which 
I hope may never take place, of manning the privateers of 
your enemies with the seamen of America. 

In my regard for the peace and happiness of the two coun 
tries, your Grace will find, I trust, the proper apology for bring 
ing these things before you. I the less regret having been de 
tained in town for that purpose, as it gives me an occasion to 
reiterate the assurances of that respect, with which I have the 
honor to be, &tc. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

London, September 24th, 1790. 

Sir, 

Just about to leave this city, I have been detained for some 
hours by an object, which appears to me important. I have 
already had occasion to mention the impress of American sea- 



NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 4 

, to serve on board of British ships of war. The ministers 
seemed desirous of doing what was right, and of avoiding just 
ground of complaint) but the orders for an impress being of 
necessity entrusted to agents, neither scrupulous nor delicate, it 
becomes as barbarous in the execution, as in the principle it is 
violent and despotic. Allowances are to be made in judging 
such cases, but I had been given to understand &gt; that the prin 
ciples adopted by the administration were such as ought not 
by us to be admitted. 

I must own to you, Sir, that my position was, in this respect, 
disagreeable. I did not wish to assume the management of af 
fairs not committed to me, nor put on the appearance of a 
character, to which I had no pretension ; and yet, I could not 
be an indifferent witness to the injuries sustained by my fellow 
citizens. Liable to censure for neglect, and to the imputation 
of hunting employment, but feeling alike guiltless of the one, 
and incapable of the other, I determined neither to seek for 
causes of complaint, nor yet to avoid them, but submit my con 
duct to the dictate of occasion. Pardon me, Sir, for making 
myself my subject. To you an explanation of actions and mo 
tives is due. And as for the world, T shall never take pains to 
conceal the one, nor communicate the other. 

On the seventeenth instant, Mr Cutting called to mention the 
case of an American, who had been impressed, and, after an 
order obtained for his release, had been ill used, confined, and 
was then in fetters, expecting severe and ignominious punish 
ment. I immediately went to Whitehall, and waited some time 
for the Duke of Leeds, or Mr Burgess, to arrive. Mr Burgess 
at length came ; and upon my showing him the papers, and ex 
plaining the business, he immediately took measures to procure 
the needful redress. He expressed, at the same time, in very 
proper terms, the regret he felt for such abuses of authority, 
Next morning, Captain Makins applied to me, (as being ac 
quainted with the owners of his ship,) to assist in procuring the 
release of his mate and seamen. He told me, that previous 
to his leaving New York, a part of his crew had made oath 

VOL. II. 5 



50 NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 

that they were citizens of America. Arrived at the mouth of 
the channel, he was stopped by a British frigate, which took 
away some of them, but at length returned all except one, who 
was an Irishman. After this, he passed several vessels of war, 
without receiving either insult or molestation ; but in the river, 
so many of his men were taken out, that he was obliged to hire 
others, for the security of his ship. Some of the men so tak 
en were induced to enter into the British service, as he 
informed me, by ill usage, threats, and particularly by the as 
surance, that having nobody here to speak for them, their case 
was desperate, and therefore they might as well take the boun 
ty as let it alone, for go they must. 

Many aggravating circumstances were related ; but as these 
are generally foreign to the merits of a question, I desired him 
to write me a letter, simply stating the facts. Among these, 
were a refusal to deliver the men who had entered, a rejection 
of all evidence other than his oath, and .the insisting that this 
evidence should prove the men to have been born in America. 
I immediately transmitted that letter, with the papers accompa 
nying it, to Mr Burgess, who sent them to Mr Stephens, the 
Secretary of the Admiralty. Yesterday, Captain Makins called 
again, complaining that he could get no satisfaction from the 
admiralty board, nor from the regulating captain ; but on the 
contrary was treated by the latter with insult. 1 immediately 
wrote a note to Mr Burgess, who assigned the death of Mr 
Stephens son in a duel, as the cause why the affair had been 
neglected ; and gave me the assurance, that he would pay every 
attention to it. An event so distressing would certainly call 
from all other cares the mind of a father. I could not, there 
fore, insist on the decisive answer which I wished. But hav 
ing been repeatedly told, that the practice was such as is above 
mentioned, I wrote to the Duke of Leeds the letter, of which 
the enclosed is a copy. You will perceive, Sir, that I have 
sought rather to bring forward the particular objects for consid 
eration, than to dilate those observations to which they give 
rise. I will not trouble you with any comment on this transac- 



NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 51 

tion, but only entreat that you will excuse my interference. 
Having acted without authority, there is at least this advantage 
to the public, that my conduct may be avowed or disavowed, 
as circumstances shall render most proper. I am, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MoRRIS. 



TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Paris, November 22d, 1790. 

Dear Sir, 

My last letter was of the twenty-fourth of September. Since 
that period, I have passed through Flanders and a part of Ger 
many, and having coasted the Rhine to Strasburg, came thence 
to this city. 

As I conjectured, so it has happened, that my longer contin 
uance in London would have been useless. Spain finding from 
the revolt of the marine, and other circumstances, that whatev 
er might be the intention, or rather wish, of France, no real 
aid could be hoped for from a country, where even the sem 
blance of authority is gone, has submitted to the imperious de 
mands of Britain. This is a great point in the general system. 
From henceforth, the benefits derived by Spain from her col 
onies must wither away, and if she should hereafter wage war 
to cancel an onerous compact, it is highly probable, that one or 
more independent monarchies maybe established in that large 
portion of the new world, which she now occupies. Nothing 
of this sort can be indifferent to us. In the great course 
of events, which divine Providence may have marked out, 
human wisdom can do but little, and to effect that little, we 
must approach as nearly as possible to our comprehension 
the view of futurity, and bestow on the present that cool 
consideration, with which every one can examine the deeds 
that were done in the old time before us. The indepen 
dence of all America will place us forward as the bulwark of 
our neighbors ; and at the same time, it must loosen our hold 
upon Europe. I consider the several colonies to the south of 



52 NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 

us, as a pledge in our hands for the good conduct of those pow 
ers to which they belong. We now derive an influence from 
their reciprocal jealousies,, which we shall sooa, I trust, secure 
by our own internal force. This subject opens a field too vast 
for present discussion, but it leads to another of narrower com 
pass, which we at present tread. 

England will not, I am persuaded, enter into a treaty with 
us, unless we give for it more than it is worth now, and infinite 
ly more than it can be worth hereafter. Had they got engag 
ed in a war, and could they in such war have obtained our aid. 
they w r ould have paid high. But no price could, in my poor 
opinion, have compensated to us the ill consequences which 
must have followed. In proportion as her commerce with our 
neighbors becomes more extensive, and our naval force more 
evident, in that same proportion shall we find the advantage of 
being freed from any stipulations with her. A present bargain 
would be that of a young heir with an old usurer. Believing 
in our wants, she will impose terms which we ought not, canr- 
not consent to. This, at least,, is my serious belief, A differ 
ent idea may be entertained by others, who have better infor 
mation, more experience, or clearer judgment; and the pro* 
priety of each opinion must be decided by the arbitrament of 
time. At present we may consider the western posts, which 
belong to us, as a part of what Britain means to give for privi 
leges of trade,, which in her hands turn always to gold. This, 
which is very like buying us with our own. money, would ena 
ble the minister to go down to the House of Commons with 
perfect ease and self complacency. I am, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON, SECRETARY OF STATE. 

London, December 24th, 1790. 

Dear Sir, 

I did not receive your letter of the twelfth of August, until 
yesterday afternoon, or I should have made an earlier reply- 



NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 53 

I am very happy to find that you approve of the ground on 
which the interchange of ministers with this country was placed, 
and the judgment formed respecting the posts. I am led to 
fear, that my conduct in regard to our impressed seamen has 
not been equally fortunate ; but I hope the interference will 
be excused. Having no other guide, than my own sense of 
our interest and honor, it is not improbable that I may have 
missed my way. It was with much anxiety that I took any 
one of those steps, to which 1 found myself impelled. 

My letters to the President, subsequent to the month of May, 
will have communicated my conduct, and the opinion by which 
it was directed. I flatter myself, that on the subject of an al 
liance with this country, they will be found conformable to the 
sentiments which you express, and which will ever I hope gov 
ern the councils of our country. 

It was my good fortune also to anticipate your ideas respect 
ing the designs of Britain upon the Spanish possessions, and 
therefore, whenever they mentioned to me the claims of Spain 
as highly interesting to us, I declared, (but as my private opin 
ion only,) that we should view those claims of exclusive right 
with perfect indifference, from a conviction that it never would 
be exercised to our prejudice. .This was with the double view 
of keeping up their disquietude about connexions, which we 
might form with Spain, and of preventing them from having 
any shadow of pretext to embroil us with that court hereafter, 
should the existing dispute be amicably adjusted. 

Before I dismiss this subject, indulge me with your pardon 
for hinting an idea, on which I have formed no decisive opin 
ion, but which may perhaps merit some consideration. Spain, 
from the situation of France, the sense of her own weakness, 
and the effects of her late treaty with Britain, may, perhaps, 
wish for an effectual guarantee of her transatlantic dominions ; 
and perhaps she may deem that which we can give more im 
portant, than what Britain holds out. Perhaps she might incline 
to give something valuable for our friendship and protection. 

The convention between Britain and Spain having beeo 
5* 



54 NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 

completed, and a bill for the government of Quebec being in 
agitation, I thought it might be well to pass a few days here, 
a nd therefore, having private business sufficient to prevent the 
drawing of any direct conclusions of a public nature, I came 
hither on Sunday, the twelfth instant. I made the needful 
inquiries respecting the Quebec system, and on the fourteenth 
called at Whitehall. The Duke of Leeds being absent, I left 
a card, and on the eighteenth paid his Grace another visit. 
The council was then breaking up, and as he had much to do, 
he sent Mr Burgess to me with an apology. This gentleman 
gave me a deal of civil nothingness 5 was glad that our difficul 
ties about the impress were at an end ; had during my absence 
received frequent applications from Mr Cutting, and, in conse 
quence of what passed between us, had paid every attention to 
them. Administration had every desire 1 could wish for treaty. 
Many cabinet councils had been held upon it. A great many 
difficulties had arisen in fixing on- the persons to whom the- 
management should be committed. This matter, however, was 
adjusted. A reference had been made above three months 
since to Lord Hawkesbury. His Lordship very diligent, but 
his report not yet made. When received, no time would be 
lost in setting all the different engines at work. Hoped we 
should soon have residents with each other, &ic. &tc. &c. I 
heard him quietly out, and then replied, that I was sorry to 
have interrupted his attention to other affairs. Having been 
called by private business to London, I thought it my duty to 
let them know I was alive. If his Grace wished to see me, I 
would wait on him at such time as he might indicate ; that my 
stay here would be short ; that I should write to America before 
my departure, and if I learnt nothing more than that things re 
mained in the same state of uncertainty in which I had left them 
1 should say so. It was for them and not for me to consider 
what consequences delay might produce to the British com 
merce. 

The reputation of the United States rises fast ; and although 
our enemies make objections to the funding system^ yet that 



NEGOTIATION IN ENGLAND. 55 

step towards the establishment of public credit has produced a 
sensible effect on those opinions, which no administration will 
wholly disregard. I am, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON, 

London, December 28th, 1790. 

Dear Sir, 

This will accompany what I had the honor to write on 
the twenty-fourth. In the afternoon of that day I receiv 
ed a note from Mr Burgess, appointing an hour on the twenty- 
fifth for an interview with the Duke of Leeds. I attended, 
but something or other kept his Grace away. The twenty- 
sixth I received a note apologizing for the disappointment, and 
requesting my attendance the twenty-seventh. I waited on 
him again. A note had been sent, informing me that a severe 
indisposition kept the Duke at home ; but this I did not receive 
in season to prevent the visit. Mr Burgess therefore mention 
ed to me the contents of it. The Duke, it seems, wished, if 
I had any communications to make before I went to Paris, that 
they should come through Mr Burgess. I told him, that as he 
well knew, I had to make none, and only put myself in the 
way of receiving them. He said that the business remained 
as it was when he last spoke to me ; that he could now say, 
however, the Duke had a person in his eye to be sent to 
America. I told him carelessly, that I had heard Mr Elliott 
was appointed. He said no appointment had been made ; it 
would be improper, until they should have determined what 
such person was to do. I smiled at this, and he was a little 
confused. He said he wished to make their communications 
through me, and hoped I should be again in London next 
f.pring. I told him, that perhaps I might, but that was of no 
consequence ; they could easily find a channel of their own. 

There was nothing in this which at all surprised me. It 



56 NEGOTIATION IN EN GLAND?. 

needs no comment,- and is, indeed, exactly what I expected. 
Next spring they will know better what to look for from their 
present negotiations. This intended appointment of Mr Elli^ 
ott was during the height of the armament. He, on being 
spoken to, thought the affair was concluded, and mentioned it 
to his friends. One of them told me of it. At that time he 
was to have gone out immediately ; but the whole affair is now 
suspended. 

I am, &c.

CORRESPONDENCE, 

CONCERNING THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 



AND THE 



AFFAIRS OF FRANCE. 



Paris, February 23d, 1789. 

IF I should attempt, my dear Sir, to thank you for the kind 
introductions you have given me to your friends, I could not 
succeed in giving expression to my feelings. You, who know 
how much they are attached to you, will better conceive, than 
I can describe, the cordial reception which these letters pro* 
cured me. The more I see of Paris, the more sensible I am of 
your sacrifices in leaving it, to traverse a great ocean, and es 
tablish yourself with a people, as yet too new to relish that so 
ciety, which forms here the delight of life. For devoting thus 
to the public service both your time and enjoyments, you have 
as yet been but poorly recompensed. The rich reward re 
mains behind, in that success, which I hope and believe will 
at length crown your efforts to unite the two countries in bonds 
of interest and affection indissoluble. 

* Afterwards the Marquis de Moustier. He succeeded M. de la Luzerne 
as Minister from France to the United States. He filled diplomatic stations 
in England and Prussia, adhered to the royal cause, returned to France with 
Louis the Eighteenth, and died in February, 1317. 



60 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

Your nation is now in a most important crisis, and the great 
question, shall we hereafter have a constitution, or shall will 
continue to be law, employs every mind, and agitates every 
heart in France. Even voluptuousness itself rises from its 
couch of roses, and looks anxiously abroad at the busy scene to 
which nothing can now be indifferent. 

Your nobles, your clergy, your people, are all in motion for 
the elections. A spirit, which has been dormant for genera 
tions, starts up and stares about, ignorant of the means of ob* 
taining, but ardently desirous to possess its object, conse 
quently, active, energetic, easily led, but also easily, too easily 
misled. Such is the instinctive love of freedom, which now 
grows warm in the bosom of your country. That respect for 
his sovereign, which forms the distinctive mark of a French 
man, stimulates and fortifies on the present occasion those sen 
timents, which have hitherto been deemed most hostile to mon 
archy ; for Louis the Sixteenth has himself proclaimed from 
the throne a wish, that every barrier should be thrown down, 
which time or accident may have opposed to the general felici 
ty of his people. 

It would be presumptuous in me even to guess at the effects 
of such causes, operating on materials and in situations, of which 
I confess to you the most profound ignorance. I feel that 1 
have already gone too far, in attempting to describe what I 
think I have perceived. But before I quit the subject, I must 
express the wish, the ardent wish, that this great ferment may 
terminate, not only to the good, but to the glory of France. 
On the scenes which her great theatre now displays, the eyes 
of the Universe are fixed, even with anxiety, and the national 
honor is deeply interested in a successful issue. Indulge me 
also, I pray, in conveying the opinion, that until that issue be 
known, every arrangement both foreign and domestic must 
feel a pause. 

Horace tells us, that in crossing the sea we change our cli 
mate, not our souls. I can say,, what he could not, that I find

other ; a nation which exist in hopes, prospects, and expecta 
tions. The reverence for ancient establishments gone, existing 
forms shaken to the very foundation, and a new order of things 
about to take place, in which, perhaps, even the very names of 
all former institutions will be disregarded. 

To judge of the present turmoil, I can give you no better 
standard, than by telling you what is seriously true, that when I 
took up the pen, it was to give you news of your friends, and 
to describe the impression made on my mind by the objects, 
which incessantly present themselves in this great capital, I will 
not say of France, but of Europe. And have I done it ? Yes ; 
for the one great object in which all are engaged has swallowed 
up, like the rod of Aaron in Egypt, every other enchantment 
by which France was fascinated. I am determined, however, 
after having pestered you so much with a recital of what will be 
told you from other quarters much more intelligibly, and with a 
knowledge of all the secret springs which produce those move 
ments, I am determined, I say, that this letter shall give you 
some entertainment; and for this purpose, I shall enclose in it 
several letters from your friends, who have charged me with 
the very agreeable commission of transmitting them to you. 

I will trespass no farther on your patience ; but still I must 
impose the task on your good nature, of presenting my affection 
ate remembrances to my friends, who are about you. I will 
write to them if J have time, but the hours fly so quickly in Pa 
ris ! I will not let them escape me, without assuring you of the 
esteem and respect, with which 

I have the honor to be, &c.

62 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 



Paris, February 25th, 1789. 

Dear Sir, 

As soon as I can place objects here in due arrangement, I 
shall proceed to Holland. Before I take there my last engage 
ments, I wish most earnestly to be, through you, in such treaty 
as to leave room, for I expect that those engagements will bind 
me as to all future operations. From Holland I shall perhaps 
be obliged to go to England. But I contemplate, in all cases, 
a return to this capital, as speedily as possible ; and from hence 
I wish to go to Madrid. You will calculate, however, that as 
the most important scene acted for many years on the Euro 
pean theatre will, in the next spring, be displayed at this place. 
I, in common with all others, have a curiosity to see it. You 
must also consider, that I have motives stronger than curiosity; 
for until the States-General shall have decided on the important 
objects for which they are convened, their government can 
make no solid arrangements for anything. Of this be assured, 
that if nothing happens very unexpected, I will see you in 
Spain before I return to America. 

Lafayette is out of town. He is gone to Auvergne to get 
himself elected, either for the Noblesse or the Tiers Etats. I 
hope the former, for he would otherwise, in my opinion, be too 
desperately estranged from those of his own class. As he did 
not communicate to me his hesitation, I presume that he had 
determined, for he made some important communications just 
before his departure. Apropos a term which my Lord Ches 
terfield well observes we generally use to bring in what is not 
at all to the purpose apropos then, I have here the strang 
est employment imaginable. A republican, and just as it were 
emerged from that assembly, which has formed one of the most 
republican of all republican constitutions, I preach incessantly 
respect for the prince, attention to the rights of the nobility,

and moderation, not only in the object, but also in the pursuit 
of it. All this, you will say, is none of my business ; but I 
consider France as the natural ally of my country, and of 
course, that we are interested in her prosperity ; besides, to 
say the truth, 1 love France, and, as I believe the king to be 
an honest and good man, I sincerely wish him well, and the 
more so, as I am persuaded that he earnestly desires the feli 
city of his people. I am, &ic.

TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Paris, March 3d, 1789. 
Dear Sir, 

Herewith you have a copy of what I had the honor to write 
on the twenty-third of last month. Since that period, there 
are advices here, which announce the re-establishment of the 
King of Great Britain s health ; but from a letter I have just 
now received from the Marquis de la Luzerne, * I am disposed 
to doubt the fact. 

The other day I saw the Due de Castries, who served in 
America under the title of the Comte de Charlu. He desired 
to be remembered to you, and so did General Duplessis,j &gt; who 
has been promoted lately. Our friend, the Marquis de Lafa 
yette, is now in Auvergne attending his election. This coun 
try presents an astonishing spectacle to one, who has collected 
his ideas from books and information half a dozen years old. 
Everything is a P Anglais, and a desire to imitate the English 
prevails alike in the cut of a coat, and the form of a constitu 
tion. Like the English, too, all are engaged in parliamenteer- 
ing ; and when we consider how novel this last business must 
be, I assure you their progress is far from contemptible.

Poor General Chastellux * is no more. I have seen his 
widow, an amiable woman, who is not the less lovely for the 
tears she sheds to his memory. A fine boy remains as the

pleasure, if you took the trouble to mingle in a short letter con 
dolence for one event, and congratulations for the other. You 
would in that case oblige me by confiding the letter to my care. 
Excuse me, I pray, for dropping this hint, and do me the jus

TO JOHN JAY. 

tet 

Paris, March 4th, 1789. 

Dear Sir, 

Although I am much pressed for time, and consequently 
cannot indulge myself in the pleasure of a long conversation, I 
must pay you a visit, and say how do you do, while I deliver 
the packages, which Mr Jefferson is so kind as to entrust to 
my care. I will not have the assurance, with his dispatches in 
my hand, to say a word about politics. And more especially, 
as he has not only the advantage, by frequent access to the 
ministers, of seeing more distinctly those movements, which 
others contemplate at a distance ; but also because he is very 
much in the confidence of the patriotic party here, and conse 
quently well informed of their views and intentions. 

If, in the course of my observations, anything should turn 
up worthy of notice, I will seize an early opportunity to make 
the communication. But my present opinion is, that until 
some time after the States- General shall have assembled, this 
government will offer little or nothing for the contemplation of 
your department. If any new lesson were wanting to impress 
on our hearts a deep sense of the mutability of human affairs,

the double contrast between France and America two years 
ago, and at the present moment, will surely furnish that im 
portant lesson. 

I trust that my country, in proportion as she acquires digni 
ty by wise and honest measures, will show to others the re 
spect and attention, which, while they flatter and conciliate the 
weak on whom they are bestowed, shed lustre on the great 
ness from which they emanate. I wish but why attempt to 
express those hopes and wishes, which constantly swell my 
heart for her prosperity ? To read or write them all would 
tire both you and me ; besides, it is a useless task, for I am per 
suaded you will find them all in your own bosom. I am, &c&gt;

TO DR JOHN JONES. 

Paris, April 18th, 1789, 

My Dear Doctor, 

I am pretty well convinced that I am not fit for a traveller * 
and yet I thought otherwise when I left America. But what will 
you say to a man, who has passed through Rouen without 
looking at the great bell, and who has been above two months 
in Paris without ascending to the top of Notre Dame ; who 
has not been inside of any church whatever, except one which 
is building ; who has not been but three times at Versailles, 
and on neither of those times has seen the King or Queen, or 
had the wish to see them ; and who, if he should continue here 
twenty years, would continue in ignorance of the length of the 
Louvre, the breadth of the Pont Neuf, the depth of the Seine, 
and a thousand other lengths, breadths, and dimensions, which 
are of the last importance, as everybody knows ? 

Should you ask me what I have seen, I might reply in the 
words of Nat Hyde, of stammering memory, It is hard to say. 
A man in Paris lives in a sort of whirlwind, which turns him 
round so fast that he can see nothing. And as all men and

things are in the same vertiginous condition, you can neither 
fix yourself nor your object for regular examination. Hence 
the people of this metropolis are under the necessity of pro 
nouncing their definitive judgment from the first glance ; and 
being thus habituated to shoot flying, they have what the sports 
men call a quick sight. Ex pede Herculem. They know a 
wit by his snuff-box, a man of taste by his bow, and a states 
man by the cut of his coat. It is true, that, like other sports 
men, they sometimes miss ; but, then, like other sportsmen, 
too, they have a thousand excuses, besides the want of 
skill. The fault you know may be in the dog, or the bird, or 
the powder, or the flint, or even the gun, without mentioning 
the gunner. 

We are at present in a fine situation for what the bucks and 
bloods would term a frolic, or high fun. The ministers have 
disgusted this city by the manner of convoking them to elect 
their representatives for the States-General, and at the same time 
bread is getting dearer, so that when the people assemble on 
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday next, what with hunger and 
discontent, the least spark would set everything in a flame. 
The state physicians have, by way of antidote, brought between 
fifteen and twenty thousand regular troops within and about 
the city, so that at any rate the bons Bourgeois may not have 
all the fun to themselves. This measure will rather tend to pro 
duce than to prevent a riot. For some of the young nobility have 
brought themselves to an active faith in the natural equality of 
mankind, and spurn at everything which looks like restraint. 
There are some anecdotes of this sort, the most whimsical and 
ridiculous imaginable, but I have neither time nor inclination 
to communicate them. 

I am, &c.

THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 67 

TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Paris, April 29th, 1789. 

Dear Sir, 

I had the pleasure to write to you a short letter on the third 
of last month. Monsieur de Lafayette is since returned from 
his political campaign in Auvergne, crowned with success. 
He had to contend with prejudices, and the interests of his 
order, and with the influence of the Queen and Princes, 
(except the Duke of Orleans ;) but he was too able for his 
opponents. He played the orator with as much eclat as ever 
he acted the soldier, and is at this moment as much envied 
and hated as his heart could wish. He is also much beloved 
by the nation, for he stands forward as one of the principal 
champions for her rights. 

The elections are finished throughout this kingdom, except 
in the capital, and it appears from the instructions given to the 
representatives, (called here les Cahiers,) that certain points 
are. universally demanded, which when granted and secured 
will render France perfectly free, as to the principles of the 
constitution. I say the principles, for one generation at least 
will be required to render the practice familiar. We have, I 
think, every reason to wish that the patriots may be successful. 
The generous wish that a free people must have to dissemi 
nate freedom, the grateful emotion which rejoices in the happi 
ness of a benefactor, and a strong personal interest as well in 
the liberty as in the power of this country, all conspire to make 
us far from indifferent spectators. 

I say, that we have an interest in the liberty of France. 
The leaders here are our friends. Many of them have im 
bibed their principles in America, and all have been fired by 
our example. Their opponents are by no means rejoiced at 
the success of our revolution, and many of them are disposed 
to form connexions of the strictest kind, with Great Britain. 
The commercial treaty emanated from such dispositions ; and 
according to the usual course of those events, which are shap- 



68 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

ed by human wisdom, it will probably produce the exact 
reverse of what was intended by the projectors. The spirit of 
this nation is at present high, and M. Necker is very popular ; 
but if he continues long in the administration, it will be some 
what wonderful. His enemies are. numerous, able, and 
inveterate. His supporters are indifferent as to his fate, and 
will protect him no longer than while he can aid in establishing 
a constitution. But when once that great business is accom 
plished, he will be left to stand on his own ground. The 
court wish to get rid of him, and unless he shows himself 
very strong in the States-General, they will gratify their wishes. 
His ability as a minister will be much contested in that as 
sembly, but with what success time only can determine. 

The materials for a revolution in this country are very indif 
ferent. Everybody agrees that there is an utter prostration of 
morals; but this general position can never convey to an 
American mind the degree of depravity. It is not by any 
figure of rhetoric, or force of language, that the idea can be 
communicated. A hundred anecdotes, and a hundred thou 
sand examples, are required to show the extreme rottenness 
of every member. There are men and women who are 
greatly and eminently virtuous. I have the pleasure to num 
ber many in my own acquaintance ; but they stand forward 
from a back ground deeply and darkly shaded. It is how 
ever from such crumbling matter, that the great edifice of 
freedom is to be erected here. Perhaps, like the stratum of 
rock, which is spread under the whole surface of their coun 
try, it may harden when exposed to the air ; but it seems 
quite as likely that it will fall and crush the builders. 

I own to you that I am not without such apprehensions, for 
there is one fatal principle which pervades all ranks. It is a 
perfect indifference to the violation of engagements. Incon 
stancy is so miogled in the blood, marrow, and very essence of 
this people, that when a man of high rank and importance laughs 
to day at what he seriously asserted yesterday, it is considered 
as in the natural order of things. Consistency is a phenom- 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 69 

enon. Judge, then, what would be the value of an associa 
tion, should such a thing be proposed, and even adopted. The 
great mass of the common people have no religion but their 
priests, no law but their superiors, no morals but their interest. 
These are the creatures who, led by drunken curates, are now 
in the high road a la liberte, and the first use they make of it 
is to form insurrections everywhere for the want of bread. We 
have had a little riot here yesterday, and the day before, and I 
am told that some men have been killed ; but the affair was so 
distant from the quarter in which I reside, that I know noth 
ing of the particulars. 

I am almost at the bottom of my paper, without mentioning 
what I at first intended. Six days ago I got from the maker 
your watch, with two copper keys, and one golden one, and a 
box containing a spare spring and glasses, all which I have de 
livered to Mr Jefferson, who takes charge of them for you. 
I am, &ic. 

GOUVERNEUR MotUUS, 



TO JOHN JAY. 

Paris, July 1st, 1789. 
My Dear Sir, 

I am too much occupied to find time for the use of a cy 
pher, and in effect the government here is so much occupied 
with its own affairs, that in transmitting to you a letter under 
an envelope there is no risk. This, however, 1 am pretty 
certain will go safe. The States-General have now been a 
long time in session, and have done nothing. Hitherto they 
have been engaged in a dispute, whether they shall form one 
body or three. The commons, who are represented by a 
number equal to both the others, and who, besides, have at 
least one half the representatives of the clergy, insist on form 
ing a single house. They have succeeded ; but the nobles 
deeply feel their situation. The king, after siding with them, 



70 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

was frightened into an abandonment of them. He acts from 
error only. 

The soldiery in this city, particularly the French guards, 
declare they will not act against the people. They are now 
treated by the nobility, and parade about the streets drunk, 
huzzaing for the Tiers. Some of them have in consequence 
been confined, not by the force but by the adroitness of au 
thority. Last night this circumstance became known, and im 
mediately a mob repaired to the prison. The soldiers on 
guard unfixed their bayonets and joined the assailants. A 
party of dragoons ordered on duty to disperse the rioters, 
thought it better to drink with them, and return back to their 
quarters. The soldiers, with others confined in the same pri 
son, were then paraded in triumph to the Palais Royal, which 
is now the liberty pole of this city, and there they celebrated, 
as usual, their joy. Probably this evening some other pri 
sons will be opened ; for liberte is now the general cry, and 
authority is a name&gt; not a real existence. The court are 
about to form a camp in the neighborhood of Paris, of 25,000 
men, under the command of the Marechal de Broglio. I do 
not know him personally, therefore cannot judge what may be 
expected from his talents ; but all my information goes to the 
point, that he will never bring his army to act against the peo 
ple. The Gardes du Corps are as warm adherents in gene 
ral to the Tiers, as anybody else, strange as that may seem ; 
so that, in effect, the sword has slipped out of the Monarch s 
hands, without his perceiving a tittle of the matter. 

All these things in a nation, not yet fitted by education and 
habit for the enjoyment of freedom, give me frequently sus 
picions, that they will greatly overshoot their mark, if indeed 
they have not already done it. Already some people talk of 
limiting the king s negative upon the laws. And as they have 
hitherto felt severely the authority exercised in the name of 
their princes, every limitation of that authority seems to them 
desirable. Never having felt the evils of too weak an execu 
tive, the disorders to be apprehended from anarchy make as 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 71 

yet no impression. The provincial assemblies, or adminis 
trations, in other words the popular executive of the provinces, 
which Turgot had imagined as a means of moderating the royal 
legislative of the court, is now insisted on as a counter securi 
ty against the monarch, when they shall have established a 
democratical legislative ; for you will observe, that the noble 
and clerical orders are henceforth to be Vox et preterea ni- 
hil. The king is to be limited to the exact sum needful for 
his personal expenses. r \ he management of the public debt 
and revenues to provide for it will be taken entirely out of his 
hands, and the subsistence of the army is to depend on tempo 
rary grants. Hence it must follow, that his negative, in what 
ever form reserved, will be of little avail. 

These are the outlines of the proposed constitution, by which 
at the same time Lettres de Cachet are to be abrogated, and 
the liberty of the press established. My opinion is that the 
King, 10 get fairly out of the scrape in which he finds himself, 
would subscribe to anything. And truly, from him, little is to 
be expected in any way. The Queen hated, humbled, mor 
tified feels, and feigns, and intrigues, to save some shattered 
remnants of the royal authority ; but to know that she favors a 
measure is the certain means to frustrate its success. 

The Count d Artois 3 alike hated, is equally busy, but has 
neither sense to counsel himself, nor to choose counsellors for 
himself, much less to counsel others. The nobles look up to him 
for support, and lean on what they know to be a broken reed, 
for want of some more solid dependence. In their anguish 
they curse Necker, who is in fact less the cause than the in 
strument of their sufferings. His popularity depends now 
more on the opposition he meets with from one party, than any 
serious regard of the other. It is the attempt to throw him 
down, which saves him from falling. He has no longer the 
preponderating weight in counsel, which a fortnight ago deci 
ded everything. If they were not afraid of consequences, he 
would be dismissed ; and on the same principle the King has 
refused to accept his resignation. If his abilities were equal to 



72 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

his genius, and he were as much supported by firmness as he 
is swayed by ambition, he would have had the exalted honor 
of giving a free constitution to above twenty millions of his fel 
low creatures ; and would have reigned long in their hearts, 
and received the unanimous applause of posterity. But as it 
is, he must soon fall ; whether his exit will be physical or mor 
al, must depend on events which I cannot foresee. The best 
chance, which royalty has, is, that popular excesses may alarm, 
At the rate at which things are now going, the King of France 
must soon be one of the most limited monarchs in Europe. I 
am, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL. 

Paris, July 4th, 1789, 

Dear Sir, 

I am to reply to three of your letters. Probably I shall 
make my answer as long as all three of them, and thus in 
quantity at least be even with you. For the rest, we must 
take our chance, because when I take up my pen, I know no 
more what I am going to write, than you will in breaking the 
seal what your are going to read. 

Before all things I am reminded as I go along, that this 
day, the birthday of our republic, demands our filial acknow 
ledgments. A day now at length auspicious, since by the 
establishment of our new constitution we have the fair pros 
pect of enjoying those good things, for which we have had so 
hard a contest. Indulge, I pray you, the effusion of my heart, 
which gratulates itself on this occasion. Feel, with me, the 
transports which 1 cannot but feel, when every letter from 
America brings confirmation of the public happiness, and 
announces some additional cement to our national union, or 
some useful exhibition of national authority. The opposi 
tion sickens with mortal symptoms, and I hope and trust, that 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 73 

our countrymen will have the wisdom to wait, before they 
attempt amendments, for those lights of experience, which are 
the only guides that can pretend to infallibility. 

You will find herein a letter from our friend Robert Morris 
to you, which he left open by way of saving himself the trou 
ble of writing to me the public occurrences. In that letter he 
announces a fact, which we have received from other quarters 
with some details, that the House of Representatives have 
resolved to submit the principal direction of the finances to a 
single man. Through this measure I can feel the pulse of 
our government. It is vigorous beyond my hopes, far beyond 
my expectations, and comes up to my wishes. It is the vigor 
of administration, which can alone consolidate recent establjsh- 
ments. The mass of a nation will always judge rightly of 
their rulers, by the effects of their measures, although they can 
never, penetrate into the nature of the measures themselves. 
From the fruit we know the tree, without pretending to inves 
tigate the botanical mysteries of vegetation. The extent of 
our country, and the deliberative freedom of its legislative au 
thority, require an active and vigorous executive. Every 
subordinate power should be tied to the chief, by those inter 
mediate links of will and pleasure, which, like the elasticity of 
the arterial system, render sensible the pulsations of the heart 
at the remotest extremities. For how can the executive be 
accountable, when its members are not subordinate and obe 
dient to the general volition ? But where am I going ? I 
shall, ere I am aware of it, convert a letter of friendship into 
a political essay. But so it is, that if once the ideas get into 
that beaten track, where they have been used to travel, they 
go on, like old cart-horses, with the most determined obstinacy 

imaginable. 

July 10th. 

You ask me if Mr Jefferson is gone to America. He is 
not, but is ready to depart at a moment s warning, having 
staid here some time expecting to receive his conge by every 
opportunity, but is still in the same expectation. I conclude, 

VOL. II. 7 



74 THE TRENCH REVOLUTION. 

that ft will not be expedited, until the arrangement of the 
ministerial departments shall have been completed. It occurs 
to me, while I write, that probably the secretary of foreign 
affairs will decline acting, until appointed under the new 
government, for which I can perceive many reasons. It 
might, for instance, be construed into presumption. It is 
probable, also, that the question of the conge will not be 
agitated, till another question is determined, viz. who shall act 
here in the interim ; and although I doubt not but the secreta 
ry, Mr Short, will be empowered, yet until he is, the other 
matter will be delayed. 

You seem surprised, that our minister here does not mention 
me. in his letters ; but cui bono ? He knows that we corres 
pond together. You suppose that he has introduced me to the 
Corps Diplomatique. In this you are mistaken. I hinted that 
matter to him shortly after my arrival. He told me they were 
not worth my acquaintance. I did not press the matter, and I 
am persuaded he assigned his real reason. I have since thought 
that it might have been as well otherwise. But on this chap 
ter of acquaintance I have experienced, I believe, the usual 
fate. I have a set which I have made myself, and these are 
not, you will easily conceive, among the worst company of 
Paris, As to the ministerial dinners, I have not been at them. 
It has never been proposed to me. The ministers, you know ? 
give no invitations themselves, and we are bashful. By the 
bye, I some time since went and asked a dinner of the Count 
de Montmorin, who very kindly assured me at parting, that I 
must in his house consider myself at home ; and this, you know, 
from him is not an unmeaning compliment. I find that you are 
a favorite of the whole family. I am tant de bete that I have not 
since profited by these kind assurances. But what can one do ? 
Versailles is the most triste sejour on earth. And though I am 
tempted by the strong passion of curiosity to go thither, and 
attend the debates of the Etats-Generaux, I have not yet pre 
vailed on myself to do it. I believe no man ever made less use 
of strong recommendations to ministerial people. Probably I 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 75 

arn wrong, but I cannot help it. I go soon to England, and on 
my return I will endeavor to profit more of circumstances. 

I have attentively noticed what you say respecting the per 
sons, who have been arrested with you for their libels. Had 
any conversation arisen on the subject in my presence, 1 should 
have given the due explanation ; but people here are too much 
occupied with their own affairs to think of anything else. I 
am happy to find, that the attempts to overturn the existing ad 
ministration chez vous have proved abortive ; because there 
are many chances against your meeting with such good friends 
in a new set, as you have in the old. There are great intrigues 
against the administration here, but hitherto without effect. Be 
fore I enter, however, into the detail of occurrences here, I will, 
in reply to one of your questions, inform you, that I have steadi 
ly combatted the violence and excess of those persons, who, 
either inspired with an enthusiastic love of freedom, or prompt 
ed by sinister designs, are disposed to drive everything to ex 
tremity. Our American example has done them good ; but 
like all novelties, liberty runs away with their discretion, if they 
have any. They want an American Constitution, with the ex 
ception of a King instead of a President, without reflecting, 
that they have not American citizens to support that constitution. 
Mankind see distant things in a false point of light, and judge 
more or less favorably than they ought ; this is an old observa 
tion ; another, perhaps as old, but which all are not in the po 
sition to feel, is^ that we try everything by the standard of pre 
conceived notions ; so that there is an impossibility almost of 
knowing by description a distant people or country. Whoev 
er, therefore, desires to apply, in the practical science of gov 
ernment, those rules and forms which prevail and succeed in a 
foreign country, must fall into the same pedantry with our young 
scholars, just fresh from the university, who would fain bring 
everything to the Roman standard. 

Different constitutions of government are necessary to the 
different societies on the face of this planet. Their difference 
of position is, in itself, a powerful cause, as also their manners* 



76 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

their habits. The scientific tailor, who should cut after Grecian 
or Chinese models, would not have many customers, either in 
London or Paris ; and those who look to America for their 
political forms are not unlike those tailors in the island of 
Laputa, who, as Gulliver tells us, always take measure with a 
quadrant. He tells us, indeed, what we should naturally 
expect from such a process, that the people are seldom 
fitted. 

And now for occurrences here, after a digression which is 
not of the shortest. The King, who long ago declared for the 
people, has since been wavering. He is an honest man, and 
wishes really to do good; but he has neither genius nor edu 
cation to show the way toward that good which he desires. In 
the contest between the representatives of the people, and of 
the nobles, he has, by those about him, been induced to give 
support to the latter ; but he came forward too late, and not in 
the proper manner. The result is, that he has retreated, and 
the nobles have been obliged to give way. In fact, this coun 
try has undergone a great change unobservedly. The Noblesse, 
who at this day possess neither the force, the wealth, nor the 
talents of the nation, have rather opposed pride than argument 
to their assailants. Hugging the dear privileges of centuries 
long elapsed, they have clamored about the court, while their 
adversaries have possessed themselves fully of the public confi 
dence everywhere. Knowing and feeling the force of that 
situation, they have advanced with a boldness, which to those 
unacquainted with all the facts, has looked like temerity. But 
this hardihood has been imposing. 

Those who are at the head of the opposition to them are not 
possessed of talents or of virtue. The chief has not even 
courage, without which, you know, that in revolutions, there is 
nothing. The French troops, as far as it can be ascertained, 
would not serve against their countrymen; and the foreign 
troops are not sufficiently numerous to make any serious im 
pression. The people of this city are going, (by that invisi 
ble instinct which produces in every animal the conduct pecu- 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 77 

liar to his situation,) in the same road, which marked the au 
rora of American opposition Three months ago the sight of 
a soldier excited awe. Now they speak of attacking whole 
regiments, and in effect there are not unfrequently some scuf 
fles with the foreign troops. This opinion, which is everything^ 
becomes daily fortified. 

While I write, I consider the sovereignty of this country as 
heing effectually lodged in the hands of theJlssemblee Nation- 
ale, for you will observe, that this name is assumed instead of 
Etats-Generaux, which is tantamount to an American legisla 
ture resolving itself into a convention. They mean immedi 
ately to form a constitution, and I have no doubt that they 
will obtain the King s consent. The partisans of the ancient 
establishments have contrived to have a very large body of 
troops assembled in this neighborhood, but if I conjecture 
rightly those troops will soon be dispersed. The National 
Assembly have already marked their disapprobation ; but the 
matter will not stop here, and sooner or later the King must 
send them away. Indeed, I am induced to believe that this 
measure will cause the kingdom to be cleared of foreign troops, 
for not being able to rely on the French regiments, they have 
selected principally the foreigners. The probable object of 
those who are at the bottom of the business, is, to surprise some 
order from his Majesty s fears, which are now continually exci 
ted, so that he is constantly the sport of apprehensions. 

But they have a more difficult and dangerous business, than 
they are at all aware of. The Assembly have determined) 
that all taxes shall cease when they separate, except such as 
they may continue or impose. This provides for as long a 
term of existence as they may choose to take, and if dispers 
ed, France will certainly refuse to pay. An army will never 
break a general combination to that effect, so that, either soon 
er or later, they must submit, and every -show of authority 
now will weaken it without producing any other effect. 

Such, then, is the state of this country, in which I think 
the crisis is past without having been perceived ; and now a 
7* 



78 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

free constitution will be the certain result. If they have the 
good sense to give the nobles, as such, some share in the na 
tional authority, that constitution will probably endure; bat 
otherwise, it will degenerate into a pure monarchy, or become 
a vast republic, a democracy. Can that last? I think not. 
I am sure not; unless the whole people are changed. In any 
event, however, of the business, it bids fair to change the po 
litical face of Europe. But whither am I going ? I am, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MoRRlS. 



TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Dieppe, July 31st, 1789. 
Dear Sir, 

I had the honor to write to you on the twenty-ninth of April 
last. I shall not trouble you with a recital of events, which Mr 
Jefferson has, I know, communicated to the office of foreign 
affairs. But being now here on my way to London, and find 
ing a vessel bound directly to New York, I take the opportunity 
to send some tables, which contain the political, military, pe 
cuniary, and commercial state of this country. I believe them 
to be tolerably authentic as far as they go. 

I will also communicate a matter, which Mr Jefferson was 
not yet informed of, and which I could not tell him, because 
I was forbidden to mention it to any person here. You know, 
I dare say, that the Count de Moustiers has his conge. His 
successor will be Colonel Ternant. At first, in the character 
of Charge des Affaires, and when M. de Moustiers is otherwise 
placed, it is highly probable that Ternant may be made Minis 
ter ; but that will depend on the situation of the court at the 
time, so that there I only state probability. As to the other, 
you may rely on it, because my intelligence I know to be good. 
The important trait in this appointment is, that he is named as 
a person who will be agreeable to us. 

You may rely, also, on what I am about to mention, but 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 79 

which I pray you not to disclose. It is known to very few in 
this country, and may, perhaps, as it ought, be buried in ob 
livion. The King has actually formed the design of going off 
to Spain. Whether the measures set on foot to dissuade him 
will have, as I hope, the desired effect, time only can discov 
er. His fears govern him absolutely, and they have of late 
been most strongly excited. He is a well meaning man, but ex 
tremely weak, and probably these circumstances will in every 
event secure him from personal injury. An able man would 
not have fallen into his situation, but I think that no ability 
can now extricate him. He must float along the current of 
events, being absolutely and entirely a cypher. If, however, 
he should fly, it would not be easy to predict the consequences, 
for this country is at present as near to anarchy as society can 
approach without dissolution. There are some able men in 
the National Assembly, yet the best heads among them would 
not be injured by experience, and unfortunately there are great 
numbers who, with much imagination, have little knowledge, 
judgment, or reflection. You may consider the revolution as 
complete, that is to say, the authority of the King and of the 
nobility is completely subdued ; yet I tremble for the con 
stitution. They have all that romantic spirit, and all those 
romantic ideas of government, which happily for America we 
were cured of before it was too late. They are advancing 
rapidly. But I must check myself, or my reflections will oc 
cupy too much space both for you and for me. 

One of the last persons I saw in Paris was M. de Lafayette. 
He had promised to trust me with a letter for you, but he must 
be excused, for he is as busy as a man can be. Not long 
since, speaking to him on his own subject, I told him some 
hints I had given, tending to make him governor of the Isle of 
France, which you know includes Paris. He declared that 
the command of the military in that city only was the utmost of 
his wishes. That he was satiated with power. He had his sove 
reign, during the late procession to Paris, completely within his 
authority. He had marched him where he pleased, measured 



80 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

out the degree of applause he should receive as he pleased, 
and if he pleased could have detained him prisoner. All this is 
strictly true. He commanded on that day at least eighty thou 
sand men, who, during the King s progress through them to the 
Hotel de Ville, shouted Vive la Nation, and only on his return 
cried Vive la Roi. 

I do not know whether you will be informed of the critical 
situation in which things were placed, just before the last min 
istry were turned out and the old one restored. My authority 
is very good, but yet I will not vouch for the truth. It was re 
solved to reduce Paris by famine, to take two hundred of the 
States-General prisoners, to dissolve that assembly, and to gov 
ern in the old-fashioned way. All this you will say was mad 
ness, and therefore improbable. But was it not equally mad 
to drive away Necker, and change the ministry at the time and 
in the manner, which were chosen for that purpose ? The men, 
weak enough for the one, were certainly mad enough for the 
other. Two German regiments, which were to be employed, 
were regaled by the Queen in the Orangerie at Versailles. 
They received promises and largesses, and were prevailed on to 
shout Vive la Reine, Vive le Comte d Jlrtois, Vive la Duchesse 
de Polignac. Afterwards their music played for hours under 
her Majesty s window. The Mareschal de Broglio endeavored, 
at the same time, to conciliate the artillery. But it was at 
length discovered, that, though the troops would shout and sing, 
yet they would not fight against their countrymen. All which 
might have been known long ago. At the moment when their 
intrigue was carrying on by the court, the Gardes du Corps 
and Gardes Fran^aises combined to defend the members of the 
National Assembly. I pass over those facts, which you cannot 
but know, to mention in one word, that the whole army of 
France have declared for liberty ; and that one reason why his 
Majesty has not taken the steps above mentioned, is, that he 
does not know a single regiment that would obey him. 

Adieu, my dear Sir. I write this letter in much hurry, and

inelegant, and pardon it, on the score of that sincere and af-

GEORGE WASHINGTON TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

New York, Oct. 13th, 1789. 
Dear Sir, 

In my first moments of leisure I acknowledge the receipt of 
your several favors. 

To thank you for the interesting communications contained 
in those letters, and for the pains you have taken to procure 
me a watch, is all, or nearly all, I shall attempt in this letter ; 
for I could only repeat things, were I to set about it, which I 
have reason to believe have been regularly communicated to 
you in detail, at the periods which gave birth to them. It may 
not, however, be unpleasing to you to hear in one word, that 
the national government is organized, and as far as my infor 
mation goes, to the satisfaction of all parties ; that opposition 
to it is either no more, or hides its head ; that it is hoped 
and expected it will take strong root ; and that the non-acced 
ing States will very soon become members of the union. No 
doubt is entertained of North Carolina ; nor would there be any 
of Rhode Island, had not the majority of those people bid adieu, 
long since, to every principle of honor, common sense, and 
honesty. A material change however has taken place, it is said, 
at the late election of representatives, and confident assurances 
are given, from that circumstance, of better dispositions in their 
legislature at its next session, now about to be held. 

The revolution which has been effected in France is of so 
wonderful a nature, that the mind can hardly realize the fact. 
If it ends as our last accounts to the first of August predict, 
that nation will be the most powerful and happy in Europe ; 
but I fear, though it has gone triumphantly through the first 



82 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

paroxysm, it is not the last it has to encounter before matters 
are finally settled. In a word, the revolution is of too great a 
magnitude to be effected in so short a space, and with the loss 
of so little blood. The mortification of the King, the in 
trigues of the Queen, and the discontent of the princes and no 
blesse, will foment divisions, if possible, in the National Assem 
bly, and they will unquestionably avail themselves of every 
faux pas in the formation of the constitution, if they do not give 
a more open, active opposition. In addition to these, the licen 
tiousness of the people on one hand, and sanguinary punishments 
on the other, will alarm the best disposed friends to the measure, 
and contribute not a little to the overthrow of their object. Great 
temperance, firmness, and foresight are necessary in the move 
ments of that body. To forbear running from one extreme to 
another is no easy matter, and should this be the case, rocks 
and shelves, not visible at present, may wreck the vessel, and 
give a higher toned despotism than the one which existed be 
fore. I am, dear Sir, &LC. 

GEORGE WASHINGTON. 



TO JOHN PAUL, JONES, AT WARSAW. 

Paris, November 8th, 1789, 

My Dear Sir, 

I received a few days past your kind letter from Warsaw, 
without date. The enclosures shall be applied as you desire, 
both in this city and in London, to which latter place I expect 
soon to repair. I have delivered your message to the Countess 
de Segur, and desired Mr Short to send the bust, which he has 
promised, and presents his compliments to you. 

Mr Jefferson is, you know, departed, with intention to return 
next spring. All the accounts received from our country are 
flattering. Freedom, order, and justice are established. Abun 
dance reigns, and there is every just hope of future prosperity. 
As yet, the government have not turned their attention to na- 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 83 

val affairs, which, though perhaps more necessary, are less ur 
gent than many others. I do not think that establishments of 
that kind will take place for two or three years to come. Con 
sequently, any views which you may have directed towards 
that object can be for some time suspended. 

You ask me, my dear friend, to give you my advice. This 
is a task both difficult and delicate. A journey to this city can, 
I think, produce nothing but the expense attending it ; for nei 
ther pleasure nor advantage can be expected here, by one of 
your profession in particular ; and, except that it is a more dan 
gerous residence than many others, I know of nothing which 
may serve to you as an inducement. 

Whether the Turk will be able to make battle for another 
campaign seems to be considered as uncertain. But from the 
troubles in Brabant, and from the necessity of supporting Swe 
den through the contest she has been led to engage in, I con 
clude that peace will not take place this winter ; and if not, the 
Baltic will witness some warm work next year. The cabinet 
of St Petersburg must know what can be depended on before 
the first day of January next, and as it is possible that Sweden 
will get help, (perhaps from Holland,) everything must depend 
on striking early. Hence t conclude, that the ball will be op 
ened in April next, and if you can devise any good plan, it will be 
well to communicate it to the Empress early. I am not suffi 
ciently master of facts to give hints, but I should suppose that 
a manoeuvre towards the mouth of the Baltic, so as to cover 
any assistance that Denmark may feel inclined to give, and pre 
vent the junction of any aid sent from the southward, might be 
no unwise procedure. 

I am, &tc. 

GOUVERNEUR MoRRIS. 



84 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 



TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Paris, January 22d, 1790. 

Dear Sir, 

Yesterday I went to dine with the Count de Montmorin, * 
and expressed to him my wish that France might seize the 
present moment to establish a liberal system of commercial 
policy for her colonies. I observed, that her interest was 
deeply at stake, because America could always dispose of the 
Islands, and would naturally wish to see them in possession 
of that power, under whose government they would be most 
advantageous to her. That nothing could tend so much to 
make the United States desirous of an alliance with Britain, 
as to exclude them from a free trade with the French colonies. 
That, if the metropolis wishes to preserve the affection of her 
distant subjects, and to derive from them the greatest com 
mercial benefit, she ought to suffer them to draw their subsist 
ence from that quarter, where they can obtain it most cheap 
ly. He assured me, that he was fully of my opinion ; said 
that our position rendered it proper to make in our favor an 
exception from their general system respecting other nations, 
and that he hoped, within a fortnight, something might be done. 
But he lamented, as he had done before, that they have no 
chief minister, and consequently no fixed plan nor principles. 
I shall see him again before I depart, and also Monsieur de la 
Luzerne, within whose department this matter regularly lies. 
He is an adherent to the exclusive system, which is unfortu 
nate. 

In the National Assembly, also, there is a considerable diffi 
culty. Among the most violent of the violent party, are some 
representatives of cities on the western coasts of this kingdom, 
where the chief commerce is with the Islands; and those 



* Count Montmorin was at this time Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
During the American Revolution, he was the French Ambassador in 
Madrid, and well disposed towards the interests of the United States. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 85 

who wish for the closest union with America, do not wish to 
offend these gentlemen; and therefore are desirous of waving 
the matter at present. For my own, I am very desirous that 
the business should be put in train, at least. If successful, so 
much the better * 7 but at any rate, it will give an alarm on the 
other side of the channel. If either of these rival nations sets 
the example, the other will soon follow ; and although it is not 
very clear, that the actings and doings of the Assembles 
Nationale in general will long endure, yet whatever they 
grant to us in this particular business, those who come after 
them will be fearful of retracting. Under these impressions, 
for a long time past, I have been endeavoring to smooth the 
way towards our object, and I believe in the success. 
I am, &tc. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Paris, January 22d, 1790. 
Dear Sir, 

In another letter of this date, I have mentioned a part of 
yesterday s conversation with the Count de Montmorin. That 
part of it, which I am now to communicate, is for yourself alone. 
As Monsieur de Lafayette had asked me some days ago, who 
should be 1 seat to replace the Comte de JMoustiers, and upon 
my answering with great indifference, that it might be whom he 
pleased, had asked my opinion of Colonel Ternant, I told the 
Count de Montmorin this circumstance ; to which he replied, that 
he had communicated his intention to Monsieur de Lafayette 
some time since, in consequence of the intimacy which has long 
subsisted between them. I asked him if he would permit me 
to mention it to you. The idea gave him pleasure, and he 
told me that he should consider it as a very great kindness, and 
particularly if through the same channel he could learn 
whether that appointment would be agreeable to you. This 

VOL. II. 8 



86 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

is you know a compliment, which the most respectable courts 
on this side of the Atlantic usually pay to each other. It is 
not without use, and on the present occasion is not a mere 
compliment, because Monsieur de Montmorin is sincerely de 
sirous of cultivating a good understanding with the United 
States. 

It is not impossible that he may retreat from his present 
office ; but he will I think in that case be appointed Gov 
ernor to the children of France, and his opinions, while about 
the court, will have weight, for many reasons ; amongst others, 
because they deserve it. In talking over the deplorable situa 
tion to which this kingdom is reduced, I told him that I saw 
no means of establishing peace at home, but by making war 
abroad. He replied that he thought with me in part, viz. that 
an offensive war might be useful, but that he thought a de 
fensive war must prove ruinous. That this last seemed the 
more likely to happen, and that in either case the state of the 
finances was alarming. [ observed, that ability in that depart 
ment might restore it, even during a war ; that nothing could 
revive credit without the re-establishment of executive authori 
ty, and that nothing could effect that re-establishment but a 
general sense of the necessity. Upon this, he lamented the 
want of a chief minister, who might embrace the great whole 
of public business. He owns himself unequal to the task, and 
too indolent into the bargain. 

Our friend Lafayette burns with desire to be at the head of 
an army in Flanders, and drive the Stadtholder into a ditch. 
He acts now a splendid, but dangerous part. Unluckily } he 
has given in to measures, as to the constitution, which he does 
not heartily approve, and he heartily approves many things 
which experience will demonstrate to be injurious. While all 
is in confusion here, the revolt of Austrian Flanders, and the 
troubles excited in Poland by the agency of Prussia, give 
every reason to suppose that the King of Sweden will be vig 
orously supported ; so that provided the Turk has but a suffi 
cient share of obstinacy to bear a little more beating, the scale, 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 87 

according to human probabilities, must turn against Austria 
and Prussia, who are the allies of France. Great Britain is, 
as yet, no otherwise engaged than as an eventual party; and, 
according to the best opinion which my judgment can form, 
upon the information I have been able to obtain, the Premier 
of that country can, to use the words of Mr Addison, * rise in 
the whirlwind and direct the storm. A person, however, on 
whose knowledge I have some reliance, assures me that Mr 
Pitt, engrossed by borough politics and ignorant of continent 
al affairs, takes no part in them, but what he is absolutely 
forced into, and I am inclined to believe that there is some 
truth in that assertion. Accept I pray the assurances of that 
sincere esteem with which I am yours, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Paris, January 24th, 1790. 

Dear Sir, 

It gave me very sincere pleasure to learn from you the 
good tidings, which you communicate respecting our new form 
of government. I know that you are not liable to the dupery 
of false hopes and groundless expectations ; and therefore I 
am confirmed in the opinion I have invariably entertained, that 
the new constitution is such a plain, calm, sensible appeal to 
the interest, feelings, and common sense of our countrymen, 
that it must, by its own intrinsic weight, bear down all opposi 
tion. I have from time to time received very great pleasure, 
at the developement of its principles by the legislature, which 
in my opinion does them the greatest honor. They have 
far, very far outgone my expectations, and even come up, not 
only to my hopes, but to my very wishes. 

I have not unfrequently brought myself to share in the plea 
sure you must feel, in the consciousness of your own useful 
agency. Certainly it is the sublimest sentiment of the human 



88 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

heart, to know that we make others happy ; and more espe 
cially those whom we love. You have too much good sense 
not to know, that no person but yourself could have obtained 
that full confidence needful to the due establishment of the ex 
ecutive authority, which certainly is the key-stone in the great 
arch of empire. I doubt, also, whether any other could so 
universally have called forth into action the talents and virtues 
of America. Let me add, what I have mentioned to you on 
other occasions, and which I would not have mentioned, 
did I not know it to be true, your knowledge of human 
character is a gift inestimable to our country on the present 
occasion. I hope in God, my dear Sir, that you may long 
continue to preside, and that not only you, but all who suc 
ceed you, may be assisted by counsellors as able and as hon 
est, as those who now fill the different seats in Congress. 
The prospect of public felicity, which must be the result, 
swells my bosom with delight. Oh my country, how happy r 
didst thou but know thine own blessedness. 

Your sentiments on the revolution effecting here, T believe 
to be perfectly just, because they perfectly accord with my 
own, and that is, you know, the only standard which Heaven 
has given us by which to judge. The king is in effect a pris 
oner at Paris, and obeys entirely the National Assembly. This 
assembly may be divided into three parts; one, called the 
Aristocrats, consists of the high clergy, the members of the 
law, (note, these are not the lawyers,) and such of the nobili 
ty as think they ought to form a separate order. Another, 
which has no name, but which consists of all sorts of people, 
really friends to a good free government. The third is com 
posed of what is called here the Enrages, that is, the mad 
men. These are the most numerous, and are of that class 
which in America is known by the name of pettifogging law 
yers; together with a host of curates, and many of those per 
sons who, in all revolutions, throng to the standard of change, 
because they are not well. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 89 

This last party is in close alliance with the populace here, 
and derives from that circumstance very great authority. 
They have already unhinged everything, and according to cus 
tom on such occasions the torrent rushes on irresistible, until 
it shall have wasted itself. The Aristocrats are without a lead 
er, and without any plan or councils as yet, but ready to throw 
themselves into the arms of any one who shall offer. The 
middle party, who mean well, have unfortunately acquired 
their ideas of government from books, and are admirable fel 
lows upon paper ; but as it happens, somewhat unfortunately, 
that the men who live in the world are very different from those 
who dwell in the heads of philosophers, it is not to be wonder 
ed at, if the systems taken out of books are fit for nothing but 
to be put into books again. 

Marmontel is the only man I have met with, among their 
Literati, who seems truly to understand the subject. For the 
rest, they discuss nothing in their Assembly. One large half 
of the time is spent in hallooing and bawling. The manner 
of speaking to a question is as follows. Such as intend to 
hold forth write their names on a tablet kept for that purpose, 
and are heard in the order that their names are written down, 
if the others will hear them, which very often they refuse to 
do, but keep up a continual uproar till the orator leaves the 
pulpit. Each man permitted to speak delivers the result of 
his lucubrations, so that the opposing parties fire off their car 
tridges, and it is a million to one if their missile arguments 
happen to meet. As to the arguments themselves, you will 
observe that it is a usual compliment of the Assembly to order 
them printed ; therefore, there is as much attention paid, at 
least, to make them sound well and look well, as to convey 
instruction or produce conviction, 

But there is another ceremony which the arguments go 
through, and which does not fail to affect the form, at least, 
and perhaps the substance. They are read beforehand in a 
small society of young men and women, and generally the fair 
friend of the speaker is one, or else the fair whom he means to 



90 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

make his friend, and the society very politely give their appro 
bation, unless the lady who gives the tone to that circle chan 
ces to reprehend something, which is of course altered if not 
amended. Do not suppose that I am playing the traveller. I 
have assisted at some of these readings, and will now give you 
an anecdote from one of them. It was at Madame de Stael s, 
the daughter of M. Necker. She is a woman of wonderful 
wit, and above vulgar prejudices of every kind. Her house is 
a kind of temple of Apollo, where the men of wit and fashion 
are collected twice a week at supper, and once at dinner, and 
sometimes more frequently. The Count de Clermont-Ton- 
nerre, one of their greatest orators, read to us a very pathetic 
oration, and the object was to show that no penalties are the 
legal compensations for injuries and crimes ; the man who is 
hanged, having by that event paid his debt to the society, ought 
not to be held in dishonor ; and in like manner, he who has 
been condemned for seven years to be flogged in the gallies 
should, when he had served out his apprenticeship, be receiv 
ed again into good company as if nothing had happened. You 
smile ; but observe the extreme to which the matter was car 
ried the other way. Dishonoring thousands for the guilt of 
one has so shocked* the public sentiment, as to render this ex 
treme fashionable. The oration was very fine, very sentimen 
tal, very pathetic, and the style harmonious. Shouts of ap 
plause and full approbation. 

When this was pretty well over, I told him that his speech 
was extremely eloquent, but that his principles were not very 
solid. Universal surprise ! A very few remarks changed the 
face of things. The position was universally condemned, and 
he left the room. I need not add, that as yet it has never been 
delivered in the assembly. And yet it was of the kind, which 
produces a decree by acclamation ; for sometimes an orator 
gets up in the midst of another deliberation, makes a fine dis 
course, and closes with a good snug resolution which is carried 
with a huzza. Thus, in considering a plan for a national bank 
proposed by M. Necker, one of them took it into his head to 



FRENCH REVOLUTION. 91 

move, that every member should give his silver buckles, which 
was agreed to at once, and the honorable mover laid his upon 
the table, after which the business went on again. 

It is very difficult to guess whereabouts the flock will settle, 
when it flies so wild ; but as far as it is possible to guess, at 
present, this (late) kingdom will be cast into a congeries of 
little democracies, laid out, not according to the rivers, moun 
tains, &c. but with the square and compass, according to lati 
tude and longitude ; and as the provinces had anciently differ 
ent laws called coutumes, and as the clippings and parings of 
several different provinces must fall together within some of 
the new divisions, I think such fermenting matter must give 
them a kind of political cholic. Their ,/lssembUe Nationale 
will be something like the Old Congress, and the King will be 
catted executive magistrate. As yet they have been busily en 
gaged in pillaging the present occupant of his authority ; how 
much they will leave him, will depend upon the chapter of ac 
cidents. I believe it will be very little ; but little or much, the 
perspective of such a King, and such an Assembly, brings to 
my mind a saying which Shakspeare has put into the mouth of 
an old soldier, upon hearing that Lepidus, one of the famous 
Triumvirate, was dead. c So, the poor third is up. World, 
thou hast but a pair of chops, and throw between them all the 
food thou may st, they needs must grind each other. 

At present the people are fully determined to support the 
Assembly ; and although there are some discontents, I do not 
believe that anything very serious, as yet, exists in the style of 
opposition. Indeed, it would be wonderful if there should ; 
for hitherto an extension of privileges, and a remission of taxes 
to the lower class, have marked every stage of their progress. 
Besides, the love of novelty is a great sweetener in revolutions. 
But the time will come when this novelty will be over and all 
its charms gone. In lieu of the taxes remitted, other taxes 
must be laid, for the public burthen must be borne. The 
elected administrators must, then, either indulge their electors, 
which will be ruinous to the Fisc, or in urging the collection of 



92 THE 1KENCH REVOLUTIONi 

taxes, displace their constituents. In all probability, there will 
be a little of both. Hence must arise bickerings and heart 
burnings among the different districts, and a great languor 
throughout the kingdom. As the revenue must fall short of cal 
culation in point of time, if not in amount, (and that is the 
same thing where revenue is concerned,) it will follow, that 
either the interest of the public debt will not be regularly paid, 
or that the various departments will be starved ; probably a 
little of both. Hence will result a loss of public credit, and 
therewith much injury to commerce and manufactures, operat 
ing a farther decrease of the means of revenue, and much de 
bility as to the exterior operations of the kingdom. 

At this moment the discontented spirits will find congenial 
matter in abundance to work upon ; and from that period, 
all the future is involved in the mist of conjecture. If the 
reigning prince were not the small beer character that he is, 
there can be but little doubt, that watching events, and making 
a tolerable use of them, he would regain his authority ; but 
what will you have from a creature who, situated as he is, eats, 
and drinks, and sleeps well, and laughs, and is as merry a 
grig as lives ? The idea that they will give him some money, 
which he, can economize, and that he will have no trouble in 
governing, contents him entirely. Poor man ! he little thinks 
how unstable is his situation. He is beloved, but it is not with 
the sort of love which a monarch should inspire. It is that 
kind of good natured pity, which one feels for a led captive. 
There is, besides, no possibility of serving him ; for at the 
slightest show of opposition, he gives up everything and every 
person. 

As to his ministers, the Count de Montmorin has more 
understanding than people in general imagine, and he means 
well, very well. But he means it feebly. He is a good 
easy kind of man, one who would make an excellent peace 
minister in quiet times ; but he wants the vigor of mind need 
ful for great occasions. The Count de la Luzerne is an 
indolent, pleasant companion, a man of honor, and as obsti- 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 93 

nate as you please ; but he has somewhat of the creed of 
General Gates, that the world does a great part of its own 
business, without the aid of those who are at the head of 
affairs. The success of such men depends very much upon 
the run of the dice. The Count de St Priest is the only man 
among them, who has what they call caractere, which answers 
to our idea of firmness, joined to some activity. But a person 
who knows him pretty well, (which I do not,) assures me, that 
he is mercenary and false hearted. If so, he cannot possess 
much good sense, whatever may be his share of genius or 
talents. Monsieur de Latour-Dupin, the minister at war, 
whom I am also unacquainted with, is said to be no great 
things in any respect. M. Necker was frightened by the 
Enrages into the acceptance of him, instead of the Marquis de 
Montesquiou, who has a considerable share of talents, and 
a great deal of method. Montesquiou is of course at pres 
ent the enemy of M. Necker, having been his friend. 

As to M. Necker, he is one of those people, who has ob 
tained a much greater reputation than he had any right to. 
His enemies say, that as a banker, he acquired his fortune by 
means, which to say the least were indelicate, and they 
mention instances. But in this country, everything is so 
much exaggerated, that nothing is more useful than a little 
skepticism. M. Necker, in his public administration, has 
always been honest and disinterested ; which proves well, I 
think, for his former private conduct ; or else it proves that 
he has more vanity than cupidity. Be that as it may, an 
unspotted integrity as minister, and serving at his own expense, 
in an office which others seek for the purpose of enriching 
themselves, have acquired for him very deservedly much confi 
dence. Add to this, that his writings on finance teem with 
that sort of sensibility, whiah make? the fortune of modern 
romances, and which is exactly suited to this lively nation, 
who love to read but hate to think. Hence his reputation. 
He is a man of genius, and his wife is a woman of sense ; but 
neither of them have talents, or rather the talents of a great 



94 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

minister. His education as a banker has taught him to make 
tight bargains, and put him upon his guard against projects. 
But though he understands man, as a covetous creature, he 
does not understand mankind ; a defect which is remediless. 
He is utterly ignorant of politics, by which I mean politics in 
the great sense, or that sublime science, which embraces for 
its object the happiness of mankind. Consequently, he neith 
er knows what constitution to form, nor how to obtain the 
consent of others to such as he wishes. From the moment 
of convening the States-General, he has been afloat upon the 
wide ocean of incidents. 

But what is most extraordinary is, that M. Necker is a very 
poor financier. This, I know, will sound like heresy in the 
ears of most people, but it is true. The plans he has pro 
posed are feeble and inept. Hitherto he has been supported 
by borrowing from the Caisse d Escompte, which, (being by 
means of what they call here an arret de surseance secured 
from all prosecutions,) has lent him a sum in their paper 
exceeding the totality of their capital, by about four millions 
sterling. Last autumn he came forward to the Assembles with 
a dreadful tale of woe, at the fag end of which was a tax 
upon every member of the community of a fourth of his rev 
enue, and this he declared to be needful for saving the state. 
His enemies adopted it, (declaring what is very true, that it is 
a wretched, impracticable expedient,) in the hope that he 
and his scheme would fall together. This JLssemblee, this 
patriotic band, took in the lump the minister s proposition, 
because of their confidence and the confidence of the people 
in him as they said ; but in fact, because they would not risk 
the unpopularity of a tax. 

The plan thus adopted, M. Necker, to escape the snare 
which he had nearly got taken in, altered his tax into what 
they call the patriotic contribution. By this, every man is to 
declare, if he pleases, at what he pleases to estimate his annual 
income, and to pay one fourth of it in three years. You will 
easily suppose that this fund was unproductive, and notwith- 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 95 

standing the imminent danger of the state, we are as yet without 
any aid from the contribution patriotique. 

His next scheme was that of a National Bank, or at least 
an extension of the Caisse d Escompte. It has been variously 
modelled since, and many capital objections removed ; but at 
last it is good for nothing, and so it will turn out. At present 
it is just beginning. By way of giving some base to the pre 
sent operation, it is proposed and determined to sell about ten 
or twelve millions sterling of the crown and church lands, both 
of which are, by resolution of the JlssembUe, declared to belong 
to the nation ; but as it is clear that these lands will not sell 
well just now, they have appointed a treasurer to receive what 
they will sell for hereafter, and they issue a kind of order upon 
this treasurer, which is to be called an Jlssignat, and is to be 
paid, (out of these sales) one, two, and three years hence. 
They expect that on these Jlssignais they can borrow money 
to free the engagements of the Caisse d Escompte, and they are 
at the same time to pay some of the more pressing debts, with 
the same Jlssignats. 

Now this plan must fail, as follows. First, there will be some 
doubt about the title to these lands, at least till the revolution 
is completed. Secondly, the representative of the land must 
always (for a reason which will presently appear) sell for less 
than a representative of money, and therefore, until public 
confidence is so far restored as that the five per cents are 
above par, these Assignats bearing five per cent must be be 
low par. Money, therefore, cannot be raised upon them but 
at a considerable discount. Thirdly, the lands to be disposed 
of must sell a great deal below their value, for there is not 
money to buy them in this country; and the proof is, that they 
never obtained money on loan at the legal interest but always 
upon a premium sufficient to draw it from the employments of 
commerce and manufactures, and as the revolution has greatly 
lessened the mass of money, the effect of the scarcity must be 
greater. 

But farther, there is a solecism in the plan which escapes 



96 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

most of them, and which is, nevertheless, very palpable. The 
value of lands in Europe is, you know, estimated by the in 
come. To dispose of public lands is to sell public revenue ; 
and therefore taking the legal interest at five per cent, lands 
renting for 100 livres ought to sell for 2000, but they expect 
that these lands will sell for 3000, and that thereby, not only 
public credit will be restored, but a great saving will be made, 
as the 3000 will redeem an interest of 150. It is, however, 
an indisputable fact, that public credit being established, the 
stocks are worth more than land of equal income, and for three 
reasons ; first, that there is no trouble whatever in the manage 
ment ; secondly, there is no danger of bad crops and taxes ; 
and thirdly, they can be disposed of at a moment s warning, 
if the owner wants money, and be as readily repurchased when 
it suits his convenience. If, therefore, the public credit be re 
stored, and there be a surplus sum of ten to twelve millions to 
be invested, and if such large sales (contrary to custom) should 
not from the amount affect the price, still the lands must go 
cheaper than the stocks, and consequently the interest bought 
will be smaller than the revenue sold. 

Having thus given you a very rude sketch of the men and 
the measures of this country, I see and feel that it is time to 
conclude. I sincerely wish I could say that there are able 
men at hand to take the helm, should the present pilots aban 
don the ship. But I have great apprehensions as to those who 
may succeed. The present set must wear out in the course of 
the year, and most of them would be glad to get fairly out of 
the scrape at present ; but it is alike dangerous to stay or to 
go, and they must patiently wait the breath of the Assembles and 
follow as it blows. The new order of things cannot endure. 
I hope it may be mended, but fear it may be changed. All 
Europe, just now, is like a mine ready to explode ; and if 
this winter does not produce peace, next summer will behold 
a wider extension of the war. I am, &c.

THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 



TO ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 

Paris, January 31st, 1790. 

Dear Hamilton, 

I did expect that in congratulating you, which I do most 
sincerely, upon your appointment, I should have communicat 
ed a matter which would have administered much ease and 
convenience to the affairs of your department. I learn this 
morning that these expectations are frustrated from a quarter, 
and in a manner, which would excite my surprise, had I not 
long since acquired the habit of wondering at nothing. I will 
tell you a plain story. 

M. Necker, pressed for money, had listened to overtures 
for selling the debt of the United States, and mentioned the 
matter to some members of the National Assembly, by which 
means it became known to the principal Americans, and 
friends of America here. I own that upon the first mention 
of the matter, it appeared to me a thing of indifference, and 
so I expressed myself. Our duty is to pay to such creditors 
as may possess the demand. But further information placed 
the affair in a different point of light. It appeared that the 
offer was for a small part, at a great discount ; and that the 
terms of the bargain were to be debated in the National 
Assembly, and consequently our reputation sported with. 
Mr Short did everything in his power, but having no pointed 
instructions, could only express the result of his own judg 
ment and feelings. But the minister was pressed for money, 
and he had the offer of money. Under these circumstances, 
in connexion with a society of friends to America, I made M. 
Necker an offer, such as in my conception was honorable to 
France, to America, and to the parties. This proposition, 
(after stating the amount of the principal and interest which 
would be due on the first of January 1790, and considering 
that as a new capital on which the interest was to run,) con 
tains the following terms. On propose de P acquerir du gouv- 
ernementj et a cet effet de I 9 - acquitter en entier par des rents per- 

VOL. II. 9 



98 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

petuelles de la France moniantes a la meme somme. This 
payment was to be made in the year 1790 and 1791 ; con 
sequently, so far as France is concerned, the offer went to a 
full, complete, and entire payment, and that at a much earlier 
period than is stipulated by the terms of the loans themselves. 
To this was added a further offer, in case the situation of 
affairs in this kingdom should require it, in the following terms ; 
On se chargera de solder en argent la moitie de la dite rente 
au prix courant des effets royaux. This part of the offer 
has no other merit than to secure to the minister the sale of 
the French effects, if he thought proper, and is therefore a 
matter rather of convenience than advantage. I communicat 
ed this plan, beforehand, to Mr Short, and to the Marquis de 
Lafayette, who both considered it as an excellent means of 
saving at the same time the honor and interest of America, 
while it furnished a useful resource to France. I showed it 
also to Monsieur de Montmorin, who, having well weighed 
and considered it, assured me that he most heartily approved 
it, and would do everything in his power to secure the success. 
In the supposition that this plan were adopted here, applica 
tion was to be made through you to the United States to pay 
the amount of this debt in obligations for current guilders, cal 
culating the exchange at par ; those obligations to bear five per 
cent interest, and to be paid in instalments, the first of which 
to commence five years hence. Consequently, as the society 
was to bear all the charges of negotiation, &c. &c. it follows 
clearly, that the United States would have obtained the needful 
time required for their accommodation without a farthing of ex 
pense, and without the pain of soliciting it from this Court. It 
was therefore equally honorable and useful for them. It was 
honorable also to the parties. First, because they became em 
inently useful to the societies of which they are respectively 
members; and secondly, because the advantage, if any, which 
they were to derive would result merely from a careful and 
industrious attention to the variations of the exchange and fluc 
tuations in the effects, and from the use of their funds and 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 99 

credit to make investments at the proper times and seasons, 
which, as far as the sum of forty millions of livres and up 
wards can go, must necessarily have sustained the value of the 
stocks here. And you will observe that this was clearly stated 
and understood. 

The proposition was delivered to M. Necker on the fifth of 
December. You will observe, that in framing it we counted 
upon the aid of money-lenders in Holland ; and, in preference 
to others, upon the commissioners of the United States. We 
learned, however, that these gentlemen had, notwithstanding 
the remonstrances of Mr Jacob Van Staphorst, who has a real 
and warm regard for America, joined with those who made the 
offer to M. Necker. Through the channel that brought us this 
information, an interview was brought about between Monsieur 
de la Chaise and Mr Van Staphorst, charged with the final pro 
position to M. Necker and me. I told those gentlemen, that I 
was convinced their offer could not be accepted, (by the bye, 
M. Necker had told me that the sum offered was not sufficient,) 
and that, if accepted by the minister, it could not be adopted 
by the Assembly, and that they risked doing great injury to 
America, without any advantage to themselves ; that I would 
communicate to them an offer I had made } and which I had 
great reason to believe would be adopted ; that I would offer 
them an interest in it, or a commission, at their option ; that if 
they should not approve of holding a concern, I would then lie 
still, and let them make the most of their plans without opposi 
tion, but asked the assurance on the part of themselves and of 
their principals, (those whom they represented) that if they 
found their own Scheme impracticable, and did not choose to 
adventure with me, they should only not oppose. This 
being solemnly promised, I stated the matter to them at large, 
and they came so fully into my views, as to withhold the pro 
position they were directed to make, and send an express on 
the subject to Amsterdam. 

The interview was on the eleventh of December, in the eve 
ning. Some further discussions were needful, which we had the 



100 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

next day. I avoided going to M. Necker s, because I was to do 
nothing which would defeat their plan. On the twenty-sixth, 
Mr Hubbard, partner of the house of Staphorst, arrived charg 
ed to make their offer, with a budget of reasons in support of 
it. This offer was to purchase the 6,000,000 at a discount of 
about eleven per cent. It was made immediately ; and on 
the morning of the 28th he called on me, in company with 
Mr Van Staphorst. I had heen repeatedly assured from 
different quarters that M. Necker was ready to treat with me, 
but I had not put myself in his way. The conversation with Mr 
Hubbard was not very long. I heard what he had to say, and 
replied with great precision, but so as to change entirely his 
opinion. You will not wonder at this, when I tell you the 
purport of the objections he had brought forward ; first, that it 
was too profitable to the parties ; secondly, too burdensome to 
France ; and thirdly, might injure the credit of America by 
selling the obligations too low. To the first, I replied by a 
smile, and the assurance, that I never expected such an ob 
jection from Holland. This disconcerted him. To the second 
I answered, that M. Necker understood his own business, and 
might safely be trusted in making a bargain ; but I showed 
him further that the bargain was a good one. To the last I 
made the answer, which I am sure you have already made in 
your own mind, viz. that if the commissioners of the United 
States could safely be trusted in making negotiations, where 
the loss was to be borne by their employers, a fortiori might 
they be trusted where the loss was to be borne by them 
selves. 

As all this was merely ostensible, I pressed him hard for the 
real reasons, but could get nothing more than assurances that 
there were no other than those above mentioned. As these 
were clearly refuted, of course he acknowledged himself 
converted ; but Hudibras has very well observed that, 

Who s convinced against his will, 
Is of the same opinion still. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 101 

A more effectual change was wrought by M. Necker, who, 
on the second of this month, refused their offer. On the morning 
of the third, Mr Hubbard called and informed me of this, and 
in the afternoon of the fifth he set off for Amsterdam, apparently 
desirous of bringing all his friends into my views. The busi 
ness went on but slowly in Amsterdam ; and Mr Jacob Van 
Staphorst was amused from time to time, and amused me with 
the expectation that each succeeding post would bring their 
definitive answer ; but this morning he tells me, with very sin 
cere regret, what has been done. The letter to you on this 
subject I have read, and will make a few remarks upon it, but 
shall not be very precise, perhaps, as it is only from memory 
of what it contained that I write. 

The idea of an enormous profit, admitting for a moment 
that such were to accrue, would hardly have been with them 
what Candid calls the sufficient reason for refusal, although per 
haps it might have been for acceptance. But you can judge 
of the extent of that profit, and you will with me smile at the 
absurdity of connecting with such profit a sacrifice in the price 
of American obligations, on the vending of which at or near 
par, the profit must certainly depend. There is something 
else which perhaps is more ridiculous still, viz. that the United 
States, whose obligations belonging to numerous individuals 
are daily sold on the change of Amsterdam, should apprehend 
an injury to their credit from trusting a farther negotiation to 
persons, whose immediate interest in supporting that credit 
would be so great. They state as a great difficulty the bor 
rowing of twelve millions within the term, when on the same 
pledge they can borrow twenty. Their statement of sums is 
not, I believe, very accurate, or perhaps my memory is not 
accurate. However, I am sure the idea is, that the greater 
sum can be borrowed more easily than the less. There is also 
the farther very extraordinary idea, that it is for the interest 
of the United States to pay between four and five per cent 
upon a negotiation, rather than get it done for nothing. I shall 
not notice many expressions which are injurious, but make to 
9* 



102 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION* 

their affectation of disinterestedness, the answer which Jacob 
Van Staphorst made to me. It is very strange that they should 
say all this, when they must remember that in M. Calonne s 
time, they offered him only fourteen millions of livers for one 
half of the thirty-two, and arrearages of interest, but would not 
take the whole, even at that rate, which is the reason why the 
bargain was broken off. I should make but a poor excuse for 
so long a story, if I stopped here ; but I will now proceed to 
give you what T conceive to be the key of the riddle. 

These gentlemen are engaged, as I suppose you know, in 
very extensive speculations upon the funded debt of America. 
They have lately worked this matter to a most astonishing ben 
efit. Above three millions of that debt, which cost them five 
shillings in the pound, has been made the basis of a loan on 
which they receive sixty per cent, and are bound to repay it 
by instalments from the interest receivable in Jlmerica. The 
Dutch, however, prefer lending at five per cent to the Con 
gress direct. It is, therefore, essential to the success of their 
schemes, that they should be able to suspend the one loan al 
ways till they have completed the other ; and thus our nation 
al interests are rendered subservient to their particular negoti 
ations. You will easily see that one such operation, in which there 
is no risk, is better worth pursuing than the very great profit 
they complain of. With this hint you will understand the mat 
ter thoroughly. I must come to a conclusion. 

I did not see M. Necker as I expected this afternoon, be 
cause he was gone to council ; however I must suspend, at 
least, the matter with him ; but you may rely on it that if the 
Minister at this court, or any other agent, be authorised fully 
to deal in the business, and, if the court will not readily agree 
to a new arrangement respecting the debt, to contract with in 
dividuals, that the matter can be yet managed in the manner 
above mentioned, provided it be not too long delayed. As to 
the loan which the commissioners have undertaken of their own 
heads, you may, I think, derive great advantage from it ; for, 
in the first place, your Minister or Agent can make terms with 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 103 

them to that amount at pleasure, for the benefit of the United 
States ; and you may, in the next place, convert the money to 
very useful purpose by sinking three or four times as much of 
the domestic debt, and raising the price at the same time to 
wards par, which will prevent the success of speculations by 
foreigners, which are a loss to America. I am very truly, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO WILLIAM SHORT, AMSTERDAM* 

Paris, Febuary 20, 1790. 

Dear Sir&gt; 

You have seen the decree which has been made respecting 
tobacco, and which gives to French shipping a preference of 
above one hundred livres per ton over American. Previous to 
the decision on this business, T was desired by a note to dine 
with Monsieur de Lafayette, in order to confer on American 
business. And note, that I had attended once before, when 
he wished me to go with him to the Committee of Commerce, 
but I declined until the Committee should ask my attendance, 
which they have not done. At the conference to which I 
was invited, were present Mr Swan, and Colonel Walker, and a 
little man whom Chastellux formerly recommended to me as 
being a disciple of Doctor Pangloss. In his way to America 
he was shipwrecked, had his toes frozen off, and was after 
wards, I believe, appointed to some subordinate place in the 
consular office. During the conference, another little man 
came in, whom I do not know, but have been told that his 
name is Raymond, and that he is from Alsace. 

After Lafayette had proposed the question, I asked the opin 
ion of Walker and Swan, which they gave, and the latter in 
particular observed that the southern provinces would soon 
supply the kingdom, if the culture was allowed. I delivered 
my sentiments to the following effect. A sacrifice of the in 
terest of France to that of America could not reasonably be 



104 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

expected. The first question was, or ought to be, whether 
they could dispense with the revenue. If they could, then 
they should give it up entirely, and consult the commercial in 
terest of the country. That to this effect they should make 
the article free to be imported and exported everywhere. 
That if on the contrary they should deem the revenue neces 
sary, then the following modes of obtaining it occurred. 1. a 
Duty ; 2. an Excise ; 3. a Farm ; 4. a Regie. That the first, 
if great, would be eluded ; that the second, incompatible with 
their new principles, was not worth establishing as a single ar 
ticle, because of the expense attending it; that the third was 
out of fashion ; and by the fourth they would be cheated. 

Respecting the free culture, I gave it as my decided opin 
ion, that in a short time it would totally destroy the tobacco 
trade, and to this effect I stated the charges attending the 
transportation of that article, which amount to about three guin 
eas on the medium produce of an acre. And I have no doubt 
that the south of France will produce as good tobacco as Vir 
ginia. About this time the Alsaciancame in, and said a great 
deal to prove what, if I can read the countenance, he did not 
believe a word of, viz. that no tobacco would be planted even if 
the permission were granted, excepting in Flanders and Al 
sace. I did not think it worth while to attempt a useless con 
futation, but told Lafayette that as they had already set Alsace 
on fire, I could not advise them to add more fuel. That I had 
given him facts from which he might draw his own conclusions. 
That I would not pretend to advise, but would venture to pre 
dict. That the free culture would be permitted, and thereby 
the revenue be lost ; but that afterwards the culture would be 
prohibited through all France, and the revenue be established. 
I could not but smile inwardly at the conduct of the business. 
The national interests are every way injured, those of Ameri 
ca by no means served, and Alsace is the dupe. All this, time 
I think will show. 

Finding that the decrees bore so hard upon us, both in our 
agriculture and navigation, I have, notwithstanding my previ- 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 105 

ous determination, spoken to Monsieur de Lafayette, who, ac 
cording to custom, asked for a little note about it. I spoke 
also to Monsieur de Montmorin, at whose request I have real 
ly written a pretty large note, which he will get translated and 
deliver to the Diplomatic Committee. It purports to be obser 
vations of sundry American citizens. I mean to keep out of 
sight as much as possible, and do all the good I can ; and for 
the rest I repeat again, let the world wag as it may. I have 
the honor to be, &ic. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO WILLIAM SHORT, PARIS. 

London, April 23d, 1190. 
Dear Sir, 

I have received yours of the eleventh instant. I have no 
doubt but that the advocates of the Jlssignats forces will tri 
umph in the success of their favorite plan. A momentary ad 
vantage was of course to be expected, and in all matters de 
pending on opinion the effect becomes a cause ; hence you 
will find for some time a regular increase of the happy conse 
quences. But this measure has in it the certain cause of evil, 
and that cause will in due time produce its effect, which will 
also be increased by opinion. The bounds of a letter would 
not permit of the full developement of such principles as apply 
to the subject; but a word to the wise is sufficient. 

I would send you Hamilton s plan, (just now received,) but 
Mr Parker has already sent it, and you will find one postage 
sufficient. It was not from what I found in Amsterdam, that I 
was deterred from pursuing the propositions to M. Necker, but 
the conviction that his expectations have been so raised, as to 
shut his ears to anything which could with safety be proposed ; 
and I have not enough of the knight errant in my composition 
to go beyond that line. 

I think Colonel Hamilton s idea of obtaining money at four 



106 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

per cent is premature. Doubtless it will be practicable at a 
future day, when we do not want money, and our loans should 
be so managed now, as to leave room for taking advantage of 
that circumstance hereafter; but such an attempt would not 
succeed at present. Had my proposals been accepted. I think 
I should have so managed as to bring that matter about in a 
very short time ; but everything must be now suspended, for 
a few weeks at least. I am, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



WILLIAM SHORT TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

Paris, September 12th, 1790. 

Dear Sir, 

The last letter which I had the pleasure of receiving from 
you was of the tenth of August ; it was only the beginning of a 
letter, which some company coming in obliged you to cut short. 
I was in hopes you would have sent me the continuation of it ; 
for I have great pleasure in receiving your sentiments on the 
persons and things which are here before me. Although my 
opinion of them is not always the same with yours, still you 
have great authorities and much experience in your favor, and 
besides support what you say with so much ingenuity and elo 
quence, as must always instruct and please, and often convince ; 
and this you know is of all things the most difficult, as every 
one seems to consider his opinion as a property which is the 
last he will relinquish. 

The present feature of affairs here is such, as confirms your 
friends in the opinion they had conceived of your judgment in 
such matters. I see often some of them, who say you not only 
predicted what was to happen, but how ; they wish to consult 
you now, that you might tell them when the bankruptcy will 
arrive, and whether there will be a civil war, and what will be 
the event of it. There is no danger in talking of you in this 
manner as you are not here, but if you were within the juris- 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 107 

diction of the Comite des Recherches, I should be afraid of 
their making you a nocturnal visit. These visits have lately 
become fashionable ; one of the most remarkable is one which 
has just taken place. A washerman found a letter in the dirty 
pockets of one of his fair customers, which had the appearance to 
him, as he did not know how to read, of a counter-revolution ; 
by means of the district this came to the knowledge of the 
Comite des Recherches. The lady in question was called be 
fore them late at night, and underwent an interrogatory of some 
hours. Her papers were examined, but nothing found. The 
Comite des Recherches made their report to the Assembly, in 
formed them, as a proof of their vigilance and zeal, that 
they had passed the whole night without sleeping, were ap 
plauded by the Assembly, and the female was ordered not to 
leave Paris. And all this is considered as the sure and cer 
tain road to the establishment of a free government, and 
particularly to the securing of personal liberty. 

There is a plan for paper money now before the Assembly. 
The Assembly is divided in their opinion, and so are the commer 
cial towns ; but the people who fill the galleries, and who surround 
the Assembly-house often in crowds, seem to be unanimous in 
favor of it. Mirabeau undertakes to prove that it is not paper 
money. It is true that it is a paper, which you may force your 
creditor to receive, and which is to have all the legal proper 
ties of money, but still he swears and so do many others, that it 
is not paper money, because it has land for its pledge. Some 
insist on calling it papier-terre, and the idea was near passing. 
It has been lately decided, that the final vote shall not be taken 
on it before the 17th. My opinion is, that should the two mill 
ions which they talk of be issued, for the purpose of immedi 
ately paying off the dette exigible, a great part of it, instead of 
being thus applied, will be diverted to the daily exigencies of 
government, and for which it seems evident a sufficient quanti 
ty of taxes will not be collected. You will readily believe, that 
a government like this will not adopt the harsh business of for 
cing taxes, so long as they can make use of that gentle means 



108 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

of striking paper to satisfy their demands. This argument, 
however, has no force with the members of the Assembly ; they 
all advocate or oppose the system on other principles ; the 
objection of so great an emission, changing the proportion 
of prices of all articles of commerce, seems not lo have its full 
weight, though it is used by some. So much is written 
and said for and against this system, that it is impossible to 
discover what will be the decision. I think, however, that if 
the vote of the Assembly should be taken independent of any 
external influence, it would be rejected. 

An opinion begins now to prevail here, that the Assembly 
are not very desirous of putting an end to their session. You 
know they have determined that their powers continue until 
the constitution is finished. You know also, that they are 
inviolable for criminal matters, though not for debts (by their 
decrees.) You know that they concentre in their hands 
all the powers of government and exercise them daily. To 
an impartial person this certainly presents the idea of a very 
aristocratical and tyrannical body. It is observable that public 
inquiry begins to examine more attentively the nature of their 
powers; so that if they make no further progress in the con 
stitution, than they have done for some time, it would not be at 
all surprising if public opinion should soon be as much against, 
as it has been for them. 

You will have heard of M. Necker s retreat from the helm. 
It produced no effect either on the public mind or public 
funds. The Assembly received intelligence yesterday of his 
being stopped on his way to Switzerland by a municipality, 
although he had a passport from the King and from the mayor of 
Paris. He and the municipality both wrote to the Assembly ; 
he, to inform them of his being stopped and to desire a per 
mission to continue his route ; the municipality, to inform 
them that as they had determined that ministers should be re 
sponsible, and as M. Necker s passport authorised his quitting 
the kingdom, which would destroy the responsibility, they had 
thought proper to stop him. The Assembly have directed 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 109 

their President to write to the municipality to give him his 
liberty. Some members were for voting their thanks to the mu 
nicipality. 

We have intelligence here from New York as late as the 
20th of July. You have probably later. You will have been 
informed of the removal of Congress. Would it not have 
been as well to have remained the ten years at New York, 
where they were well settled ? I have seen the bill passed 
by the Senate for a foreign loan, and for assuming a certain 
sum of state debt. I am not acquainted with the resources 
which Congress have in view, but I should fear those of which 
we know as yet would not be sufficient to fulfil the engage 
ments taken, and I fear still more that a failure of an engage 
ment taken by Congress at present will have a bad effect on 
future engagements. Still I have much confidence in their 
wisdom, and suppose they have a certainty of calling to their 
aid new resources. Their designs as to foreign appointments 
are enveloped in as much secrecy, as those of Mr Pitt s 
armaments. I suppose a very short time will give us some cer 
tain information on this subject, or at least some data to rea 
son on. They talk of two ministers and two Charges des 
Affaires. The salary of the former remains the same ; the 
latter they have augmented fifty per cent. The proportion is 
certainly not well preserved, agreeably to the ideas of the 
courts of Europe. I will thank you, if you have any farther 
or later information of the proceedings of Congress, to inform 
me of them. Be assured of the sentiments of attachment 
with which I am yours, &c. 

WILLIAM SHORT. 



TO WILLIAM SHORT. 

London, September 18th, 171M). 



Dear Sir, 

Your letter of the 12th did not arrive until this morning. It 
is perfectly natural that your opinions should differ from mine. 

VOL. II. 10 



110 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

There will ever be a difference of opinions on subjects, which 
do not admit of demonstration. It will be very long before po 
litical subjects will be reduced to geometric certitude. At pre 
sent the reasoning on them is a kind of arithmetic of infinities, 
where the best information, the wisest head, and clearest mind, 
can only approach the truth. A cautious man should, there 
fore, give only Sybilline predictions, if indeed he should haz 
ard any. But I am not a cautious man. I therefore give it 
as my opinion, that they will issue the paper currency, and sub 
stitute thereby depreciation in the place of bankruptcy, or rath 
er suspension. 

Apropos of this currency, this papier-terre, I could tell them 
of a country where there is a papier- terre now mort et enterre. 
The Assembly havec ommitted many blunders, which is not to 
be wondered at. They have taken genius instead of reason 
for their guide, adopted experiment instead of experience, and 
wander in the dark because they prefer lightning to light. I 
think you are mistaken in supposing, that the emission of paper 
will destroy the proportion of prices. This proportion is in 
dependent of the medium of trade. The one results from a 
relation of things, the other is only an ideal standard by which 
to measure those things. Your height and mine would be the 
same, and consequently the proportion of one to the other the 
same, although a measure of six inches should be called a 
foot. 

You are very merry on the subject of personal liberty, but 
the District has more to say than many are aware of. Is it not 
written in the Droit tfHomme, that liberty is an inalienable pro 
perty of man inseparable from the human character ? And if 
this be so, pray what better mode of securing personal liberty 
than to secure the person ? Your wits may sneer, but you 
must learn to respect the decrees of the municipalities, which 
like, those of Heaven are inscrutable, but not on that account 
the less entitled to obedience and respect. The lady, I am 
told, is so far from complaining of the restraint she was laid 
under, that although an aristocrat, she tells the Assembly with 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. Ill 

all becoming humility that she finds their yoke is easy and 
their burden light, while the young gentleman ordered on duty 
in her chamber acknowledges that service to be perfect free 
dom. Shortsighted man that you are ! Is it not a general com 
plaint, that France is torn by a division of political sentiment 
and opinion? And what mode so effectual to produce a union 
of both, as to give the women of one party in charge to men of 
the other ? By way of addition and amendment, I would 
humbly propose that the male aristocrats should be put into the 
custody of the female whigs, and I dare say they would come 
out much less fierce than they were. 

That the Assembly should continue its session too long is 
both natural and necessary. Mankind in general reason only 
from their feelings, and therefore to discern the wrong, which 
that body has committed, the people must first be heartily dis 
pleased with them. And then they will go too far the other 
way. It is a pendulum, and the farther you draw it on one side 
the farther will it go towards the other. 

I have very late news from America, viz. the 14th of August, 
but my correspondents do not give themselves the trouble to 
communicate any political intelligence. The funding bill is, I 
understand, in this city, but I have not yet seen it. They have 
not provided for the full interest of the public debt. As to 
the ability of the country, you need not entertain the slightest 
apprehension. The domestic debt is always a mere nominal 
thing. It neither adds to, nor takes away from the mass of na 
tional property, but furnishes a species of private property, 
which from its convertible nature, and by holding a kind of 
middle rank between real value and the mere sign of value, 
may be rendered of admirable use to increase commercial cir 
culation, invigorate the manufactures, and consequently to bene 
fit the agricultural interests, which receive thereby under the 
name of price more than they pay under the name of tax. 

The situation of France is by no means desperate. A tor 
rent of depreciation may inundate the land, and storms and 
tempests arise, but the one you know fertilizes the soil, and the

other purifies the atmosphere. Ultimately health and abun 
dance succeed the wintry appearance, which seemed fatal to 
both. Adieu. I shall leave this in a day or two.

TO THE CHEVALIER TERNANT,* PARIS. 

London, May 4th, 1790, 

Dear Sir, 

Your favor of the 22d of last month reached me too late 
to reply by the last post. If your friends speculate in the Jls- 
signatSj I wish them much success, but I incline to think that 
there will be more loss then gain in such speculations. You 
and I know a little about paper money. There is somewhere 
on the way towards me a long letter and other documents res 
pecting some lands in America, about which we have had a 
conversation together. I will write to you about that affair 
when I receive it. You mistake me if you suppose that I 
meant to stimulate your endeavors. I was prompted merely 
by a common sense of justice. Why should your time and at 
tention be consumed by the business of other people ? But I 
quit this subject. 

Pray let me know how affairs go on. I think the public 
opinion is now inflated by the dssignats, which will prove at 
last to be but a frail reliance. There seems to be a kind of 
petite guerre between the AssembUe and M. Necker. This 
will do no good to either ; but in such contests the one gene 
rally sinks under the efforts of the many. How stands our 
friend Lafayette. Very much depends on him. I see no 
means of extricating you from your troubles, but that which 
most men would consider as the means of plunging you into 
greater I mean a war. And you should make it to yourselves 

* Ternant served as a Colonel in the American army during the 
Revolution ; and afterwards succeeded M. de Moustiers as French 
Minister in the United States. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 113 

a war of men, to your neighbors a war of money. I do not 
explain, because a word to the wise is sufficient. You want 
just now great men to pursue great measures. As to the idea 
that you can keep out of the fire, which consumes your neigh 
bors and your allies, it is ridiculous. You must suffer either 
for or with them ; and the latter is at once the nobler and the 
safer position. But I correct and check myself with a due 
respect for the gentlemen in the several post offices, who will, 
I hope, permit my letter to go forward and convey to you 
the assurance of my regard. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO M. DE LAFAYETTE. 

London, May 7th, 1790. 
My Dear Sir, 

When this letter reaches your hands it will probably find you 
meditating on the situation of France, which is not perhaps en 
viable, but it is by no means so dreadful as would at first sight 
appear. This country is arming, and 1 am convinced with a 
determination to compel not only Spain, but every other power, 
to subscribe such terms as she may choose to dictate. You 
will strive in vain to deprecate the blow, therefore you must 
prepare to meet it, to return it, or rather so to strike as may 
prevent it. 

The enclosed letter is left open for your perusal ; pray for 
ward it. 1 do not think that France can be prepared before 
September ; but it is not improbable that under existing circum 
stances the King of Hungary would cede, as a don de famille, 
his rights to the low countries upon assurances of effectual aid 
to support his claims to Silesia, and elsewhere in that quarter. 
Certainly a good understanding might be obtained with the par 
ty of General Vandermersch, and measures might be taken to 
secure the surrender of the few garrison towns, which are in 
that country. These things being ripened, two armies, compos- 
10*

ed in a great measure of militia, might march, the one from 
Luxembourg and take post in Liege, so as to oppose there ef 
fectually with any army of good troops the efforts of Prussia ; 
the other might go along the sea coast. But a detachment of 
each army might move so as to form a junction at Brussels, 
and go thence down the Scheldt to Antwerp. The mode of co 
operating against Holland seems to me to be from Dunkirk, 
with vessels which Jones will describe to you, so as to fall in up 
on Amsterdam ; which being effected would, with the aid of 
the popular party, give possession of the whole country. Or, 
allowing a great part, or even the whole of this plan to fail at 
first, it would eventually succeed in uniting all Flanders to the 
Kingdom of France, and, by obliging this country to fight at 
land, would greatly exhaust her. 

Previous to striking a blow, preparations should be made in 
your islands, by laying an embargo on all ships there on the 
same day that an embargo is laid on ships in your own ports ; 
and if the nation should not be able to fit out all your ships of 
war, the smaller ones might be disposed of to great advantage 
to merchants, who would fit them out as privateers. Such 
ships of war as you can fit out might be selected from the fast 
est sailers, and cruise upon the commerce, with orders to de 
stroy whatever they can, and to secure the seamen. The Dutch 
commerce should be respected, let them do what they will ; by 
which means you will secure friends in that country and excite 
contention between the allies. 

The difference between France and Britain is, that the form 
er can exist without commerce, but the latter cannot. Secure 
their seamen, and never exchange them ; you will by that 
means ruin both their Marine and Finance ; and, if you send 
those seamen into the interior parts of the kingdom, and em 
ploy them in public works upon the highways, &ic. &tc. they 
will cost you nothing, and by degrees lose their habits of sea 
manship. 

I hear you cry out that the Finances are in a deplorable sit 
uation. This should be no obstacle. I think that they may 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 115 

be restored during war better than in peace. You want also 
something to turn men s attention from their present discon 
tents. Admitting, however, everything that can be said on the 
chapter of Finance, surely it is better to strike than to be 
struck; and you will strive in vain to parry the blow. Adieu, 

GoUVERNEUR MoRRIS. 



TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Paris, November 22d, 1790. 
Dear Sir, 

The country T now inhabit, on which so many other countries 
depend, having sunk to absolute nothingness, has deranged the 
general state of things in every quarter ; and what complicates 
the scene in no small degree is the incertitude which prevails, as 
to her future fate, because a new system, calculated on the pal 
sied state of France, would be as effectually deranged by her 
recovery, as that was which leaned upon her greatness heretofore 
and fell in her fall. The northern courts, removed at a great 
er distance from her influence, had provided for themselves by 
an alliance, which took place immediately after the peace be 
tween Sweden and Russia. I think I hinted in a former letter 
my expectation, that a new system would arise there. In effect 
a treaty concluded between what may be called the Baltic pow 
ers will have considerable influence hereafter upon the gene 
ral system. When you recollect that they are exclusively the 
magazine of naval stores in this hemisphere, your comprehen 
sive mind will seize at once the consequences, which may follow 
to America from combinations where such articles are indispen 
sable. This same Baltic is also a granary for southern Europe. 
Hence a new source of important reflection. I think that oc 
casions will ere long present themselves, in which America may 
be essentially concerned. But to come nearer to my present 
position, the Emperor disengaged from the Turk and likely to 
be soon repossessed of Flanders, will be there in the command 



116 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

of fifty thousand men, besides the resource which every sove 
reign derives from an unsuccessful revolt. The King of Prussia 
is no longer at the head of an effective Germanic league. The 
fear of Austria and her connexions has, for evident reasons, 
subsided, and the Baron Hertzberg, rather a pedant than poli 
tician, but illy fills that great void which was left by the death of 
Frederick. In fact, Prussia seems to be just that country in shape, 
extent, fertility, population, connexion, and relation, which 
one would have chosen to show what great genius can do with 
incompetent materials, and what a dream is human greatness. 

The Emperor is in possession of proofs, that the spirit of re 
volt through all his dominions was fostered by that court, and 
would have broken out in every quarter at the instant of a war. 
Hence the sudden pacification at Reichenback, of which the 
Prussian was the dupe, though he dictated terms. You will read 
ily suppose that Leopold, neither as a man nor a statesman, can 
look on such conduct * in the calm sight of mild philosophy. 
Hereditary claims to dominion, which his rival is possessed of, 
a long opposition of jarring interests, and the bitterness of that 
cup he has just been forced to drink, must lead him to seek and 
to seize the moment of vengeance. Forgiveness is not a fam 
ily feature in the House of Lorraine, neither is Italy the school 
of Christian meekness. On the other hand, the alliance be 
tween him and the late sovereign of this country is rent to tat 
ters. Not formally cancelled, it is effectually annulled. The 
French nation hate the Emperor, and detest a connexion, which 
seems nevertheless to be the wisest that could have been form 
ed. 

The great power of this monarchy has been for centuries an 
insurmountable barrier to imperial ambition. Leopold must 
therefore wish to see it injured, and even dismembered. Ma 
ny of the German princes, who have rights within the bounda 
ries of France, secured to them by numerous treaties, and 
guarantied by the Germanic corps, but lately violated by the 
National Assembly, wish the whole empire to insist on restitu 
tion, and in case of refusal to engage in a war, whose object 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 117 

would be the recovery of Alsace and Lorraine. Many of the 
discontented nobles and clergy of France are urgent with the 
chief of the empire to avenge the insults offered to his unfor 
tunate sister. So fair a pretext, such plausible reasons, both 
public and private, joined to a great political interest and per 
sonal territorial claims, might determine an enterprising prince. 
But he is cautious ; trusting more to art than force. He sits 
on a throne which lately tottered, and is hardly yet confirmed. 
He has before him the example of a predecessor, whose inces 
sant toils brought only an increase of laborious care ; whose 
anxieties wore away the web of his existence ; and whose 
mighty projects were but the * baseless fabric of a vision. 3 
The Germanic body itself is distracted between the duty of 
supporting its members, and a dread of destroying the check 
upon its chief. 

This unhappy country, bewildered in the pursuit of meta 
physical whimsies, presents to our moral view a mighty ruin. 
Like the remnants of ancient magnificence, we admire the ar 
chitecture of the temple, while we detest the false god to whom 
it was dedicated. Daws and ravens, and the birds of night, 
now build their nests in its nitches. The sovereign, humbled to 
the level of a beggar s pity, without resources, without authority, 
without a friend. The Assembly at once a master and a slave, 
new in power, wild in theory, raw in practice. It engrosses 
all functions though incapable of exercising any, and has taken 
from this fierce ferocious people every restraint of religion and 
of respect. Sole executors of the law, and therefore suprerne 
judges of its propriety, each district measures out its obedi 
ence by its wishes, and the great interests of the whole, split 
up into fractional morsels, depend on momentary impulse and 
ignorant caprice. Such a state of things cannot last. 

But how will it end ? Here conjecture may wander through 
unbounded space. What sum of misery may be requisite to 
change popular will, calculation cannot determine. What cir 
cumstances may arise in the order of Divine Providence to give 
direction to that will, our sharpest vision cannot discover. 



118 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

What talents may be found to seize those circumstances, to 
influence that will, and above all to moderate the power which 
it must confer, we are equally ignorant of. One thing only 
seems to be tolerably ascertained, that the glorious opportunity 
is lost, and (for this time at least) the revolution has failed. In 
the consequences of it we may however find some foundation 
of future prosperity. Such are, 1. The abolition of those differ 
ent rights and privileges, which kept the provinces asunder, oc 
casioning thereby a variety of taxation, increasing the expenses 
of collection, impeding the useful communication of commerce, 
and destroying that unity in the system of distributive justice, 
which is one requisite to social happiness. 2. The abolition of 
feudal tyranny, by which the tenure of real property is simpli 
fied, the value reduced to money, rent is more clearly ascer 
tained, and the estimation which depended upon idle vanity, or 
capricious taste, or sullen pride, is destroyed. 3. The exten 
sion of the circle of commerce to those vast possessions held by 
the clergy in mortmain, which conferring great wealth as the 
wages of idleness, damped the ardor of enterprise, and impair 
ed that ready industry, which, increases the stock of national 
riches. 4. The destruction of a system of venal jurisprudence, 
which, arrogating a kind of legislative veto, had established the 
pride and privileges of the few, on the misery and degradation 
of the general mass, 5. Above all, the promulgation and ex 
tension of those principles of liberty, which will, I hope, remain 
to cheer the heart and cherish a nobleness of soul, when the 
metaphysical froth and vapor shall have been blown away. 
The awe of that spirit which has been thus raised, will, I trust, 
excite in those who may hereafter possess authority a proper 
moderation in its exercise, and induce them to give to this 
people a real constitution of government, fitted to the natural, 
moral, social, and political state of their country. 

How and when these events may be brought about I know 
not. But I think from the chaos of opinion, and the conflict 
of its jarring elements, a new order will at length arise, which 
though in some degree the child of chance, may not be less 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 119 

productive of human happiness, than the forethought provi 
sions of human speculation. 

In the beginning of this year I mentioned the conviction that, 
during the course of it, the then ministry would wear out. 
This has been literally verified, and M. de Montmorin is the 
only remaining shred of the old garment. As to the present 
temporary set, I shall say nothing just now, reserving to a bet 
ter opportunity some sentiments on particular men. The ob 
ject of this letter is, as you will observe, to communicate as 
nearly as I can that state of things, which may in a greater or 
smaller degree be forced upon your attention. I must add the 
conviction, that my letters present very different prospects from 
those, which may reach you through other channels. You, who 
know mankind thoroughly, will be able to form a solid opinion ; 
and however that may vary from mine, I shall still rejoice if 
even by the display of false ideas, I shall have cast any addi 
tional light upon those which are true. I am always, &c. 

GOUVERNEQR MORRIS. 



TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Paris, December 1st, 1790. 
Dear Sir, 

I had the honor to address you a letter on the twenty-second 
of last month, in the close of which I mentioned the intention 
of saying at a future period some few words of the people, who 
are now on the stage. To begin then with our friend Lafayette, 
who has hitherto acted a splendid part. The King obeys but 
detests him. He obeys because he fears. Whoever possesses 
the royal person, may do what he pleases with the royal cha 
racter and authority. Hence it happens that the ministers are 
of Lafayette s appointment. A short description of their use 
was given the other day by Mirabeau. { We make ministers, 
said he, as we used formerly to send servants to keep our boxes 
at the playhouse. I gave you the explanation of this jest while 



120 THE TRENCH REVOLUTION. 

I was in London. Lafayette thinks that these his creatures 
will worship their creator, but he is mightily mistaken. 

You know Duportail,* the Minister of War. He is said to be 
violent in favor of the revolution. It is more than a year since I 
have seen him, excepting a short visit of congratulation the oth 
er day. My judgment, therefore, should have little weight ; 
but I believe he is too much the friend of liberty to approve of 
the constitution. For the rest ; he has as you know that com 
mand of himself, and that simplicity of exterior deportmentj 
which carry a man as far as his abilities will reach. He may 
perhaps remember his creator in his ministerial youth, in or 
der that his days may be long in the land of office ; but I ven 
ture to predict, that his duteous observance will not endure one 
half second beyond the moment of necessity. I believe I did not 
mention to you, about a year ago, the intention to appoint him ; 
but at that time I endeavored to take his measure. The min 
ister of the Marine 1 know nothing about. They say he is a 
good kind of man, which is saying very little. The Keeper of 
the Seals, Monsieur Duport-Dutertre, was a lawyer of emi 
nence thrown up into notice by the circumstances of the mo 
ment. He is said to possess both abilities and firmness. Mon 
sieur Delessart, the Minister of the Finances, is rather above 
than below mediocrity, and possesses that kind of civil assent 
which never compromises the possessor, though it seldom tra 
vels in company with greatness. 

There is not a man among them fitted for the great tasks in 
which they are engaged, and greater tasks are perhaps impend 
ing. I have no proofs, but I have a well founded opinion, that 
the leaders of one party wish, what those of the other fear, 
and both expect, viz. the interference of foreign powers. One 
previous step would be to carry off, if possible, the King and 
Queen. The latter at least, for there is every reason to ap-

prehend for their safety, should violent measures be adopted 
while they are here. 

For my own part I do not believe in any such interference, 
neither do I think that the opposers of the Assembly have suf 
ficient energy of character to make a civil war. Their attemptSi 
if any, will, I imagine, be feeble and consequently ruinous to 
themselves. If indeed they had a considerable part of the 
army, commanded by the Prince of Conde, and the person of 
the King in his possession ; and if they came forward to estab 
lish a proper constitution, adopting such good things as the As 
sembly have done, and rejecting the evil ; then indeed there 
would be different grounds of expectation. But I consider this 
rather as the visionary hope of a few, than as the fixed plan of 
persons who can carry it into execution. I am, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Paris, Febuary 26th, 1791. 

Dear Sir, 

I am to acknowledge your favors of the twenty-sixth of No 
vember, and seventeenth of December, which reached me two 
days ago. The system of finance did not indeed fully meet 
my opinions, but I know it is necessary to conform even to the 
prejudices of mankind. I fully believe with you, that any re 
sources dependent on consumption will greatly increase. I be 
lieve this increase will not be merely in proportion to that of 
population, but in the compound ratio of numbers and wealth. 
This last will be abundantly produced by an industrious people 
from a luxuriant soil. Taxation moreover excites industry and 
necessitates economy. It increases also the commercial me 
dium, inasmuch as it creates a domestic object for the applica 
tion of money, and forces an interior circulation. 

Pardon me while on this chapter, for expressing my appre 
hension that the sale of western lands will not produce the present 

VOL. II. 11 



122 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

relief expected, and it will consume a valuable future resource. 
America has not the needful money capital. I put aside tax 
ation, and consider only the three great objects of agriculture, 
manufactures, and commerce. These in populous and polished 
societies present themselves in the order I have just placed 
them ; but this order is inverted with us. Commerce, by more 
potent means, commands a preference. To supply its wants 
a bank is useful, but its operations will not produce all that is 
expected. Among many other reasons, because we have not 
yet a great centre of commerce, finance, and money dealing. 
The payment of interest in the States has a tendency also to 
obviate and impede bank circulation. The channels of com 
merce are not yet duly filled. Those of manufactures are 
scarcely moistened ; those of agriculture are absolutely dry. 
Whenever therefore the government puts up lands for sale, it calls 
money from those objects to which I verily believe it might be 
more advantageously applied. The purchaser calculates, and 
will not part with his cash, till he sees greater benefit than in 
any other appropriation, Under present circumstances the 
hesitation will be whether to purchase stocks or lands. If by 
lowering the price of land you make that the greater tempta 
tion, stocks must fall, and then foreigners will buy them cheap. 
The land if sold cannot be cultivated, but if not sold it cannot 
run away as the stocks do. Besides, by throwing more land 
on the market you ruin those, who have no means to pay debts 
but by sale of real estate, &c. &ic. I quit the discussion and 
indeed beg your pardon for entering into it. 

My letters from London of the 24th and 28th of December 
will have communicated what passed with the British admin 
istration. I am sorry now that I spoke to them, because from 
yours of the 17th of that month I find it was the President s 
pleasure, that no other application should be made, but I flatter 
myself that the manner was such, as by no means to comprom- 
i se the dignity of our country.* 

* The following is an extract from Mr Jefferson s letters of December 
the 17th, here alluded to? 
Since mine to you of August the 12th, yours of July the 3d, August 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 123 

You very kindly, my dear Sir, in that letter communicate the 
President s approbation of rny conduct. I cannot tell you the 
pleasure which this occasions, but you will estimate it by your 
own feelings under similar circumstances. Pardon me for 
adding that I feel highly gratified in receiving the communica 
tion from you. 

In this letter you enclose an order for 2475 florins, on the 
bankers in Holland. Make for me 1 pray you the proper ac 
knowledgements. Pecuniary considerations never yet weigh 
ed with me, where the public service was in question ; and 
therefore immediately on receipt of the President s orders, I 
proceeded, without regarding other objects, as speedily as I 
could to London. Previous engagements had indeed render 
ed it my duty to go to Amsterdam, and on that route I made 
those inquiries which you once desired I would. The result 
has since been occasionally communicated to Mr Short. I 
embarked at Helvoetsluys the twenty-fourth of March, and 
continued in London til) the twenty-fourth of September, al 
though 1 had no business of my own there, but such as I could 
have transacted by letters. I would have staid still longer had 
I imagined it could have been of any use. My expenses dur- 

the 16th, and September the 18th, have come to hand. They suffice 
to remove all doubts, which might have been entertained as to the real 
intentions of the British cabinet, on the several matters confided to you. 
The view of government in troubling you with this business was, ei 
ther to remove from between the two nations all causes of difference, 
by a fair and friendly adjustment, if such was the intention of the other 
party, or to place it beyond a doubt that such was not their intention. In 
result it is clear enough, that further applications would tend to delay 
rather than advance our object. It is therefore the pleasure of the 
President, that no others be made ; and that in whatever state this letter 
may find the business, in that state it be left. I have it in charge at 
the same time to assure you, that your conduct in these communications 
with the British Ministers has met the President s entire approbation, 
and to convey to you his acknowledgements for your services. 

As an attendance on this business must, at times, have interfered with 
your private pursuits, and subjected you also to additional expenses, 
I have the honor to enclose you a draft on our bankers in Holland for 
a thousand dollars, as an indemnification for those sacrifices, 



124 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

ing that period were 489 : 6 : 6 ; but I did not intend to 
ask compensation, nor do I mention them now in that view. 

Since I have been in this city a matter has turned up, which 
is very interesting to America, and the result of which is by no 
means pleasing. I mean the decrees respecting tobacco. 
The second day of this month I was requested to go to Mon 
sieur de Lafayette, and thence with him to speak on that sub 
ject to the Committee of Commerce. I went to his house, but 
declined waiting on the Committee, unless they should previous 
ly desire it. This was fortunate, for the arrangements had 
been so illy made that the Committee did not meet, and for 
little reasons not worth mentioning, some of the members were 
predisposed not to receive information. On the 9th I dined 
with him, in consequence of a note desiring me to confer on 
American business. After dinner Mr Swan, Colonel Walker, 
and I were introduced into his closet with a M. Raymond, and 
another man whose name I forget ; but he was I believe some 
thing in the consulate at New York. Monsieur de Lafayette 
asked our opinion on the question then agitated, respecting a 
free culture of tobacco in France. Mirabeau had moved to 
prohibit it, after a certain time, even in the privileged provinces, 
but Monsieur de Lafayette considered it as standing closely 
connected with the disaffection then prevalent in Alsace. Mr 
Swan gave it as his opinion, that if the free culture was allow 
ed, the introduction of that article from America must speedi 
ly cease. M. Raymond insisted that the culture, if permitted, 
would not be pursued ; but it seemed to me that he did not, 
and indeed could not, think so. The other gentleman was si 
lent. Colonel Walker observed, that he supposed France would 
consult her own interest, and therefore it was not worth while 
to inquire what was the interest of America ; and in this I think 
he judged perfectly well. I refused to give an opinion, but 
stated facts to show that Mr Swan was right in his judgment, 
and then observed that the question seemed to turn on the sin 
gle point, whether they could dispense with the revenue ; for 
if they could not, they must consider the means of obtaining it, 
which were either Duty, Excise, Farm, or Regie. That the 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 125 

first would, if great, be eluded. The second was not now 
practicable ; the third was unfashionable ; and by the last they 
would be cheated. If, however, they would dispense with the 
revenue, then not only they might allow the free culture, but 
they ought to allow the free commerce. I stated the advanta 
ges which would result from the latter. He seemed surprised 
at some things as not having presented themselves, and press 
ed for an opinion, to which I replied, that I would not advise, 
but predict. That they would begin by allowing the free cul 
ture, which would annihilate the revenue ; and in less than two 
years they would prohibit the culture to recover the revenue. 
The thing has turned out as I expected as far as it went. 
Colonel Ternant has endeavored to prevent the culture, and to 
render the commerce as free as possible, but in vain. We 
have held sundry conferences on the subject together. He 
communicated to me what was doing, and I gave him all the 
information I could. The Assembly have allowed the culture, 
and laid a duty of twenty-five livres per quintal upon the im 
port, one fourth of which is taken off from such as may be 
brought from America in French bottoms. This, in addition 
to the heavy duty on our oil, bears hard. To the arguments 
of such as blame these decrees it is answered, that it will be 
necessary to form a commercial treaty with America, and then 
everything can be regulated. 

I had hitherto, you will observe, kept as clear as I could from 
interfering ; but the matter had now put on an appearance, 
which demanded the exertions of every American citizen. On 
the seventeenth, therefore, I called on Monsieur de Lafayette. 
He desired me to give him a note on the subject, siid that 
Mirabeau had promised to speak about it ; and that he expect 
ed the Diplomatic Committee would take the matter up. I had 
been told long before what part Mirabeau would take, and how 
much he would receive for his agency. I asked, therefore, 
whether it would not answer for the king to object, because the 
Assembly being much divided, a trifle would turn the balance, 
and it had been said, that if he would himself have taken a part 
11* 



126 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

in the debate the question would have been otherwise decided, 
He told me he would rather the United States should be in 
debted to the nation than to the king. But if things go on at 
the present rate we shall be indebted to neither. 

The next day I called on the Count de Montmorin, who as 
sured me he would do all in his power. By way of a spur I 
told him, that it was currently reported in London, that the 
British were going to send out a Minister to America, that I 
had good reason to believe it was their wish to form an offensive 
and defensive alliance with us, and presumed that he was ac 
quainted with their intentions. He replied, as I supposed he 
would, in the affirmative. Upon this I asked him whether it 
would answer any good purpose for me to write him a letter on 
the subject. He pressed me earnestly to do so the next day, 
as he was in the evening of it to meet the Diplomatic Committee. 
In consequence I wrote on the nineteenth that of which a 
copy is enclosed. 

You will observe that I hint at the views of Great Britain in 
such manner, that he must take on himself any communication 
of that sort to the Committee. As to the observations, I stated 
them as being made by American citzens in order to supply the 
defect of ministerial character, and also to keep myself out of 
sight, not choosing to be quoted in any of their deliberations. 
I have communicated these steps to Mr Short,* and am now en 
deavoring to obtain, if possible, a duty per arpent on the culture 
equivalent to the import duty, supposing each arpent to produce 
eight quintals. This, which would, I sincerely believe, be use 
less to France, would also prevent the sudden decrease in the 
consumption of our tobacco. And although I am convinced 
that planting it is bad husbandry, yet I wish my countrymen 
rather to correct themselves by their own experience, than re 
ceive such a shock from abroad. 

As yet there is little hope of success to any proposition for 

* See above, page 109, the letter to Mr Short, which is there print 
ed with a wrong date, namely, 1790 instead of 1791. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 127 

alleviating, much less removing, the burthens they have laid 
upon us. The greater part have adopted systematic reason 
ings in matters of commerce as in those of government, so 
that, disdaining attention to facts and deaf* to the voice of 
experience, while others deliberate they decide, and are the 
more constant in their opinions in proportion as they are less 
acquainted with the subject, which is natural enough. Stat pro 
rations voluntas has, you know, been the adage with those, who 
have much of one and little of the other, from time imme 
morial, and the Assembly will not, I think, lose by non-user that 
valuable franchise. 

I will do myself the honor to communicate such farther 
matter as may occur in this regard, and beg leave in the mean 
time to assure you of the sincerity with which I am, &c.

TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Paris, March 9th, 1791, 
Dear Sir, 

I am to acknowledge the receipt of yours of the seventeenth 
of December, which reached me several days ago, but no good 
opportunity then presented itself to convey a reply. * The 

* The following is an extract from General Washington s letter of 
December 17th. 

An official letter from the Secretary of State of this date, ac 
knowledging the receipt of your dispatches on public business, will 
convey to you my sentiments on the views and intentions of the Bri 
tish cabinet. If the exigences of the national affairs of that kingdom 
should excite dispositions in it favorable to a commercial treaty with 
the United States, and to the fulfilment of the treaty of peace, its min 
isters will, of themselves, come forward with propositions. Until these 
are apparent to them, and press, I am persuaded, from the communi 
cations you have had with them, that it is not only useless, but dero 
gatory, to push them any farther on the first point, or to say anything 
more on the second, until we are in a situatiou to speak with more 
decision. 



128 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

idea you formed of the British cabinet was, I am persuaded, 
perfectly just. This government has lately taken some steps, 
which cannot but be advantageous to their rivals, for T am per 
suaded that the late duress laying a heavy duty on oil, giving 
a great preference of duty on tobacco imported in French 
ships, and declaring that none but those built in France shall 
be reputed French bottoms, will excite much ill humor in 
America. Those who rule here seem to think, that because 
the old government was sometimes wrong, everything contrary 
to what they did must be right ; like Jack in the Tale of the 
Tub, who tore his coat to pieces in pulling off the fringe, points, 
and trimmings that Peter had put on. Or like the Old Con 
gress in its young days, which rejected the offer of valuable 
contracts, and employed a host of commissaries and quarter 
masters, because Great Britain dealt with contractors. 

In the debate on this subject one of the Lameths gave it as 
his opinion, that America was not in a situation to be either 
sought or feared for some time to come. This, which is not 
however the sentiment of the party, occasioned some hints in 
the close of the observations I sent to M. de Montmorin, and 
of which a copy has been transmitted to Mr Jefferson. I 
hope that the Congress will not act precipitately in consequence 
of these decrees, for I believe that proper representations in a 
proper moment will produce a change, and really, in the pre 
sent effervescence, very few acts of the Assembly can be con 
sidered as deliberate movements of national will. 



* Congress has commenced its third session. Our affairs assume 
a good aspect. Public credit is high, and stocks have arisen amazing 
ly. Except the disturbances occasioned by a few hostile Indians on 
our western frontier (instigated thereto, I am persuaded, by the British 
traders,) and some remains of the old leven, the wheels of government 
move without interruption, and gather strength as they move. The 
numbers of our people, so far as they can be ascertained by the present 
state of the census, will not fall short, it is said, of five millions ; some 
think more. Whilst this will on the one hand astonish Europe, it 
may on the other add consequence to the union of these Stales. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 129 

There still continue to be three parties here. The Enrages, 
long since known by the name of Jacobins, have lost much in 
the public opinion, so that they are less powerful in the Assem 
bly than they were ; but their Committees of Correspondence, 
(called Societes Patriotiques) spread all over the kingdom, have 
given them a deep, strong hold of the people. On the other 
hand, the numerous reforms, some of them unnecessary and all 
either harsh, precipitate, or extreme, have thrown into the aristo 
cratic party a great number of discontented. The military, who 
as such look up to the sovereign, are somewhat less factious than 
they were, but they are rather a mob than an army, and must, I 
think, fall either to the Aristocratic or Jacobin side of the ques 
tion. 

The middle men are in a whimsical situation. In the Sen 
ate they follow the Jacobin counsels, rather than appear connect 
ed with the other party. The same principle of shame-faced- 
ness operates on great occasions out of doors ; but as the Aris 
tocrats have been forced down by a torrent of opinion from the 
heights of their absurd pretensions, and as the middle men begin 
to be alarmed at the extremities to which they have been hur 
ried, these two parties might come together, if it were not for 
personal animosities among the leaders. This middle party 
would be the strongest, if the nation were virtuous ; but, alas, 
this is not the case, and therefore I think it will only serve as a 
stepping stone for those, who may find it convenient to change 
sides. 

In the midst however of all these confusions, what with con 
fiscating the church property, selling the domains, curtailing 
pensions, and destroying offices, but especially by that great 
liquidater of public debts, a paper currency, this nation is work 
ing its way to a new state of active energy, which will I think 
be displayed as soon as a vigorous government shall establish 
itself. The intervening confusions will probably call forth men 
of talents to form such government and to exert its powers. 

In a letter I had the honor to write on the twenty-second of 
November, I mentioned a treaty made between the Baltic pow-

ers. I do not know whether I drew this idea from information 
or conjecture, but it was in my mind and still continues there. 
While in England waiting at Whitehall for the Duke of Leeds, 
who was accidentally prevented from keeping his appointment, 
I had a long conversation with Mr Burgess, who seemed de 
sirous of convincing me, that he was an efficient man in the of 
fice of Foreign Affairs. I asked him whether such treaty exist 
ed, insinuating that he must certainly be informed of every 
movement in that, as in every other quarter. He assured me 
positively that it did not ; but that assurance did not alter my 
opinion. Indeed the object of my question was to discover, 
whether they were at all upon terms with Sweden, and from 
what afterwards passed, I am persuaded that they are not. I 
must add that my inquiries here have been answered in the 
same way, but yet I believe that such a treaty exists. He 
spoke a good deal of the convention with Spain, and I declared 
freely my opinion, which being favorable to the administration, 
drew from him in support of it a history of the negotiation. It 
ended (as he said) in this remarkable manner. The Count de 
Florida Blanca, upon hearing of the revolt of the French Marine, 
told the British Ambassador ; You insist on the terms to which 
I am now about to agree, not because they are just, but be 
cause I am compelled to it. If France would assist us I would 
never submit ; but we are not able singly to cope with you, and 
therefore you must do as you please. You will judge, my 
dear Sir, how long such a treaty is likely to last. 

I am delighted with the account you give me of our public 
affairs. There can be no doubt that a publication of the cen 
sus, and a clear state of our finances, will impress a sense of 
our importance on the statesmen of Europe. We are now get 
ting forward in the right way, not by little skirmishing advantages 
of political manoeuvres, but in a solid column of well formed na 
tional strength. Like Father Mason s aristocratic screw, which 
you doubtless remember, at every turn we shall now gain and 
hold what we get. It is no evil that you should have a little of 
the old leven. I have always considered an opposition in free 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 131 

governments as a kind of outward conscience, which prevents 
the administration from doing many things through inadvertence, 
which they might repent of. By these means both men and 
measures are sifted, and the necessity of appearing as well as of 
being right confirms and consolidates the good opinion of so 
ciety. I expect and am indeed certain, that this good opinion 
will live with you during life, and follow weeping to your grave. 
I know you will continue to deserve it, and I hope you may long 
live to vex your enemies by serving your country. I am, &c.

TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Paris, March 16th, 1791. 

Dear Sir, 

I had the honor to write to you on the twenty-sixth of last 
month, to which I now refer. Since that period the Assembly 
have taken another step in the same disagreeable road. They 
have deprived all ships other than those built in France of the 
privilege of French bottoms. This, added to the other .duress 
already noticed, produces, I am told, much sensation among 
the few Americans who are settled in the ports of this king 
dom. 

You will find enclosed herein a copy of the note, which I gave 
to the Marquis de Lafayette. He told me in conversation 
when I urged his interference, that by so doing he should in 
jure us, because his enemies had already voted against us, 
contrary to their general opinion, merely to vex and injure 
him. This is very unfortunate.* I am, &c,

* An extract from a letter to Robert Morris, dated March 13th, gives 
a further explanation on this subject. 

When the matter was taken up the culture was permitted, and such 
a heavy duty laid as would secure an immense profit to those, who 
had purchased up the tobacco on speculation ; then came the difference 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Paris, May 27th 1791. . 

Dear Sir, 

I have the honor to enclose a letter and sundry papers relat 
ing to it, from Messieurs Shweizer, Jeannerst & Co. I have 
referred these gentlemen to Mr Short, telling them that it is 
most fitting in many respects that they should apply to him. 

As it is possible, however, that this business may come before 
you, I think it a duty to convey some observations which occur 
to me, and which may not perhaps strike you, because matters 
of that sort have not, I believe, much occupied your attention. 
Previous thereto I beg leave, however, to give you a history of 
my acquaintance with it. In a letter to Colonel Hamilton, of the 
31st of January, 1790, 1 mentioned what had passed between M. 
Necker and me respecting the debt due by the United States to 
France, and I hinted the means of turning to useful account a 
very precipitate step of the public agents in Holland. About 
this time I received your orders to communicate with the British 
ministers, and although I did by no means consider that in the 



of duty on American ships, without any particular object except to 
punish Lafayette. This may seem a strange reason, but it is a true 
one. The Aristocrats, as such, are his enemies, and those who wished 
to preserve the valuable revenue upon toba,cco were mortified, at see 
ing it thrown away in the manner I have related. Some of my par 
ticular acquaintances in the Assembly, to whom I mentioned the ill 
policy of these decrees, assured me that they would not have been 
passed had Monsieur de Lafayette, who was present, opposed them ; 
but he being there, they left him to step forward, it being as it were his 
particular business ; and he being silent, they were taken by surprise , 
whereas had he been absent they would certainly have made head, and 
obtained an adjournment at least. The exclusion of our ships, also, 
from being admitted as French bottoms, arises from the same desire to 
show that his support of America is useless, and at the same time they 
have circulated that he prefers America to France, in consequence of 
which he is afraid to do anything pointed, lest he should lose his 
popularity. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 133 

light of an appointment to office, yet from motives of delicacy I 
determined to extricate myself from the affairs of the debt, as 
speedily as I could with propriety. Various applications were 
made to me from different quarters, to which I replied evasive 
ly ; but in my arrival in this city last November, I informed 
nhe parties that I had reasons of a private nature, which deter 
red me from holding any share in their speculation. I con 
versed with Mr Short on the same subject, and communicated 
to him confidentially my reasons for declining an interest, as 
well as my opinion respecting the use which might be derived 
from such negotiation. 

A few days after the President of the Committee of Finance, 
happening to meet me at the Count de Montmorin s, mention 
ed some proposals then before them, which to the best of my 
remembrance were extravagant I declined giving an opinion 
without previously seeing and considering the terms, upon 
which he and M. de Montmorin agreed together, that before 
anything was concluded the various propositions which might 
be made should be submitted to my examination. Here the 
thing dropped, and the enclosed papers show the reason why, 
for it appears from them that a bargain was made shortly after 
by the Controleur General with a different company. Mr 
Short mentioned this to me on his return hither in the end of 
March, telling me that the parties concerned were, as he was 
informed in Amsterdam, men of no credit nor capital. 1 of 
course agreed with him in opinion, that if so, it was not worth 
while to listen to them. 

A few days after one of them called on me, and after giv 
ing a history of the affair, begged me to make use of my good 
offices. I told him at once that it was ridiculous to ask a com 
mission of five per cent on changing the nature of our debt. 
That it was quite as convenient to owe France as to owe the 
subjects of France ; and further, that before any treaty was of 
fered, persons of credit and capital should appear. As soon 
as I made this last observation, he drew out the letter of the 
Comptroller General, and showing me the second clause of it, 

VOL. II. 12 



134 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

replied; that after what was there contained no man had a right 
to question the solidity of the society. He then added, that 
for my private satisfaction he would prove that people of the 
first fortune were connected therein, and indeed he gave me 
such proof. I told him upon this, that they must apply to 
Mr Short, or to their own ministry, whose support would be 
much more efficacious than the sentiments of any private in 
dividual. I mentioned nevertheless to Mr Short, the substance 
of this conversation. While he was in the country the enclos 
ed letter was received. He returned to town yesterday, and 
called on me in the evening, when I communicated to him the 
purport of it. 

I have ever been of opinion, that as we are not in condition 
to pay our debt to France, a bargain by which the period can 
be prolonged, without loss to either party, is desirable. I say 
without loss, because the conduct of this nation has been so 
generous to us, that it would be very ungrateful indeed to take 
advantage of those necessities, which the succor afforded to 
America has occasioned. Such bargain must be either with 
the government or with individuals. But after the repeated 
delays on our part, to ask longer time would not look well. 
Indeed no such treaty could be made without the consent of 
the Assembly, and their observations would not be pleasant. 
A bargain with individuals has the advantage of bringing in 
the aid of private interest to the support of our credit, and 
what is of very great consequence, it would leave us at liberty 
to make use of that credit for the arrangement of our domestic 
affairs. And on this head I must mention to you, my dear 
Sir, that it has been my good fortune to prevent some publi 
cations, which would have been particularly injurious to us. 
Their object was to complain of the United States for specu 
lating in their own effects with the funds of France ; urging that 
while we owed heavy instalments already due here, all the 
loans we obtain in Holland ought to be applied to the dis 
charge of them, and therefore that the speculations in our do 
mestic debt were a double violation of good faith, &ic. &c. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 135 

The present state of things here has occasioned so great a 
fall in the exchange, that money borrowed in Holland is re 
mitted with great gain, consequently loans made there just 
now answer well, and it is evident that the parties, who are 
endeavoring to contract, count on a considerable profit from 
that circumstance. Much however is to be said on this part 
of the subject. 

First, it is questionable whether our reputation may not be 
a little affected, for you will recollect that about one third of 
our debt to France arose from a loan made on our account in 
Holland of five millions of florins, for which the King paid us here 
ten millions of livres, without any deduction for charges of any 
sort. The nation is now obliged to pay this five millions in 
Holland, and for us to borrow that amount there, and then 
squeeze them in an exchange, which distresses both their com 
merce and finances, looks hard. There was a good deal of 
murmuring about it when the last operation of 1,500,000 guil 
ders took place, and I should not be at all surprised if some 
patriot, by way of showing his zeal, should make a violent at 
tack in the Assembly when the next payment is made. There 
are many of these patriots, who if they can inculpate ministers 
and distress those of different sentiments, do not care a jot for 
consequences. 

But supposing this not to happen, it is not possible for a 
nation to make the advantage, which individuals do in such 
things, because they must employ individuals, each of whom 
will be too apt to look a little to his own advantage. There is 
a difference also between the gain made upon parts, and that 
which would arise on the whole, for even if we could borrow all 
at once so large a sum, there can be no doubt that the remit 
tance of it hither would greatly alter the exchange. But it is 
not possible to borrow it speedily, and the present unnatural 
state of things will, in all probability, be changed. In fact the 
leading characters are very seriously alarmed at it. If their 
paper currency should be either redeemed, or annihilated, 
or abolished tomorrow, the exchange would immediately turn 
in favor of France, and then we should lose on remittances. 



136 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION". 

So much for this affair in its little details ; but there is a 
great view of it, which forcibly strikes my mind. If we were at 
liberty to turn all our efforts towards our domestic debt, we 
sheuld by raising its value prevent speculations, which are very 
injurious to the country, if not to the government. Millions 
have already been bought at a low price, and afterwards negotia 
ted in Europe. Neither is that all, for if we can borrow at 
five per cent and buy up our six per cent debt at par, we gain 
at once by that operation one fifth of the interest, or twenty per 
cent, which, besides all the other good consequences, is much 
more than ever we shall get by any management of our debts 
on this side of the water. 

I have given you, my dear Sir, these hints in abridgement, 
because my time will not admit of dilating them ; attribute them, 
I pray you, to the true cause, and believe me always very sin 
cerely yours, 

GouvEitNEUR MORRIS. 



TO ROBERT MORRIS. 

Paris, July 16th, 1791. 

My Dear Friend, 

My last was from London of the twenty- eighth of June. The 
latest I have received from you is of the third of May. You 
will have heard, through various channels, of the King s escape 
from the Tuileries. By the bye, he was said to be in perfect 
liberty there ; but yet our good friend Lafayette was very near 
being hanged because he got away, and his justification tends 
to show, that his Majesty, besides his parole given, was so close 
ly watched that he had but little chance of getting off unobserv 
ed. 

This step was a very foolish one. Public affairs were in 
such a situation, that, if he had been quiet, he would have soon 
been master, because the anarchy, which prevails, would have 
shown the necessity of conferring more authority, and because 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 137 

it is not possible so to balance a single Assembly against a Prince, 
but that one must prove too heavy for the other, or too light for 
the business. 

The Assembly also, very strongly suspected of corrupt prac 
tices, was falling fast in the public estimation. His departure 
changed everything ; and now the general wish seems to be for 
a republic, which is quite in the natural order of things. Yes 
terday the Assembly decreed, that the King, being inviolable, 
could not be involved in the accusations to be made against 
those concerned in his evasion. This has excited much heat 
against them. The people are now assembling on the occasion, 
and the militia (many of them opposed to the King) are out. 
As I lodge near the Tuileries, it is far from improbable, that 
I shall have a battle under my windows. The vanguard of the 
populace is to be formed by two or three thousand women. 
A good smart action would, I think, be useful rather than per 
nicious. 

But the great evil arises from a cause not easily re 
moved. It will, I think, be scarcely possible to confer authori 
ty on, or in other words to obtain obedience for, a man, who 
has entirely forfeited the public opinion ; and, if they lay him 
aside, I do not see how they are to manage a regency. His 
brothers are abroad, and so is the Prince of Conde. The 
Duke of Orleans is loaded with universal contempt ; and if they 
should name a council of regency, they would be obliged to 
take either feeble or suspected characters. Add to this the 
struggle, which must arise in a state where there is a King de 
throned, and that for trivial causes. At the same time, the state 
of their finances is detestable, and growing worse everyday. 
They have passed a law against emigrations, although by their 
bill of rights, every man has a right to go where he pleases. 
But this, you know, is the usual fate of bills of rights. How 
long the restrictions may continue is uncertain. I am, &c.

133 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 



TO ROBERT MORRIS. 

Paris, July 20th, 1791, 

My Dear Friend, 

My last was of the sixteenth. The riot of that day went off 
pretty easily, but the next morning two men were lanterned 
and mangled in the Parisian taste. This occasioned some 
little stir. There had been a pretty general summons to the 
friends of liberty, requesting them to meet in the Champ de 
Mars. The object of this meeting was to persuade the As 
sembly, by the gentle influence of the cord, to undo what they 
had done respecting the imprisoned monarch. As the differ 
ent ministers and municipal officers had received it in charge 
from the Assembly, to maintain peace and see to the execu 
tion of the laws, they made proclamation and displayed the 
red flag. 

In coming from the British Ambassador s, about seven in the 
evening, I met a detachment of the militia with the red flag 
flying, and some of the civil officers. I went shortly after 
wards to a height to see the battle ; but it was over before I 
got to the ground ; for as the militia would not, as usual? 
ground their arms on receiving the word of command from the 
mob, this last began, according to custom, to pelt them with 
stones. It was hot weather, arid Sunday afternoon, for which 
time, according to usage immemorial, the inhabitants of this 
capital have generally some pleasurable engagement. To be 
disappointed in their amusement, to be paraded through the 
streets under a scorching sun, and then stand like holiday 
turkeys to be knocked down by brickbats, was a little more 
than they had patience to bear ; so that, without waiting for 
orders, they fired and killed a dozen or two of the ragged 
regiment. The rest ran off like lusty fellows. - 

If the militia had waited for orders, they might,. I fancy, 
have been all knocked down, before they received any. As 
it is, the business went off pretty easily. Some of them have 
since been assassinated, but not above five or six, as far as I 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 139 

can learn. Lafayette was very near being killed in the morn 
ing ; but the pistol snapped at his breast. The assassin was 
immediately secured, but he ordered him to be discharged. 
These are things on which no comment is necessary. I think 
we shall be quiet here a little while ; but it is possible enough, 
that seizing some plausible occasion, a violent effort will be 
made, and then, if the militia succeed, order will be estab- 
ed. Adieu. I am very truly and affectionately yours, 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



GEORGE WASHINGTON TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

Philadelphia, July 28(h, 1791. 
Dear Sir, 

The communications in your several letters, relative to the 
state of affairs in Europe, are very gratefully received ; and I 
should be glad if it were in my power to reply to them more in 
detail than I am able to do. But my public duties, which are 
at all times sufficiently numerous, being now much accumulated 
by an absence of more than three month? from the seat of gov 
ernment, make the present a very busy moment for me. 

The change of systems, which have so long prevailed in Eu 
rope, will, undoubtedly, affect us in a degree proportioned to 
our political or commercial connexions with the several na 
tions of it. But I trust we shall never so far lose sight of our 
own interest and happiness as to become, unnecessarily, a par 
ty in their political disputes. Our local situation enables us to 
maintain that state, with respect to them, which otherwise could 
not, perhaps, be preserved by human wisdom. The present 
moment seems pregnant with great events ; but, as you ob 
serve, it is beyond the ken of mortal foresight to determine 
what will be the result of those changes, which are either mak 
ing, or contemplated, in the general system of Europe. Al 
though as fellow men we sincerely lament the disorders, op 
pressions, and incertitude, which frequently attend national 



140 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 

events, and which our European brethren must feel, yet we 
cannot but hope, that it will terminate very much in favor of 
the rights of man. And that a change there, will be favora 
ble to this country, I have no doubt. For under the former 
system we were seen either in the distresses of war, or viewed 
after the peace in a most unfavorable light through the medi 
um of our distracted state. In neither point could we appear 
of much consequence among nations. And should affairs con 
tinue in Europe in the same state they were, when these im 
pressions respecting us were received, it would not be an ea 
sy matter to remove the prejudices imbibed against us. A 
change of system will open a new view of things, and we shall 
then burst upon them, as it were, with redoubled advantages. 

Should we, under the present state of affairs, form connex 
ions, other than we now have, with any European powers, 
much must be considered in effecting them, on the score of our 
increasing importance as a nation ; and at the same time, should 
a treaty be formed with a nation, whose circumstances may not 
at this moment be very bright, much delicacy would be neces 
sary in order to show that no undue advantages were taken on 
that account. For unless treaties are mutually beneficial to 
the parties, it is vain to hope for a continuance of them beyond 
the moment when the one, which conceives itself overreached, 
is in a situation to break off the connexion. And I believe it 
is among nations as with individuals, that the party taking ad 
vantage of the distresses of another will lose infinitely more in 
the opinion of mankind, and in subsequent events, than it will 
gain by the stroke of the moment. 

In my late tour through the southern States, I experienced 
great satisfaction in seeing the good effects of the general gov 
ernment in that part of the union. The people at large have 
felt the security which it gives, and the equal justice which it 
administers to them. The farmer, the merchant, and the 
mechanic have seen their several interests attended to, and 
from thence they unite in placing a confidence in their repre 
sentatives, as well as in those in whose hands the execution of 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 141 

the laws is placed. Industry has there taken place of idle 
ness, and economy of dissipation. Two or three years of 
good crops, and a ready market for the produce of their lands, 
have put every one in good humor ; and in some instances they 
even impute to the government what is due only to the good 
ness of Providence. 

The establishment of public credit is an immense point 
gained in our national concerns. This, I believe, exceeds the 
expectation of the most sanguine among us. And a late in 
stance, unparalleled in this country, has been given of the con 
fidence reposed in our measures, by the rapidity with which 
the subscriptions to the Bank of the United States were filled. 
In two hours after the books were opened by the commission 
ers, the whole number of shares was taken up, and four thou 
sand more applied for, than were allowed by the institution ; 
besides a number of subscriptions which were coming on. 
This circumstance was not only pleasing, as it related to the 
confidence in government, but as it exhibited an unexpected 
proof of the resources of our citizens. 

In one of my letters to yoiij the account of the number of 
inhabitants, which would probably be found in the United 
States on enumeration, was too large. The estimate was 
then founded on the ideas held out by the gentlemen in Con 
gress of the population of the several States, each of whom (as 
was very natural) looking through a magnifier would speak of 
the greatest extent, to which there was any probability of their 
numbers reaching. Returns of the census have already been 
made from several of the States, and a tolerably just estimate 
has been now formed in others ; by which it appears, that we 
shall hardly reach four millions ; but this you are to take along 
with it, that the real number will greatly exceed the official 
return^ because, from religious scruples, some would not give 
in their lists ; from an apprehension that it was intended as 
the foundation of a tax, others concealed, or diminished theirs ; 
and from the indolence of the mass, and want of activity in 
many of the deputy enumerators, numbers are omitted. The 



142 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

authenticated number will, however, be far greater, I believe, 
than has ever been allowed in Europe ; and will have no 
small influence in enabling them to form a more just opinion 
of our present growing importance, than has yet been enter 
tained there. 

This letter goes with one from the Secretary of State, to 
which I must refer you for what respects your public transac 
tions, and I shall only add to it the repeated assurances of 
regard and affection, with which I am, dear Sir, 
Your obedient and obliged, 

GEORGE WASHINGTON. 



TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Paris, September 30th, 1791. 

Dear Sir, 

Mr Short has delivered to me within these few days your 
favor of the twenty-eighth of July. I cannot express to you 
what I felt on reading it. The view which it gives of our pros 
perity as a nation swelled my bosom with emotions, which none 
can know but those who have experienced them. The won 
derful change, which has been effected in our affairs by the 
operation of the general government, has exceeded the pre 
dictions of its warmest friends. How great a source of joy is 
this to those, who have been at all instrumental in its forma 
tion and establishment ; those especially to whom Providence 
in its bounty has imparted a sincere affection for their fellow 
men. Yes, my dear Sir, man is not merely a selfish, nor a 
material being, and I attest your heart to witness the truth 
from the conviction of its own feelings. 

The King has at length, as you will have seen, accepted the 
new constitution, and been in consequence liberated from his ar 
rest. It is a general and almost universal conviction that this con 
stitution is inexecutable. The makers to a man condemn it. Judge 
what must be the opinion of others. Mr Short will doubtless 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 143 

forward all the public documents respecting it, and therefore 
1 shall not trouble you with any of them. His majesty is to 
go in about an hour hence to close the session of the National 
Assembly, and then they leave the field to their successors. 
His present business is to make himself popular ; indeed his life 
and crown depend upon it ; for the constitution is such, that he 
must soon be more or less than he is at present, and fortunate 
ly he begins to think so, but unfortunately his advisers have 
neither the sense nor the spirit, which the occasion calls for. 

The new Assembly, as far as can at present be determined, 
is deeply imbued with republican or rather democratical princi 
ples. The southern part of this kingdom is in the same dis 
position. The northern is ecclesiastical in its temper. The 
eastern is attached to Germany, and would gladly be reunited 
to the empire. Normandy is aristocratical. and so is part of 
Britany. The interior part of the kingdom is monarchical. 
This map is (you may rely on it) just, for it is the result of great 
and expensive investigations made by government, and I think 
you will be able by the help of it, and of the few observations 
which precede it, fully to understand many things, which would 
not otherwise perhaps be so easily unriddled. You doubtless 
recollect that the now expiring Assembly was convened to ar 
range the finances, and you will perhaps be surprised to learn, 
that after consuming church property to the amount of one 
hundred millions sterling, they leave this department much 
worse than they found it. Such however is the fact, and the 
chance now is, in my opinion, rather for than against a bank 
ruptcy. 

The aristocrats, who are gone and going in great numbers to 
join the refugee princes, believe sincerely in a coalition- of the 
powers of Europe to reinstate their sovereign in his ancient 
authorities ; but I believe they are very much mistaken. Noth 
ing of consequence can be attempted this year, and many things 
may happen before the month of June next, were the several 
potentates in earnest. I am led to imagine, that their views are 
very different from those which are now assigned to them, and 



144 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

it is very far from impossible that the attempt, if any, will, so 
far as France is concerned, be confined to a dismemberment. 
The weak side of this kingdom, as matters now stand, is Flan 
ders ; but were the provinces of Alsace, Lorraine, French Flan 
ders, and Artois rent away, the capital would be constantly ex 
posed to the visits from an enemy. These provinces were, you 
know, acquired at an immense expense of blood and treasure, 
and if Louis the Fourteenth could have succeeded in making 
the Rhine his boundary, from Switzerland to the ocean, he 
would have obtained the advantages almost of an insular position. 
Indeed it is difficult to abstain from the wish, that the countries 
included within that boundary were united under a free efficient 
government, since it would, in all human probability, be the 
means of dispensing the blessings of freedom in no distant pe 
riod to all Europe. But on this subject it is now permitted to 
a rational being to form rather wishes than hopes, much less 
expectations. 

I will enclose herein a note just now received of the latest 
intelligence from Coblentz. It is written by the Prince de 
Conde to his confidential friend here, and is accompanied by 
the request that all French gentlemen, capable of actual service, 
will immediately repair to the standard of royalty beyond the 
Rhine, or rather on the banks of that river. To the troops 
mentioned in this note are added by the counter revolutionists 
here 15,000 Hessians and 16,000 French refugees, so that 
exclusively of what the Emperor may bring forward, they mus 
ter an army, on paper, of 100,000 men. The Emperor has 
about 5,000 men in the low countries. But all these appear 
ances, and the proposed Congress of Ambassadors at Aix la 
Chapelle, do not in the least change my opinion, that nothing 
serious will be attempted this year. 

M. de Montmorin has resigned, and the Count de Moustier 
is named as his successor, but whether he will accept seems to 
be very doubtful. He is now at Berlin, and as he is an inti 
mate of M. de Calonne, who is one mainspring of the count 
er revolution, he is, I presume, in the secret of what may be 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 145 

really in agitation. This on one side ; and on the other an 
office, the power and authority of which are just nothing at all; 
for you will observe, that by the new constitution every treaty 
and convention whatever must be submitted to the investiga 
tion of the Assembly to be by them accepted or rejected. 

You will have seen I suppose, ere this arrives, what has been 
done here respecting the colonies. It is supposed that, they 
will be perfectly satisfied, because their internal legislation is 
left to themselves ; but 1 much doubt this, for their com 
merce, which involves their existence, is left entirely at the 
mercy of the Assembly, which will not be over attentive to their 
interests, when they fall into competition with those of the 
mother country. 

I send out to Mr Morris a bundle of pamphlets written 
here by a M. de Cormere, according to hints and observations 
which I furnished to him. Mr Morris will give you one, and 
you will see that it was calculated to produce a liberal system of 
colonial government, beneficial to them and to us. In order 
to bring it about, it was proposed that commissioners should be 
sent out with full powers to treat with the colonial Assemblies, 
and could that have been carried, this pamphlet would have 
been the groundwork of the instructions. The proposition was 
rejected, but as it is more than probable, that the colonies will 
have had a full taste of the sweets of free trade before the 
troubles are composed, and as they will have learnt that fear 
can produce what reason could not, I do expect that at length 
this government must come into some such measure, and there 
by not only the stumbling block will be taken out of the way 
to a useful treaty between France and the United States, but 
at the same time, and by the same means, the road will be laid 
open for solid connexion with Great Britain. 

In all cases we have the consolation, that if the powers of 
Europe by their excluding principles deprive us of the need 
ful vent for our produce, which becomes daily more and more 
abundant, we shall, from the cheapness of living and of raw 
materials, which results from that circumstance, make great and 

VOL. II. 13 



146 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

rapid progress in useful manufactures. This alone is wanting 
to complete our independence. We shall then be, as it were, 
a world by ourselves, and far from the jars and wars of Europe, 
their various revolutions will serve merely to instruct and 
amuse ; like the roaring of a tempestuous sea, which at a cer 
tain distance becomes a pleasing sound. 

Farewell, my dear Sir ; that you may be well and happy is 
the sincere wish of yours, &tc. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Paris, October 3d, 1791. 

Dear Sir, 

I am favored with yours of the twenty-sixth of July, * for 
which I pray you to accept my thanks. I mentioned to you 
from London, that Mr Walpole had been offered the place of 
Envoy Extraordinary to the United States, which he had refus 
ed. I took care to avoid any sort of intercourse with the 
government while I was there, and of course could not possess 
any minute information worthy of your notice. I avoided also 
seeing any of the chiefs of opposition, lest some conclusions of 
a disagreeable nature should be drawn from that circumstance. 
Of course it was not until my arrival in this city, that I learnt 
(from the British Ambassador here) what had been done. 
Mr Hammond was sent for from Spain, and passed through 
this city while I was in London. I do not know whether he 
is gonfc out ; if not, you have long since I suppose received the 
communication of his appointment. The plan seerns to have 
been that which I long since mentioned, viz. the sending out a 
minister with letters of credence in his pocket, to be delivered 
when you shall appoint one to their court. 

From a variety of small circumstances I am convinced, that 



* See Jefferson s Wiitings, Vol. iii. p. 115. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 147 

the British cabinet begins very seriously to consider its situa 
tion in respect to us. The rapid rise of our credit, the wise 
decisions of our courts, the general peace and order which 
prevail, and the gradual display of our population, wealth, and 
industry, produce very great effect upon their minds. Let 
me add that the calm dignity of those, who are at the head of 
our affairs, has a considerable influence. Events confirm me 
in the opinion, which I formed from an attentive consider 
ation of the subject, and I think we may calculate almost with 
certainty on forming a good treaty with that country, as soon as 
they shall determine to form any treaty ; and until that time, 
I agree fully with you, that attempts on our part should be such 
only, as to justify to the world that conduct which it becomes 
us to pursue. I know that among the many, whose duty or 
occupation it may be to consider this subject, there must be a 
variety of opinions, because dispositions differ, because prejudi 
ces exist, because interests sway, in a word, because men are 
men ; but Time will set his seal of truth on that which is right. 
I am, &tc. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO ROBERT MORRIS. 

Paris, October 10th, 1791. 
My Dear Friend. 

The people of this city are become wonderfully fond of the 
King, and have a thorough contempt for the Assembly, who 
are, in general, what used to be called in Philadelphia, the blue 
stockings. There is, however, this difference between the 
two capitals, that with you virtuous poverty is respected, but 
here splendor is indispensable. Judge the consequence, and 
to enlighten that judgment, know that at this moment they 
stand on the brink of bankruptcy, which can only be avoided 
by increasing the vigor of the executive magistrate. This 
becomes daily more and more apparent ; and Paris exists, as 
it were, on the interest of the national debt. 



148 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

These facts will enable you to understand, why the other 
evening at the Italian comedy, as it is called, the parterre, or 
people, cried out continually Vive le Roy; Vive la Heine; 
Vive, la famille royale. Sire, vive votre Majeste. These 
words, Sire and JWajeste, were, you know, proscribed by the 
Assembly, which was obliged, by a strong expression of the 
popular sentiment, to retract that decree the very next day. 
A patriot, in the midst of this acclamation, took it into his 
head to cry Vive la Nation, but the rest silenced him imme 
diately. 

Now, my dear friend, this is the very same people who, 
when the King was brought back from his excursion, whipped 
a democratical Dutchess of my acquaintance, because they 
heard only the last part of what she said, which was, 11 nefaut 
pas dire, vive le Roi. She had the good sense to desire the 
gentleman, who was with her, to leave her. Whipping is, you 
know, an operation which a lady would rather undergo among 
strangers, than before her acquaintance. 

The provinces are not as yet in the same disposition with 
the capital, and I think they will not be so for a long time to 
come. But accidents may happen to change either the one 
or the other, and it is difficult to decide with precision on a 
people and situation so fluctuating and inconstant. I am, &ic. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Paris, December 27th, 1791. 
Dear Sir, 

Your favor of the 12th of September reached me a few days 
ago. In the proposition of S. J. and Co. I saw the means of 
saving somewhat to the United States, without incurring the 
odium of a payment in depreciated paper ; but since a de-^ 
termination to pay in value is adopted, I heartily and en 
tirely approve of the rejection of their offer. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 149 

Before the receipt of your letter Mr Short communicated to 
me, in general terms, the intention to make good the deprecia 
tion on the money paid here before, and told me at the same 
time that it seemed to be in contemplation to pay in specie, 
about which he felt himself much embarrassed ; for in that 
case there would be a loss of about five per cent, which, with 
the commissions on loans, &tc. &tc. would increase the debt 
about one tenth, instead of paying it with advantage. And 
this arises from a circumstance which is, I believe, the com 
mon attendant of paper money, viz. that specie is higher in 
proportion than foreign exchanges. 

This will be best understood by assigning what I conceive 
to be the cause of that difference. I begin by rejecting the 
theories of speculative men, who suppose that bills of exchange 
are drawn and purchased for payment of -reciprocal debts, and 
the like. I reject equally the stock-jobbing operations of 
bankers, and confining my view to the ordinary course of 
things, I observe, that when a man purchases in France goods 
which are to be sold in England, he pays for those goods by 
the proceeds of bills drawn on England, and as he makes the 
acquisition of the goods with a view to the future sales, he 
governs himself by the usual price of such goods in the coun 
try to which they are to be sent. 

The rate of exchange, therefore, enters into his consideration 
only so far as by means thereof the price he is to pay for his 
goods may be affected. On the other hand, he who has 
bought goods on credit in England, which he vends in France, 
regards the exchange only in so far as it governs the price at 
which he must sell his goods. Thus the pound sterling being 
worth about twenty-five livres, if the exchange is at thirty livres 
for the pound sterling, he must advance one fifth, or twenty 
per cent on the price of English goods ; and for the same 
reason, the English agent can afford to give an advance of 
twenty per cent on French wines. Now in proportion as the 
price of English goods advances, the consumption of them 
lessens, and consequently the purchase of bills on London to 
13* 



150 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

pay for them diminishes ; and in proportion as the exchange 
advances, which is of course a decrease in the the real price of 
French goods, the purchase of them increases, and of course 
the sale of bills on London to pay for them, and thus the de 
preciation of the paper currency checks, by eventual operation, 
its immediate effect on foreign exchange. 

But the price of specie depends on a different cause. 
Specie, in a time of peace and good government, is but the 
sign of vveahh, and not the substance ; so that no more of it is 
found in a country, than is necessary for the interchange of 
those commodities, which form the real wealth of such country. 
And by the bye it follows, that in proportion to the degree of 
credit resulting from a vigorous execution of good laws, the 
necessity of money decreases, and it becomes plentiful by the 
prevalence of confusion, without any actual increase or decrease 
of the mass. But w r hen a paper circulation is forced forward, 
prudent men first, and all men afterwards, desire to realize 
this property. Land is not always a convenient object for 
this purpose, because the subsequent sale is difficult, and 
merchandises are objectionable from their bulk and decay. 
The precious metals, therefore, naturally obtain a preference, 
and as their quantity is by no means proportionate to the real 
wealth of the country, their price is increased more rapidly 
than that of other things. But the foreign merchant, observing 
this advance, declines drawing bills unless he can get some 
thing near the price which his coin, if brought into the coun 
try, would produce, and thus the exchange follows the price 
of coin in the course of depreciation instead of preceding it. 
If I were to hazard a conjecture, as to the corollary of this 
reasoning, it would be that the quantity of the precious metals 
rather increases than diminishes in a country where paper 
money circulates. 

I make no apology for this digression, because if it conveys 
no information, it tends at least to explain one fact, and to 
place some others in a different light from that in which they 
are usually viewed. To return then to the subject of your let- 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 151 

ter, I must tell you, that about the same time that Mr Short s 
despatches arrived, a plan was imagined by the colonists of St 
Domingo and proposed to the administration, for repairing the 
ravages committed by their slaves in the late insurrection, by 
appropriating to that purpose the debt of the United States to 
France. One of them came to converse with me on the sub 
ject ; but supposing it to be some new scheme of speculation, 
I refused to listen to him. A few days after, however, the 
Minister of the Marine told me that he had sent him, and de 
sired me to consider the matter and see if something could not 
be done. In consequence of this I mentioned to Mr Short, 
who is now in Holland, a plan which appeared to me useful to 
the two countries ; and before his departure we agreed on cer 
tain principles to govern in that business, conformably to which 
the minister is now acting. I shall send you his address to 
the Assembly on the subject, and if the thing he has in view is 
effected, I will detail it to you ; if not, I will spare you the pe 
rusal of so much useless writing. 

As to the state of things here, I would convey it to you as 
fully as propriety will admit ; but I know not yet by what op 
portunity this letter will go, and the Post Office was never 
more abused under the most despotic ministers than it is at 
present, notwithstanding the decrees to the contrary. Every 
letter I receive bears evident marks of patriotic curiosity. 
This anxious spirit of pettifogging villany proves the fear of 
those who make use of it ; and truly they have reason to fear, 
for every day proves more clearly that their new constitution 
is good for notliing. 

Those, whom I had warned in season of the mischiefs they 
were preparing, endeavor, now that it is too late, to lay the 
blame on others by way of excusing themselves, but the truth 
is that instead of seeking the public good by doing what was 
right, each sought his own advantage by flattering the public 
opinion. They dare not now propose the amendments, which 
they perceive and acknowledge to be indispensable. They 
have besides no confidence in each other, for every one feels 



152 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

a reason against it, and meets moreover with daily proofs that 
his copatriots are no better than himself. 

The Assembly (as you who know such bodies will naturally 
suppose) commits every day new follies, and if this unhappy 
country be not plunged anew into the horrors of despotism, it 
is not their fault. They have lately made a master stroke to 
that effect. They have resolved to attack their neighbors, un 
less they dissipate the assemblies of French emigrants, who 
have taken refuge in their dominions. These neighbors are 
members of the German Empire, and France threatens to car 
ry into their country, not fire and sword, but la liberte. Now 
as this last word does not, in the acceptation of German courts, 
.mean so much liberty as insurrection, you will see that the pre 
text is given for hostilities without violating the law of nations. 

Add to this, that three French armies of fifty thousand men 
each are ordered to assemble on the frontiers. One under 
your old acquaintance Rochambeau, in Flanders ; one under our 
friend Lafayette in Lorraine, so as to penetrate by the Moselle 
river into the electorate of Treves; and one under a Monsieur 
Luckner in Alsace. This last T am told has but slender abili 
ties; the other two you are acquainted with. Putting all 
other things out of the question it is self-evident, that ihe Empire 
must bring force to oppose force thus ordered, and in conse 
quence it is not to be doubted, that fifty thousand Prussian and 
fifty thousand Austrian troops will make their appearance as 
speedily as circumstances can permit. 

Now 1 am thoroughly convinced, that if this country were 
united under a good government, and in peace with England, 
they could set the rest of Europe at defiance ; but you have no 
idea, my dear Sir, of a society so loosely organized. America 
in the worst of times was much better, because at least the 
criminal law was executed, not to mention the mildness % of our 
manners. My letters predicting their present situation may 
perhaps have appeared like the wanderings of exaggerated fan 
cy, but believe me, they are within the coldest limits of truth. 
Their army is undisciplined to a degree you can hardly con- 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 153 

ceive. Already great numbers desert to what they expect will 
become the enemy. Their Gardes Nationales, who have turned 
out as volunteers, are in many instances that corrupted scum of 
overgrown population, of which large cities purge themselves, 
and which, without constitution to support the fatigues, or cou 
rage to encounter the perils of war, have every vice and every 
disease, which can render them the scourge of their friends and 
the scoff of their foes. 

The finances are so deplorably bad, that the bankruptcy, 
which actually exist by the depreciation of the paper money, 
must soon be declared by stopping payment in some quarter or 
other, unless those effectual remedies be applied, which seem to 
be beyond the power of the government, and beyond the talents 
of those who administer it. The discontent is general, but it 
does not break out, partly because the antipathy to the Aristo 
crats, and the fear of their tyranny still operates, and partly 
because no safe opportunity offers. Every one is bewildered 
in his meditations as to the event, and like a fleet at anchor in 
a fog, no one will set sail for fear of running foul. 

If they come to blows on the borders a curious scene will, I 
think, present itself. The first success on either side will decide 
the opinions of a vast number, who have in fact no opinion, but 
only the virtuous determination to adhere to the strongest party ; 
and you may rely on it, that if the enemy be tolerably success 
ful, a person who shall visit this country two years hence will 
inquire with astonishment by what means a nation, which in 
the year 1788 was devoted to its King, became in 1790 una 
nimous in throwing off authority, and in 1792 as unani 
mous in submitting to it. The reasons are given to you in my 
letter of the 29th April, 1789, and my fears expressed in that 
letter seem now to be on the eve of reality. The King means 
well, and may perhaps by his moderation finally succeed in 
saving his country. I hope much from this circumstance ; but, 
alas, the moderation of one who has been so wounded, so insult 
ed, seems to be but a slender dependence, and yet I verily 
believe it to be the best, and I had almost said the only de 
pendence. 



154 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

December 31st. 

A courier arrived last night with despatches, which are to be 
communicated to the Assembly this morning. The Emperor 
informs the King, that he has given orders to General Bender, 
who commands in the Low Countries, to protect the electorate 
of Treves with all his forces. I did not mention, as I ought to 
have done, that the courts of Berlin and Vienna have conclud 
ed a treaty for the protection of the German Empire and 
maintenance of its rights. You will have seen that the Empe 
ror, having adopted the determination of the Diet respecting 
the claims of those princes, who have certain feudal rights 
preserved to them by the treaty of Westphalia in Alsace and 
Lorraine, reminded the King, that the dominion of France over 
those provinces is conceded by that treaty. 

The Dutch government has proposed a treaty with the Em 
peror, as sovereign of the Low Countries, for mutual aid and 
protection, in case of insurrections, which offer is accepted. 

All this is explained by the intrigues of France to excite 
revolt in Holland and Flanders, and the completion of such a 
treaty will place the Emperor at ease, should he operate against 
this country next spring. 1 am, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

London, Febuary 4th, 1792. 

Dear Sir, 

I wrote to you on the twenty-seventh of December, but there 
were many things which I did not write, and some of them I 
will now communicate. At the close of the session of the first 
National Assembly, a coalition was brought about between the 
Jacobins and the Quatre-vingt-neufs. It is proper to explain 
these terms. The Jacobins, so called from their meeting at a 
convent or church of that name, were then the violent party. 
The others, who took their name from a club instituted in the 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 155 

year 1789, were those who termed themselves moderate men, 
friends to order, &c. &c. The death of Mirabeau, (who was 
beyond all controversy one of the most unprincipled scoundrels 
that ever lived,) left a great chasm in the latter party. He 
was then sold to the court, and meant to bring back absolute 
authority. 

The chiefs of the Jacobins were violent, for two reasons. 
First, that the Quatre-vingt-neufs would not join with them 
seriously and heartily, wherefore not being able to make head 
alone, they were obliged to use the populace, and therefore to 
sacrifice to the populace. Secondly, that the objects of their 
desire were much greater, though more remote, than those of the 
other party ; for these last had never sought in the revolution 
anything else, than to place themselves comfortably, whereas 
the Jacobins did really at first desire to establish a free consti 
tution, in the expectation that sooner or later they should be 
at the head of it. 

The Aristocrats, you will observe, were reduced to insig 
nificancy before the others divided. That, you know, is a 
thing of course. You will remember, that the first Assembly 
had decreed that their members could neither hold any office 
under the crown, nor yet be chosen to represent the people. 
These decrees were partly the fruit of opposition between the 
two parties, and partly the result of suspicions, which they had 
both excited amongst the well meaning members of the Assem 
bly. The first decree was of Jacobin parentage, to disappoint 
their enemies, who were upon the point of succeeding to office. 
The second decree was carried against the secret inclinations 
of both. But the consequence was, that each was seriously 
disappointed ; and as the constitution was clearly unable to 
support itself, they began to perceive that its ruin might involve 
their own, and therefore they formed a coalition, in which 
each determined to make use of the other for its own purposes. 

But you will say perhaps, that both together would be of lit 
tle use ; and this is true in a degree ; for if the constitution 
had been a practicable thing, those alone who were in power 



156 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

under it could have any real authority. But that was not the 
case, and therefore the plan of the Allies was to induce a be 
lief in the court, that they alone had sufficient popularity in the 
nation to preserve the monarchical authority against the repub 
lican party, and on the other hand to convince the Assembly, 
that (having in their hands the royal authority) all favor, offices, 
and grants must come through them. Thus they constituted 
themselves, if I may be allowed the expression, the govern 
ment brokers of the nation. 

I have mentioned the republican party. This naturally 
grew up out of the old Jacobin sect ; for when the chiefs, find 
ing that all was nearly ruined by the want of authority, had 
set themselves seriously at work to correct their own errors, 
many of their disciples, who believed what their apostles had 
preached, and many who saw in the establishment of order the 
loss of their consequence, determined to throw off all submis 
sion to crowned heads, as being unworthy of a free people. 
Add to this the number of { moody beggars starving for a 
time of pell-mell havock and confusion. 

It was this coalition, which prevented the King from accept 
ing the constitution in a manly manner, pointing out its capital 
faults, marking the probable consequences, calling on them to 
reconsider it, and declaring that his submission to their decis 
ions arose from his belief, that it was the only means to avoid 
the horrors of civil war. They saw that this conduct would 
render them responsible, and although it was the most likely 
means of obtaining a good constitution at a future day, and would 
have bound the King down to the principles he should then ad 
vance, yet they opposed, because such good constitution would 
be established, not only without, but even against them, and 
would of course deprive them of those objects which they were 
in pursuit of. The King contended strongly for that kind of 
acceptance, which I have just mentioned, but he was borne 
down, being threatened with popular commotions fatal to him - 
self and his family, and with that civil war which he most wish 
ed to avoid, as the necessary result of such fatal commo 
tions. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 157 

Shortly after his acceptance it became necessary to appoint 
another minister of Foreign Affairs, Monsieur de Montmorin 
having insisted so strongly on retiring that the King could not 
longer, with any propriety, ask him to stay. The state of the 
ministry was then as follows. Monsieur Duport, the Keeper of 
the Seals, a creature of and sworn adherent to the Triumvirate ; 
which Triumvirate is another Duport, Barnave, and Alexander 
Lameth, being the chiefs of the old Jacobins. I say the old 
Jacobins, for the present Jacobins are the republican party. 
This Keeper of the Seals constantly communicated every 
thing that passed in council to his coadjutors. The Minister of 
the Interior, Monsieur Delessart, was a wavering creature, one 
of those of whom Shakspeare says that they renege, affirm, and 
turn their halcyon beaks with every gale and vary of their 
masters. He had been one of M. Necker s underlings, was 
brought forward by him, and had connected himself with the 
Triumvirate, M. Necker s enemies, as being the strongest party, 
but still kept up a good understanding with the others. 

Duportail, the Minister at War, of whom I formerly spoke to 
you when he was appointed, and foretold the conduct he would 
pursue towards his creator, Monsieur de Lafayette, was also 
completely subservient to the Triumvirate. But at that time he 
was so much embroiled with the Assembly, that his speedy resig 
nation seemed unavoidable. Monsieur Bertrand de Molleville 
had just been appointed to the Marine, an office which Monsieur 
de Bougainville had refused to accept. He was pushed to it by 
the Quatre-vingt-neufs, whom he despised, and told the King 
that he would not be member of a ministry, many of whom he 
knew to be unfaithful to him. Monsieur Bertrand was brought 
forward by the same influence, but he is really attached to the 
crown, wishes ardently to obtain a good constitution for his 
country, is an intelligent, sensible, and laborious man, formerly 
of the robe, and the particular friend of Monsieur de Montmo 
rin. 

! mentioned to you formerly that Monsieur de Choiseul had 
refused the office of Foreign Affairs. While it was in question 

VOL. II. 14 



158 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

who should be appointed to succeed Monsieur de Montmorin, 
the King of his own head named the Count de Moustier, and 
wrote him a letter on the subject, which de Moustier has since 
shown to me. He had the prudence to write from Berlin to 
decline accepting, until after he should be in Paris. When he 
arrived in that city the King told him that he could not give 
him the office, because he was considered as an Aristocrat. 
You will observe that the coalition had been at work to get rid 
of him, and here I must make a digression. The plan was 
that as soon as circumstances would permit, a Minister at War 
should be appointed, faithful to the King, and then Bougain 
ville take the Marine, Bertrand be appointed Keeper of the 
Seals, and Delessart either kept in or turned out, as he should 
behave. This plan was not known to the coalition at all, but 
they well knew that if de Moustier got into place, it would be 
a step towards the destruction of their influence and author 
ity. They therefore assured the King, that they could not an 
swer for consequences, threatened him with popular commo 
tions, with opposition in the Assembly, and the like, so that at 
last he gave up his nomination and explained the matter to de 
Moustier. A long interregnum ensued in that office, and as 
Monsieur de Montmorin absolutely refused to continue any long 
er, the Portefeuille was given to Monsieur Delessart, and 
after some time the Count de Segur was appointed. 

He accepted in the belief of two things, in both of which he 
was mistaken. One, that he had the confidence of the King 
and Queen ; but he had never taken the right way to obtain 
either their confidence, or that of others. The second article 
of his creed was, that the Triumvirate (his patrons) command 
ed a majority in the Assembly. He was undeceived as to the 
latter point immediately, and therefore threw up the office and 
went out of town. Under these circumstances Monsieur de 
Narbonne tried hard to obtain that place, and, as I have men 
tioned his name, and that of Monsieur de Choiseul, I will in 
this place mention that of the Abbe de Perigord, afterwards 
Bishop of Autun. These three are young men of high fam 
ily, men of wit and men of pleasure ; the two former were 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 159 

men of fortune, but had spent it. They were intimates ; all 
three had run the career of ambition together to retrieve 
their affairs. On the score of morals neither of them is 
exemplary. The Bishop is particularly blamed on that head, 
for the variety and publicity of his amours, for gambling, and 
above all for stock-jobbing during the ministry of Monsieur de 
Calonne, with whom he was on the best terms, and therefore 
had opportunities which his enemies say he made no small use 
of. However I do not believe in this, and I think that except 
his gallantries, and a mode of thinking rather too liberal for a 
churchman, the charges are unduly aggravated. 

It was by the Bishop s intrigues principally, that Monsieur 
de Choiseul was formerly nominated to the office of Foreign 
Affairs, but he preferred staying at Constantinople till he 
could see which way things would settle, and to that effect he 
prevailed on the Vizier, or rather the Rei-s Effendi, to write that 
he thought it much for the interest of France, that he should 
stay for three years longer in that city. In the beginning of 
the revolution, Narbonne, a great Jlnti-neckerist, was not a 
little opposed to it, and there was afterwards some coldness 
between him and the Bishop, partly on political accounts, and 
partly because he (in common with the rest of the world) 
believed the Bishop to be too well with his mistress. This 
coldness was however at length removed by the interference 
of their common friend, and the Bishop labored hard to get 
his friend de Narbonne appointed to the office of Foreign 
Affairs, but the King would not agree to it. M. Delessart 
was therefore appointed, he being very glad to get rid of the 
department of the Interior, where he had everything to ap 
prehend from want of power, want of order, and want of 
bread. The next step was to bring Monsieur de Narbonne 
forward to fill the place of Monsieur Duportail, and to this 
M. Delessart gave his hearty assistance by way of compen 
sating foi- the disappointment in the other department. Final 
ly the Interior, or Home Department, was filled by a Monsieur 
Cahier de Gerville, of whom I know very little ; nor is it 
necessary that I should. 



160 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

This ministry stands then divided as follows. The Keeper 
of Seals and M. Delessart are attached, or supposed to be so, 
to the Lameth faction, Monsieur de Narbonne and Monsieur 
Bertrand are supposed to be attached to the Quatre-vingt- 
neufs, and M. de Gerville rather leaning to the latter. This 
ministry, extremely disjointed in itself, and strongly opposed 
by the Assembly, possesses on the whole but a moderate share 
of talents, for though Count de Narbonne is a man of wit, and a 
very pleasant lively fellow, he is by no means a man of 
business ; and though M. Bertrand has talents, yet according 
to the old proverb, one swallow never makes a summer. 

Such as it is, every one of them is convinced that the con 
stitution is good for nothing ; and unfortunately they are. many 
of them so indiscreet as to disclose that opinion,. when at the 
same time they declare their determination to support and ex 
ecute it, which is in fact the only rational mode, which now 
remains, of pointing out its defects. It is unnecessary to tell 
you, that some members of the National Assembly are in the 
pay of England, for that you will easily suppose. Brissotde 
Warville is said to be one of them, and indeed, (whether from 
corrupt or other motives I know not,) his conduct tends to in 
jure his own country, and benefit that of their ancient foes in a 
very eminent degree. 

The situation of their finances is such, that every considerate 
person sees the impossibility of going on in the present way ; 
and as a change of system, after so many pompous declama 
tions, is not a little dangerous among a people so wild and un- 
governed, it has appeared to them that a war would furnish 
some plausible pretext for measures of a very decisive nature, 
in which state necessity will be urged in the teeth of policy, 
humanity, and justice. Others consider war as the means of 
obtaining for the government the eventual command of disci 
plined military force, which may be used to restore order, in 
other words to bring back despotism ; and then they expect 
that the King will give the nation a constitution, which they 
have neither the wisdom to form nor the virtue to adopt for 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 161 

themselves. Others again suppose that in case of a war there 
will be such a leaning from the King towards his brothers, from 
the Queen towards the Emperor, from the nobility (the very 
few) who remain towards the mass of their brethren, who have 
left the kingdom, that the bad success natural to arise from 
the opposition of undisciplined mobs to regular armies, may be 
easily imputed to treasonable counsels, and the people be pre 
vailed on to banish them altogether, and set up a federal re 
public. Lastly, the Aristocrats burning with the lust of ven 
geance, most of them poor, and all of them proud, hope that, 
supported by foreign armies, they shall be able to return 
victorious and re-establish that species of despotism most suited 
to their own cupidity. * 

It happens, therefore, that the whole nation, though with dif 
ferent views, are desirous of war, for it is proper in such gene 
ral statement to take in the spirit of the country, which has ever 
been warlike. 1 have told you long ago, that the Emperor is 
by no means an enterprising or warlike prince. I must now, 
in confirmation of that, inform you that in the famous confer 
ence at Pilnitz he was taken in by the King of Prussia, for he 
came prepared to higgle about the nature and extent of the 
succor to be given and forces to be employed ; but the King 
cut the matter short by telling him, that the difference in the 
extent of their respective dominions, and a variety of other 
circumstances, would justify him in demanding greater efforts 
on the part of the Emperor, but that he would meet him on 
ground of perfect equality. In consequence of this the Em 
peror was obliged to accede, but he did so in the view and the 
wish to do nothing. 

When therefore the King accepted the constitution, he chose 
to consider that as a reason why foreign Princes should not 
interfere. The King cf Prussia, however, gave to the King per- 
sonal assurances of his good will, and brotherly attachment, and 
of this offered substantial proofs. The King s true interest 
(and he thinks so) seems to consist in preserving the peace, 
and leaving the Assembly to act as they may think proper, which 
* 



162 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

will demonstrate the necessity of restoring in a great degree the 
royal authority. The faction opposed to him are very sensible 
of this, which forms an additional reason for driving everything 
to extremity ; and therefore with a view to destroy every root 
and fibre of ancient systems, they have imagined to court the 
alliance of Great Britain and of Prussia. In consequence, the 
Bishop d Autun has been sent to England, and if my informa 
tion be good, is authorised to propose the cession of the Islands 
of France and Bourbon and the island of Tobago, as the price 
of an alliance against the Emperor. 

This has a direct tendency to break the family compact with 
Spain, which has long been courted by Britain ; for it is evi 
dent, that this country will not embark in a contest which is to 
do France any good, and therefore the game of Mr Pitt is as 
clear as the sun, and suits exactly his temper and disposition. 
He has only to receive the offers made, and send copies to 
Vienna and Madrid, by way of supporting his negotiations, par 
ticularly with the latter. He can offer them also the guarantee 
of their dominions and rights against us, and by this means we 
should find ourselves all at once surrounded by hostile nations. 
The minister of the Marine opposed violently in council this 
mission, stated the consequences, and obtained some useful re 
strictions. M. de Warville proposed in the Diplomatic Commit 
tee the cession of Dunkirk and Calais to England, as pledges 
of the fidelity of France to the engagements she might take. 
You will judge from this specimen of the wisdom and virtue 
of the faction to which he belongs, and I am sure the in 
tegrity of your heart will frown with indignant contempt when 
I tell you, that among the chiefs of that faction are men, who 
owe their all to the personal bounty of the King. 

This mission of the Bishop d Autun has produced something 
like a schism in the coalition. The party of Lameth and Bar- 
nave are strongly opposed to it. Monsieur Delessart, who 
had adopted the scheme on the representation of the Bishop 
(with whom it originated) and his friends, abandoned it on the 
representation of the others, and two days before I left Paris 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 163 

an express was sent to assure the Emperor, that notwithstand 
ing appearances they meant him no harm. In effect they 
were again going to endeavor at an alliance of the nation with 
him, upon a plan which was set on foot about three months 
ago by those, who afterwards fell into the plan of an alliance 
with Britain. You may judge from hence how much depen 
dence is to be placed on these new fangled statesmen. The 
King and Queen are wounded to the soul by these rash mea 
sures. They have, I believe, given all needful assurances to 
the Emperor and King of Spain. A confidential person has 
desired me to assure you on their behalf, that they are very 
far from wishing to change the system of French politics and 
abandon their old allies, and therefore if any advantage is tak 
en of the present advances to Britain, that you will consider 
them as originating merely in the madness of the moment ; and 
not as proceeding from them, or as meeting with their approba 
tion, but the contrary. I shall send this letter in such a way, as 
promises the greatest safety, and I must entreat you, my dear 
Sir, to destroy it for fear of accidents ; you will feel how impor 
tant it is to them, that this communication be not disclosed. It 
is merely personal from them to you, and expressive of senti 
ments which can have no action until they have some authori 
ty. 

It is time to close this too long letter, whose object is to pos 
sess you of that interior machinery by which outward move 
ments are directed. Believe always, I pray, in the sincerity of 
those sentiments with which I am yours, 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO ROBERT MORRIS. 

London, February 15th, 1792. 
My Dear Friend, 

This letter will be in reply to what you have been so kind 
as to write respecting my nomination as minister to the court 



164 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

of France. I feel as I ought the honor conferred by the 
President in making it, and whatever may be its fate in the 
Senate, I shall always count his suffrage among the most flat 
tering events of my life. I find that no decision was made 
down to the evening of the ninth of January, though the first 
consideration was in the morning of the twenty-third of De 
cember, being in the whole eighteen days that it had hung by 
the eyelids. J\ mischievous consequence of the delay is, that 
foreign powers will suppose there is a great division of senti 
ment, and of course the Minister will have less weight, at 
least for some time, and if a bare majority should eventually 
approve, that circumstance also will operate in the same way. 
To obviate evil, so far as the other gentlemen may be con 
cerned, I have declared here to those who have wondered at 
the delay, that I believe the exceptions, if any, are against 
me. It has been reported, that the exception was to making 
any appointment whatever ; but I have declared my belief 
that this was not the case, for you will observe that such opin 
ion presupposes that the President was precipitate, whereas 
the law passed on the subject is of long standing. On the 
whole, I have thought it best to make myself the scape goat 
of the flock, because if disapproved of, it will then appear all 
natural enough, and if appointed, I must work through the dif 
ficulties as well as I can ; they will be less important to my 
country, on the other side of the channel, and my great object is 
her interest. 

The mission to France must be a stormy one, let it fall on 
whom it may. You will have seen that every character, both 
in and out of that country, is very rudely handled by their 
journalists. These gentlemen stick not to declare that Mon 
sieur de Lafayette is a mercenary traitor, sold to the Aristocrat 
ic faction. When such things are said, read, and believed by 
the vulgar, you will judge what likelihood there is that reason 
should be heard, or truth prevail. However, as mankind must 
in all countries come to their senses either sooner or later, there 
is no reason to doubt that aproper conduct will atlength succeed. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 165 

You will observe, that it was not in the nature of things possible 
to make an appointment from America, which would have been 
unexceptionable, and to have made none would have been of 
fensive, for the conclusion would have been that America look 
ed with contempt at their present situation. 

That kingdom is split up into parties, whose inveteracy of ha 
tred is hardly conceivable, and the Royalists and Aristocrats 
consider America, and the Americans, as having occasioned 
their misfortunes. The former charge it upon us as ingratitude, 
seeing that it was the King who stepped forward to our relief. 
Should this party get the better in the struggle, there are very 
few Americans who would, for the present, be well received. 
On the other hand, the republicans consider everything short 
of downright democracy, as an abandonment of political prin- 
ciple, in an American. I could dwell minutely on both sides 
of this question ; but a word to the wise is sufficient. To 
stand well with all parties is impossible, but it is possible, and 
merely so, to stand well with the best people in all parties, 
without greatly offending the others ; and in order to do this, 
a man must make up his mind to hear the virtuous traduced by 
the wicked, and to listen unruffled to calumny, folly, and even 
to insanity. I am in hopes, however, that things will ere long 
come to some more steady bearing, though the present pros 
pect is by no means flattering or fair. The Bishop d Autun 
tells me that the ministry are all disjointed, each undermining 
the other, and the Assembly at war with them all. I am, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

London, March 17th, 1792. 
Dear Sir, 

1 had the honor to write to you on the fourth of last month. 
Two days after, I was informed that you had nominated me as 
minister to the court of France, but the latest advices from 



166 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

America, which come down to the tenth of January, show that 
the Senate had not then made their decision. Be that decis 
ion what it may, I shall ever gratefully esteem and acknowledge 
this mark of confidence from the person in the world, whose 
good opinion I consider most estimable. 

In my letter of the fourth, I gave you a picture of the French 
ministry, and a view of the measures pursued by different par 
ties, including the mission of the Bishop d Autun. As he has 
now got back to Paris, it may be well to communicate the re 
sult. His reception was bad, for three reasons. First, that 
the court looks with horror and apprehension at the scenes act 
ing in France, of which they consider him as a prime mover. 
Secondly, that his reputation is offensive to persons, who pique 
themselves on decency of manners and deportment. And last 
ly, because he was so imprudent, when he first arrived, as to 
propagate the idea that he should corrupt the members of ad 
ministration, and afterwards by keeping company with leading 
characters among the dissenters, and other similar circumstan 
ces, he renewed the impression made before his departure 
from Paris, that he meant to intrigue with the discontented. 
His public reception, however, furnishes no clue to decide on 
the success of his mission; because the former might have been 
very bad, and the latter very good. 

The fact however is, that he could offer nothing worthy of 
their acceptance, and that what he asked was of a nature not 
to be granted. His offer was confined to the cession of Toba 
go, a demolition of the works of Cherburg, and an extension of 
the commercial treaty. He asked a strict neutrality in case of 
war with the Emperor. Now you will observe, that no court 
could prudently treat with France in her present situation, see 
ing that nobody can promise in her name otherwise than as god 
fathers and godmothers do at a christening ; and how such 
promises are kept everybody knows. Convinced of this, the 
Bishop never told his errand to Lord Gower, the British Am 
bassador at Paris, who mentioned that circumstance to me as 
extraordinary, but yet so far agreeable, as that he was glad 
not to have been called on for letters of introduction. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION". 167 

Respecting Tobago I must make a digression. It is now a 
long time since it was mentioned to me in Paris, that some of 
the colonists of St Domingo had come hither to make overtures 
to Mr Pitt. Since that period, 1 learnt that the French minis 
try were in possession of documents to prove, not only that he 
fomented the disturbances in France, but that he was in deep 
intrigues with regard to that colony. The particular proofs 
were not shown to me, so that I cannot speak positively. 
Neither can I vouch for what T have learnt further on that sub 
ject within this month ; but I am assured, that it is Mr Pitt s 
intention to bring about, if he can, the independence of St Do 
mingo. Mr Clarkson, the great negro advocate, is mentioned 
to me as his agent for this business at Paris, and the conduct 
of a part of the Assembly, in opposing succor to that island, 
seems corroborative of such an idea. This then being the case, 
or supposing it to be so, the offer of Tobago was too trifling to 
attract Mr Pitt s notice, even if unconnected with other circum 
stances. By the bye, my informant tells me also, that Mr Pitt 
means to coax us into the adoption of his plan respecting St 
Domingo. And I learn from another quarter, that he means 
to offer us his mediation for a peace with the Indians. If all 
this be true, his game is evident. The mediation is to be with 
iis a price for adopting his plans, and with the Indian tribes a 
means of constituting himself their patron and protector. It 
may be proper to combine all this with the late division of Can 
ada, and the present measures for military colonization of the 
upper country, and above all with what may come from Mr 
Hammond. 

I return to St Domingo. If such be Mr Pitt s scheme, 
although we shall not, I presume, engage in, or countenance 
it, yet the success will be entirely for our advantage, and a 
mere preliminary to something of the same sort, which must 
happen to Jamaica on the first change of wind in the political 
world. The destruction of the port of Cherburg is no pres 
ent object with the British ministry, because they suppose it 
will be ruined by the elements before it can be completed ; 



168 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

and because the French Marine is, from the want of discipline, 
an object more of contempt than apprehension. The proffer 
ed extension of the commercial treaty amounts to nothing, be 
cause at present every part of France is open to contraband 
commerce, and because there is little reason to believe, that 
the stipulations in a treaty now made would be of any long 
duration. 

Thus it happens that neither of the objects offered were 
worthy of notice. But the neutrality required was of a most 
important nature. By leaving the Austrian Low Countries 
exposed to French invasion, it would have been a violation 
both of ancient and of recent treaties. Nor is this all, for (as 
I have already had occasion to remark) the annexation of those 
provinces to the French monarchy would prove almost, if not 
altogether, fatal to Great Britain. And when we consider 
that they are almost in revolt already, and that it is in fact their 
interest to become one with France, there is reason to 
suppose that a union might have been effected, in case of a 
war with the Emperor. 

So much then on the ground of good faith, and good policy. 
But there is still a farther cause, which, as the world goes, 
may be equal in its operation to all others. It seems to be a 
moot point whether it is the British or the Prussian cabinet 
which directs the other. Perhaps there may be a little of 
both ; but be all that as it may, it is certain that neither feels 
disposed to counteract the views of its ally, in any open 
manner. Now putting aside the personal feelings, which natur 
ally agitate the sovereign of this, as well as of other kingdoms, in 
regard to the French revolution ; it is notorious that from the 
very dawn of it, agents were employed to foment a spirit of re 
volt in other States, particularly in Prussia. The king of Prus 
sia therefore feels for the French revolutionists all the enmity 
of a proud, passionate, and offended German Prince. Add to 
this, that the Elector of Hanover, as such, cannot wish for a 
change in the government of Germany. If therefore it had 
been the interest of Great Britain to establish a free constitu- 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 169 

tlon in France, (which it certainly is not,) I am perfectly con 
vinced that this court would never have made a single effort 
for the purpose. 

I stated to you, in my last, that the French ministry are 
extremely disjointed. It was too much so for any durable 
existence, besides which, the members took effectual means 
to precipitate each other s ruin. M. de Narbonne wished to 
get into the office of Foreign Affairs. This was desirable to 
him, it is said, on many accounts, but particularly so because 
it gives the command of large sums without account. What 
ever may have been his motives, the following seems to have 
been his conduct. He stood forth the advocate of all violent 
measures. This would naturally have excited suspicions with 
thinking men, but not so with the Assembly. He associated 
himself to the partizans of democracy, and while by these means 
he secured himself against their clamors, he took great care 
of his pecuniary affairs. This at least is affirmed to me, and 
with the addition that he had the imprudence to pay off his 
debts, although it is notorious that his estate, (which is in St 
Domingo,) is among those which are laid waste. It is further 
asserted, that in order to quiet the clamors of contractors who 
had given him money, and found themselves in the road to 
ruin, he agreed to compensate the depreciation of the Jlssig- 
nats. In order to remove a great obstacle to his proceedings, 
he joined in the intrigues against M. Bertrand, and at the 
same time fostered other intrigues against M. Delessart, with 
a view of getting his place. The proofs of all these things 
are said to be in the King s hands. 

M. Delessart s conduct I have already in part communica 
ted. I must add that, afterwards, imagining that Brissot de 
Warville and Condorcet were omnipotent in the Assembly, he 
violated his engagements made with the Triumvirate, and wrote 
some despatches conformably to the views of those two gentle 
men. In consequence of this, it was resolved to displace 
him, and they were looking out for a successor. The person 
applied to was actually deliberating whether he should or should

170 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

not accept, at the moment when Brissot brought about his im 
peachment and arrest. Tn this same moment M. de Narbonne 
was dismissed, and with him was to go M. de Gerville. The 
Chevalier de Graave succeeds M. de Narbonne. When I 
left Paris he was attached to the Triumvirate. He does not 
want understanding, but I think it almost impossible that he 
should succeed. Monsieur Bertrand, against whom an address 
from the Assembly was at length carried, has, I find, resigned. 
There is something at the bottom, which I cannot discover, 
without being on the spot, but you may rely on it he goes out 
with the full confidence of the King and Queen. 

My informations from Paris are previous to the news of the 
Emperor s death, which has probably occasioned the violent 
proceedings against poor DelesSart, by removing the fears of 
those who, in the midst of all their big words, were confound 
edly frightened. What may be the consequences of this event 
it is impossible to determine, or even to conjecture. Much, 
very much, depends on the personal character of his successor, 
which I am not yet acquainted with. 

It is supposed by some here, that Mr Pitt is not strong in 
the cabinet at present, although the majority in Parliament was 
never more decisive, and this is said to arise from his refusing 
to ask money for the payment of the Prince of Wales s debts, 
which the King, it is said, was desirous of, and which his min 
ister declined, with some offensive expressions. Mr Pitt s 
friends insist, on the other hand, that the whole story is false, 
from beginning to end. For my own part, I do not think he 
will be turned out, because I believe him to be very cunning, 
and although he has conducted Foreign Affairs but poorly, he 
manages all the little court and parliamentary intrigues with 
consummate address.

TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

London, March 21st, 1792. 

Dear Sir, 

Yesterday I was informed that the Senate had agreed to your 
nomination of diplomatic servants. If I know my own heart, 
this intelligence is far less agreeable to me on my own account 
than on that of the public. I am sure that a rejection, from 
whatever cause it may have arisen, would have been attributed 
to disunion in our counsels. 

I find that the King of France has appointed to the office 
of Foreign Affairs a Monsieur Dumouriez, and that it is con 
sidered as a sacrifice to the Jacobins. He is a bold, determined 
man. I am not acquainted with him personally, but I know 
that he has long been seeking a place in the administration, 
and w r as, about six months ago, determined, if appointed one 
of the ministers, to destroy at the peril of his life the Jacobin 
and all other clubs, and to effect a change in the government. 
How far he may have changed his opinions since I really can 
not tell, but I mention this to you now, because when I know 
more I can refer to this letter and say, that by coming into of- 
Jice he has not changed his sentiments, if he persists in those 
his ancient determinations. If not, I will tell you, that he is 
more prudent than was supposed. And these words will in 
either case mean nothing more than is here set down for them. 
The King consulted him (as I was told by his confidential friend 
in the middle of last October) on the state of affairs, when 
M. de Montmorin when out ; but the high toned measures he 
proposed were not adopted.

THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 

TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

London, April 6th, 1792. 

Dear Sir, 

I had the honor to receive this morning your favor of the 
twenty-third of January, * with its enclosures, excepting the 
cypher which seems accidentally to have been omitted in mak 
ing up your despatches, or perhaps it has been put by mistake 
in the letters directed to Mr Short, which at Mr Johnson s re 
quest I have taken charge of. I shall deliver it as speedily as 
may be, intending to make my arrangements for leaving this 
city as soon as the present holidays -are over. 

Nothing can be more just, than your observations respecting 
the propriety of preserving silence as to the government of 
France ; and they are peculiarly applicable to the present state 
of things in that country. Changes are now so frequent, and 
events seem fast ripening to such awful catastrophes, that no 
expressions on the subject, however moderate, would be re 
ceived with indifference. 

Feeling with you the importance of our commercial connex 
ions, I shall of course lend all my attention to establish and 
extend them. Permit me to entreat, my dear Sir, that you 
will send me all the information, which can be collected on the 
subject. If, at the same time, you could favor me with the par 
ticular points which it is desired to carry, I shall feel myself 
more at ease than in a general pursuit, which may perhaps be 
directed to objects less important than I may suppose them. 

I thank you for the accurate statement you have been so 
kind as to make, respecting my salary, &c. and you may rely 
that I shall exactly conform to your wishes on that head. And 
I take this opportunity to say, that you will never receive from 



* See this letter in Jefferson s Writings, Vol. iii. p. 150. Mr Morris s 
appointment was confirmed by the Senate on the 12th of January, and 
that intelligence was communicated in the letter here referred to from

me any observations respecting the amount. If it proves in 
sufficient, I will supply the want from my own funds, as far 
as they will permit, and the balance must be made up by re 
trenchment. 

As you have yourself run through the career, which I am 
now about to commence, you know much better than I do the 
importance of early information, and therefore I feel more 
confidence in acting under you, than I should in any other sit 
uation. If you would kindly afford me your good counsel, it 
would confer a great obligation. Pardon me, I pray you, one 
observation. The distance of America is such, that probable 
events are almost of equal importance with those which have 
actually happened, because measures must be squared in some 
degree to the one as much as to the other. You will from 
hence infer my desire to know on some subjects the best opin 
ion which can be formed ; and I am sure I cannot better ad 
dress myself for that purpose than to you. I am, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MoRRIS. 



TO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL. 

Paris, May 14th, 1792. 

Dear Carmichael, 

I received your letter of the fifth of April in London, 
but I did not choose to reply from thence, because I did not 
wish my letter to be inspected. It is true that I am appointed 
Minister Plenipotentiary here. I did not and could not an 
nounce it, because it was in the Gazettes a long time before it 
was officially known to me, and as our Senate can prevent an 
appointment, I was long in doubt Avhether this had really taken 
effect. It was unexpected, and must for some time to come be 
unpleasant. 

You know that I do, from the bottom of my heart, wish well 
to this country, and will therefore easily judge what I have felt 
in seeing them long since in the high road to despotism. They 



174 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

have made the common mistake, that, to enjoy liberty, it is ne 
cessary only to demolish authority, and the common consequence 
results, viz. that the most ardent advocates for the revolution 
begin now to wish and pray, and even cry out for the establish 
ment of despotic power, as the only means of securing the lives 
and properties of the people. This is terrible. The w T ar in 
which they are engaged furnishes a dreary prospect ; there 
seems to be but one ground to hope for success, which is, that 
improbable things are those which usually happen. I will not 
dwell on these topics. 

From what you tell me I have concluded, that the British 
ministry sent forward to Madrid my communications, to defeat 
your views. This procedure was adroit enough, but what will 
you think of the measure, when I tell you that they assigned in 
America as a reason for not treating with me, my attachment to 
France. In effect I would not listen to any overture tending 
to violate our treaties and connexion with the House of Bour 
bon. If the Spanish Ambassador in London had made true re 
port, my conduct in London would have served, and not injur 
ed you. I even went so far as to put my letters to you under 
cover to him ; he knowing my sentiments, first from the French 
Ambassador, and afterwards from me, in a conversation of some 
length ; but I am afraid that he thought of other things besides 
the interest of his sovereign. 

My letters to the British ministry were calculated to draw 
from them a pointed answer, or put them in the wrong if they 
preserved an obstinate silence. I did not believe that we should 
make a treaty with them at that time, but I thought the occasion 
suitable for taking such ground as might be useful to us hereaf 
ter. If you can again see my letters, read them, I pray you, in 
that idea, and then you can explain them so as to remove any 
evil impressions. If you have received what I wrote you at the 
same period, expressly to be communicated to the Spanish court, 
you will have seen that this was the true idea. I am, &;c.

TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Paris, June 10th, 1792. 
My Dear Sir, 

Although I have been above a month in this city, I have not 
been able until within a day or two to make up my mind, as to 
the sentiments of the person mentioned to you in mine of the 
twenty-first of March, or rather I could not obtain that certain 
ty which was needful, before I could properly mention them 
to you. I can now venture to assure you, that by coming into 
office he has not changed his sentiments. 

My former letters have mentioned to you the indiscipline of 
the French armies, and the public prints will give you such 
facts on that head, as may tend to making up in your mind 
a solid judgment as to future events. The first step towards 
bankruptcy has already been made, by extending to seventeen 
hundred millions the sum of Assignats, which may be in circu 
lation. A further extension must take place in a few days. 
The powers combined against France have it therefore in their 
choice, to wear her out by a war of resources, or dash into the 
heart of the country. This last will best suit with their own 
situation, but I do not think they will advance before the be 
ginning of August. 

Your letter to the King has produced a very good effect. 
It is not relished by the Democrats, who particularly dislike 
the term your people, but it suits well the prevailing temper, 
which is monarchical. The Jacobin faction approaches to its 
dissolution, as you may perceive by its agonies. In fact, the 
deliberations are so absurd and so extravagantly wild, that they 
daily furnish new arms to their enemies. You will perceive at 
a glance, that this is not a moment for making commercial trea 
ties. I shall however do all that I can, without seriously com 
promising our future interests. I am, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MoRRIS. 



176 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Paris, June 10th, 1792. 

Dear Sir, 

I have the honor to acknowledge your favors of the tenth 
of March, and twenty-eighth of April.* My last was of the 
twenty-fifth of April. As Mr Short remained here until the 
second instant, and was better acquainted with the current 
transactions, I relied on him for the communication of them. 
He informed you, that we obtained an interview with M. 
Dumouriez on the fifteenth of May. In this interview he told 
me, that he thought it was best I should be presented to 
the King immediately, but yet my first audience did not take 
place until the third of this month. He apologised for this de 
lay, as proceeding from the state of public affairs, which kept 
him continually occupied and agitated. I shall have occasion 
presently to say something about them. 

In our first conversation, as a fair, opportunity presented it 
self, I made use of it to tell him that, during my residence here 
in a private character, I had, as well from my attachment to 
the cause of liberty in general, as to the interests of France in 
particular, endeavored to effectuate some changes in the Con 
stitution, which appeared to me essential to its existence. 
That, being now in a public character, 1 thought it my duty to 
avoid all interference in their affairs, of which, from henceforth, 
I should be a mere spectator. I will not trouble you with re 
peating what passed at my reception by the King and Queen. 

On the next day I dined with M. Dumouriez, and delivered 
the letter from the President to the King, on his acceptance of 
the constitution, of which letter I had previously made a trans 
lation, to avoid mistakes of their agents, which are not uncom 
mon. Several members of the Corps Diplomatique have spok 
en to me on the subject of this letter, which has given them a 



* See Jefferson s Writings, Vol. iii. pp. 155, 168. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 177 

high idea of the President s wisdom. I took occasion, accord 
ing to your instructions, to mention the obnoxious acts of the late 
Assembly, both to M. Dumouriez, and to M. Bonne-Carrere, 
his confidential secretary. The latter told me that he coincid 
ed witk me in opinion fully on that subject, but that nothing 
could be done till they brought the Assembly into more consis 
tency. That they could indeed command a majority, but that 
they could not bring that majority into a support of other meas 
ures than those of the moment. That, however, we might di 
gest the business, and put it in train. M. Dumouriez told me 
that his system of politics was extremely simple. That a pow 
er so great as France stood in no need of alliances, and there 
fore he- was against all treaties other than those of commerce. 
That he would very readily enter with me into a consideration 
of a treaty of commerce, but wished me to defer it until he 
should return from the frontiers. 

In order that you may fully understand the facts, which I shall 
have occasion to communicate, I think it most advisable to 
mention the state of affairs in this country, such as it appears 
to me. I shall avoid speaking of characters, for evident rea 
sons. You are already informed, I suppose, of the reasons 
which led to a declaration of war against the King of Hungary, 
and you know that the hope of an insurrection in the Austrian 
Flanders was among the reasons. Indeed, the intention to 
excite it, and the efforts made to that effect, have, (for the first 
time. I believe, in modern days) been publicly avowed. This 
hope has hitherto proved fallacious, and indeed as far as can 
be judged from the temper and character of the Flemish peo 
ple, and from the information I have been able to collect, it 
seems to be the better opinion, that however they may feel an 
aversion to the Austrian government, they are still less disposed 
to that of France. There is, therefore, no probability of any 
capital diversion in that quarter, and the chance of it is daily 
decreasing, from two natural causes. First, the French troops 
are extremely undisciplined ; and secondly, the force of their 
enemies will soon receive very considerable additions. 



178 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 

On the first of these heads I need say nothing, since you will 
receive from various quarters the sufficient evidences. In re 
spect to the latter, having combined all the intelligence which 
can be relied on, it results that about the middle of next month 
the allied armies will be one hundred and eighty thousand 
strong, exclusive of the French emigrants. 

It is doubtful whether these last will be permitted to act, 
and for the following reasons. First, it is not to be supposed 
that twenty thousand gentlemen volunteers serving at their own 
expense can be well disciplined ; consequently it is to be appre 
hended that they will be more injurious to their friends than to 
their enemies. Secondly, it is next to impossible that in such 
a number, all irritated by injuries either real or supposed, there 
should not be some who will act more from motives of private 
vengeance, than regard to public good, and it is certain that 
acts of cruelty and injustice will rather tend to prolong than 
terminate the contest, at least to give it that termination which 
they wish for. Thirdly, it is notorious that the great mass of 
the French nation is less solicitous to preserve the present or 
der of things, than to prevent the return of the ancient oppres 
sions, and of course would more readily submit to a pure des 
potism, than to that kind of monarchy whose only limits were 
found in those noble, legal, and clerical corps, by which the 
people were alternately oppressed and insulted. 

And this observation leads naturally to the object of the 
combined powers, which I conceive to be the establishment of 
a military government on the ruins of that anarchic system 
which now prevails, and in the continuance of which no power 
but England has any interest. The others, seeing that without 
a counterpoise in the marine scale, Britain must possess the 
Empire of the Ocean, (which in the present commercial state 
of the world is a kind of universal empire,) cannot but wish to 
re* establish this kingdom. 

But a great question occurs. What kind of government 
shall be established ? The emigrants hope for their darling 
aristocracy; but it can hardly be supposed, that Kings will 
exert themselves to raise abroad what they labor incessantly to 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 179 

destroy at home, and more especially as the French revolu 
tion having been begun by the nobles, the example will be so 
much the more striking, if they become the victims of it. But 
if the allied monarchs have an interest in destroying the Aris 
tocracy, they have a much stronger and a more evident inter 
est in preventing a free and well poised system from being 
adopted. Such system must inevitably extend itself, and/orce 
the neighboring powers to relax from their tyranny. If the 
court of Berlin could have been insensible to this truth, in 
which it is so deeply interested, the zealous reformers here 
would have not permitted the Prussian ministers to slumber 
over their danger. The desire to propagate and make con 
verts to their opinions has led them so far, that the quarrel 
which might have been only political has become personal, and 
I have good reason to believe, notwithstanding the profound 
secrecy which is preserved respecting the designs of the grand 
alliance, that it is in contemplation to put all power into the 
hands of the King. 

Things have been prepared for that event by the inconsidera 
ble partizans of liberty. In their eagerness to abolish ancient 
institutions they forgot that a monarchy without intermediate 
ranks is but another name for anarchy or despotism. The first, 
unhappily, exists to a degree scarcely to be paralleled, and 
such is the horror and apprehension, which licentious societies 
have universally inspired, that there is some reason to believe 
the great mass of French population would consider even des 
potism as a blessing, if accompanied with security to person 
and property, such as is experienced under the worst govern 
ments in Europe. 

Another great means of establishing despotism here, is to 
be found in that national bankruptcy which seems to be inev 
itable. The expense of the last month exceeded the income 
by about ten millions of dollars. This expense continues to 
increase, and the revenue to diminish. The estate of the 
clergy is consumed, and the debt is as great as at the opening 
of the States-General. The current expense has, by taking 



180 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

away the property of the church, been increased about a sixth. 
The dilapidation in every department is unexampled, and they 
have, to crown all, an increasing paper money, which already 
amounts to above three hundred millions of dollars. 

From suh facts it is impossible not to draw the most sinis 
ter presages. The country people have hitherto been actuated 
in a great measure by the hope of gain. The abolition of 
tithes, of feudal rights, and burthensome taxes, was so pleas 
ant that a cold examinatibn of consequences could not be ad 
mitted ; still less an inquiry into the strict measure of jus 
tice. 

Next to the abolition came on those philosophical and math 
ematical arrangements of the Fisc, which are very beautiful and 
satisfactory, and to which there lies but one objection of any 
consequence, which is, that they are inexecutable. Now I 
have frequently observed, that when men are brought to aban 
don the paths of justice, it is not easy to arrest their progress 
at any particular point, and therefore, as the whole kingdom 
(Paris excepted) is interested in the non-payment of taxes, 
the question will be decided without much difficulty, if once 
the legislature get out of this city. 

They are already preparing for a march, and it is intended 
to take the King with them, to which effect a decree has al 
ready passed to disband his life guard, and another to collect 
20,000 men to the northward of this city. An opposi 
tion will be made by the Parisian militia to the latter decree, 
because they begin to perceive the object ; and as it seems to 
be a pretty general opinion among them, that no capital oppo 
sition will be made to the Austrian and Prussian troops, they 
consider the person of Louis the Sixteenth as forming the 
most solid reliance they have to protect them from plunder and 
outrage. This decree may therefore occasion either a schism 
between the militia and the Assembly, or among the inhabitants 
of Paris, or both. 

Already there exists a serious breach between the members 
of the present administration, and a part of them must go out. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 181 

I have the best reason to believe, that the whole will be changed 
before many weeks, and some of them within a few days. 
There exists also a mortal enmity between different parties in 
the Assembly. At the head of the Jacobin faction is the 
Deputation of Bourdeaux, and that city is, as you know, par 
ticularly indisposed to our commercial interests. It is this 
state of universal hostility, or rather confusion, to which Du- 
mouriez alluded when he apologised for delaying my audi 
ence. And it was this also that his confidant had in view, when 
he mentioned the necessity of waiting for a greater consistency 
in the legislature, before anything could be done. 

I mentioned to you above, that M. Dumouriez had it in con 
templation to visit the frontiers. This was in his quality of prin 
cipal minister, and certainly not as minister of Foreign Affairs. 
One of his principal advisers tells me that he has dissuaded him 
from taking that step. The object was to bring the army to ac 
tion ; for having brought on a state of hostility, of which per 
sonally he is deeply concerned in the success, he has little 
hope unless from a coup de main, before the armies of the ene 
my are collected. In consequence, he has given repeated or 
ders to fight, both to Monsieur Luckner and Monsieur La 
fayette. The former has declined, and the latter peremptorily 
refused ; the situation of their respective armies not permitting 
any well grounded expectations. At present the two armies 
are in march to form a junction, when the whole will be com 
manded by Monsieur Luckner. It is expected that he will be 
at the head of sixty thousand picked troops, and the Austrians 
cannot well oppose above thirty-five thousand. It is said that 
they are to act immediately, but I have pretty good reason to 
believe that the stroke will be about the twentieth to the twen 
ty-fifth. 

M. Dumouriez told me that he was perfectly easy in re 
spect to Prussia, whose only object was to get the House of 
Austria fairly engaged, and then to take advantage of its embar 
rassments. I told him that he must of course be well informed 
on that subject, but that since the departure of the Prussian 

VOL. II. 16 



182 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 

minister, without taking leave, I could not but suppose the in 
tentions of that court were more serious than he imagined. He 
gave me many reasons for his opinion, which I should have 
supposed to be only an ostensible one, if his intimates had not 
on another occasion quoted it to me, and if I did not know the 
principal channel through which he derives his intelligence. A 
late circumstance will tend rather to establish than remove this 
opinion ; I mean the attack of Poland by the Empress of Rus 
sia to overturn the new constitution, Whether this movement 
be in concert with the Austrian and Prussian cabinets or not, is 
doubtful. I cannot as yet make up any tolerable judgment on 
the subject, but I believe that in either case those cabinets will 
pursue their objects in regard to this country. 

The details I have entered into, and the informations which 
you will collect from the public prints, will show that in the 
present moment it will be very difficult to excite attention to 
other objects, than those by which they are so strongly agitated. 
The best picture I can give of the French nation is, that of 
cattle before a thunder storm. And as to the government, ev 
ery member of it is engaged in the defence of himself, or the 
attack of his neighbor. I shall, notwithstanding, pursue the 
objects which you recommend. The obstacles to success form 
but incitements to the attempt. It must however be made 
with caution, because any sudden change of affairs may bring 
forward persons, who would oppose a measure merely because 
their predecessors had approved of it. 

You desired me among other things to send you the Moniteur, 
but the editor of that paper does not give so faithful a report of 
what passes in the Assembly, as you will find in the Logographe. 
If there be any one of the Gazetteers who is impartial, it 
is the author, or rather transcriber, of this. I send you of course 
the Gazette of France, which says, you know, whatever the min 
istry orders it to say. The Patriots Frangais, written by M. 
Brissot, will give you the republican side of the question, as the 
Gazette Universette does that of the kind of monarchy propos 
ed by the constitution. The paper called the Indicateuris writ- 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 183 

ten by a party, who wish a more vigorous executive, although 
(strange to tell) this party consists of the persons, who in the 
beginning of the late Assembly did everything to bring the king 
dom into the situation now experienced. The journal of the 
Jacobins will give you what passes in that society. The Ga 
zette of Ley den, which I transmit according to your request, 
will convey a kind of digest of all these different sentiments 
and opinions. Thus, Sir, if you have the patience to look over 
these several papers, you will have a clear view not only of 
what is done, but of what is intended. 

For the present I take my leave, with the assurances of that 
sincere respect and esteem, with which I am yours, 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Paris, June 17th, 1792. 
My Dear Sir, 

I had the honor to write to you on the tenth instant. The 
ministry is changed rather sooner than I expected, that is to 
say, as to the totality. Messieurs Servan, Roland, and 
Claviere were dismissed by M. Dumouriez. He filled the 
places of the two former with his particular friends, and as this 
step was decisive and would certainly bring on very serious 
quarrels, it was supposed that he had prepared himself before 
hand for all consequences. 

It would seem, however, that he was less firmly fixed than 
he had imagined, for as the reason for sending away the other 
ministers was, that they insisted on the royal sanction to the 
two obnoxious and unconstitutional decrees, it was in the 
natural order of things, that they should be immediately sent 
back to the Assembly. Instead of that it is said, that Monsieur 
Dumouriez insisted on passing both, and in case of refusal 
threatened resignation. To his surprise the King accepted 
the resignation, and in consequence, his friends newly appoint- 



184 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

ed go out with him. As the present set have not all taken 
the oaths, I will defer giving you the list for the present, but 
put at the foot of my letter the names and places of such as 
may finally be fixed on. 

The Jacobins were busy all last night to excite a tumult in 
the city, but the precautions taken to prevent it have as yet 
proved successful. I am told that M. Lucloier and M. de 
Lafayette still persist in their determination not to risk an 
action. If so, the present state of uncertainty may continue 
some time. If they fight and gain a victory, it is not improb 
able that we may witness some outrages of the most flagitious 
kind. If on the contrary there is any capital defeat, the Jaco 
bin faction will be a little moderated. On the whole, Sir, we 
stand on a vast volcano, we feel it tremble and we hear it 
roar, but how, and when, and where it will burst, and who may 
be destroyed by its eruption, are beyond the ken of mortal 
foresight to discover. 

While I am writing I learn the following to be the arrange 
ment for the new ministry. Of the old set, two remain, M. 
Duranthon and M. Lacoste. The former is said to be a 
pretty honest man, but rather too much attached to the Fac 
tion Bordeloise. The latter is considered as an honest man, 
well acquainted with the business of his department, the 
Marine. M. Lajarre is appointed to the department of War. 
He is a creature of M. de Lafayette. His ability doubtful, 
but his principles sound. M. Chambonas is appointed to the 
office of Foreign Affairs. He is un homme tf esprit, but une 
mauvaise tete, un mauvais sujet, and ignorant of the business, 
at least so says my informant, and he is well informed. M. 
Mouciel, a very worthy man, is named to the department of 
the Interior, but his acceptance is very doubtful. The 
minister of Impositions is not yet fixed on. He will I believe 
be a cypher, for two or three such have been applied to. 

This new ministry will be purged, at any rate, of some of 
its members, but one great doubt exists whether it will not be 
driven off by the Jacobin faction. It is in contemplation to 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 185 

make a serious effort against that faction in favor of the con 
stitution, and M. de Lafayette will begin the attack. I own 
to you that I am not sanguine as to the success. Very much 
is to be done, and there is very little time to do it in, for the 
foreign enemy will soon be greatly superior in number, and it 
seems now to be ascertained, that Alsace and Lorraine are 
disposed to- join the invaders. Thus, while a great part of 
the nation is desirous of overturning the present government, 
in order to restore the ancient form, and while another part, 
still more dangerous from position and numbers, are desirous 
of introducing the form of a federal republic, the moderate 
men, attacked on all sides, have to contend alone against an 
immense force. 

I cannot go on with the picture, for my heart bleeds when I 
reflect that the first opportunity, which ever presented itself for 
establishing the rights of mankind throughout the civilized 
world, is perhaps lost, and forever. I write on as events arise, 
and shall continue to do so until an opportunity to send my 
letters shall present itself. I am, &c.

Pan?, July 1st, 1792. 
Dear Sir, 

According to your orders I sit down to render this day a 
state of my account, which will be but short, because I shall 
charge at present no contingencies. There are some such 
which will come in my next account, and which would be stat 
ed this day, but as I have not yet got into the house which I 
hired immediately after my arrival, and which I have daily been 
in the hope of entering, my papers and books remain in the 
state in which they were. Add to this, that the amount is not 
great, and that I am very much occupied and very frequently 
interrupted.

TO M. CHAMBONAS, MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS. 

Translation. 

Paris, July 9th, 1792. 
Sir, 

I have already had the honor of informing you of the good 
dispositions of the United States toward France, of which they 
are sincerely desirous of giving multiplied proofs. I have had 
the honor also of informing you, that during the last session of 
Congress, although heavy duties were laid upon wines import 
ed from other countries, no addition has been made to the du 
ties paid by those of your country ; which amounts, in fact, to 
allowing them a premium from which they must derive a con 
siderable sale. It is thus, Sir, that the American government, 
while employed in paying its pecuniary debt, endeavors at the 
same time to discharge that of gratitude. You may rely on 
its faithful exactness, and give the King this assurance. 

I should, however, but ill fulfil rny duty to my country, and 
should give but a weak expression of the attachment, which I 
have so long entertained for your own, if I should attempt to 
conceal the discontent that has been excited in America by 
the decrees of the Constituent Assembly, which are inflicting 
a blow upon the system of commerce established between 
France and the United States before the year 1789. I re 
frain from all observations on this subject, because I refer the 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 187 

whole matter to your wisdom, and to the sentiments of your 
nation, and I venture to believe, that even if their own inter 
ests alone were concerned, the National Assembly would not 
allow regulations to continue in force, which are still more op 
pressive to the French consumers, than they are injurious to the 
American ship-owners. 

There is another subject, Sir, to which you will certainly 
lend all the attention that its importance deserves. The Con 
stituent Assembly expressed a wish, that the King should 
cause a new treaty of commerce to be negotiated with Ameri 
ca. This was communicated to the President of the United 
States by the Minister Plenipotentiary of his Majesty, but, hith 
erto, nothing has been the result of this project. lam instruct 
ed to assure you, that the United States will very cordially re 
ceive any overtures, that shall be made to them on this subject, 
and that they are desirous to establish this treaty on founda 
tions that shall be just, firm, and reciprocally beneficial to the 
two nations. The Minister Plenipotentiary of France at Phil 
adelphia is in a better condition, than any one else, to appreci 
ate the advantages of such a treaty, and I venture to assure 
you now, that if he is intrusted by the King with this negotia 
tion, he will experience on our part the most open and amica 
ble dispositions. You will do me a great pleasure, Sir, when 
you shall be pleased to authorise me to write, that such a com 
mission has been given him. I have the honor to be, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Paris, July 10th, 1792. 

Dear Sir, 

I had the honor to write to you on the first instant. On the 
seventeenth of the last month I mentioned the plans then in 
contemplation, and gave a short view of the existent state of 
things. I did not communicate those events, which have since 



188 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

taken place, because you will find the most ample details in 
the several Gazettes. 

On Saturday, the seventh, a farce was acted in the Assem 
bly, in which the principal performers played well their parts, 
and the King was duped according to custom. Things are 
now verging fast to the catastrophe of the play. For some 
weeks, the adverse parties, I mean the court and Jacobins, 
have been laboring, each to cast on the other the odium of vi 
olating entirely the constitution, and commencing the civil war. 
The party which calls itself independent, and which in fact is 
the fearful party, begs hard for peace, and seizes eagerly what 
ever bears the appearance or the name. It was to catch these 
gudgeons that the scene of Saturday was exhibited. 

The King and Queen, believing that the actors were in ear 
nest, and knowing that their lives had been at stake, were over 
joyed ; and their timid counsellors, trembling under the tyran 
nous powers of the Assembly, seized with eagerness the bait of 
reconciliation, which had been thrown out without any hope 
that they would swallow it. One of them, whom I have alrea 
dy mentioned to you as a very worthy man, saw through the 
thin veil of deception, and opposed the opinion of the others, 
but in vain. Events in justifying him have fixed his predom 
inance. This day the King will commence a new career, and 
if he goes through, I think he will succeed. I have every rea 
son to believe that this letter will go safely, but yet I cannot 
justify saying more on the subject, because otherwise the con 
fidence reposed in me might in the course of events prove fa 
tal to my informant. 

The present intention of the King is to secure the liberty of 
France ; but whether he will preserve the steady purpose 
through those varying events, which must soon take place, to 
me appears uncertain. Indeed, I doubt whether he will be 
sufficiently master of his own party to execute such purpose, 
even if it be not changed. Whether he will live through the 
storm is also uncertain. It will blow hard. 

The exterior enemy hovers over his prey, and only seems 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 189 

to wait the moment which he has fixed to himself for his own 
stroke. New parties to the grand alliance daily show them 
selves. The Palatinate has declared ; Holland seems on the 
point of adhering ; and doubts in regard to England begin to 
appear. The force, which France can oppose to her numer 
ous assailants, does not exceed one hundred and eighty thou 
sand undisciplined men ; some of whom wait but the opportu 
nity to desert. Against her, are collected two hundred and 
fifty thousand of the best troops in Europe, under the com 
mand of the ablest General in this hemisphere. The intention 
was not to enter before the harvest, in order that subsistence 
might be easily procured. Whether this plan will be changed 
in consequence of what is like to happen here, I cannot say. 
I rather think it will. I understand that the manifesto, which 
precedes attack, will disavow the constitution, and claim for 
the King (what it calls) his rights; for the clergy, their posses 
sions. That this city will be rendered responsible for the royal 
family. That the Gardes Rationales will be considered as arm 
ed peasants, meddling with business not their own, and there 
fore not under the protection of the laws of war. The allied 
monarchs are to declare themselves in arms, not against France, 
but against the revoltes. You will easily see that these broad 
terms will mean whatever power may choose to explain them 
to mean. 

I have repeatedly pressed the minister of Foreign Affairs 
to come to a settlement of accounts, which he has promised 
to do, and I think I shall accomplish my purpose, because 
the Marine department is to treat with me for supplies to St 
Domingo. I mean to be generous in the terms of exchange 
for this supply, obtaining at the same time a beneficial liquida 
tion of past payments ; for you will observe, Sir, that the 
whole account is open. Two reasons operate with me on 
this occasion. First, I think that we ought to encourage our 
own argriculture and arts ; and secondly, I think what is paid 
here goes into a gulph of unbottomed profusion, and can but 
little advance the real interests of the nation. 



190 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

I have also repeatedly called the minister s attention to the 
obnoxious acts of the late Assembly, and to their proposition 
of a new commercial treaty. He has replied very candidly, that 
for himself he should be glad to settle everything to my satis 
faction, but that his ministerial existence is too precarious to 
undertake any extensive plan ; that the attention of govern 
ment is turned too strongly towards itself, in the present mo 
ment, to think of its exterior interests ; and that the Assembly, 
at open war with the executive, would certainly reject whatev 
er should now be presented to them. These are truths which 
I knew before, and therefore I thought it best not to urge too 
strongly for a decision, in the unpropitious moment. The ap 
parent reconciliation of Saturday seemed to give a better pros 
pect. The court on Sunday had an air less embarrassed, and 
therefore, although the dictate of my judgment was different 
from that of others, I thought it my duty to make a formal ap 
plication, which I did yesterday in a letter, a copy of which 
shall be transmitted. My intelligence of this morning justifies 
the opinion I had formed, and proves that the matter must be 
yet for some time suspended. I am, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Paris, August 1st, 1792. 

Dear Sir, 

My last was of the tenth of July. Mr Livingston, who is on 
his way to America, presents an opportunity of writing, which 
must not be neglected, although I am engaged at present in 
examination of the account received from the Commissioners of 
the Treasury. I have already mentioned to you, Sir, that the 
whole of this account is open, and I must now observe, that I 
do not find myself particularly authorised to make the final ad 
justment. If it becomes necessary, I will do it, but I shall 
avoid it as long as I can. In respect to the payments made 
and making in America, I am at ease, because there I have 






THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, f f 

* 



your orders ; but not so in regard to those made by 
I shall hope however to be favored with your instructions in 
consequence of his communications. I shall write particularly 
respecting the account, when I have gone through it. 

In a former letter I mentioned that M. de Lafayette was 
about to commence an attack upon the Jacobin faction. I have 
not followed that business in my correspondence, because the 
Gazettes will furnish the most ample intelligence. I mention 
ed my apprehension, that it would not be successful, and it fur 
nishes a new instance of the instability of human affairs, espe 
cially of those which depend on the opinion of an ignorant pop 
ulace. I verily believe that if M. de Lafayette were to appear 
just now in Paris unattended by his army, he would be torn to 
pieces. Thank God, we have no populace in America, and I 
hope the education and manners will long prevent that evil. In 
the present state of things, it seems evident that if the King be 
not destroyed, he must soon become absolute. I think the 
prime movers of the revolution see no other mode of establish 
ing the affairs of their country, on any tolerable footing, and will 
therefore declare their adherence to his Majesty, grounded on 
the abolition of the constitution by the Assembly, and their mas 
ters, the Jacobin club. 

In my last I told you, that the King would that day commence 
a new career ; but while I was writing all was changed, and 
my letter was gone off but a few minutes, before I was informed 
that the ministry had given in their resignation. I will not com 
municate the reasons, because they would be uninteresting to 
you, and should my letter miscarry, it would occasion much of 
that noise and nonsense, in which it is unpleasant to find one s 
name. And the wrong-headed people, who get hold of such 
things, cannot distinguish between a person who has obtained 
exact information of what is doing, and those who are actors in 
the business. For the same reason, I must decline mentioning 
the plans in agitation, at present, to establish a good constitu 
tion. I dare not say that I hope this will take place. I ardent 
ly wish it, but I have doubts and fears, because I have no con 
fidence in the morals of the people. The King is anxious to 



192 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

secure their permanent happiness ; but alas ! they are not in a 
state of mind to receive good from his hands. Suspicion, that 
constant companion of vice and weakness, has loosened every 
band of social union, and blasts every honest hope in the mo 
ment of its budding. 

You will have se^en in the report of the minister of Foreign 
Affairs to the Assembly, that the impressions are made, which 
you desire, respecting the dispositions of the United States. 
After this report was made, some persons spoke to me of those 
dispositions in a tone of irony ; but I assured them, very serious 
ly, that our grateful sentiments for the conduct of this nation 
would be demonstrated by our conduct, whenever occasion 
should require. That the changes they might make in their 
own administration, would by no means affect our regard for 
them, nor diminish our attachment. As this language was not 
ministerial, but held in the sincerity of social life, it surprised 
those who, unfortunately for them, can find for the conduct of 
nations no motive but interest, and are so short-sighted as not 
to perceive, that a virtuous and honorable conduct is the truest 
interest which a nation can pursue. 

In respect to other objects which are committed to me, it is 
hardly necessary to say, that nothing can be done in the pre 
sent moment. Such time as the Assembly can spare from the 
discussion of party disputes is necessarily engrossed by the de 
partment of war and finance. The determination to suspend 
the King has been a little palled by the information, that their 
armies would immediately revolt, and particularly the Southern 
army, on which they made their greatest reliance. This cir 
cumstance has greatly deranged the plan of operations, and the 
more so, as many instruments especially convened and collect 
ed for that grand stroke are at present no small incumbrance to 
the contrivers of it. Among these are the Bretons and Marseil- 
lois now in this city. Some of the chiefs of the Jacobins have, 
I am told, prepared the means of their escape to America, and 
among them your old acquaintance Condorcet. They are to 
embark at Dunkirk and St Valery. I am, &c.

Paris, August 4th, 1792. 
Sir, 

I have the honor to inform you, that the King has made 
choice of M. Bonne-Carrere, director general of the Departe- 
ment Politique } to succeed M. Ternant as minister plenipoten 
tiary from France to the United States. M. Bonne-Carrere 
regrets that it has not been in his power to announce to you 
himself his nomination to a post, which will continue and he 
hopes will augment his relations with you. But he is prevent 
ed by a very severe rheumatic attack, which not only confines 
him to his bed, but disables him from every kind of effort. He 
will seize the first moment after his recovery to call and see 
you, but he is not willing to delay any longer to reiterate to 
you the assurances of his zeal, and the sentiments with which 
you have inspired him.

ceived it. 1 hope this will find you well and happy in London.

to come hither is arrived, so that we must wait for another 
conveyance for the packet. In the mean time be so kind as 
to let me know your address in London. Mine is Rue de la 
Planche, No. 488. 

We have had here within these few days some serious 
scenes, at which I am not surprised, because I foresaw not 
only a struggle between the two corps, which the constitution 
had organized, viz. the executive (so called) and the legisla 
tive. But I was convinced that the latter would get the better. 
Such is the natural, and indeed the necessary order of things. 
It is nevertheless a painful reflection, that one of the finest 
countries in the world should be so cruelly torn to pieces. 
The storrn which lately raged is a little subsided, but the winds 
must soon arise again, and perhaps from the same, perhaps from 
another quarter. But that is of but little consequence, since 
in every case we must expect a little rage and devastation. A 
man, attached to his fellow men, must see with the same dis 
tress the woes they suffer, whether arising from an army or from 
a mob, and whether those by whom they are inflicted speak 
French or German. 

An American has a stronger sympathy with this country 
than any other observer, and nourished as he is in the very 
bosom of liberty, he cannot but be deeply afflicted to see that 
in almost every event, this struggle must terminate in despotism. 
Yet such is the melancholy spectacle, which presents itself to 
my mind, and with which it has long been occupied. I ear 
nestly wish and pray, that events may prove all my rea 
sonings to have been fallacious, and all my apprehensions 
vain. I am, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 195 

TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Paris, August 16th, 1792. 

Dear Sir, 

My last was of the first instant. Since that period another 
revolution has been effected in this city. It was bloody. 
Success, which always makes friends, gives to the present order 
an air of greater unanimity than really exists. A very con 
siderable party is deeply interested to overturn it, but what 
may be their conduct is uncertain. Whether they will con 
fine themselves to idle vows and empty wishes, or whether 
they will break out into action, is doubtful. Some of them 
are men of enterprise, but it is rather .small than great enter 
prise. 

As you know well this kingdom, it may perhaps be 
sufficient to mention the kind of persons who compose this 
party. They are those who called themselves the moderate, 
or middle men, and who hoped to balance the two extremes, 
and govern the kingdom by playing off one set against the 
other. This, in quiet times, requires great talents, as well as 
great address, and they had more of the latter than the 
former. In times of turbulence it is necessary, that those who 
play this game should have a considerable armed force, 
because neither argument, nor persuasion, can then avail. It 
remains to be proved by the fact, whether they possess such 
force. If they do, it must be in the hands of M. de Lafayette ; 
and as all must depend on an immediate exercise of it, I 
rather think that the precious moment will be suffered to pass 
away. I have long been convinced that this middle party, 
who by the bye were the prime movers of the revolution, must 
fall to the ground, and that those who compose it must join 
one of the great factions. 

The Aristocratic faction is split into two or more. Some 
are for absolute monarchy, some for the ancient regime, some, 
and those but few, desire a mixed government. The framers 
of the late constitution had got up to this last ground, but the 



196 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

idea of a hereditary Senate stuck in their throats. The King. 
who has an uncommon firmness in suffering, but who has not 
the talents for action, and who is besides a very religious man,, 
found himself fettered by his oaths to the constitution, which 
he in his conscience believed to be a bad one ; and about 
which indeed there is now but one opinion in this country , 
because experience, that great parent of wisdom, has brought 
it already to trial and condemnation. The King, from the 
causes just mentioned, would not step forward, and of course 
there was no standard to which the adherents of the two 
chambers could repair. 

The republicans had the good sense to march boldly and 
openly to their object, and as they took care not to mince 
matters, nor embarrass themselves by legal or constitutional 
niceties, they had the advantage of union, concert, and design, 
against the disjointed members of a body without a head. If, 
under these circumstances, the foreign force were out of ques 
tion, I should have no doubt that the republican form would 
take place quietly enough, and continue as long as the morals 
of the country would permit. You know the state of morals 
here, and can of course, if it be necessary, form the calculation 
for yourself. The circumstance of foreign force is however, 
on the present occasion, a preponderant object, and I think 
its effect will depend upon its activity. Should the Duke of 
Brunswick advance rapidly, he will be joined by great num 
bers, even of the armies opposed to him ; because the late 
change will furnish to some a reason, and to others a pretext, 
for abandoning the cause they had espoused. If, on the 
contrary, his progress be cautious and slow, it is probable that 
those who are now silent from fear, will habituate themselves 
by degrees to speak favorably of the present government, in 
order to lull suspicion : and that thus a public opinion will 
appear, which, when once pronounced, governs the generality 
of mankind. If by this means the new republic takes a little 
root, foreign powers will, I believe, find it a difficult matter to- 
shake it to the ground, for the French nation is an immense 
mass, which it is not easy either to move or to oppose. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 197 

You will observe, Sir, that matters are now brought to a 
simple question, between an absolute monarchy and a republic ; 
for all middle terms are done away. This question also must 
be decided by force, because on one side it is in the hands of the 
people, who cannot treat for themselves, and who will not per 
mit others to treat for them in respect to the important inter 
ests which are now at stake. If, as in former times, some fac 
tious nobles were at the head of a party, they would, as for 
merly, take the first opportunity to stipulate for themselves at 
the expense of their party ; but without entering here into a 
question of relative integrity, I do not think the people are so 
attached to any particular men, as to have what may be called 
leaders ; and those who appear as such are in my opinion ra 
ther instruments than agents. 

I do not go into the history of things, nor trouble you with a 
recapitulation of events. I enclose, and shall send by the pre 
sent opportunity, the gazettes since my last, which will com 
municate all particulars, which you may desire to know. Since 
the operations of the tenth, the Logographe, Gazette Univer- 
selle, and Indicateur, are suppressed, as indeed were all those 
which were guilty of Feuillantisme, that is, adherence to the 
Club des Feuillants soi-disant Constitutionel. You must there 
fore make allowances for what you find in the other Gazettes, 
written not only in the spirit of a party, but under the eye of 
a party. The first must influence the most honest printer in 
the coloring of some facts, and the second will restrain the 
boldest printer in the publishing of other facts. If it were ne 
cessary, or could be useful, I should communicate all the par 
ticulars which come to my knowledge ; but this invidious task 
would answer no good end, and long before my letters could 
reach you, changes must inevitably take place. 

One particular however it is becoming to note. You will 
find that the Assembly immediately superseded the appoint 
ment of a Monsieur Bonne-Carrere, as minister to the United 
States. This man s character is as bad as need be, and stained 
by infamous vices. By what influence he was introduced in- 
17* 



198 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

to the office of Foreign Affairs I know not, for I was then in 
England ; but I have reason to believe it was the poor expedi 
ent of the Feuillants to watch, and check, and perhaps to be 
tray the Jacobin ministry. While the King was pressing M. 
Sainte-Croix (an eight day minister) to accept the department 
of Foreign Affairs, this last declared that he would not serve 
if Bonne-Carrere was retained ; and to get rid of him they in 
vented the expedient of sending him to America. I consider 
ed this step as a kind of insult, and transmitted my sentiments 
on the subject to the King, who thereupon told M. Sainte- 
Croix that I was angry at that appointment, and he must ar 
range the matter with me ; that he wished I would prevent 
his being received. 

The minister apologised for himself by saying the nomina 
tion had taken place before he came into office, and that he 
had remonstrated against it. He apologised for the thing as 
well as he could, admitting always that it was wrong ; and ad 
ded that his embarkation should be delayed, and I was at lib 
erty to prevent his being received. To this I replied, that he 
must not embark at all, but be removed ; and that would have 
been done, for when hs presented the Bon for his appointments, 
the minister refused to sign it. In the mean time the new revolu 
tion took place, and the history of M. Bonne-Carrere s ministry 
is at an end. It may perhaps be misrepresented, and therefore 
having stated the facts, I think it right to add that it proceed 
ed from downright weakness. He was supposed to possess the 
confidence of a great many of the nobility, and therefore they 
were afraid to turn him about his business. Perhaps also he had 
been trusted so far that he knew too much. This was the 
case with some others, not better than him as to essentials, 
though not so much abased. 

I shall send herewith a packet, containing my correspon 
dence with the Commissioners of the Treasury, relative to our 
debt, and in the same packet you will find a letter from Mr 
Cathalan to you relative to a riot at Marseilles, and his conduct 
therein. He has written two long letters to me on that subject, 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 199 

and I have replied by one of the thirteenth instant, which you 
will also find enclosed with his letter to you. 

I have already had occasion to mention to you, Sir, that I did 
not find myself authorised to go into the settlement of the 
account finally with the Commissioners of the Treasury. This 
observation I must again in this place repeat, and add that not 
withstanding my utmost efforts, I have not been able to bring 
the minister of Foreign Affairs to consider for a moment the 
question referred to me, respecting the sums paid and paying in 
America. What is still more surprising is, that the minister of 
the Marine, although authorised to treat with me for supplies to 
the colony of St Domingo, has done nothing in that affair. 
Two ministers have occupied that place since the decree. 
Each has given me various rendezvous, but neither has appear 
ed at the time and place, because circumstances of the mo 
ment have obliged them to attend to something else. Indeed 
the executive of the late constitution has been at the last agony 
for these three months, and of course has thought more of sav 
ing its life than of doing its business. The present executive 
is just born, and may perhaps be stifled in the cradle. 

If a general arrangement could have been made with the 
late government, for paying the whole of the debt at some 
fixed exchange, so as to do justice, and fulfil the honorable 
intentions of the United States, I should have been well pleased, 
and although not exactly authorised should probably have taken 
on me to make the needful engagements ; and in so doing I 
should have made a great sacrifice to the public, because I wish 
of all things to be free from any pecuniary transactions, for I 
know by experience, that the utmost possible purity will not 
prevent malicious insinuations, which however unfounded will 
always find some believers. 

It appears, however, a probable event, that before our debt 
is paid, we may experience some considerable losses on ex 
change, not to mention the dead charges which are considera 
ble too. It has therefore appeared to me most advisable to 
make one general statement and settlement of the whole ; and 
if it shall appear that we have gained, and that they have lo"

by the modes of payment, then to give a good round sum as a 
compensation, and as it were gratuitously, because by that 
means we have the reputation of the good we do, and the sac 
rifice we make ; and because otherwise the agents of this gov 
ernment might attribute to their address an advantage gained, 
instead of giving credit to our generosity for a compensation 
granted. And it seems important to establish the latter idea, 
because it cannot fail to extend our credit throughout the world, 
and consequently to facilitate all pecuniary operations, which 
hereafter we may have occasion to make. 

Before I conclude this letter, permit me, my dear Sir, to 
request the orders of the President respecting my line of con 
duct in the circumstances about to arise. Perhaps these or 
ders may not reach me, until the circumstances are past, but 
even then they may serve as a ground to reason on, in the cir 
cumstances which succeed. If they arrive in season, they will 
relieve my mind from a great weight. At present I feel my 
self in a state of contingent responsibility of the most delicate 
kind. I am far from wishing to avoid any fair and reasonable 
risk, and I rely on the justice of government, at the same 
time, to mark out as exactly as possible the conduct to be pur 
sued, as well as on its goodness to judge favorably of causes 
unforeseen. I am, &c.

TO ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 

Paris, August 17th, 1792. 

Dear Sir, 

Mr Short, just before he departed from this city, left with 
me a Memoir in Dutch, respecting the mint. I was to get it 
translated for you, but not not having been able to find a per 
son acquainted with the Dutch and English languages, I have 
now determined to send you the original, which you will find 
here enclosed. I hope it may prove useful, and answer the end 
you had in view. I have transmitted to Mr Jefferson copies 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 201 

of my correspondence with the Commisioners of the Treasury 
here, respecting our debt. You seem to have supposed, that 
the instalments due had been paid, and this may turn out to 
be the case, when the account shall have been strictly exam 
ined, which I shall take care of. Mr Short left (as I presume 
he informed you,) this business unfinished, supposing that my 
powers would be competent to it, which they are not; and in 
deed I should be glad to avoid all interference in pecuniary af 
fairs, if possible. Not on account of the labor, for you may lay 
as much of that on me as you please, but I would avoid all oc 
casions of slanderous imputation. 

I formerly recommended to Mr Short the opening of a loan 
at Antwerp, and it was attended with the best effects ; for the 
capitalists of Amsterdam, who had shortly before induced our 
Commissioners to believe that money could not be obtained 
there under five per cent, soon after let us have it at four. This 
1 was sure would happen, for I had been in Holland, had studi 
ed the character of the money lending people, and made my 
self acquainted with the manner of transacting business. 

I am still of opinion, that it is wise to multiply the scenes on 
which to display our credit. Those, who have lent money to a 
nation, naturally incline to speak well of that nation, first to jus 
tify the confidence they have placed, and next to increase the 
value of the stock they possess. It may at first seem more el 
igible, because more convenient, to perform all our pecuniary 
operations at one place, and those, who are interested in estab 
lishing that dcctrine, will find many plausible arguments in sup 
port of their favorite theory, just as somebody (I believe it was 
Silas Deane) endeavored to prove, that we had better buy teas 
and nankins in London than in China. I remember the thing 
made an impression on me at the time, as the India Company 
were then buying at Dunkirk some teas, which had been ship 
ped from America. 

To return from the digression, I apprehend that confining 
this business to one spot, may in the end have a very unfavor 
able influence both on our commerce and exchange, because 



202 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

the necessity of remittances being known, and the periods also, 
capitalists can take their measures beforehand to give you the 
law. And if, which God forbid, public events should compel 
us to make loans, our creditors knowing our absolute depend 
ence on them alone, will impose whatever terms they please. 
I do not dwell on these topics, because a word is sufficient to 
you. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Paris, August 17th, 1792. 

Dear Sir, 

If I have not hitherto mentioned the application made to 
me by the foreign officers, who have certificates, whereof the 
interest is payable in this city, it has not been for want of 
sufficient reason, but because I daily hoped to have received 
some orders on that subject. * Many have spoken to me, 
written to me, and called upon me. I have given to all the 
general assurances, that justice would be done, that I would 
transmit their claims, and the like. I now enclose a letter 
from the Polish Envoy, relative to the claims of Brigadier 
General Kosciuszko, and I have told the Count d Oraczewski 
that I daily expect despatches from you on this subject. I 
did this because General Duportail told me, that he had infor 
mation from Colonel Ternant, that these claims are honorably 
provided for. In the uncertainty as to what may have been 
done, I feel it my duty to bring the matter to your recollec 
tion, persuaded that you will do everything which may be 
proper on the occasion. 



* The French and other foreign officers, who served in America 
during the revolution, received certificates at the end of the war of 
money due to them. For their convenience provision was made for 
paying the interest at stated periods in Paris. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 203 

I enclose, in like manner, a letter I have received from 
Mr Francis Coffin of Dunkirk, respecting the Consular office 
in that city. I tell him in answer to it, that I shall inquire of 
M. de Lamotte as to the appointment he complains of, and 
will transmit his letter to you, and take your orders. These 
you will, I trust, be so kind as to give me. I know not Mr 
Coffin, and consequently can say nothing either for or against 
him. I am, &;c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Paris, August 22d, 1792, 

Dear Sir, 

My last was of the seventeenth instant. In mine of the 
sixteenth, I mentioned the revolution of the tenth. I suggest 
ed my idea, that the force commanded by M. de Lafayette 
would not be brought to immediate action, and that in such 
case he and his friends had nothing to hope for. He, as you 
will learn, encamped at Sedan, and official accounts of last 
night inform us, that he has taken refuge with the enemy. 
Thus his circle is completed. He has spent his fortune on a 
revolution, and is now crushed by the wheel which he put in 
motion. He lasted longer than I expected. Some other offi 
cers tried to influence their troops in favor of the late consti 
tution, but without effect. They are, it seems, yet to learn 
that an officer has never complete possession of his soldiers, 
till rigid discipline has led them by the hand over fields of 
glory, in which he has shared then- danger, and pointed to 
them the path which leads to triumph. 

These scenes are yet remote, but if the combined powers 
cannot succeed in the present plans, they must hereafter take 
place. In the mean time much suspicion, much jealousy, and 
many victims, are all in the natural order of things. 

I do not find that the Prince of Brunswick has made those 



204 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

rapid movements, which the existent state of things required, 
and he loses much by delay. He probably understands too well 
the business of war, and his high station requires a man in whom 
the accomplished General should be but a secondary talent. 
I cannot for a moment suppose a possibility of beating him with 
the French army, if army it can be called where there is no 
discipline ; but if he will not commit himself a little to fortune, 
it appears to me a very easy matter to wear away the time 
till winter shuts the theatre. We are now far advanced in 
August, and he has at most three months before him. 

The day before yesterday, the British Ambassador received 
a despatch from his court, which he immediately transmitted 
to the present minister of Foreign Affairs, and at the same 
time asked for passports. This despatch has not yet been 
communicated to the Assembly, because it runs rather coun 
ter to expectations which had been raised, and of course the 
public mind is not duly prepared. The purport of this des 
patch is, that Britain is determined on a strict neutrality, that 
she means to preserve it, and therefore, as his letters of cre 
dence are to the King now dethroned, he had best come 
away. To this is subjoined a hope, that nothing will happen 
to the King or his family, because that would excite the indig 
nation of all Europe. This despatch, turned into plain En 
glish, is shortly, that the British court resent what is already 
done, and will make war immediately if the treatment of the 
King be such as to call for, or to justify, measures of extremi- 
ty. ; 

The different Ambassadors and ministers are all taking their 
flight, and if I stay I shall be alone. I mean however to stay, 
unless circumstances should command me away, because in 
the admitted case that my letters of credence are to the Mon 
archy, and not to the Republic of France, it becomes a matter 
of indifference whether I remain in this country, or go to Eng 
land, during the time which may be needful to obtain your or 
ders, or to produce a settlement of affairs here. Going hence, 
however, would look like taking part against the late revolution, 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 205 

and I am not only unauthorised in this respect, but I am bound 
to suppose that if the great majority of the nation adhere to 
the new form, the United States will approve thereof; because 
in the first place we have no right to prescribe to this country 
the government they shall adopt, and next because the basis 
of our own constitution is the indefeasible right of the people 
to establish it. 

Among those who are leaving Paris, is the Venetian Ambas- 
dor. He w^as furnished with passports from the office of For 
eign Affairs , but he was nevertheless stopped at the barrier, 
was conducted to the Hotel de Ville, was there questioned for 
hours, and his carriages examined and searched. This viola 
tion of the rights of Ambassadors could not fail, as you may 
suppose, to make an impression. It has been broadly hinted 
to me, that the honor of my country and my own require that 
I should go away. But I am of a different opinion, and rather 
think that those who give such hints are somewhat influenced 
by fear. It is true that the position is not without danger ; but 
I presume, that when the President did me the honor of naming 
me to this embassy, it was not for my personal pleasure or safe 
ty, but to promote the interests of my country. These, there 
fore, I shall continue to pursue to the best of my judgment, and 
as to consequences, they are in the hand of God. I have the 
honor to be, with great respect, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.

Paris, August 30th, 1792. 
Sir, 

I call your attention again to day to the important subject, 



* After the suspension of the monarchy, on the memorable 10th of Au- 
VOL. n. 18 



206 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

dissussed in our yesterday s conversation, only that I may con 
vince you of the necessity of preventing the greater incon 
veniences, which would result from the pretended insufficiency 
of your powers, f Upon the principle, that your instructions 
do not authorise you to treat with the new French govern 
ment, your functions would be, at this moment, void ; and our 
colonies, whose urgent need of supplies demands our care, ac 
tivity, and zeal, would be in danger of remaining in want of 
them. 

I have the honor to observe, Sir, that we think too highly of 
the sentiments of friendship and affection, which the United 
States entertain towards France, to believe that their represen 
tative could, or ought to hesitate, under any pretext whatev 
er, to promote the success of an arrangement, begun by Mr 
Short, and the continuation of which has been confided to your 
care. 

The suspension of the King s functions should make no al 
teration, Sir, in the dispositions of a nation, with whom we are 
connected by friendship and interest, and whose independence 
is our work, (et dont ^independence est notre ouvrage.) 
She knows all the efforts and sacrifices we have made to obtain 



gust, an Executive Council was established, which consisted of six min 
isters, as follows ; Danton, minister of Justice ; Monge, of the Marine ; 
Roland, of the Interior ; Claviere, of Contributions ; Servan, of War ; 
Lebrun, of Foreign Affairs. 

f On the 28th of August, Mr Morris received the following note from 
M. Lebrun. 
Sir, 

If you will have the goodness to call tomorrow at twelve o clock at 
the Hotel of Foreign Affairs, you will meet there M. Claviere, minister of 
Public Contributions, M. Monge, minister of Marine, and myself, with 
whom you may enter into a conference relative to the supplies of our 
colonies. You will find us disposed to treat this affair in a manner 
the most satisfactory. I have the honor to be, &c. 

Lebrun. 

The interview accordingly took place on the 29th, when the discus 
sion alluded to in M. Lebrun s letter of the 30th occurred. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 207 

it for her. We do not say this to awaken your gratitude, but 
to excite your good will. I think, Sir, this was due from you 
to the French nation, before the actual accomplishment of this 
object, and that if you manifest it at this time, you will cer 
tainly meet the wishes of your constituents. 

To return, Sir, I ought to tell you, that the King is only 
suspended from his office; moreover the government, being 
immutable, and, of necessity, always subsisting, no representa 
tive can, without an express order from his court, or his con 
stituents, refuse to treat directly with it. Since the establish 
ment of the new T government, you have received from your 
constituents no order which could forbid this measure ; you can 
then, Sir, fulfil the engagement entered into by Mr Short, re 
lative to the eight hundred thousand dollars to be held at our 
disposal in North America, for the purchases necessary to 
supply our colonies. If the facts, which I have here placed be 
fore you, do not induce you to change the determination, 
which you made known to us yesterday, I beg you will have 
the goodness to assign the motives of your refusal, in the reply 
which I shall expect from you, and by which I shall be guid 
ed. I have the honor to be, &c. 

LEBRUN, 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Paris, August 30th, 1792, 

Dear Sir, 

Heretofore I have mentioned to you, that I had not been 
able to adjust with the minister of Foreign Affairs the rate of 
exchange, which should govern the payments made, and mak 
ing, in America, on account of our debt to France ; and that 
I had not been able to see the minister of Marine, to adjust 
with him the sums which the Assembly had determined to 
apply out of that debt to the use of St Domingo. You will 
have seen, by my correspondence with the Commissioners of 
the Treasury, that the last payment of six millions will nearly 



208 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

balance the account according even to their statement of it, 
over and above the four hundred thousand dollars, which are 
to be paid at Philadelphia during the current year. 

A few days since M. Monge, the present minister of the 
Marine, desired an interview, and at our meeting he presented 
me a regular contract for payment of eight hundred thousand 
dollars, as being equivalent to the four million of livres, which 
the Assembly had appropriated as above mentioned. I will 
not trouble you with the conversation, because it ended in a 
request on his part to meet M. Lebrun the minister of Foreign 
Affairs, and M. Claviere the minister of Public Contributions. 
This meeting took place yesterday by their appointment. 
The same form of agreement was again produced, and M. 
Claviere, who was principal spokesman, mentioned my signing 
it as a thing of course. I told him that I had been authorised 
to settle with the late government the exchange of one half of 
that sum already paid, and paying, on this very account. 
He spoke of such settlement as the easiest thing in the world, 
and advanced on the subject exactly those principles, which 
Mr Short had refused to be governed by ; and rejected as 
visionary those, which Mr Short had stated as just, and which 
I think are reasonable and right. 

The great object however was to get the money, and Con 
gress was to fix the exchange. I told them, (which is very 
true) that I felt a sincere desire to furnish aid to that unhappy 
colony, and had done everything in my power to comply with 
the wish of the legislature in that respect, but in vain ; that 
at last our bankers in Holland being extremely anxious to dis 
charge themselves of the large sums which had for months 
been lying in their hands, their own Commissaries of the Treas 
ury being also desirous to receive it, Mr Short, to whom the 
management of that business had been committed by the 
United States, being also solicitous that the payments should 
be made, I had desired him to place in the hands of the 
bankers named by the Commissaries an equivalent of six mil 
lions of livres, by which means the instalments of our debt 3 



THE FllENCH REVOLUTION. 209 

already due, were overpaid. That of course any advan 
ces now made must be on account of those instalments, which 
are to become due hereafter. That I had no instructions 
respecting them, for reasons I had already assigned, and that 
of consequence, if I should enter into the agreement they 
wished, I should probably be blamed for exceeding the line 
prescribed to me. That there remained, however, another 
point worthy of their attention, which was that my agreement 
would be in itself void, because I had no powers to treat with 
the present government. It followed, therefore, that the min 
isters of the United States would feel themselves as much at 
liberty, as if nothing had been done, and act according to their 
own ideas of the object, distinctly from any engagements. 
That it would be equally useful to them,, and more proper in 
me, to state the whole matter to you in the first instance, and 
that I would add my earnest request to make the desired pay 
ment. 

This however did not at all suit their ideas. M. Claviere 
made many observations on the nature of our debt, and the 
manner in which it had accrued. He said that the United 
States would certainly act in a different manner towards the 
present Government, from what the Monarchs of Europe did. 
That it was impossible I should have any difficulty, if I inclin 
ed to do what they asked, and then concluded by asking me 
peremptorily whether I would, or would not. 

His language and manner were such as naturally to excite 
some little indignation, and although I would pardon much in 
a man, whose stockjobbing life had but little qualified him for a 
station in which delicacy of manner and expression is almost 
essential, yet I could not submit to an indignity in my per 
son, towards the country I represent. I told him therefore that 
I did not understand what he meant to say. My countenance 
I believe spoke the rest of my sentiments, and led him to say, 
in explanation, that it was necessary for them to have some 
positive engagement, because otherwise they must make pro 
vision for the service from another source, and then he again 
18* 



210 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

expressed his conviction, that the United States would recog 
nise them ; and at any rate would not disavow the engage 
ments which I might make. I told him it was not proper for 
me, a servant, to pretend to decide on what would be the 
opinion of my masters. That I should wait their orders, and 
obey them when received. That the present Government 
might collect my sentiments from my conduct. That I could 
not possibly take on me to judge questions of such magnitude. 
That I would do everything I could with propriety, and again 
repeated my offer, which they would not listen to, and I left 
them, not a little displeased, if I may judge from appearances 
by no means equivocal. 

The Dutch Ambassador, who dined with me, told me that 
he had received his orders, and should ask for passports this 
day. The British Ambassador went off two days ago, and 
Mr Lindsay, their Minister, intends going tomorrow. He of 
fers to take my letters to Mr Pinckney, to whom 1 shall en 
close this to be forwarded to you. 

Last evening between ten and eleven, I received a visit 
from some Commissaires de Section, who came in consequence 
of a denunciation made by some blockhead, or rascal, that I 
had arms concealed in my house. I made them sensible of 
the impropriety of their conduct, told them that 1 had no arms, 
and that if 1 had, they should not touch one of them. That 
in such case, they must apply to me through their minister of 
Foreign Affairs, and ask me to cede them. I insisted that the 
man who had presumed to make this denunciation should be 
seized, and then I would demonstrate the falsehood, that he 
might be punished. The scene finished by apologies on their 
part. Last night there was a general visit and search through 
out the town for armSj and I presume for persons also. It still 
continues. Between nine and ten, the Commissary called on 
me with many apologies, and took a note of my reply, so that 
we met and parted good friends. 

You will see by all this, my dear Sir, that I have sufficient 
cause to take offence and depart, if I were so inclined ; but I 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 211 

will stay, if possible, so as to preserve to you the most perfect 
liberty of action. I do not indeed feel offended at what is 
done by the people, because they cannot be supposed to un 
derstand the law of nations, and because they are in a state of 
fury which is inconceivable, and which leaves them liable to all 
impressions, and renders them capable of all excesses. I 
shall endeavor, nevertheless, to preserve the proper firmness, 
and let what will happen^ I hope that though my friends should 
have occasion to lament my fate, they will never be obliged to 
blush for my conduct.

Translation. 

Paris, September 1st, 1792. 
Sir, 

Your letter of the 30th of August was not delivered to me 
until four o clock yesterday. I shall reply to it in detail, 
and with the shortest delay possible. 

You do me the honor to tell me, that { / am able to Julfil 
the engagements entered into by Mr Short, relative to the eight 
hundred thousand dollars to be held in North America at your 
disposal, for the purchases necessary to supply your colonies. 
I have already observed to you, Sir, and I now repeat it, that 
the care of making the payments of our debt to France was 
confided to Mr Short, and that / have never been authorised to 
meddle with it. I venture to add, Sir, that you have in your 
own office proofs of this fact. 

Your predecessors informed me, that they had received 
from the French Minister at Philadelphia the copy of a letter, 
written to him by Mr Hamilton, our Minister of Finance, and 
dated the eighth of March. You will perceive, that Mr Ham 
ilton there says ; &lt; After the instructions given to Mr Short, 
after the known progress of these operations, and .from some

passages in one of his letters of the 12th of November last, 
Icondude with certainty, that he has paid all arrears of inter 
est and reimbursements of capital become due up to the close 
of the year 1791. He adds (with respect to the four hun 
dred thousand dollars, which it was agreed to pay in the course 
of the year 1792) that this sum will be in anticipation of what 
becomes due at a future time. 1 Here I should observe to you, 
Sir, that all engagements, made by Mr Short, will be fulfilled 
by the United States, with the greatest precision. 

I pray you moreover, Sir, to fix your attention upon another 
very important fact, which I had the honor to lay before you. 
Mr Short had left in the hands of our bankers at Amsterdam 
very great sums for many months, while waiting for definitive 
arrangements to be made with regard to the payments, arrange 
ments which were not made during his mission. On the 30th of 
July last, I stated to the Commissaries of the national treasury, 
that it was impossible for me to do anything decisive on this point, 
until I should receive the orders of rny government, (les ordres 
de ma cow.*) At this time, Mr Short urged me to pay over 
to the Commissioners of the treasury the money, which was at 
his disposal, and the Commissioners on their side begged me to 
make the same payment. Accordingly, having agreed with 
them on the rate of exchange, by which we should be regulated 
at the time, always excepting the definitive arrangements to be 
made with the person, who should be appointed for this pur 
pose by the United States, I requested Mr Short, by letter, 
on the 6th of August to give orders to our bankers to pay to 



* This expression, { ma cowr, gave great offence to the French Minis 
ters, who were members of an executive council of a. Republic, so called, 
of twenty days standing. They considered it a monarchical phrase, 
and looked upon it as an indignity coming thus to them from the 
representative of a republican government. They wrote about it to 
Genet, who, in a letter to the Secretary of State, represents it as having 
caused displeasure, and as one of the reasons for dissatisfaction with 
Mr Morris. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 213 

Messieurs Hoguer, Grand and Company, bankers designated 
by the Commissioners of the treasury, the sum of one mil 
lion six hundred and twenty five thousand florins, (florins de 
banque) which, at said rate of exchange, amounted to six 
millions of French money. 

You will have the goodness to observe, Sir, that according 
to the calculation of the Commissioners, there was due to 
France, on the first of July last, a sum of six millions and a 
half; that in this sum was included that of three millions one 
hundred and fifty-seven thousand seven hundred and fifty- 
eight livres, which was not taken into Mr Hamilton s calcula 
tion, and of which a part at least is still to be verified. You 
will be pleased to remark also, that in this calculation the pay 
ments, which have been actually made in America, are not in 
cluded, which make still another item of more than two mill 
ions. It follows then, at all events, that the reimbursements 
to be made, up to the present time, are all discharged. I 
would observe farther, that I am in no way authorised to dis 
pose of any sums, which were or might be in the hands of our 
bankers at Amsterdam, and that all I have done, or could do, 
was to apply to Mr Short, who alone has authority in this 
matter. 

It still remains for me to recall another very important fact 
to your mind, which you will find authenticated in the same 
letter of Mr Hamilton ; that owing to the extra expenses oc 
casioned by our Indian war, it was impossible for him to prom 
ise the payment of the sum of four hundred thousand dollars, 
at any nearer intervals than those specified, the last of which 
extends to the first of December, 1792. You may judge, af 
ter this exposition, whether it would be possible for me to go 
farther than to make the offer I have already made, of earnest 
ly soliciting my Government to lend you the assistance you 
demand. A proposal which you refused to accept. 

As to the suspension of the King, Sir, you must surely agree 
with me, that a Minister has no right to express any opinion 
whatever, without the previous orders of his nation. And 



214 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

when I spoke of it to you, I was not disposed to give any opin 
ion; nor at your solicitation, did I express anything farther, 
than that you might perceive that even if it were possi 
ble for me to run the risk of committing myself, by consenting 
to the pecuniary arrangements which you desired, and which 
were not confided to me fry my government, you would still 
be unable to claim from them the execution of my engage 
ments ; for though they might recognise your authority, yet 
they would consider it necessary for you to wait my new cre 
dentials. 

In the letter, which I had the honor of writing to you on the 
twenty-first of August, I informed you that it was my intention 
to remain in Paris ; but the style of yours of the thirtieth of 
August obliges me to request from you a passport to leave 
France. I shall travel by short stages with my own horses, 
taking the route to England by Calais. I shall leave my 
house in its present condition, my secretary, and part of my 
family, till I receive orders from the United States. I have 
the honor to be, &c.

TO WILLIAM SHORT.* 

Paris, September 9th, 1792. 

Dear Sir, 

Yours of the fourth instant arrived yesterday afternoon, and 
I write now, that I may be in time for the post tomorrow. I 
believe the delay of my letter was not in this city. As the 
six millions are, I suppose, paid, it is not necessary to dilate 
on that subject. 

In regard to the extent of my powers, I will explain to you 
my ideas thereon. At first I supposed that the management of 
what relates to our debt was in some sort a needful appendage 
to this mission. Mr Jefferson s letter committing to me ex- 

* At this time Minister Resident from the United States at the Hague* 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 215 

pressly an incidental nogociation, respecting a small part of it, 
undeceived me. Counting however on your concurrence in 
such measures as might appear proper, I should have gone on 
to prepare with the Minister a plan for the final liquidation of 
this object, could I have prevailed on him to attend to it. I 
have since had occasion, when I treated with the Commissaries 
of the treasury, to examine a little more minutely into my pow 
ers, so far as they relate to the debt, and I found that the man 
agement of it was committed entirely, and of course exclusive 
ly to you. Whether the knowledge they must have acquired 
before the present moment, that nothing final is done, joined 
to the idea that you are in Spain, will induce them to address 
their orders to me, I know not ; and you will, I trust, excuse 
me for adding that I hope not. 

Of all things I wish to steer clear of pecuniary transactions, 
because they involve a species of responsibility which is most 
irksome, and expose the agent to the chance of being called 
by every calumniator, to answer at the bar of public opinion. 

You tell me, in the very moment you express an apprehen 
sion as to the validity of transactions with the present govern 
ment, that you would be glad that I should take up certain of 
our obligations, &tc. &c. On this head I must observe to you, 
that the informations you have received and communicated to 
me respecting the state of the account, and the objections made 
by the Secretary of the Treasury, prove beyond a possibility of 
doubt, that our government do not mean or wish that I should 
meddle therein. I have not received a line from the Secreta 
ry of the Treasury of any kind. 

To return however to your wish. You will doubtless see 
with me, that our obligations do not constitute, but only evidence 
our debt. To possess ourselves of them, therefore, otherwise 
than by due payment, would not cancel or alter the debt. 
And from the moment you impeach the right of the present 
government to receive the money, you invalidate any transac 
tions respecting it which they may make. This observation I 
make for your consideration ; it cannot in any wise affect my 



216 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

conduct, because I am for the reasons already mentioned quite 
unauthorised, and indeed indirectly prohibited from acting in 
that behalf. 

Among the many scenes of bloodshed, which have of late 
been exhibited, you will lament the fate of the Duke de la 
Rochefoucault, killed in the presence of his aged mother. I 
am, &c.

TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Paris, September 10th, 1792. 
Dear Sir, 

The object of this is merely to transmit a letter forwarded to 
me by Mr Cathalan, who desires me to communicate the 
scarcity to my friends, and at the same time mentions, that if 
I will encourage him thereto, he will immediately set off to 
America to procure wheat. My answer of this date is 
enclosed. 

By the first convenient opportunity I shall write to you 
respecting the state of things here, and I shall now send with 
this letter the several gazettes. We have had one week of 
unchecked murders, in which some thousands have perished in 
this city. It began with between two and three hundred of 
the clergy, who had been shut up because they would not 
take the oaths prescribed by the law, and which they said 
were contrary to their conscience. Thence, these executors 
of speedy justice went to the Abbaye, where the persons were 
confined, who were at court on the tenth of August. These 
were despatched also, and afterwards they visited the other 
prisons. All those who were confined either on the accusation, 
or suspicion of crimes, were destroyed. Madame de Lamballe 
was, I believe, the only woman killed, and she was beheaded 
and embowelled, the head and entrails paraded on pikes 
through the streets, and the body dragged after them. They 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 217 

continued I am told in the neighborhood of the Temple, until 
the Queen looked out at this horrid spectacle. 

Yesterday the prisoners from Orleans were put to death at 
Versailles. The destruction began here about five in the 
afternoon on Sunday, the second instant. A guard had been 
sent a few days since to make the Duke de la Rochefoucault 
prisoner. He was on his way to Paris under their escort with 
his wife and mother, when he was taken out of his carriage 
and killed. The ladies were taken back to la Roche Guyonne 
where they are now in a state of arrestation. Monsieur de 
Montmorin was among those slain at the Abbaye. You will 
recollect, that a petition was signed by many thousands to 
displace the Mayor on account of his conduct on the twentieth 
of June. The signing of this petition is considered as a suffi 
cient proof of the crime of Feuillantism, and it was in contem 
plation with some to put all those who were guilty of signing 
that petition to death. This measure seems, however, to be 
suspended, for the present at least ; but as there is no real 
executive authority, the plan may be easily resumed, should it 
suit the views of those who enjoy the confidence of that part 
of the people, who are now active. I am, &c.

Paris, September 16th, 1792. 
Sir, 

By the answer you have returned to the letter, which I had 
the honor of writing to you on the thirtieth of August, T see 
that you have misunderstood certain expressions therein con 
tained, and which were used relatively to circumstances. My 
object, in speaking to you of the existing Government, was to 
prove to you that it could not be dissolved, nor lose anything 
of its authority, so long as the nation had an existence. In 

VOL. II. 19 



218 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

consequence of this just and incontestible principle, I have sup 
posed that you might reside still in Paris, await here new cre 
dentials, and new instructions from your constituents, and, fi 
nally, continue to treat upon affairs interesting to both nations. 

You must be persuaded, Sir, that you would have found us 
eager to give you satisfaction, on every point founded in jus 
tice and reason. And as, doubtless, you would have brought 
forward no others, the result of our conferences, and of your 
proceedings towards us, would have been followed by the suc 
cess you desired. 

As to the aversion, which you appear to feel to our present 
government, I think it right to remind you of a fact, which 
comes in aid of the principle just cited. It is this. When the 
inhabitants of North America resolved to separate themselves 
from England, and to gain their liberty, they sent representa 
tives to France, to negotiate with the government, which made 
no difficulty in admitting them to a conference, and even con 
cluding with them a treaty of friendship and commerce, as 
well as of alliance. Hardly had" the United Provinces called 
a Congress, when Dr Franklin was recognised by us in quality 
of Minister Plenipotentiary.* He was admitted as one of the 
Diplomatic Corps to the audiences of the Court and the Min 
ister. France, also, on her part, sent an accredited Minister 
to Congress. Yet, Sir, you know, that at that time no de 
cisive measures had been taken for the establishment of a 
government in America, nor could there exist any settled 
government, since war was still carried on for the cause of 
independence and liberty. 

Our present position, therefore, and that of your country at 
that time, are very different. Of this you will be further con 
vinced by the following fact. 

Before our revolution we had a government, which has 



*The first Congress was convened in 1774, but Franklin was 
not received as Minister Plenipotentiary in France, till after the trea 
ty in 1778. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 219 

subsisted continually since. It has, indeed, taken another 
form, but this form has been thus determined by the liberty 
and safety of the country. Besides, Sir, you, who were born 
in the midst of a free people, should regard the present affairs 
of France in a very different light, from that in which they ap 
pear to all other foreign ministers residing in Paris. We 
maintain the same cause with your country ; our principles 
and your own should be the same ; and by a natural train of 
consequences, there can be no reason against your residence 
in Paris. 

T wish, Sir, that this explanation of facts, as well known to 
you as to myself, may induce you to reconsider the subject, 
and decide you to change your resolution. 

However this may be, Sir, I have had the passport prepared, 
which you requested of me ; it is now with the municipality to 
go through the necessary forms. I hope to have it ready 
for you tomorrow. 

You see, Sir, by the subjoined extract from the reply of the 
Minister of Public Contributions, that you have entire satisfac 
tion on every point contained in your letter of the 21st of Au 
gust last. I have the honor to observe to you, that the trifling 
personal casualties you have experienced, with regard to your 
effects, wines, &ic. are, as you are aware, a consequence of 
the agitation inseparable f&om a great revolution.* 

I have the honor to be, with sincere regard, Sir, your most 
obedient humble servant, 

LEBRUN. 



* This alludes to certain articles being detained in the custom 
house, and charged with duties, which, as belonging to a foreign 
minister, ought to be admitted free. Mr Morris paid the duties, but 
they were afterwards returned by order of the government.

Paris, September 17th, 1792. 

Sir, 

I have had the honor of receiving your letter of the 16th. 
After the explanations contained in it, I shall not again recur 
to that of the 30th of August, and as it was that which decided 
me to leave France, I now resume my determination to re 
main here, and await the orders of my government. 

As to my personal opinions, Sir, they are of no importance 
in so serious an affair, but you may be sure, that I have never 
questioned the right of any people to govern themselves ac 
cording to their own pleasure. For these many years I have 
desired sincerely, that France might enjoy all the liberty and 
all the happiness possible ; and I am confident that I express 
the sentiments of the United States, in assuring you that in 
this wish all my countrymen unite. 

I have the honor, Sir, to renew my application for a pass 
port for the interior. In testifying to my rank, it will preserve 
me from the interruptions to which one is liable at the present 
time. I have the honor to be, &LC.

Paris, September 19th, 1792. 

Dear Sir, 

I shall confine myself, on the present occasion, to trans 
mitting copies of my correspondence with the ministry, on the 
subject of the conference mentioned to you in mine of the thir 
tieth of last month. I transmit, however, a copy of what I 
wrote on the twentieth of August, because the answer of the 
eighth of this month would not be otherwise intelligible. I 
will not at present make any comments on this correspondence, 
and I do not know whether I shall ever mention it again. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 221 

I send you also, as the best means of communicating the 
state of this city and kingdom, the short but lively picture drawn 
of them in the Assembly by Monsieur Masuyer, on Saturday 
last, the fifteenth instant, and the report made on Sunday morn 
ing, by Monsieur Roland, the minister of the Interior. 

I wish it were in my power to communicate a more flatter 
ing prospect, than is held out by these extracts. It gives me 
pain to write, and will, I am sure, give you pain to read, the 
distressful state of a country for which we have both a sincere 
regard. All which I can do under present circumstances, is, 
to be silent. Bad news have a flight so rapid, that I will not 
add to their wings. 

GOUVEJINEUR MORRIS. 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON, 

Paris, September 27th, 1792. 
Dear Sir, 

In my last I transmitted copies of my correspondence with 
the Minister, respecting the subject of the conversation mention 
ed in mine of the thirtieth of last month, of which, as well as of 
those of the seventeenth and twenty-second, copies are here en 
closed. 

I think it is proper to mention to you now a circumstance 
relating to that conversation, because it may explain transac 
tions connected therewith. I had good reason to believe, that 
a private speculation was at the bottom of the proposals made 
to me, and the extreme urgency which was exhibited by one 
of the conferees, who had been designated to me as concerned 
therein, tended not a little to confirm the information I had re 
ceived. The wrath excited by the unwillingness on my part 
to jump over all the bounds of my powers and instructions, did 
by no means lessen, but came in support of the same idea. 
Since that period I have been asked by a person, who said he 
was offered a bill drawn by the government here on the treasu- 
19* 



222 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

ry of the United States, whether such a bill would be paid. I 
expressed my surprise, and was told that this bill would be for 
the sum decreed by the Assembly to be employed in purchas 
ing supplies for the colony of St Domingo. I observed that it 
seemed a strange procedure either to sell or buy such a bill ; 
because the vender could only employ the money in America, 
and of course need not risk a draft ; and the purchaser, who 
must make the expenditure, could not, I supposed, find his ac 
count in the transaction. This led to an explanation. The 
bill was to be paid for in Assignats at par, six or nine months 
hence, and the produce was to be employed in purchasing man- 
ufactures suitable to the colony in this country. I told the 
person who applied to me, that I did not think this would be con 
sidered in America as falling within the decree, and that no 
good reason could be assigned for paying, under great disadvan 
tages in Philadelphia, what could be paid with great advantage 
in Paris, when the sum paid was not to be expended in the 
United States but. in France. At length the true object of this 
application to me came out. I discovered it was merely a 
scheme of speculation to be carried into effect, if I could be in 
duced to recommend the payment, under what was known to 
be a favorite idea with me, viz. the expending in America what 
we owe to France, and for the support of the colony of St Do 
mingo. As my concurrence could not be hoped for, I believe 
the plan is abandoned, but perhaps it is only abandoned in ap 
pearance. 

I also take the liberty to enclose the extract of a letter from 
Mr Short respecting M. de Lafayette, with my answer. I 
understand that he was forwarded from Luxemburg private 
ly on the route to Vienna, and had got as far as Brisgaw 
several days ago. I presume tljat his treatment will depend 
very much on the success of the military operations. If the 
allied monarchs, finding themselves disappointed in their 
expectations from the present campaign, are obliged to look 
forward to more extensive and more permanent efforts, they 
will probably endeavor to gain one of the great parties in this 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 223 

country ; and should they turn their eyes towards the Quatre- 
vingt-neufs, or Feuillants, they will naturally consider M. 
de Lafayette as the most fitting instrument to be employed, 
and he will naturally desire to aid in the establishment of the 
party and the principles, which he considers as true supporters 
of liberty in this country. For you will observe, that in like 
manner as the Clerical and Aristocratic parties considered 
the Assembly in 1789 as a usurper, the leaders of that 
Assembly affixed on the Jacobins the same charge of usur 
pation, and now the leaders of the last revolution are charged 
by some of their brethren with Feuillantism. 

You will see by the gazettes, that there is the same enmity 
between the present chiefs, which prevailed heretofore against 
those whom they considered as their common enemies, and if 
either of the present parties should get the better, it would 
probably again divide ; for party, like matter, is divisible ad 
infinitum, because things which depend on human opinion 
can never be tried by any common standard. And not only 
is it unavoidable, that there should be differences among differ 
ent men, but it is even uncommon to find in the same man the 
same sentiments, for a continued length of time, even upon 
the ^ame subject, for either the circumstances change or else 
the man. 

You will see that the King of Prussia has made some over 
tures for treaty, which were not listened to. I consider the 
offer as a mere military manoeuvre, because it is not possible 
that treaty should succeed in the present moment, and because 
preparations are making for more vigorous efforts the ensuing 
campaign. I am told that both Sweden and Denmark have 
acceded to the league, and that they count on the assistance 
of Great Britain, should that become necessary. 

On this last subject much may be said. Of the King s per 
sonal opinions there can be no doubt, and I have some little 
reason to believe, that not only his ministers, but the great mass 
of property and interest in that kingdom would readily embark 
in a contest to crush opinions, which are considered fatal to the 



224 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

peace and order of civil society. And you know of how little 
consequence it is, as to human action, whether opinions be or 
be not well founded. On the other hand, there is a party in 
England, not inconsiderable as to numbers, and very important 
from the activity of its members, who, joining to high notions 
of civil liberty some mixture of the enmities and prejudices of 
particular sects of religion, aim at a subversion of Monarchy, 
Hierarchy, and Aristocracy. But as any great convulsion 
must necessarily overturn the stupendous fabric of national 
credit, which has been erected within this century, there are 
among the chieftains even of this party several, who rather 
wish that the battles for freedom should be fought on French 
than English ground. Yet these same men, should it become 
necessary to take a decided part, would range themselves, I 
think, under the revolutionary standard. But in this uncertain 
state of men and things the ministry have to fear from inaction, 
that the principles of the government will be sapped, and they 
have to fear a total defeat, should they declare war without 
first securing the aid of the opposition. This they have been 
laboring at for some time, but with little effect, because there 
are two or three great places desired by both parties. Of 
these intrigues, however, Mr Pinckney will, I doubt not, give 
you ample details, as they are closely connected with the objects 
of his mission. I have little doubt but that a junction, or coa 
lition, between these two parties would enable the government 
to act with all the energy it could wish, and there seems to me 
to be a little cause not much noticed, but of considerable effect, 
which may lead them into a war. It is the legal advantage to 
be gained over those, who, in supporting certain opinions, may 
in case of war be brought under the statute of treasons as ad 
hering to the foreign enemy. 

An opponent more dreadful than any of the armies which 
can be sent against this country &gt; or any of the parties by which 
it may be distracted, seems to be preparin ghis vengeance. Fa 
mine is among the things on which to calculate. The crop in 
Sicily was short ; that of the Southern provinces, always in- 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 225 

sufficient, is much less than usual. The supplies usually 
drawn from the coast of Barbary will, I am told, be totally cut 
off by those powers, who, in consequence of the affair of the 
tenth of August, mean to break with this country. The grain 
provinces on the north and east, if not possessed by the enemy, 
will be totally exhausted by the two armies ; and Poland, 
whose granaries are shut up till the next spring, will be engross 
ed by the enemy to furnish his own magazines. I consider it 
therefore as next to certain, that the want here will be very 
great during the ensuing year ; and as this must, by the end of 
December, become apparent to everybody, most other resour 
ces will then be shut by the hand of mercantile speculation. 
Hence it would seem, that our merchants would act wisely in 
sending hither cargoes of flour, and I have but one apprehen 
sion in recommending it, which is, that, from the laxity of gov 
ernment, property of that sort may become precarious, when 
the price has got so high as to oppress the poor, and yet it 
must so rise, or else the merchant will suffer, because the 
exchange cuts off a great- proportion of what he receives. 

I submit, my dear Sir, to your better judgment all these 
ideas, persuaded that you will turn them to the best account ; 
and I pray you to believe in that sincere regard with which I 
am, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



GEORGE WASHINGTON TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

Philadelphia, October 20th, 1792. 
My Dear Sir, 

Although your letter of the tenth of June, which I have 
received, did not paint the prospects of France in the most 
pleasing colors, yet the events which have since taken place 
give a more gloomy aspect to the public affairs of that king 
dom, than your letter gave reason to apprehend. 

A thousand circumstances, besides our distance from the 



226 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

theatre of action, made it improbable that we should have, 
in this country, a fair statement of facts and causes through 
the medium of the public prints ; and I have received no 
other accounts, than what have come in that channel. But 
taking up the most favorable of these, gloomy indeed appears 
the situation of France at this juncture. But it is hardly 
probable that even you, who are on the spot, can say with any 
precision how these things will terminate ; much less can we, 
at this distance, pretend to augur the event. We can only 
repeat the sincere wish, that much happiness may arise to the 
French nation, and to mankind in general, out of the severe 
evils which are inseparable from so important a revolution. 

In the present state of things we cannot expect, that any 
commercial treaty can now be formed with France ; but I 
have no doubt of your embracing the proper moment of ar 
rangement, and of doing whatever may be in your power for 
the substantial interest of our country. 

The affairs of the United States go on well. There are 
some few clouds in our political hemisphere, but I trust that 
the bright sun of our prosperity will disperse them. 

The Indians on our western and southern frontiers are still 
troublesome, but such measures are taken as will, I presume, 
prevent any serious mischief from them ; I confess, however, 
that I do not believe these tribes will ever be brought to a 
quiescent state, so long as they may be under an influence 
which is hostile to the rising greatness of these states. 

From the complexion of some of our newspapers, foreign 
ers would be led to believe, that inveterate political dissensions 
exist among us, . and that we are on the very verge of dis 
union ; but the fact is otherwise. The great body of the 
people now feel the advantages of the general government, 
and would not, I am persuaded, do anything that should de 
stroy it ; but this kind of representations is an evil, which 
must be placed in opposition to the infinite benefits resulting 
from a free press ; and I am sure you need not be told, that in 
this country a personal difference in political sentiments is 
often made to take the garb of general dissensions. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 227 

From the Department of State you are, I am informed, 
furnished with such papers and documents from time to 
time, as will keep you more particularly informed of the state 
of our affairs. I shall therefore add nothing further to this 
letter, than assurances of being always and sincerely yours, &c. 

GEORGE WASHINGTON. 



TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Paris, October 23d, 1792. 
My Dear Sir, 

Yours of the twenty-first of June is at length safely arrived. 
Poor Lafayette ! Your letter for him must remain with me yet 
some time. His enemies here are as virulent as ever, and I 
can give you no better proof than this. Among the King s 
papers was found nothing of what his enemies wished and ex 
pected, except his correspondence with M. de Lafayette, 
which breathes from beginning to end the purest sentiments 
of freedom. It is therefore kept secret, while he stands ac 
cused of designs in conjunction with the dethroned monarch 
to enslave his country. 

The fact respecting this correspondence is communicated to 
me, by a person to whom it was related confidentially by one 
of the parties who examined it. You will have seen in my 
letters to Mr Jefferson, a proposition made by Mr Short respect 
ing M. de Lafayette, with my reply. I had very good reason 
to apprehend, that our interference at that time would have 
been injurious to him, but I hope that a moment will soon of 
fer in which something* may be done for his relief. In reading 
my correspondence with Mr Short you must consider, that 1 
wrote to the French and Austrian government, as each would 
take the liberty to read my letters. 

You will have seen also that in my letters to Mr Jefferson, 
I hint at the dangers attending a residence in this city. Some 
of the sanguinary events which have taken place, and which 



228 TliE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

were partial executions of great plans, will point to a natural 
interpretation thereof; but these were not what I contempla 
ted. Should we ever meet, I will entertain you with the reci 
tal of many things, which it would be improper to commit to 
paper, at least for the present. You will have seen, that 
the King is accused of high crimes and misdemeanors ; but I 
verily believe that he wished sincerely for this nation the en 
joyment of the utmost degree of liberty, which their situation 
and circumstances will permit. He wished for a good consti 
tution, but unfortunately he had not the means to obtain it, or 
if he had he was thwarted by those about him. What may 
be his fate God only knows, but history informs us, that the 
passage of dethroned monarchs is short from the prison to 
the grave. 

I have mentioned to Mr Jefferson, repeatedly, my wish to 
have positive instructions and orders for my government. I 
need not tell you, Sir, how agreeable this would be to me, and 
what a load it would take from my mind. At the same time 
I am fully sensible, that it may be inconvenient to give me 
such orders. The United States may wish to temporize, and 
see how things are likely to end, and in such case, leaving me 
at large with the right reserved to avow or disavow me accord 
ing to circumstances and events, is for the government an eli 
gible position. My part in the play is not quite so eligible ; but 
although I wish the Senate to be sensible of this, I am far from 
wishing that any precipitate step be taken to relieve me from 
it, for I know how contemptible is every private consideration, 
when compared with the public interests. One step however 
seems natural, viz. to say that before any new letters of cre 
dence are given, it will be proper to know to whom they are 
to be directed, because the Convention, a mere temporary bo 
dy, is to be succeeded by some fixed form, and it may be a 
long time before any such form will be adopted. 

Mr Jefferson, from the materials in his possession, will be 
able to give you an accurate account of the military events. 
I discover three capital errors in the conduct of the Duke of 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 229 

Brunswick. First, his proclamation arrogated rights, v,hich 
on no construction could belong to him or his employers, and 
contained threats which no circumstances could warrant, and 
which in no supposable success could be executed. They 
tended however to unite the nation in opposing him, seeing 
that no hope remained for those who had taken any part in 
the revolution ; and the conduct observed towards Monsieur 
de Lafayette and his companions was a severe comment on 
the cruelty of the rest Thus in the same moment he wound 
ed the pride, insulted the feelings, and alarmed the fears of all 
France. And by his thundering menaces to protect the royal 
family, he plunged them into the situation from which he 
meant to extricate them. 

The second error was, not to dash at Paris the Instant he 
received the news of the affair of the tenth. He should then 
have advanced at all hazards, and if in so doing he had declar 
ed to the several Generals and armies, that he expected their 
assistance to restore their dethroned prince and violated con 
stitution, I am persuaded that he would have met with as much 
support as opposition. I learn within these two days, that the 
delegates of Lorraine and Alsace had so little hope, or rather 
were so thoroughly persuaded that those provinces would join 
the enemy, that they made unusual haste to come forward, lest 
they should be apprehended. Great activity in that moment 
would have done wonders ; but then he was not ready. 

The third great error was, that after waiting so long he came 
forward at all this season. By menacing the frontiers with 
great and increasing force, vast numbers of the militia would 
have been drawn to the utmost verge of the French territory. 
The difficulty of subsisting them there, would have been ex 
treme. By taking strong and good positions, his troops would 
have been preserved in full vigor, and the French, wasted by 
disease, tired of inaction, and stimulated by their natural impa 
tience and impetuosity of temper, would have forced their Gen 
erals to attack, even \ithey had the prudence to be quiet. The 
consequence of such attack, excepting always the will of God, 
VOL. ii. 20 



230 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

must have been a complete victory on his part, and then it 
would have been next to impossible for them to escape. Then 
the towns would have surrendered, believing the business to be 
over, and he might have come as far forward this autumn as 
the needful transportation of stores would permit. Next spring 
France would have found it almost impossible to subsist the 
armies needful for the defence in that part of the country, 
which is most defensible, and of consequence her enemy would 
have reached the point from which he lately retreated, without 
the smallest difficulty. 

The appearances are so vague and contradictory, that I can 
not pretend to tell you whether the alliance will or will not be 
preserved for the next campaign. If I were to hazard con 
jectures on the present state of things, it might cast suspicions 
where I have not sufficient ground, and therefore 1 will bury 
them in my own bosom, lest accident should put this letter in 
to improper hands. France has a strong ally in the feelings of 
those nations, who are subject to despotism, but for that very 
reason, she has a mortal enemy in every Prince. If, as is ve 
ry possible, the league should hold firm till next spring, it will 
then have gained considerable auxiliaries, and I am very much 
mistaken if this nation will make as great efforts as those she is 
now making. The character of nations must be taken into 
consideration in all political questions, and that of France has 
ever been an enthusiastic inconstancy. They soon get tired 
of a thing. They adopt without examination, and reject with 
out sufficient cause. They are now agog with their republic, 
and may perhaps adopt some form of government with a 
huzza ; but that they will adopt a good form, or, having adopt 
ed, adhere to it, is what I do not believe. There is a great 
body of royalists in the country, who do not now declare them 
selves, because it would be certain death, but a favorable occa 
sion would bring them out of their holes. 

The factions here are violent, and among those who admin 
ister the government there is not, I ana told, that degree of cha 
racter which lays hold of the esteem and respect of mankind, 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 231 

but rather the contrary. In their opponents there is a nervous 
temper, which sticks at nothing, and if I see rightly there is in 
the current of their affairs a strong eddy, or counter tide, which 
may change materially both men and things. Yet let what will 
happen, I think it hardly possible that they should blunder as 
much as the emigrants, and I am prone to believe, that in war 
and politics the folly of our adversaries constitutes our great 
est force. The future prospect, therefore, is involved in mist 
and darkness. 

There is but one sovereign in Europe, the Empress of Rus 
sia, who is not in the scale of talents considerably below par. 
The Emperor, who it is said is consumptive and cannot live 
long, is now much influenced by Manfredi, a statesman of the 
Italian school, who takes insincerity for wisdom. The Prus 
sian Cabinet is far from strong. Leuchesini, an able man, is 
said to be rising in influence there, but there is such a mixture 
of lust and folly in the chief, that no one man can keep things 
steady. The alliance with Vienna is disagreeable to the Prus 
sians, and particularly to the inhabitants of Berlin, which may 
have some influence in destroying it, and his Majesty has given 
three strong proofs since his accession, that he is by no means 
nice on the subject of public faith. The invasion of Brabant 
will, I am persuaded, alarm both Britain and Holland, but wheth 
er they will confine themselves to court intrigue, or come into 
the field, is doubtful. 

Thus you will perceive, Sir, that nothing can be predicted 
with tolerable certainty respecting the affairs of this country, 
either internal or external, at the present moment. I am, &tc. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Paris, October 23d. 1792. 



Dear Sir, 

My last was of the twenty-seventh of September. Since 
that period, and within a few days, I have received yours of 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 

the sixteenth of June. In sunding the gazettes, it would be 
well, I think, to put them in an envelope open at each end, and 
direct them to the Consul at Havre, who should be desired to 
forward them to me by the stage. This will avoid the heavy 
postage. 

The unexpected events, which have taken place in this coun 
try since your letter was written, and of which you will have 
been informed before this reaches you, will show you that I 
cannot, until I receive the President s farther orders, take up 
any of the objects to which it alludes, not having indeed the 
proper powers. I apprehend also that the United States will 
wish to see a little into the establishment of the new Republic, 
before they take any decided steps in relation to it. In this 
case I may be a long lime without such orders, which is to me 
a distressing circumstance, because it involves a degree of re 
sponsibility for events, which no human being can foresee. It 
may indeed be replied, that in a position like mine, the proper 
conduct is to preserve a strict neutrality, and of course to do 
nothing ; but cases often arise in which to do nothing is taking 
a part. I need not state the many situations of that sort which 
occur. I had it in contemplation to leave Paris, and visit 
Bordeaux and Marseilles, but 1 found it necessary to continue 
here for the sake of such of my countrymen as were in this 
city, and who might, in the madness of the moment, have 
been exposed to danger, but certainly to inconvenience. A 
proof of which is, that the English, who remained after Lord 
Gower went away, found it so difficult to obtain passports, 
though possessed of those he had given, that many, after wait 
ing for weeks in fruitless attendance, went off at all hazards 
without them. 

1 informed you in my last, that I believed the plan for spec 
ulating on the sum appropriate d for St Domingo, was aban 
doned, but a further attempt was made by the Minister, who 
pressed me again on the subject, and I of course again de 
clined, referring him to Mr Short, who in fact is alone em 
powered in that respect. What they may have since done,, I 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 233 

know not. The intercourse with Holland is much interrupted 
just now, and a letter which Mr Pinckney forwarded for me 
by Colonel Smith, from Mr Short, and which was put into the 
postoffice at Dieppe, has not yet come to hand. I suppose 
that it relates to M. de Lafayette, who is, I am told, at Wezel, 
and of course in the power of his Prussian Majesty. 

The gazettes will inform you of the retreat of the Prussian 
army. I have been told on good authority, that the cannon 
ade of the twentieth of September was only to amuse ; that 
during its continuance the Duke of Brunswick made a master 
ly movement, by which he opened to himself the roads to 
Rheims, and to Chalons; that the French army was so 
much in his power, that he might either have driven them 
away and dissipated them, or if under every disadvantage they 
would risk an action, that he could have cut them to pieces. 
And why did he not ? To this natural question two answers 
are given. It is said, that the plan fixed for the campaign 
was, that the King of Prussia, at the head of his army, should 
form the point of a wedge, of which two columns of Austrian 
troops should form the angles. The right, under General 
Clairfayt, to penetrate the Loisons ; the left, under the Prince 
de Hohenloe, to penetrate, after masking Thionville and Metz, 
to Chalons. That by this means the magazines, sick, and 
wounded, of the three armies, would have been completely 
covered, and the police of the country been maintained by the 
emigrants, under the immediate orders of the King s brothers. 
Another body of troops was at the same time to make a pow 
erful diversion, or to penetrate, as circumstances might per 
mit, or direct, from the Brisgaw. 

You will observe, that all which depended on the Austrians, 
in the plan above supposed, completely failed, and that in con 
sequence, if the King of Prussia had advanced any farther, the 
French would have closed in upon his rear, and of course his 
sick, his wounded, and his magazines, would have been sacri 
ficed, perhaps his retreat cut off. It is said that the three days 
consumed in treaty, were to give time to the columns in ques- 
20* 



234 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION-, 

tion to advance, and by their demonstrations to drive off the 
corps, which infested one of his flanks, and menaced the other r 
and to show at the same time that he had completely perform 
ed his stipulations. In effect he had surmounted the obstacles,, 
which nature had opposed to his march, had disentangled him 
self from ihe Ardennes, and was complete in force, and in view 
of the two great plains of Champagne, the one leading by 
Rheims, and the other by Chalons, to his object. 

It is said, that without the aid of the columns in question., 
his farther progress would have been useless, because he could 
not detach to the right and left so as to cut off the communi 
cation between this city, and the southern and western parts of 
the Empire. To this it is added, that a season of which there 
is no parallel in the memory of man, and disease beyond all 
reasonable expectation, had almost crippled the Duke s army 
before he could extricate himself from the defiles, and drive 
off the parties which were in possession of them. 

This is one solution of the events, which took place subse 
quent to the twentieth. Another is of a different nature; it is 
said that Monsieur Dumouriez, convinced that an opposition ta 
the combined forces would prove unavailing, and supposing 
that the rivalry of Austria and Prussia must prevent any cor 
diality of union ; being farther induced to believe, that the 
Prussian cabinet would pursue its own separate interest when 
occasion should offer, without much regard to previous stipu 
lations, and would in fact, rather sacrifice somewhat even of its 
particular interest, than aggrandize in any degree a rival, sore 
from ancient and recent injuries ; Dumouriez, prompted and 
encouraged by these ideas, sought eagerly the occasions of 
treaty with the King of Prussia. That at length he succeeded 
so far as to show that Prince, that the present was a favorable 
moment for giving a final blow to the House of Austria, and 
that France and Prussia would find immense advantage in a 
union, by which he might take up again the business he had 
abandoned in Poland, and thereby foil the schemes of both 
Russia and Austria, That a more evident advantage, though 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 235 

not more certain, would be found in a subsidy of two hundred 
millions of livres, and that he must see the danger of the war 
in its present situation, and might thence the more easily esti 
mate the advantage of abandoning it. 

These reasonings are said to have had the desired effect, 
and that a kind of treaty was entered into ; one article of 
which related to the Royal Family of this country, which is 
to be set at liberty. I have been told farther, that the Execu 
tive Council here will not confirm that part of the bargain 
which relates to the subsidy and the Royal Family, saying, 
which is true enough, that they are in this respect without 
authority. 

I must slightly mention another solution of the late move 
ments, because it is possible that it may be w r ell founded. A 
lady, I think Madame de Guisne, but certainly the daughter of 
Madame de Polignac, is said to have made an impression on 
his Majesty, who is, it seems, very susceptible of violent, 
though not of lasting affection. This young lady is said to 
have been ill treated by her mother, and others who are 
among the principal emigrants, and to have used her influence 
with the King to avenge the slights of her countrymen and 
relations. In the midst of all these different accounts, of 
which perhaps not one is true, the leaders here seem to con 
sider Prussia as weighing no longer in the scale against them. 
Duiaouriez is on his march to Brussels, in which he means to 
take up his winter quarters, and there is in this more of cool 
good sense than at first sight may appear. 

I have already communicated to you the state of things 
here, in what regards subsistence. The country, late the seat 
of war, is totally consumed. Never abundant, it is now T so 
bare that the inhabitants will be reduced to the utmost straits, 
and although the northern frontier is not yet in the same state, 
it would be not far from it before the end of January, if the 
whole of the French army, late in the centre, were stationed 
there. This army is now very numerous, and, from the want 
of discipline, consumes much more than is usually allotted to 



236 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

one of equal number. It is furthermore very sickly, and of 
course the followers must be greatly increased. If he can 
penetrate into Flanders and Brabant, he not only saves the 
provisions which would have been consumed in France, but 
he destroys so much of the resources of the enemy. If he 
can create .a revolution, which may be effected by a very 
small number of the people while supported by a victorious 
army, he obliges the Emperor to confine his efforts to a single 
side of France, namely, that defended by the Ardennes in 
part, and in part by the Rhine. And on this side&gt; it will be 
very difficult to make any serious impression, so long as the 
French continue in their present mind. These objects justify 
some risk by M. Dumouriez ; and he is better able to calcu 
late the extent of that risk, than any mere spectator, 
because he has long had intelligence in that country. The 
undertaking is not however without considerable difficulty. 
There are not indeed any strong towns in his way, but there 
are three strong positions, of which the first is near Mons ; the 
second still stronger on a hill about half way (to the best of 
my recollection) between Mons and Brussels ; and the third 
not far from Brussels itself. The military face of that coun 
try is, you know, understood by all military men with 
perfect exactness, having been the theatre of war for the two 
last centuries ; of course all the advantages, which it gives to 
disciplined armies, will be made use of by those who are to 
defend it. Add to this, that we approach the end of October, 
and though we are just now flattered with fine weather, it is 
not to be expected that those who go due north will meet 
with warm nights and long days in November. A failure 
therefore must be fatal to many ; but this is little thought of 
here just now, because there is no want of men. It will 
count, however, in the next season. Fortune has hitherto 
smiled on the French arms in a manner unexpected to them 
selves, and it may perhaps continue to do so. Much of this 
is in my opinion owing to the folly of their opponents, who 
seem to have fostered the determination to reduce them 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 237 

under a military despotism. The Divine justice will never, I 
hope, permit such impious plans to succeed ; and I always con 
sider Princes, and Generals, and Statesmen, as mere instru 
ments, and generally blind instruments, in the hands of the 
Almighty to work out his ends by ways, which are for the 
most part inscrutable to us. 

I do not say anything about the incursions into Savoy and 
Germany, both brilliant, and the former of which bids fair to 
extend the French Republic to the foot of the Alps, because 
these things, fully detailed in the gazettes, speak for them 
selves. 

As to the domestic affairs here, they are by no means quiet. 
The great majority of the Convention is united in opposition to 
a few members, who are joined to some chiefs in this city, and 
meditate further revolutions. They aver that those, whom they 
call the Brissotines, had no wish to overturn the monarchy, 
but only to get the loaves and fishes for themselves and their 
friends. That the affair of the tenth of August happened not 
only without their aid, but contrary to their wish. That having 
happened, they did indeed take advantage of it to obtain the 
executive power for their particular friends, but even they would 
not consolidate the revolution by destroying its enemies ; a 
business, say they, which was effected on the second of Sep 
tember, and the following days, and which those who now safe 
ly enjoy the fruits of it pretend to blame. 

The Brissotines on the other hand contend, that they alone 
are the true friends of republican government, for which they 
have incessantly labored, ever since the second Assembly met. 
That the attachment they professed to the late constitution was 
only simulated, arid was necessary to cover their attack 
upon it ; that in their various decrees they constantly kept in 
view the advantage to be gained by obliging the King, either 
to sanction what (though agreeable to the popular wish) was 
contrary to the constitution, in which case the constitution would 
have become a dead letter, and have left the field of contest 
open between the King and the legislature, or else, if the King 



238 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

withheld his sanction, it turned the voice of the people against 
him, and left him in consequence exposed to a successful attack, 
whenever the favorable moment should present itself. That 
it was they, in short, who brought forward the plan of an army 
of twenty thousand republicans under the walls of Paris, and 
who took private and effectual measures to bring that army in 
to the field, if, as was apprehended, the King should put a veto 
on the decree. That it was owing to these measures, that the 
Bretons and Marsellois, and other Federes, were on the spot to 
execute the plans of the tenth of August, &tc. 

These are the outlines of the arguments made use of on 
each side to convince the public, that each is exclusively the au 
thor of a republic, which the people find themselves possessed 
of by a kind of magic, or at least a slight of hand, and which 
nevertheless they are as fond of as if it were their own offspring. 

To these main arguments are added a number of subordi 
nate ones, with all the little accessories of time, place, and cir 
cumstance. The majority of the Convention, however, diffi 
dent of the people of this city, and apprehensive that they may 
take it into their heads to make another revolution, when they 
grow tired of the present state of things, have called (private 
ly) for a guard from the different departments. This now 
forms the bone of contention. You will see in the gazettes the 
arguments pro and con. I own that I think it a false stroke in 
politics, though, as a peaceable citizen of Paris, and interested 
in the preservation of order, it is personally agreeable to me. 
On the ground of argument it is clearly a feature not republi 
can, and prima facie implies that the Convention means to do 
things, which a majority of the capital would disapprove, and 
hence it follows again, that either the interests of the capital 
and the provinces are different, or else that the measures in 
contemplation are contrary to the inclinations of both. But it 
is not, I think, on the ground of theoretic argument, that such 
things are to be tried, but from an examination of probable 
consequences. A guard of this sort evidently draws a strong 
broad line of separation between the city and the Convention. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 239 

It gives of course many means for operating on the people to 
those, who are opposed to the Convention. It is among the 
things to be calculated on, that the guard after it has been here 
some time should catch the spirit of the city, be that what it 
may. In such case, instead of protectors they will find ene 
mies in their guard ; but admitting that this should not happen, 
if the guard be feeble, it will be overawed ; if strong, those who 
can influence the guard, will command the Convention, who in 
this case will only have changed masters. If any little check 
should happen on the frontiers, it will be too unpopular to keep 
a considerable body of men for parade, who might be useful 
in camp ; and as soon as they go, the people will rise at once 
to resent the insult offered to them. It seems probable, there 
fore, that this guard will be among the reasons why the Con 
vention may leave this city, and that would give a very serious 
shock, and in many ways. It is to be noted also, that when 
they shall take up a report on the form of government, the op 
position will find vast resources in the opinions of the majority, 
let those be what they may. To these leading points, I might 
add a thousand little things, but you would be tired of such 
particularities. 

With respect to the present temper of the people of this 
country, I am clearly of opinion, that the great decided effec 
tive majority is now for the republic. What may be the tem 
per and opinion six months hence, no prudent sensible man 
would, I think, take upon him to declare. Much must depend 
on the form of government, which shall be presented by the 
Convention. If vigorous, it is very problematical whether the 
departments will adopt it, unless compelled by a sense of im 
pending exterior danger. If feeble, it is (humanly speaking) 
impossible that it can control the effervescent temper of this 
people, and that appears sufficiently by the fate of the late 
constitution. Whether they will be able to strike out that hap 
py mean, which secures all the liberty which circumstances ad 
mit of, combined with all the energy which the same circum 
stances require ; whether they can establish an authority which 



240 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

does not exist, as a substitute (and always a dangerous substi 
tute) for that respect, which cannot be restored after so much 
has been done to destroy it; whether, in crying down and 
even ridiculing religion, they will be able on the tottering and 
uncertain base of metaphysical philosophy to establish a solid 
edifice of morals ; these are questions which time must solve. 
I am, &c.

TO RUFUS KING. 

Paris, October 23d, 1792. 

Dear Sir, 

Yours of the first of September reached me a few days ago. 
Accept my sincere thanks for the information it contains, 
which is precious and highly pleasing. 

I might comment on what you say respecting a print, which 
censures every measure of government, but you will readily 
anticipate all w r hich I might say on that subject. I cannot 
give you such desirable intelligence respecting the state of 
things here, as I might have done if the late revolution had 
not taken place, because I find my intercourse of necessity sus 
pended, and until I have orders respecting the new govern 
ment I am bound to preserve a neutrality of conduct, so that I 
cannot as heretofore peep behind the scenes. Add to this, that 
there is at present no very certain march anyw r here, each feel 
ing himself obliged to deviate according to circumstances from 
the course which he might wish. I will attempt, however, to 
give you an abbreviation of the late events, and in my let 
ters to Mr Jefferson, which may perhaps be communicated to 
the Senate, and at any rate from the gazettes preceding and 
subsequent to the tenth of August, you will be able to fill 
up the outlines of the sketch. 

The late revolution has for its remote cause that excess in 
the human temper, which drives men always to extremes, if 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 241 

not checked and controlled. Fonts pr oximate cause it has 
the vices and defects of the late constitution, and particularly 
that an executive without powers was rendered responsible for 
events, and that a legislature composed of a single chamber of 
representatives was secured by every precaution, and under 
no control except some paper maxims and popular opinion. 
That the people, or rather the populace, a thing which thank 
God is unknown in America, nattered with the idea that they 
are omnipotent, and disappointed from necessity in the golden 
prospects originally held out to them, were under no restraint, 
except such as might be imposed by magistrates of their own 
choice. It resulted inevitably, that the executive must be in 
the power of the legislative, and this last at the mercy of such 
men as could influence the mob. 

By reducing the royal authority below all reasonable mea 
sure, the constitution makers had created a moral impossibili 
ty, that the people should believe the King sincere in his ac 
ceptance, even if it had been possible that he should without 
regret have beheld himself reduced from the first place allotted 
to man, to a state so low as to be exposed to insult from the 
lowest. It was evident then, that the constitution could not 
last, and in the overturn three things might happen, viz. the 
establishment of despotism, the establishment of a good con 
stitution, or the institution of a democracy. The first under an 
able and ambitious Prince was inevitable. The second was 
extremely difficult, not in itself, but because the chiefs of differ 
ent parties all found themselves committed to different points 
and opinions. The last was only a natural continuation of the 
progress of men s minds, in a necessary succession of ideas 
from the bill of rights. The advocates for republican govern 
ment therefore had an easy task, although both to themselves 
and others it appeared difficult. 

From the moment that the second Assembly met, a plan was 
formed among several of the members and others, to overturn 
the constitution, which they had just sworn to observe, and es 
tablish a republic. This arose in part from the desire of pla- 

VOL. II. 21 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

cing themselves better than they could otherwise do, and in 
part from a conviction that the system could not last, and that 
they would have no share in the administration under such a 
pure monarchy. As they had a strong hold upon the lowest 
class of people, as the aristocratic and constitutional parties 
were at open war, as these last avowed openly their wish to 
amend, in other words, to change the constitution, which at the 
same time they assumed to venerate, it was not a difficult 
matter to assault a monarch, who adhered to that form which 
he could not be supposed to approve, and whose faults became 
daily more and more apparent. 

Add to this, that the court was involved in a spirit of little 
paltry intrigue, unworthy of anything above the rank of foot 
men and chambermaids. Every one had his and her little pro 
ject, and every little project had some abettors. Strong man- 
1 y councils frightened the weak, alarmed the envious, and 
wounded the enervate minds of the lazy and luxurious. Such 
councils, therefore, if perchance any such appeared, w T ere ap 
proved but not adopted, certainly not followed. The palace 
was always filled with people whose language, whose conduct, 
whose manner were so diametrically opposite to everything 
likeliberty, that it was easy to persuade the people that the 
court meant to destroy the constitution, by observing strictly 
the constitution. Some persons avowed the tactics, which 
from the moment of such avowal were no longer worth 
a doit. The King, whose integrity would never listen to 
anything like the violation of his oath, had nevertheless 
the weakness to permit those, who openly avowed uncon 
stitutional sentiments, to approach his person, and enjoy his 
intimacy. The Queen was still more imprudent. The re 
publicans (who had also their plan to destroy the constitution 
by the constitution) founded on the King s personal integrity 
their operation to destroy his reputation for integrity, and hold 
him out to the world as a traitor to the nation, which he was 
sworn to protect. 

They in consequence seized every occasion to pass popular 
decrees, which were unconstitutional If the King exercised 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 243 

his veto, he was accused of wishing a counter revolution. If 
he sanctioned the decree, he was so far lost with those, who 
were injured by the decree, and of course became daily more 
and more unprotected. The success of his enemies was be 
yond their own expectation. His palace was assaulted. He 
took refuge with the Assembly, and is now a prisoner of state 
with his family. 

But now the ideas of revolt, which had been fostered for his 
overthrow, are grown very troublesome to those, who have 
possessed themselves of the authority. It is not possible to 
say either to the people or to the sea, so far shalt thou go and 
no farther ; and we shall have, I think, some sharp struggles 
which will make many men repent of what they have done, 
when they find with Macbeth, that they have but taught 
bloody instructions, which return to plague the inventor.

TO ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 

Paris, October 24th, 1792. 
My Dear Sir, 

I have received yours of the twenty- second of June, and am 
in the hourly hope to hear farther from you. I need not tell 
you that it will give me pleasure. Enclosed you will find the 
copy of a letter, which I wrote to Mr Jefferson on the 7th of 
November, 1791. This, with some other communications at 
the same epoch, he never acknowledged. I know not why, 
but I think the paper enclosed in that letter will be agreeable 
to you, though not very amusing. 

It would seem that your friend Scipio is not much attached 
to Paulusj at least if I may judge from some things which I see. 
However, there is a great chasm in my newspapers, which 
breaks the thread of my conjectures, as well as of my informa 
tion ; for I have little, I might almost say, none of the latter but 
from the gazettes ; of course I know what passes about two 



244 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

months after everybody else. Tell me, I pray you, how Scce- 
vola stands affected between the parties just named. I think 
he never had a very high opinion of the first mentioned, but he 
was attached to Tarquin immeasurably, and that, with some 
local circumstances, may have formed a stronger chain than I 
should otherwise suppose. 

You will have seen that the late constitution of this country 
has overset ; a natural accident to a thing, which was all sail and 
no ballast. I desire much, very much, to know the state of 
opinions with you on that subject. Some gentlemen, who con 
sidered it as the acme of human wisdom, must, I suppose, find 
out causes which persons on the spot never dreamt of. But 
in seeking or inventing these causes, what will be their opinion 
of present powers, what the conduct they wish to pursue ? 
These are to me important questions. Brutus will doubtless 
triumph, but I wish to feel the pulse of opinion with you, or 
rather to know beforehand how it is like to beat. There are 
pros and cons, whose action I cannot estimate. The flight of 
Monsieur de Lafayette, the murder of the Duke de laRochefou- 
cault and others, with many similar circumstances, have, I 
know, affected the ideas of some. But what will be the repub 
lican sense as to the new republic ? Will it be taken for grant 
ed, that Louis the Sixteenth was guilty of all possible crimes, 
and particularly of the enormous one of not suffering his throat 
to be cut, which was certainly a nefarious plot against the peo 
ple, and a manifest violation of the bill of rights ? Paulus, who 
is no enemy to Kings, will not believe that-they are all tigers ; 
but I am not certain that, if he were here, he would not con 
sider them as monkeys. 

However, we are done with them in France, at least for the 
present. There are two parties here. The one consists of 
about half a dozen, and the other of fifteen or twenty, who are 
at dagger s drawing. Each claims the merit of having made 
the young republic. My public letters and the gazettes will 
bring you acquainted with things here, as fully as I can in any 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 245 

way communicate them. It is not worth while to detail the 
characters of those now on the stage, because they must soon 
give place to others. Adieu.

TO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL. 

Paris, November 5th, 1792. 

My Dear Carmichael, 

I have received your letters of the twenty-ninth of August, 
and fifteenth of October. I feel perfectly your situation* and 
have frequently lamented that you had not powers equal to 
the position in which you are placed. It would seem that 
we know not yet the value of the moment, and I fear that we 
shall find to our cost that post est opportunitas calva. When 
Mr Short was here, he talked of going to Madrid, but, from 
what cause I know not, appeared to me indecisive, and appre 
hensive, to a degree which was astonishing. Whether this 
arises*from nature, or from long habits of ease in this city, I 
know not. 

I shall forward by Colonel Smith to Mr Pinckney, the in 
telligence you sent me for him. I shall tell him at the same 
time that, in my opinion, the principal object in contemplation 
is France, and that the United States are only affected by a 
side wind. However, that is of little importance, since a side 
wind may do as much mischief to our ship as any other. 

As to the state of things here, I can give you no very satis 
factory or flattering accounts. True it is that the French 
arms are crowned with great success. Towns fall before them 
without a blow, and the declaration of rights produces an ef 
fect equal at least to the trumpets of Joshua ; but as on the 
one hand [ never questioned the force of France if united, and 
her natural enthusiasm warmed by the ardor of newborn free 
dom, so on the other I was always apprehensive, that they 
would be deficient in that cool reflection, which appears need- 



246 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

ful to consolidate a free government. We read in the history 
of man, as it is developed in the great book of nature, that em 
pires do by no means depend on their success in arms, but on their 
civil, religious, and political constitutions, and that in the framing 
of these it is a useless question what kinds are best in them 
selves. The more so, as good and bad here below, but es 
pecially in that which we now contemplate, are mere relative 
terms. The true object of a great statesman is to give to any 
particular nation the kind of laws, which is suitable to them, 
and the best constitution which they are capable of. Now 
by as much as it is an easy thing, and within the compass of 
every schoolboy, to deal in generals and abstractions, pursuing 
demonstrations which in moral subjects are frequently least 
exact when they appear to be most evident, by so much is it 
of high and almost insurmountable difficulty, to descend into 
the nice estimates of manners, habits, and sentiments, and, 
amidst the discord of loud and contradictory passions and in 
terests, to discover the means of establishing a harmonious 
system, where each part has the needful relation to every other, 
and to the great whole. &gt; 

These observations are, I know, familiar to you, and to ev 
ery other sensible man, who has had much experience in hu 
man affairs ; but they are heathen Greek, or, if you will, flat 
nonsense, when addressed to those new fledged statesmen, who 
are always positive and peremptory in proportion to their ig 
norance of politics. But even if we should suppose, that by 
miracle the men of a day should be imbued with the impor 
tant truths, which it is necessary to the peace and happiness of 
society that its rulers should be acquainted with, still we are a 
great, and I might say, an immense distance from the object. 
Before the people will assent to the form of government, 
which in hypothesis shall be supposed the most fitting for 
them, they must be convinced of the fitness. No easy task, 
believe me ; even if man were a reasonable creature, but he 
is not. He is a creature of sense, and governed invariably by 
his feelings. Now you can easily make him feel, that in point 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 247 

of right he is equal to every other man. Vanity may even 
whisper to him that he is so in point of talent, and if vanity 
wedb remiss, the prompter flattery is at hand. But the more 
he feels his equality of rights and talents, the more must he 
feel his inequality in point of possessions. Where these are 
wanting, he has rights which he cannot exercise, talents which 
he cannot employ, desires which he cannot gratify, and, in 
consequence, resentments which he cannot allay. 

Now the severe law of property is, that in any well settled 
country a few must soon possess all, and the majority, the 
great majority, nothing. Between that economy, which con 
stitutes the tyranny of the rich, and that misery which en 
slaves the poor, let the form of government be what it may, 
there is a constant struggle which forms great men, and great 
men are generally ambitious men. Their equals in property 
are as much enslaved by their pleasures, as the poorer kinds, 
can possibly be by their wants. In such a state of things, 
where the constitution is not balanced in its structure, and 
supported by strong props of private interest, it must be 
overturned. I quit these investigations to tell you, that all 
here is in a state of uncertainty. Time will disclose the 
events with which he is charged in their due season. Some 
of them I think will be of sable hue. I am, &LC.

TO THOMAS PINCKNEY. 

Paris, December 3d, 1792. 

My Dear Sir, 

I have received yours of the ninth, and will show to the 
bearer, Mr Scott, every attention which my time and affairs 
will permit. 

The Swedish Minister, whom you speak of, is not yet arriv 
ed, neither do I expect one. The former Ambassador did 
indeed announce to his family, the intention to come hither 



248 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

in his way to Switzerland, in order to settle some private af 
fairs. An important negotiation would not be committed to 
him, I think. , f ; , 

Success, as you will see, continues to crown the French 
arms, but it is not our trade to judge from success. We must 
observe the Civil, Moral, Religious and Political Institutions. 
These have a steady and lasting effect, and these only. You 
will soon learn that the patriots, hitherto adored, were but lit 
tle worthy of the incense they received. The enemies of 
those, who now reign, treat them as they did their predeces 
sors, and as their successors will be treated. 

Since I have been in this country, I have seen the worship 
of many idols, and but little of the true God. I have seen 
many of those idols broken, and some of them beaten to dust. 
I have seen the late constitution, in one short year, admired as 
a stupendous monument of human wisdom, and ridiculed as an 
egregious production of folly and vice. I wish much, very 
much, the happiness of this inconstant people. I love them, I 
feel grateful for their efforts in our cause, and I consider the 
establishment of a good constitution here as the principal 
means, under Divine Providence, of extending the blessings of 
freedom to the many millions of my fellow men, who groan in 
bondage on the continent of Europe. But I do not greatly 
indulge the flattering illusions of hope, because I do not yet 
perceive that reformation of morals, without which liberty is 
but an empty sound. I have the honor to be, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Paris, December 21st, 1792. 
Dear Sir, 

I have received your favors of the twelfth of July, and fif 
teenth of October.* The last reached me yesterday, by ex- 

* See Jefferson s Writings, Vol. iii. p. 19L 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 249 

press from Bordeaux. I am astonished to find, that so late as the 
middle of October you had received but one of my letters. I 
had taken every precaution agaiest miscarriages, but there is 
no answering for the negligence of those one is obliged to em 
ploy in the posts. 

When I mentioned supplies to St Domingo, I certainly 
meant that such supplies should be purchased by French 
agents in the United States, and that the money should be ad 
vanced by us in diminution of our debt, upon such terms as 
that the United States should not lose in the mode of payment, 
but the contrary, besides the advantage of expending such 
large sums in the purchase of objects, the growth, produce, and 
manufacture of our country, and of its industrious inhabitants. 
As to specific supplies, I had declared in pointed terms, that 
the American government would by no means enter into stipu 
lations of any kind, with relation thereto. I am happy to find 
that, on this occasion, my sentiments have so fully coincided 
with yours. 

It gives meal so great relief to be informed, that until further 
orders the payments are suspended. You will have seen that 
on this point I have been hard run, and I do assure you that 
if fear, or interest, would have induced me to swerve from the 
line of duty, there were not wanting sufficient motives. But 
it is not needful to relate such particulars, and you may rely 
that I shall not communicate your present instruction respect 
ing our debt, unless I shall be of opinion that it will become 
serviceable to the honor or interest of the United States. 

I see with concern that the Indian war is like to continue. 
This war prevents the investments of European money in the 
purchase of our waste lands, and I have already expressed to 
you my conviction, that this species of investiture would be as 
salutary, as the engrossing of our domestic debt is pernicious. 
The distressed state of things here induces many to turn their 
attention towards us, and consequently occasions numerous ap 
plications to me. I endeavor, as far as propriety will admit, to 
lead people to a preference of American lands, but I am sorry 



250 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

to observe that the disposition to invest in our funds is predom 
inant, and that we shall thereby become tributary to those who 
obtain, below its value, a sjiare of those funds. I think it rny 
duty to mention this to you, to the end that if any measures 
can be devised to enhance the value with you, and thereby 
lessen the negotiations, or at least obtain thereon the compe 
tent value, such measures may be adopted. 

Although I step very much out of my sphere for the purpose, 
I feel myself bound also to mention, respecting this Indian war, 
some ideas which have formerly suggested themselves to me, 
and which the circumstances of the present moment seem to 
favor in a peculiar manner. I cannot but think, that it would 
be well to build a fleet on Lake Erie, having for that purpose 
established a strong post at Presque Isle, which is, I believe, the 
only good harbor on the south side-of that Lake, and to send 
also a Flotille from Oswego, with flour and salt provisions, to 
be transported by way of Niagara. As to this last measure, 
if not obstructed by the British, it would considerably lessen 
the expense, and if opposed, would terminate that situation of 
demi-hostility, which has but too much existed with them. If 
a body of fifteen hundred men were sent with all the needful 
stores by water, in good vessels, they might establish a strong 
post near the Miami Towns, and carry on from thence a war of 
devastation, which would force the savages to abandon the coun 
try, and that is, I believe, the only effectual means of obtaining 
peace with them. 

You will find enclosed herewith my letters of the twenty- 
seventh of September, and twenty-third of October. I have 
had no good opportunity since the latter of those dates. If, 
indeed, America had been at the distance of only fifty leagues, 
I should have given you every two or three days the state of 
men and things ; but placed as we are, both morally and physi 
cally in respect to this country, I should only have wearied 
you by the little uninteresting histories of persons and projects, 
whose existence will soon be consigned to an endless oblivion. 
It has however appeared to me important to obtain, as nearly as 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 251 

may be, a view of the greater events which may probably 
arise, because the conduct of the United States will, I pre 
sume, be squared rather to that state of things, which you may 
conceive likely to be established, than to the fluctuating chan 
ces of an hour which passes away. 

I shall resume, then, my account of things where I last left 
it, viz. in the projected invasion of Flanders ; and first, it may 
be proper to cast an eye on the structure and consistence of 
the French armies. The leading feature here is an artillery, 
which is, beyond all controversy, the best in Europe, and like 
ly to continue so from two causes. First, that the Frenchman 
is by nature a better artillerist than almost any other man, it 
being in his temper, and, and if I may say so, in his blood 
and marrow to act suddenly and without deliberation. Hence 
he becomes very dexterous in those things, which are to be per 
formed at a single motion, and by a single glance, but rarely 
acquires a knowledge of any business which requires constant, 
close, and undissipaied attention. Secondly, the excellence 
of the French artillery depends upon the great care and cul 
ture of their natural disposition. The able men, who have for 
merly been at the head of their military affairs, had the merit 
of knowing the character they had to do with, and therefore 
(quitting what appeared unattainable in the military art) sought 
perfection there, where Frenchmen could find it. They des 
paired of forming solid columns of infantry, moving with the 
exact precision of German discipline. It happens, therefore, 
that the present French army differs less from what the French 
armies have been heretofore, than would easily have been sup 
posed. The same enthusiasm of enterprise, the same con 
tempt of danger, the same impetuosity of valor, and the same 
impatience of control, still mark the nation which inhabits the 
country that was once ancient Gaul. 

They have, as heretofore, overrun Flanders, made impres 
sion on Germany, and occupied Savoy. Dumouriez, in his 
Flemish expedition, combined the arts of a politician with the 
bravery of an experienced soldier. You know that the inhab- 



252 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

itants of the Low Countries were indisposed to the domination 
of the House of Austria, particularly since the attempts of Jo 
seph the Second to weaken the influence of the priesthood. 
During the latter part of his reign, there had sprung up three 
parties, viz. the Bigots, who wanted a kind of theocracy, to be 
exercised by the priesthood ; The Nobility and substantial 
burghers^ who wished to established a free and well organized 
constitution ; and the French party, or those who were desirous 
of levelling the nobles; and above all, the church, which possess 
es as you know the greatest part of the Flemish territory. 

On the return of imperial authority, after the revolt under 
Vandernoot and Van Eupen, the second party above mention 
ed, naturally enough fell in with the government, as they had 
already experienced no little tyranny from the priests, and saw 
much danger in the prevalence of French ideas. They stick 
led however, for a confirmation of ancient chartered rights, 
and the disputes on that chapter were still open. They hoped 
that the war, whose avowed object on the part of France was 
to drive out the House of Austria, would induce the Emperor 
to cede the points in controversy. The cabinet of Vienna, on 
the other hand, believing in a certain victory over the French 
government, rather wished, than feared revolt ; and when the 
face of affairs had materially changed, it was too late to retract, 
since the concession of weakness, neither conciliates affection 
nor commands respect. 

The agents of the different parties, who had preserved a con 
nexion more or less direct with Dumouriez, were urgent with 
him to go into Flanders, as soon as the Prussian army began to 
retreat, and he adroitly flattered each with the hope of favoring 
its particular views. This was done at the expense of a little 
lying, which does not cost him much. By these means the 
crafty priests were as completely duped as their adversaries, 
and more so. 

After the battle of Jemappe when he had taken possession 
of Mons, he took care to proscribe the adherents to the Emper 
or, which left but two parties to deal with ; and although the 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 253 

ecclesiatics began to perceive their danger, it was now too late, 
and they were obliged to pretend an attachment which they 
did not feel, and which served his temporary purpose as effect 
ually as if it had been sincere. But he had too much sense 
not to know, that measures hostile to the real interests of the 
country could only be carried into effect by those, who have 
no common interest with the country, the populace of the large 
towns, who, having some chance to gain by turning all things 
topsy turvy, and who being happily secure against the possi 
bility of loss because they have nothing to lose, are always the 
ready instruments of mischief to those, who can bring themselves. 
to use them for destructive purposes. He, therefore, published 
a proclamation, which may in a few words be transmitted into an 
order to be free, according to his ideas of freedom, on pain of 
military execution. As a military man, he had almost insured 
success by advancing with three armies, the last of which was 
equal to all the force the enemy could muster, and the centre, 
which he commanded, was double that spread over the differ 
ent parts of that level country. At the affair of Jemappe, he 
commanded eighty-six thousand men, although they were not 
all in action, because eighty thousand cannot act together on 
only two sides of eighteen thousand. By the bye, this affair, 
notwithstanding the accounts published, was decided by the 
immense train of heavy artillery which the French employed, 
and the proof is in the retreat of the Austrians, who carried off 
their cannon, a thing impossible, had the lines been taken, as 
was said, by assault ; but the truth is, that the assault was giv 
en after the retreat was begun, and the Hungarian Grena 
diers, who brought up the rear, were in course cut to pieces. 

Dumouriez, as soon as he had got fairly in possession of 
Brussels, began to develope his particular plans. It was 
never his intention to continue, if he could avoid it, in the 
capacity of a servile agent to the Executive Council ; but they 
also were aware of his views ; hence the course of his suc 
cesses naturally tended to a breach between them. There 
were additional reasons on each side, both of safety and advan-

254 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

tage, too tedious to enumerate, because it is sufficient to state 
those sentiments which may govern events, without developing 
all the sources from which they originate. The Council gave 
orders for opening the Scheldt, with design to captivate by that 
measure, the attention of the people of Brabant, and, lessening 
his influence, increase their own. He struggled against that 
measure but in vain. Having, however, made the step, he 
formed the farther plan of attacking the Dutch, who were by 
no means prepared to receive him ; and the party in that 
country, which calls itself Patriotic, and which others would be 
very apt to term Aristocratic, immediately opened an intelli 
gence with him. 

The governing powers here, in the midst of all these plans, 
(and intoxicated by success, perhaps,) declared themselves 
the allies of all those, who would revolt against established 
authority, and the enemies of all those who would not revolt. 
They determined that everybody should be free, French fash 
ion, and should pay the expense which might attend the mak 
ing of them free. This last address to the purse was not, 
perhaps, well calculated for the taste either of the Hollanders 
or Flemings ; but the latter must for the present submit to 
whatever impositions may be laid on them, being in the pow 
er of this country. 

Shortly after the plan was laid for invading Holland, of 
which the above mentioned decree was a partial execution, 
two circumstances arose which changed the measures of the 
Council. The French army began to lessen very much ; but 
this is a subject which I must treat separately ; and therefore 
barely mention it in this place. The other circumstance was, 
that the ministers and agents they had employed in London 
assured them, that, although the declaration respecting the 
Scheldt had occasioned much alarm, and irritated at the same 
time the British cabinet, yet they might avoid hostilities, if 
they did not actually invade the Dutch territory. They, in 
consequence, gave orders to Dumouriez to abandon his design 
upon the Netherlands, and turn his arms to another quarter. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 255 

These he refused to obey ; but being reiterated, and things here 
being a little different from what he hoped, he has within 
these few days submitted ; but I shall come to this part of the 
history presently ; and here I will conclude as to Holland, by 
adding that the agents of the patriotic party press the govern 
ment hard to attack their native country immediately, but are 
told that the time is not favorable, that they will certainly 
march that way by and bye, but that at present they have not 
sufficient force nor supplies. 

You will observe, that M. Lebrun* declares to the Assem 
bly, that they are guiltless of any design against Holland, and 
that England cannot justly complain on that score. I pre 
sume, however, that the British ministry are exactly informed 
of the contrary ; but be that as it may, you may rely on what 
I relate to you. In respect to the Flemish, before I leave 
them, I must tell you that their ancient hatred to the French is 
all revived, and is, if possible, more violent than ever. Seve 
ral reasons for this appear from what I have already said ; but 
there is one cause, affecting equally all the neighbors of 
France, and which it may be well in this place to mention, ft 
would seem, at first sight, somewhat strange, that the people in 
the world, the most amiable at home, should be the most disa 
greeable abroad ; but this is strictly true. The morals, or 
rather the want of morals, in this country, places every one at 
his ease. He may be virtuous if he pleases, but there is no 
necessity either to be, or to appear so, consequently, both good 
men, and bad men, can enjoy the society of Paris; but when 
the French go abroad, they desire to introduce among other 
people the same free and easy principles, which do by no 
means suit the taste of those, who consider a chaste and order 
ly deportment essential to the peace and happiness of civil so 
ciety. 

The open contempt of religion, also, cannot but be offensive 
to all sober minded men ; add to this, a style of conversation,

256 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

which runs on the insulting comparison between their own 
usages, and those of the people with whom they live. In this 
they naturally, and I believe justly, give a preference to their 
own, but this preference becomes irksome to others, especial 
ly, if, in the expression of it, there should be mingled some lit 
tle contempt, which is not uncommon. The French emi 
grants had wearied out all those countries, which for two years 
past they have infested, and had accumulated on their own 
heads the antipathies, which had been previously extended to 
all their countrymen. Nay, from this hatred to them sprang 
up a kind of left-handed love for the Jacobins, it being natural 
to like those who war on the persons whom we dislike. But 
no sooner do the French armies enter into a country, than the 
scene changes. The emigrants do not indeed find favor, but 
the original sentiments of the people return in regard to the 
French nation. These sentiments are universally unfavorable, 
as I observed (with sorrow and surprise) in a journey I made 
two years ago through Flanders, and a part of Germany, viz. 
that which is the seat of the war. 

The irruption into Germany, under Custine, was attended 
with the same rapid success as that of Dumouriez, into the 
Low Countries. Mayence was surrendered, rather to the As- 
signats, than to the arms of France, it is believed. Frankfort 
naturally fell, as being a neutral city. Contributions were 
raised in both, and you will see with astonishment, that the 
Deputies sent from Frankfort, to solicit the remitment of her 
contribution, were made prisoners here, when their city was 
retaken by the Prussian and Hessian forces. This recapture 
was attended with strong circumstances to show that hatred of 
the French, which I have above mentioned. Custine s ad 
vance into Germany was certainly hazarded beyond the rules 
of prudence, and it will be well if he escapes with no further 
loss, than what he has already suffered. His present situation 
is certainly critical, since the Council have thought proper to 
order on Dumouriez to his relief. And here, by the way, it 
will be well to remind you, that the distance from Valenci- 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 257 

ennes to Liege is about one half the distance from Liege to 
Mayence, and that the former is a level, open country, the lat 
ter a country of defiles, at least for a considerable part of the 
distance. Add to this, the season, which is already severe in 
that quarter, and must, in all human probability, become more 
so every day, and you will easily see why Dumouriez in 
agreeing, at last, to obey his orders, has declared that he will 
by no means be responsible for the success. You will recol 
lect, also, the diminution of the French armies, which it is 
proper now to state more particularly. 

The alarm spread through France after the affair of the 
tenth of August ; the call to defend their country, a call which 
must ever be efficacious so long as men are endued with the 
feelings of men ; the boiling spirit of the nation, and the 
strenuous exertions of those against whom the Duke of 

O 

Brunswick had denounced an inexpiable war, had called into 
the field six hundred thousand men. Presently, France re 
newed the appearance of a nation of warriors, overflowing on 
every side, and bearing down with an irresistible impetuosity 
every obstacle. Her enemies, who had never brought against 
her, in the whole, above one hundred and fifty thousand, and 
who were much reduced by sickness and fatigue, found them 
selves obliged to retire, and had no resource but to impede a 
progress which they could not prevent. This government, on 
the other hand, sensible that the next campaign w r ould press 
them hard, and feeling, in spite of delusive appearances, that 
a paper system of finance must at length sink under the enor 
mous weight of their expenses, thought it wise to push to the 
utmost their successes, and were little solicitous about a loss 
of men, which they could supply more easily than their en 
emies. 

But there is, to the physical powers of man, a narrower 
bound than to his moral conceptions. Excessive fatigue, want 
of necessaries, and bad accommodations, have carried many to 
the grave. Not a few have fallen in action. At the present 
moment, there are in the different military hospitals seventy- 
22* 



258 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

five thousand sick beds, and at Liege their hospital stores are 
so greatly deficient, that the inhabitants have been compelled 
to furnish all their spare beds and mattrasses, notwithstanding 
which, many of the sick soldiers lie on the straw. The ex 
tent of country which they occupy, and the projected changes 
in government, contrary to the wish of the majority of the 
people, render it necessary to keep up garrisons, beyond those 
which are placed on the communications. 

A great proportion of the volunteers, who had turned out 
at first to defend their country, who had afterwards been 
prompted by a national spirit and temper to march into the 
neighboring states, and who, from the same spirit and temper, 
pursued as long as their limbs would support them, sinking at 
last under fatigue, have stopped, and from that moment it is 
in their nature to return, such of them at least as are able ; of 
consequence, the troops in condition to act are, comparatively 
speaking, but a handful, although still numerous. 

You will see by the gazettes, that the armies of France have 
frequently been straitened for subsistence, and surely this is 
not to be wondered at. Lorraine is so completely eaten up, 
that, as 1 am credibly informed, above one hundred thousand 
of its inhabitants had left it before the present month, for want 
of food. A contagious dysentery had swept off numbers in 
that quarter. You know the country from Aix La Chapelle 
to Coblentz, and that having been the theatre of war almost 
since the first of August, it will be impossible to find anything 
in it, and that confined by the Ardennes on one side, and the 
Rhine on the other, nothing can be brought to it but by a 
land transportation of at least fifty leagues. I fear that even, 
had Dumouriez quartered his troops as he intended in and 
about Liege, it would have been extremely difficult to have 
collected magazines, especially for his cavalry. What must it 
be, when he gets to the neighborhood of Bonn. Beurnonville 
is, you will see, pushing with an army of thirty thousand men 
towards Coblentz, by the way of Treves. A rugged country 
of fastnesses, defended by the winter, and fifteen thousand 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 259 

Austrian troops are opposed to him. Consequently his progress 
is slow, and by and bye his convoys will be exposed to parties 
from the garrison of Luxembourg. Thus you see, Sir, that 
France is warring at present against nature herself, as it were, 
and sanguine men hope for success. If it be obtained, the 
enemy will open the next campaign under manifest disadvan 
tages. But we must not yet enter into that consideration. 

You will have seen that the Jacobin club is as much at war 
with the present government, as it was with the preceding. 
Victory or death, is the word with both parties. Hitherto the 
majority of the Convention have had rather the advantage, al 
though they frequently decree what they do not wish. The 
ministers, possessing vastly more patronage than any monarch 
since Louis the Fourteenth, secured by that means the influ 
ence of the majority, their friends and the Jacobins, who, 
backed by the Parisian populace, have been several times 
within an inch of ruin. Luckily for them, their adversaries 
are many of them timid, while the Jacobin leaders are daring 
and determined. 

It is now some time since the Jacobins despatched Bonne- 
Carrere to make overtures to Dumouriez, whose quarrel with 
the Council was then just breaking out. It was then understood, 
that if Dumouriez threw up his commission in disgust, his 
army would presently retreat back to Valenciennes ; and this 
it \vas supposed would justify a coup de main in this city, and 
extend the influence of it through all France, Ever since 
this embassy of Bonne-Carrere, things have been ripening fast 
on both sides. At present there is a schism in the ministry, 
and Pache, the Minister of War, throws his weight into the 
scale of opposition. Dumouriez has, I am told, acceded, 
notwithstanding the adulations and concessions of the othei 
party, and the coalition now nearly balance their opponents. 

A late circumstance brought forward a show of forces, and 
though it is rather anticipating a different subject, I must state 
it here. The Brissotines, finding themselves hard pushed 
towards the killing of the King, and apprehensive, not with- 



260 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

out reason, that this might be a signal for their own destruc 
tion, determined on a measure not a little hazardous, but de 
cisive. This was the expulsion of the Bourbons, a blow 
originally levelled at the Duke of Orleans. The motion was 
carried, but the Convention have been obliged to suspend the 
decree, and that is, I think, equivalent to a repeal. The sus 
pension evidently was pronounced under the influence of the 
Tribunes. Many members have talked of leaving Paris, but 
the same fear, which controls them while in this city, will pre 
vent them from quitting it. At least, such is my opinion. 

I come now to the trial of the King, and the circumstances 
connected with it. To a person less intimately acquainted 
than you are with the history of human affairs, it would seem 
strange that the mildest monarch who ever filled the French 
throne, one who is precipitated from it precisely because he 
would not adopt the harsh measures of his predecessors, a 
man whom none could charge with a criminal or cruel act, 
should be prosecuted as one of the most nefarious tyrants, that 
ever disgraced the annals of human nature. That he, Louis 
the Sixteenth, should be prosecuted even to death. Yet such 
is the fact. I think it highly probable that he may suffer, and 
that for the following causes. The majority of the Assembly 
found it necessary to raise, against this unhappy Prince, the 
national odium, in order to justify the dethroning him (which, 
after what he had suffered, appeared to be necessary even to 
their safety) and to induce the ready adoption of a republican 
form of Government. Being in possession of his papers, and 
those of his servants, it was easy, if they would permit them 
selves to extract, to comment, to suppress, and to mutilate, 
it was very easy to create such opinions as they might think 
proper. The rage which has been excited was terrible ; and, 
although it begins to subside, the Convention are still in great 
straits ; fearing to acquit, fearing to condemn, and yet urged 
to destroy their captive Monarch. 

The violent party are clamorous against him, for reasons 
which I will presently state. The Monarchic and Aristocratic 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 261 

parties wish his death, in the belief that such catastrophe would 
shock the national feelings, awaken their hereditary attach 
ments, and turn into the channels of loyalty the impetuous 
tide of opinion. Thus, he has become the common object of 
hatred to all parties, because he has never been the decided 
patron of any one. If he is saved, it will be by the justice of 
his cause, which will have some little effect, and by the pity 
which is universally felt, though none dare express it openly, 
for the very harsh treatment which he has endured. 

I come now to the motives of the violent party. You will 
see that Louvet, whose pamphlet, with many others, I send 
you, has charged on this party the design to restore royalty in 
the person of the Duke of Orleans. This man s character and 
conduct give but too much room to suspect him of criminal 
intentions. In general, I doubt the public virtue of a profligate, 
and cannot help suspecting appearances put on by such per 
sons. I have besides many particular circumstances, which 
lead me to believe that he has, from the beginning, played a 
deep and doubtful game ; but I believe also, that on the present 
occasion, as on some preceding, he is the dupe. Shortly after 
the tenth of August, 1 had information on which you may rely, 
that the plan of Danton was to obtain the resignation of the 
King, and get himself appointed chief of a council of regency, 
composed of his creatures, during the minority of the Dau 
phin. This idea has never, I believe, been wholly abandoned. 
The Cordeliers, (or privy council, which directs the Jacobin 
movements,) know well the danger of intervening the order of 
succession. They know how to appreciate the fluctuating opin 
ions of their countrymen, and though they are very willing to 
employ the Duke of Orleans in their work, I am much mistak 
en, if they will consent to elevate him to the throne. So that, 
for his share of the guilt, he may probably be rewarded with 
the shame of it, and the mortifying reflection that after all the 
conflicts of his political warfare, he has gained no victory but 
over his own conscience. 

It is worthy of remark, that, although the Convention has 



262 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

been now near four months in session, no plan of a constitution 
is yet produced. Nevertheless, the special authority commit 
ted to them by the people, and the only authority, perhaps, 
which cannot be contested, was to prepare such a plan. 

I shall now, Sir, make a few reflections on the state of For 
eign powers. The adoption of Savoy, as an additional depart 
ment, forms one ground on which the adversaries of this coun 
try contend, that their protestations against conquest were only 
delusive. But the declaration, that they would erect the stand 
ard of liberty everywhere, forms the great cause with some, 
and pretext with others, for endeavoring to crush the Re 
public. 

On" the conduct likely to be pursued by Great Britain, al 
though that of Holland stands in close connexion, I shall not 
permit myself to hazard much conjecture, because Mr Pinck- 
ney will, I am persuaded, keep you fully informed, and be 
cause the accounts which Mr Short has given you will throw 
light on the same subject. I have already troubled you with 
some ideas respecting the interior state of Great Britain, and I 
add here my opinion, that sooner or later they must go into 
the war. Mr Hammond s manoeuvres will give you some good 
clue, I think, and perhaps hostile decisions at St James s may 
produce pacific dispositions among the Indian tribes. I am 
sure I need not add that it would be well to make the Indians, 
as the price of peace, declare who set them on. Perhaps in 
resentment of that conduct which may be pursued, they may 
take it in their heads to make Mr Simcoe a visit. 

The Elector of Hanover, as member of the German Em 
pire, must come into the field ; and from inclination and inter 
est^ he will do so, I think, fully. The contingent of Saxony 
will be sent forward with speed, and notwithstanding the de 
bauched temper of the Elector of Bavaria, as his dominions in 
the Palatinate are exposed, as well as his Dutchy of Juliers, 
he must exert himself. A strong squadron of British men of 
war would rouse all Italy. And without them, the French 
arms may make considerable progress in that fertile, feeble 
country. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 263 

As to Spain, I think the court is too corrupt, and too profli 
gate, to make any considerable efforts. Bankrupt, almost, in full 
peace, with the mines of Mexico and Peru at their disposal, 
what would a war produce ? The chances are, that France 
will make an inroad, rather than suffer one in that quarter. 
Russia menaces, but the state of her finances, and the great dis 
tance, must make her efforts fall short of her wishes. Every 
art is used on each side to influence the Turk, and I own to 
you, that I rather apprehend that England and the Imperial 
Courts combined will prove successful, especially as Monsieur 
de Choiseul Gouffier is now openly active there on the part of 
the emigrant Princes. Should his Highness interfere, he will 
draw after him all the Barbary powers ; and the want of the 
grain usually drawn from them, will not be the least evil that 
will thereby fall upon the Provinces bordering on the Medi 
terranean sea. 

Austria and Prussia are making their utmost efforts, and the 
Prince of Hesse, who (strange as it may seem) is adored by his 
subjects, will second those efforts to the utmost of his ability. 

Such, my dear Sir, is the foreign storm lowering over this 
country, in which you will see, that my predictions respecting 
corn, have been hitherto exactly verified. How they are to ob 
tain supplies from abroad, in the face of the maritime powers, I 
own myself at a loss to conjecture. It is nevertheless in this 
awful moment, and immediately after expediting the orders 
to recruit their army to six hundred thousand effectives, in or 
der to sustain the land war, that they affect to wish Britain 
would declare against them, and actually menace, as you see, 
the government with an appeal to the nation. There are 
cases in which events must decide on the quality of actions, 
which are bold or rash, according to the success. 

The circumstances of a war with Britain becomes impor 
tant to us in more cases than one. The question respecting 
the guarantee of American possessions may perhaps be agita 
ted, especially if France should attempt to defend her islands. 
There will doubtless be many in the United States, who will 



264 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

contend that the treaty made with the King is at least suspend 
ed, if not abrogated, by the abrogation of his office and authori 
ty. Without entering into the numerous arguments on this sub 
ject, some of them forcible, and all of them plausible, I will on 
ly pray your indulgence while I express my wish that all our 
treaties, however onerous, may be strictly fulfilled according 
to their true intent aand meaning. The honest nation is that, 
which, like the honest man, 

Hath to its plighted faith and vow forever firmly stood, 

And though it promise to its loss, yet makes that promise good. 

I feel, nevertheless, the full force of your observation, 
that until the nation shall have adopted some regular form of 
government, we may not know in what manner, or to what 
person, our obligations are to be acquitted. 

Before I close this too long letter, excuse me for mention 
ing that a statue of General Washington, ordered by the State 
of Virginia, is finished, and for requesting to know to what

TO ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 

Paris, December 24th, 1792. 

My Dear Sir, 

I wrote to you on the twenty- fourth of October, and have 
not since received any of your letters. In that I acknowledg 
ed yours of the 22d of June. You will have seen from the 
public prints the wonderful success of the French arms, aris 
ing from the following causes. 1. That the enemy, deceived 
by the emigrants, counted too lightly on the opposition he was 
to meet with. 2. That from like misinformation, instead of 
attacking on the northern frontier, backed by the resources of 
Flanders, and those which the ocean would supply, they came 
across the Ardennes to that part of Champaign, nicknamed 
the lousy, from its barrenness and misery. 3. That in this ex- 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 265 

pedition, where the difficulty of the roads, transportation and 
communication was the greatest they expected, it so happened 
that the season, usually dry and fair, (when those bad roads 
are at the best) was one continued rain for two months, so that 
at length they were nearly stuck fast, and had as much as they 
could do to drag back their cannon, &c. through the mud. 
Lastly, that France brought into the field, and has kept up un 
til very lately, the immense number of six hundred thousand 
troops. This has been done at an average expense of about 
five millions sterling per month beyond their resources, and 
yet they have ordered a like army for the next campaign, and 
talk boldly of meeting Great Britain also upon her element. 
What say you to that, Monsieur le Financier? But I will tell 
you in your ear, that in spite of that blustering, they will do 
much to avoid a war with Great Britain, if the people will let 
them, but the truth is, that the populace of Paris influence in 
a great degree the public councils. I think they will have 
quite as many men as they can maintain ; but what that may 
amount to is hard to determine. 

The ministers here are most extraordinary people. They 
make nothing of difficulties, as you shall judge by a single trait 
of M. Pache, the minister at War. He had sent Beurnonville 
to occupy the Moselle river down to Coblentz, taking Treves 
and other places in his way. Now this way lies through a ve 
ry difficult mountainous country, in which the snow is very 
deep, therefore Beurnonville, having got a little neck of land 
between the Saar and the Moselle, puts his troops into winter 
quarters, pleading their nakedness as an excuse. The min 
ister has sent him a brace of commissioners, who have power 
to impress in the neighborhood whatever may be needful for 
the troops, and then (their wants supplied) summon him to 
obey his orders. T have given to Mr Jefferson a pretty full 
account of the state of things, so that if you see that account, 
which I take it is of course, you may measure by the standard 
now given you all other affairs. 

If I may venture to judge from appearances, there is now in 
VOL. ii. 23 



266 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

the wind a storm not unlike that of the second of September, 
Whether it will burst or blow over, it is impossible to deter 
mine. 

It has occurred to me, that I never yet assigned a reason 
why the completion of payment of six million livres, which at 
Mr Short s request I had stipulated for with the government 
lately abolished, appeared to me desirable. In effect, I left 
this as I do many other things to the sense of the gentle read 
er, but as readers are sometimes ungentle, it is not amiss to 
communicate that reason to a friend. I saw that the new 
government would be hungry, and would urge us for money in 
the double view of obtaining an acknowledgment of them, as 
well as of supplying their wants. It was therefore, I thought, 
right to take a position where we might say there is nothing 
due. This would leave open a question, which it would be 
very delicate to answer either way, as things appeared then, 
and as they are now that appearances have changed. You 
will have seen the manoeuvres to force me in that intrench- 
ment ; but at last, like your friend General Lee, I was quite 
at the worst for a retrograde manoeuvre. 

But I concluded that supplies of money to support the 
colony of St Domingo would, in all events, have been consider 
ed as a good and effectual payment on our part, and, had my 
offer of recommending such supplies been accepted, I would 
on that ground have proposed the measure, which, anticipating 
the next instalments, would have still kept open the main 
point as long as you should think proper. And thus my 
apparent retreat was in effect a mode of more permanent 
defence, and this is more, I believe, than poor Lee could say 
for himself. I am truly yours, &ic. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 267 

TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Paris, December 28th, 1792. 
My Dear Sir, 

I did myself the honor to write to you on the twenty-third of 
October. Since that date the exterior affairs of this country 
have put on a more steady appearance. My letter of the twen 
ty-first instant to Mr Jefferson will communicate my view of 
things, to which I could add but little at this day. 

I have not mentioned to him the appointment of M. Genet, 
as Minister to the United States. In fact, this appointment 
has never been announced to me. Perhaps the Ministry think 
it is a trait of republicanism to omit those forms, which were 
anciently used to express good will. In the letter, which is 
addressed to you, is a strain of adulation, which your good 
sense will easily expound. Let it be compared with M. Le- 
brun s letter to me of the 30th of August. The fact is, that 
they begin to open their eyes to their true situation ; and be 
sides they wish to bring forward, into act, our guarantee of 
their islands, if the war with Britain should actually take 
place. 

As to that war, I am told that the British ultimatum is as 
follows. France shall deliver the royal family to such reigning 
branch of the Bourbons as the King may choose, and shall re 
call her troops from the countries they now occupy. In this 
event, Britain will send hither a Minister, and acknowledge 
the republic, and mediate a peace with the Emperor and 
King of Prussia. I have several reasons to believe, that this 
information is not far from the truth, and that if the Ministers 
felt themselves at liberty to act, they would agree to the terms. 
These terms are, it is said, consequential to the sentiments de 
livered by opposition in the British Parliament ; who are, as 
you will see become quite insignificant, but it was thought best 
to place them in a necessity of supporting the measures of 
administration. 



268 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

I consider these terms, or something very like them, in a 
different point of view. If the French retire, and consequent 
ly eat up again their high toned declarations in favor of 
the people, and denunciations against Kings, they will, at the 
next attempt, find as many enemies as there are men in the 
neighboring countries, and of course the mediator will pre 
scribe such terms as he may think proper. Secondly, as it 
is almost evident that the republic must be torn to pieces by 
contending factions, even without any foreign interference, her 
population, wealth, and resources, above all her Marine, must 
dwindle away ; and as much of her intelligence and industry, 
with the greater part of her money capital, must on this hypoth 
esis seek the protection of law and government on the other 
side of the channel, he r rival will increase both in positive and 
relative power. Thirdly, an exiled monarch on the other side 
of the Pyrenees, (for it is at Madrid that he would probably 
take refuge,) would enable Britain at any moment to distract 
the French affairs, and involve the republic in a war with 
Spain. Lastly, it seems an almost necessary conclusion, that 
if France in some years of convulsive misery should escape 
dismemberment, she would sink under severe and single des 
potism, and when relieved therefrom by the King, or his de 
scendants, or relations, she would be in a state of wretchedness 
for at least one generation. 

I understand that the French, in the consciousness that 
their principles have ruined their colonies, are willing to pay 
them as the price of peace ; but on the other hand Mr Pitt 
has, I am told, refused the offers which the colonists have 
made to him, partly because he does not wish to excite alarm, 
and partly because the only useful part of the colonies, their 
commerce, will, he conceives, naturally fall to Britain in pro 
portion to the interior ruin, which has already made great 
ravages in this country. 

If the terms offered by Britain, whatever they may be, are 
not accepted, I think a declaration will not suddenly follow, 
but only an increase of preparations ; because time must be 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 269 

given for the co-operators, Spain and Holland, who are both of 
them slow. Besides, it will be necessary that a body of Prus 
sian troops should be collected, through Westphalia, in the 
neighborhood of Flanders, to be joined by Dutch, Hanoverian, 
and perhaps British troops. The more the French advance, 
the more they expose themselves to this danger ; and you may 
rely, that if a large body of troops be thrown into Flanders, 
that country will join them eagerly to expel or destroy the 
French. 

I think it possible, that in case the war should break out , 
there may be a treaty of partition, in which the Elector Palatine 
may have Alsace and Lorraine in lieu of Bavaria, and that the 
Low Countries may be given by the Emperor, in exchange for 
Bavaria, to the Duke and Dutchess of York. This would 
suit everybody but France, and she will not in such case be 
consulted. 

I have not yet seen M. Genet, but Mr Paine is to introduce 
him to me. In the mean time I have inquired a little what 
kind of a person he is ; and I find that he is a man of good 
parts and very good education, brother to the Queen s first 
woman ; from whence his fortune originates. He was, through 
the Queen s influence, appointed as Charge d Affaires at Pe 
tersburg, and when there, in consequence of despatches from 
M. de Montmorin written in the sense of the revolution, and 
which he interpreted too literally, he made some representa 
tions in a much higher tone than was wished or expected. It 
was not convenient either to approve or disapprove of his con 
duct, under the then circumstances, and his despatches lay un 
noticed. This, to a young man of ardent temper, and who, 
feeling genius and talents, may perhaps have rated himself a 
little too high, was mortifying in the extreme. He felt himself 
insulted, and wrote in a style of petulance to his chief, believ 
ing always, that if the royal party prevailed, his sister would 
easily make fair weather for him at court ; which I doubt not. 
At the overturn of the monarchy, these letters were so many 
credentials in his favor to the new government, and their 
23*

dearth of men has opened his way to whatever he might wish. 
He chose America, as being the best harbor during the storm, 
and if my informant be right, he will not put to sea again un 
til it is fair weather, let what will happen. 

In addition to what I have said respecting the King to Mr 
Jefferson, it is well to mention to you, that the majority have it 
in contemplation not only to refer the judgment to the electors 
of France, that is, to the people, but also to send him and his 
family to America, which Paine is to move for. He mention 
ed this to me in confidence, but I have since heard it from 
another quarter.. Adieu, my dear Sir. I wish you many and 
happy years. 

GOUVERNEUR MoRRIS. 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Paris, January 1st, 1793. 

Dear Sir 3 

I transmit herewith a duplicate of what I had the honor to 
write on the twenty-first of last month. Since that period, this 
government, perceiving that they had been wholly deceived 
respecting the British nation, have made advances towards 
conciliation. At least, so I am informed ; and also, that these 
advances are by a declaration that, however general the terms 
of their decree, they had no idea of exciting revolt, except in 
the dominions of the powers leagued against them. That as 
these powers had entered into France with design to change 
the established government, they are justified in turning against 
them the weapons of revolt, which they had intended to use. 

If this should ever become an object of diplomatic contro 
versy, it will perhaps be objected, that until the asserted mean 
ing of a general decree be declared by some other decree, 
the words must be taken in their plain and natural import. 
Should such new decree be passed, which by the bye would 
take from France a very powerful engine, the case of Savoy 



THE TRENCH REVOLUTION. , 271 

will be quoted, where, whatever may have been the supposed 
intentions, no facts existed to support the conduct which has 
been pursued, in such manner as to show a consistency with 
the limited interpretation put upon the decree. Lastly, as to 
the Austrian Netherlands, it will, I presume, be alleged, that 
not only the aggression was on the part of France, but that it 
was avowedly made with a view to excite revolt in that coun 
try. 

But I do not believe we shall have any such war of words, 
for I am convinced that France must, to avoid a war, do some 
thing more than make professions and explanations. I say 
nothing about the navigation of the Scheldt, and the projected 
invasion of Holland. I shall not, either, make any remarks on 
the unanimity in the British Parliament, which your; good 
sense and knowledge of that people had certainly anticipated. 

Accept, I pray you, Sir, the compliments of the season, and 
believe me, &ic.

commerce. 



272 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION; 

copy of what in my last letter relates to the situation of thi 
country. 

A problem to be resolved just now is, whether the conven 
tion of neutrality lately entered into with Spain is, on the part 
of the latter, concerted with Great Britain ; or whether your 
Due d Alcudia prefers otium cum NOVA dignitate to the un 
certain splendors of a great undertaking. As I am not apt to 
trace up to rational causes the conduct of a creature so irra 
tional as man, I should decide at once, perhaps, that the un 
nerved indolence of a courtier has more to say in the decision, 
than any complicated combinations of state policy, if there were 
not a remarkable coincidence in the time and circumstance 
with what has passed lately in the British Parliament. Is the 
conduct of Spain to be attributed to a design of making future 
hostilities popular, by making them appear to result from French 
aggression ; or does it arise from the dread, that war might 
awaken the court from that profound oblivious sleep, in which 
its interest and its glory are all forgotten? 

On the contingent answers to these questions- there results 
an alternative, which may operate favorably to the object of 
Mr Short s mission. If, for instance, a war should be immi 
nent, I think that they would wish to avoid any contest with 
us ; and if ease and luxury be their motives, 1 think you may 
plague them into concessions, which, after all, (under the rose 
be it spoken) are of very little consequence to our country ; for 
I have no golden hopes from an uphill navigation of three or 
four hundred leagues. 

I will not now go into any long discussions on the state of 
affairs here, because I have communicated my opinions to Mi- 
Short pretty fully, and shall continue to do so until he takes 
his departure. The Council here talk so highly to Great Bri 
tain that you, who know mankind, will conclude them to be 
afraid ; and this conclusion is not far from the truth. Mr Pitt 
has the nation now in his hand, and may do what he pleases. 
Will he make war? The King is, Ibelieve, decidedly for it. 
Will he make war? Perhaps he can gain more by peace. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 273 

Will he make war ? He envies, I am told, his father s fame. 
A gentle armament places him in a condition to make the bel 
ligerent powers bid high for his favor, while it will convince 
Old England that when at last he strikes, it is her honor 
which compels the blow ; and then she will fight, you may re 
ly on it. I am, &sc.

TO THOMAS JEFFERSON* 

Paris, January 6th, 1793. 
Dear Sir, 

Mr Short, who is so kind as to take charge of my letters as 
far as Bordeaux, will go, he says, this day. I therefore take 
the latest opportunity to write, and to inform you, that the ap 
pearances have not at all changed since mine of the first. 
Dumouriez has been some days in Paris ; he stays at home 
under pretence of illness, but in fact to receive and consider 
the propositions of the different parties. 

It would seem that he is not reconciled to Pache, the min 
ister of War. Pache is very strong in Paris, and that circum 
stance renders him formidable, both to his colleagues and to 
the Convention. I am told that the majority of the latter body 
expect soon to be supported by a considerable number of vol 
unteers from the departments. I am also told that it cannot 
be long before the bursting of the storm, which has been so long 
brewing. This last intelligence is from one of those who, 
though a promoter of the last revolution, is now marked as one 
of the victims. He says he will die hard, but laments the fee 
bleness of temper which he experiences among those who, like 
him, are doomed to destruction. 

On the other hand, a person of cool discerning temper and 
understanding, who is in the confidence of those who direct the 
Jacobins, told me when last I saw him, that they are determin 
ed to rule, or perish. You will easily suppose, that this pro- 



274 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

vision of horrors is far from pleasant. I have, I assure you, 
been not a little tempted to spend a few days with some of my 
friends in the country during the festive season, which would 
render such an excursion natural, but the critical state of things 
with Great Britain might take a turn, which it would be im 
portant for you to know, and, therefore, it is right that I stay 
here. I have the honor to be, &-c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Paris, January 10th, 1793. 
My Dear Sir, 

As I have good reason to believe that this letter will go safe 
ly, I shall mention some things which may serve as a clue to 
lead through mysteries. Those who planned the revolution, 
which took place on the tenth of August, sought a person to 
head the attack, and found a M. Westermann, whose morals 
were far from exemplary. He has no pretensions to science, 
or to depth of thought; but he is fertile in resources, and en 
dued with the most daring intrepidity. Like Cresar, he be 
lieves in his fortune. When the business drew towards a point 
the conspirators trembled, but Westermann declared they 
should go on. They obeyed, because they had trusted him 
too far. On that important day his personal conduct decided 
in a great measure their success. Rewards were due, and 
military rank, with opportunities to enrich himself, was grant 
ed. 

You know something of Dumouriez. The Council distrust 
ed him. Westermann was commissioned to destroy him, 
should he falter. This commission was shown to the Gene 
ral. It became the bond of union between him and Wester 
mann. Dumouriez opened a treaty with the King of Prussia. 
The principal emigrants, confident of force, and breathing ven 
geance, shut the royal ear. Thionville was defended, because 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 275 

a member of the Constituent Assembly saw in Lafayette s 
fate his own. Metz was not delivered up, because nobody 
asked for the keys, and because the same apprehensions were 
felt which influenced in Thionville. The King of Prussia 
waited for these evidences of loyalty until his provisions were 
consumed. He then found it necessary to bargain for a re 
treat. It was worth to Westermann about ten thousand pounds, 
The Council, being convinced that he had betrayed their bloody 
secret, have excited a prosecution against him for old affairs of 
no .higher rank than petit larcency. He has desired a trial by 
court martial. 

You will judge whether cordial union can subsist between the 
Council and their Generals. Vergniaud, Gaudet, &c. are now, 
I am told, the intimates of Dumouriez, and that the present 
administration is to be overturned, beginning with Pache, the 
minister of War. You will have seen a denunciation against 
these members of Assembly for a letter they wrote to Thierry, 
the King s valet-de-chambre. This affair needs explanation, 
but it can be of no present use. 

The King s fate is to be decided next Monday, the four 
teenth. That unhappy man, conversing with one of his coun 
sel on his own fate, calmly summed up the motives of every 
kind, and concluded that a majority of the Convention would 
vote for referring his case to the people, and that in conse 
quence he should be massacred. I think he must die or reign. 
I am, &c.

TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Paris, January 25th, 1793. 

Dear Sir, 

The late King of this country has been publicly executed. 
He died in a manner becoming his dignity. Mounting the 
scaffold, he expressed anew his forgiveness of those who per- 



276 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

secuted him, and a prayer that his deluded people might be 
benefitted by his death. On the scaffold he attempted to 
speak, but the commanding officer, Santerre, ordered the 
drums to be beat. The King made two unavailing efforts, 
but with the same bad success. The executioners threw him 
down, and were in such haste as to let fall the axe before his 
neck was properly placed, so that he was mangled. It would 
be needless to give you an affecting narrative of particulars. 
I proceed to what is more important, having but a few min 
utes to write in by the present good opportunity. 

The greatest care was taken to prevent a concourse of 
people. This proves a conviction, that the majority was not 
favorable to that severe measure. In effect the great mass of 
Parisian citizens mourned the fate of their unhappy Prince. 
I have seen grief, such as for the untimely death of a beloved 
parent. Everything wears an appearance of solemnity, which 
is awfully distressing. I have been told by a gentleman from 
the spot, that putting the King to death would be a signal for 
disbanding the army in Flanders. I do not believe this, but 
incline to think it will have some effect on that army, already 
perishing by want, and mouldering fast away. The people of 
that country, if the French army retreats, will, I am persuad 
ed, take a severe vengeance for the injuries they have felt, 
and the insults they have been exposed to. Both are great. 
The war against France is become popular in Austria, and is 
becoming so in Germany. If my judgment be good, the tes 
tament of Louis the Sixteenth will be more powerful against 
the present rulers of this country, than an army of a hundred 
thousand men. You will learn the effect it has in England. 

o 

I believe that the English will be wound up to a pitch of 
enthusiastic horror against France, which their cool and steady 
temper seems to be scarcely susceptible of. 

I enclose you the translation of a letter from Sweden, which 
I have received from Denmark. You will see thereby, that 
the Jacobin principles are propagated with zeal in every 
quarter. Whether the regent of Sweden intends to make him- 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 277 

self King, is a moot point. All the world knows that the 
young Prince is not legitimate, although born under circum 
stances which render it, legally speaking, impossible to ques 
tion his legitimacy. 

I consider a war between Britain and France as inevita 
ble. The continental powers opposed to France are making 
great and prompt efforts, while on this side I as yet see but 
little done to oppose them. There is a treaty on foot, I be 
lieve, between England and Austria, whose object is the 
dismemberment of France. I have not proof, but some very 
leading circumstances. Britain will, I think, suspend her 
blow till she can strike very hard, unless indeed they should 
think it advisable to seize the moment of indignation against 
late events for a declaration of war. This is not improbable, 
because it may be coupled with those general declarations 
against all Kings under the name of tyrants, which contain a 
determination to destroy them, and the threat, that if the 
ministers of England presume to declare war, an appeal shall 
be made to the people, at the head of an invading army. Of 
course, a design may be exhibited of entering into the heart 
of Great Britain to overturn the constitution, destroy the 
rights of property, and finally to dethrone and murder the 
King. All which are things the English will neither approve 
of, nor submit to. 

Yours of the seventh of November is just received. I will 
reply to it by the first good opportunity. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Paris, February 13th, 1793. 

Dear Sir, 

Since my last, I have had every reason to believe, that the 
execution of the King has produced on foreign nations the 
effect which I had imagined. The war with England exists, 
VOL. ii. 24 



278 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

and it is now proper, perhaps, to consider its consequences, to 
which effect, we must examine the objects likely to be pursu 
ed by England, for in this country, notwithstanding the gasco 
nades, a defensive war is prescribed by necessity. 

Many suppose that the French Colonies will be attacked, 
but this I do not believe. It is indeed far from improbable 
that a British garrison may be thrown into Martinique, but as 
to St Domingo, it would require more men than can be spared 
to defend it, and as much money as it is worth. Besides 
which, there are higher considerations to be attended to. 
In one shape or another, this nation will make a bankruptcy. 
The mode now talked of, is to pay off the debt in a species of 
paper money, which shall be receivable for the sales of confis 
cated property, and which shall bear no interest. When once 
the whole of the debt shall be fairly afloat, the single word de 
preciation will settle all accounts. You will say, perhaps, that 
this measure is unjust, but to this I answer, that in popular gov 
ernments, strongly convulsed, it is a sufficient answer to all ar 
guments, that the measure proposed is for the public good. 
Supposing, then, the debt of France thus liquidated, she pre 
sents a rich surface covered with above twenty millions of peo 
ple, who love war better than labor. Be the form of govern 
ment what it may, the Administration will find war abroad 
necessary to preserve peace at home. The neighbors of 
France must therefore consider her as a great power, essential 
ly belligerent, and they must measure themselves by the scale 
of her force. 

In this view of the subject, to take her islands, is to possess 
but the paring of her nails, and therefore more serious efforts 
must be made. Strange as it may seem, the present war is, 
on the part of France, a war of empire, and if she defends 
herself, she commands the world. I am persuaded that her 
enemies consider this as the real state of things, and will there 
fore bend their efforts towards a. reduction of her power; and 
this may be compassed in two ways, either by obliging her to 
assume a new burden of debt to defray the expense they are 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 279 

at on her account, or else by a dismemberment. The latter 
appears the more certain mode. In this case, it will, 1 pre 
sume, be attempted to make the Saome her northern boundary 
as far as the Ardennes, and then along the Ardennes to the 
Vosges mountains, to mount Jura, and along mount Jura to the 
Alps. This will throw French Flanders, Artois, and a part of 
Picardy into the circle of Austrian Flanders, which may be 
erected into an independent State, and the country lying east 
of the Vosges and mount Jura may be a compensation to the 
Elector Palatine, for the cession of Bavaria. 

On such a project, if it exists, the first question is as to the 
means of execution ; and these are well prepared, if the ene 
my knows how to make use of them. Alsace is attached to 
the German Empire, and to the cause of religion. The only 
thing, which pleases them in the revolution, is the abolition of 
the tithes, and they are as much disgusted by the banishment 
of their priests. I speak here of the Roman Catholic only. 
The sentiments of this people cannot be unknown to the ene 
my. As to French Flanders and Artois, the cause of religion 
is with them the first care, but as yet they have not had a fair 
opportunity to show themselves, because they are awed by the 
numerous garrisons spread through their country. I think, as 
I mentioned in my last, that there exists a treaty respecting 
Flanders between England and Austria, but I cannot find out 
the exact purport. Prussia is, I think, to find her account in 
Poland. 

As to the conduct of the war, I believe it to be on the part 
of the enemy as follows. First, the maritime powers will try to 
cut off all supplies of provisions, and take France by famine ; 
that is to say, excite revolt among the people by that strong 
lever. Give us again our bread and our chains, might perhaps 
be the language of Paris. I think I can perceive some seeds 
already sown to produce that fruit. It is not improbable, that 
our vessels bringing provisions to France may be captured and 
taken into England, the cargoes paid for by the government. 
Secondly, Britain may perhaps land a body of troops in Nor- 



280 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

mandy, with intention to prenetrate to Rouen, and cause the 
royal standard to be erected by the French Emigrants. If a 
large body of the people flock to it, they might come on to 
wards the capital, if not, they may move along the coast to 
Abbeville, and thence form a junction with the army acting in 
Flanders. For this descent, if it takes place, is but a secon 
dary operation ; the main stress will be in Flanders, for there 
the troops of Britain, Holland, Hanover, Austria, and Prussia, 
can be fed from the ocean at a very cheap rate, and the more 
their operations may be confined to the sea coast, the more will 
it be difficult for France to oppose them, because the provisions 
must in such case be carried to an extreme corner of the coun 
try. Thirdly, an attack of great energy will be made on the 
side of Mayence, in the view to destroy totally the army under 
Custine, and penetrate into lower Alsace. But the real at 
tack of that ci-divant province will, I think, be on the side of 
Upper Alsace, for which purpose nothing will be left undone 
to bring the Swiss into action, as thereby the fire of war will 
extend all along from the German Ocean to the Mediterranean 
Sea. Fourthly, the efforts on the side of Savoy will proba 
bly be confined to the recovery of that country, and such di 
version as may occupy a part of the French army for their own 
defence. Fifthly, on the side of Provence and Languedoc 
there will be only a predatory war, a war of alarm, such as 
may increase the want of bread by multiplying the consum 
ers, for I do not believe in a serious attempt on either Toulon 
or Marseilles. Under this chapter, and as an incidental con 
sideration, are the intrigues with the Turk to engage the Bar- 
bary powers. I think a British squadron in the Mediterra 
nean will do more towards these than a dozen Ambassadors. 
Lastly, on the side of Spain there will, I believe, be nothing 
more than diversion. How great that may be will depend on 
contingencies, not within the compass of human foresight. A 
revolution at court which should dismiss the Queen and her 
paramour might give some energy to the administration,, 
which at present is extremely feeble. 

Having thus run through the probabilities on the side of the 



Tttfi FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

Adversary, I come now to what appear to be the views of 
France. You will have seen, that the effective army for 1793 
is fixed at something more than five hundred thousand men. 
These they will be able to get together. The recruiting ser 
vice goes on well, and although many of the last year s men 
return with design not to re-engage, their places will be sup 
plied ; so that by the beginning of June that immense army 
(barring accidents) will be completed. 

The main object at present is to overrun Holland ; a thing 
which might have been affected six weeks ago, but at present 
I believe it is not to be done. If the Prussian aud Hanove 
rian troops advance rapidly, it will hardly be attempted. It is 
however expected that Maestricht may fall as suddenly as 
Mayence, and perhaps by similar means. If this should happen 
it would greatly impede the confederates, and of course they 
will exert themselves to prevent that misfortune. Never 
were the moments more precious, than they are to both par 
ties in that quarter ; for there the first blow will be more than 
one half of the battle. Should the enemy become speedily 
superior in the field, there is nothing to stop him till he comes 
to Valenciennes, and at every step he would gather new force ; 
besides, he need not embarrass himself with convoys, because 
he would soon receive abundance from the side of the sea. 
As to the colonies, I believe that France will not attempt to 
defend them, and their whole commerce falls naturally into 
the lap of America, unless the British prevent it, and I think 
they will find it more convenient to neglect that small object 
to pursue the great ones, which open themselves to view in 
this quarter. 

What I have just said leads me very naturally to your let 
ter of the seventeenth of November. You had previously 
instructed rne to endeavor to transfer the negotiation for a 
new treaty to America, and if the revolution of the tenth of 
August had not taken place, but instead thereof the needful 
power and confidence been restored to the crown, I should 
.perhaps have obtained what you wished as a mark of favor 
24* 



282 THE TRENCH REVOLUTION. 

and confidence. A change of circumstances rendered it ne* 
cessary to change entirely my conduct, so as to produce in 
one way, what was impracticable in another. 

As I saw clearly, or at least thought I saw, that France and 
England would at length get by the ears, it seemed best to let 
them alone, until they should be nearly pitted. When I found 
this to be the case, I asked an interview with the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, and mentioned to him my wish that an excep 
tion should be made in the decree against emigrants, in favor 
of those wh6 were in the United States. I told him truly, that 
I wished the alliance between the two nations to be strictly pre 
served. I told him with great frankness, that notwithstanding 
appearances, and the flattering accounts transmitted by some 
of his agents, Britain was, in my opinion, hostile, and an at 
tempt at alliance with her, idle. He assured me he was of the 
same opinion. I then observed to him, that in such case, 
there would be no doubt but Mr Hammond would exert him 
self to inculcate the opinion, that our treaty having been made 
with the King, was void by the Revolution. He said that such 
an opinion was absurd. 1 told him, (premising in this place, 
that the whole conversation was inofficial, and unauthorised on 
my part, from circumstances he was well acquainted with,) that 
my private sentiments were similar to his, but 1 thought it 
would be well to evince a degree of good will to America, 
which might prevent disagreeable impressions, and had there 
fore taken the liberty to suggest the exception in favor of emi 
grants to America. 

Here I left it, and changed the conversation. Now I know 
well, that some of the leaders here who are in the Diplomatic 
Committee hate me cordially, though it would puzzle them to 
say why ; and I was determined rather to turn that disposition 
to account than to change it, because I see some advantages to 
result from it. Thus I contributed indirectly to the slight put 
on me, by sending out M. Genet without mentioning to me a 
syllable either of his mission or his errand, both of which, 
nevertheless, I was early and sufficiently informed of. The 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION* 283 

pompousness of this Embassy could not but excite the atten 
tion of England, and my continuance at Paris, notwithstanding 
the many reasons which might have induced me to leave it&gt; 
would also, I thought, excite in some degree their jealousy ; and 
I have good reason to believe that this effect was produced. 
From all this I conjectured, that both parties might be brought 
to bid at your auction, At any rate the thing you wished for 
is done, and you can treat in America if you please. Whether 
you will or not is another affair. Perhaps you will see that 
all the advantages desired do already exist, that the acts of the 
constitutional Assembly have in some measure set us free from 
our engagements, and that, increasing daily in power, we may 
make quite as good a bargain some time hence as now. 

It remains to add a few words in reply to what regards me 
personally in your letter. I am very happy, indeed, to find 
that my conduct, as far as it was known, is approved of. This 
is the summit of my wish, for I. candidly acknowledge that the 
good opinion of the wise and virtuous is what I prize beyond 
all earthly possessions, I have lately debated much within 
myself what to do. The path of life in Paris is no longer 
strewed with roses, as you may well imagine ; indeed it is ex 
tremely painful. I have already given my reasons for staying 
here, but now the scene is changed, and 1 had thoughts of 
making a tour to the different Consulates. There are, how 
ever, some pretty solid objections to that plan for the present. 

The next thing which suggested itself was to hire a country 
house for the summer season, in the neighborhood. At length, 
that my leaving the city might give no offence to anybody, I 
have bought a country house in an out of the way place, 
where it is not likely that any armies will pass or repass, even 
should the enemy penetrate. If I lose the money paid for it, 
I will put up with the loss. The act in itself shows a disposi 
tion friendly to France, and as it is between twenty and thirty 
miles from Paris, I shall be at hand, should business require 
my presence. Mr Livingston, my secretary, will continue 



284 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION 

in town unless driven out of it by war or famine. In this way 
I hope to avoid those accidents which are almost inseparable 
from the present state of society and government, and which, 
should they light on the head of a public Minister, might in 
volve consequences of a disagreeable nature. It is more pro 
per also, I conceive, to make arrangements of this kind in a 
moment of tranquillity, than when confusion is awakened in 
to mischief. In all this my judgment may err, but I can tru j 
ly say that the interest of the United States is my sole object. 
Time alone can tell whether the conduct be as right as I 
know the intention to be. 

Before I close this letter, I must pray your indulgence for 
referring to the enclosed copy of what I wrote on the twenty-^ 
seventh of last month, to the bankers of the United States in 
Amsterdam. I make no comment thereon, only as I had no 
right to give the order in question, I consider it as of course, 
that if disapproved of I must replace the money which may be 
advanced on it. This is one of the cases in which not to act 
is taking a part, and in which it is ruin to balance.

Dear Sir, 

I am to acknowledge yours of the seventh of last Novem

resolution, which will deprive the United States of an able and 
faithful servant. Since you declare your determination to be 
unalterable, it would be idle to offer reasons to dissuade you, 
besides which it seems probable that ere this can arrive, you 
will have acted. But were it otherwise, I know not whether 
in my present feelings I could attempt to divert from the sweets

of private and domestic life one, who has so long been de 
prived of them. Every day makes me contemplate with ad 
ditional pleasure the prospect of retirement, and that tranquilli 
ty whose loss is not perhaps to be compensated by anything 
else. 

If, however, the die be not cast, permit me to express one 
wish. It is, that you would hold your place until a successor 
can be fixed on, whom you think fully equal to the duties of the 
office. This may perhaps be a painful sacrifice, but it is one 
which I hope you will make to the interests of our country in 
the present very critical moment. If you shall have quitted, or 
persist in doing it, give me, I pray, your opinions and advice. 
These, so long as T stay here, will be very useful to me, and I 
trust not quite useless to the United States. 

In whatever situation you maybe, believe, I pray you, in 
that respectful esteem with which I am, &ic.

TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Paris, February 14th, 1793. 

My Dear Sir, 

I have received yours of the twentieth of October, which 
was very long on its way. You will find that events have 
blackened more and more in this country. The present pros 
pects are dreadful. It is not so much perhaps the external 
force, great as that may be, for there are always means of de 
fence in so vast a nation. The exhausted state of resources 
might also be borne with, if not remedied. But the disorgan 
ized state of the government appears to be irremediable. The 
venality is such, that if there be no traitors, it is because the 
enemy have not common sense. Without the aid of venality, 
there are not a few who, from mistaken zeal, and from igno 
rance, contribute to the success of those powers who are lea 
gued against France. Many also under the garb of patriotism 



286 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

conceal their attachment to the, former government. In short, the 
fabric of the present system is erected on a quagmire. The 
new constitution has not yet made its appearance, but it is easy 
to conjecture what it will not be. In the mean time 1 learn, 
that the ministers of War and Marine declare it impossible for 
them to go on. How all this will end, God only knows, but I 
fear it will end badly. 

I will not speak of my own situation ; you will judge that it 
is far from pleasant. I could be popular, but that would be 
wrong. The different parties pass away like the shadows in a 
magic lantern, and to be well with any one of them, would 
in a short period become the cause of unquenchable hatred 
with the others. 

Happy, happy America ; governed by reason, by law, by the 
man whom she loves, whom she almost adores. It is the pride 
of my life to consider that man as my friend, and I hope long to 
be honored with that title. God bless you, my dear Sir, and 
keep and preserve you. Your cool and steady temper is now 
of infinite consequence to our country. As soon as I can see 
the way open to anything decisive, I shall inform you of it. 
At present I weary myself with unavailing reflection, medita 
tion, and conjecture. A partition seems the most probable 
event at present. Adieu. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 

Paris, February 16th, 1793. 

Dear Sir, 

My last was of the sixteenth of January, of which I now 
enclose a copy. It has so happened that a very great pro 
portion of the French officers, who served in America, have 
been either opposed to the revolution at an early day, or felt 
themselves obliged at a later period to abandon it. Some of 
them are now in a state of banishment, and their property con- 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 287 

fiscated. Among these last there are a few, who had entrusted 
to their agents the certificates received from our treasury, and 
these last under the pressure of penal decrees either detain 
those certificates, or have delivered them up to those persons 
appointed by the republic to take charge of confiscated pro 
perty. 

There certainly can be no question on this subject, under 
the laws hitherto existing among nations ; but I shall not un 
dertake to decide either on rights or pretensions to right, 
especially where I am not authorised to act ; but it is proper 
that I should lay before you a state of facts, for your ulterior 
decision. The only one at present before me is the case of 
Colonel Laumoy, to whom I shall write in answer to his ap 
plications, that I am not authorised to make payment but on 
production of the certificate, and therefore he must address 
himself on the subject to you, in the full confidence that right 
and justice will take place, such being the clear determination 
of the United States. I am, &tc.

TO THOMAS PJNCKNEY. 

Paris, February 27th, 1793. 

Dear Sir, 

I have received by yesterday s post your letter of the twen 
ty-second. In reply to which I beg leave to refer you to 
mine of the eighteenth, and to add farther here, that any 
application to the government would imply doubts, which do 
not exist in my mind, and for which there is no foundation. 
On the contrary I have every reason to be convinced, tl at all 
stipulations in the treaty between France and the United 
States of America will be scrupulously complied with. It is 
true, that the first decree for fitting out privateers was hastily 
passed, and needs correction ; but all such correction as may 
be needful will be made. 



288 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

In the mean time, I think it a matter of no consequence what 
may be the rate of insurance against capture at Lloyd s. 
Real Americans certainly will not pay a premium where they 
run no risk, and as to those who borrow our flag under false 
pretences, it is no matter what they pay. I hope the Ameri 
cans will have so much good sense, as to see that the proof of 
payment of a premium to insure against capture ought to op 
erate, as an evidence against them in the courts of this country. 
If I were to sit as judge, I would certainly consider it as a 
strong presumption, that the property, however covered, was 
not American, and probably should on that presumption con 
demn it as prize, leaving the party to his appeal, in order to 
take off before the higher court by good evidence the weight 
of such presumption. I have the honor to be, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO THOMAS PINCKNEY. 

Paris, March 2d, 1793. 
My Dear Sir, 

I think that you should be acquainted with a fact, which it is 
very important to communicate to our Secretary of State as 
soon as may be. I am informed, in a way that precludes 
doubt, that the Executive Council here sent out by M. Genet 
three hundred blank commissions for privateers, to be given 
clandestinely to such persons as he might find in America in 
clined to take them. They suppose that the avidity of some 
adventurers may lead them into measures, which would involve 
altercations with Great Britain, and terminate finally in a war. 
This appears to me, waving all question of honesty, no very 
sound measure politically speaking, since they may, as a 
nation, derive greater advantage from our neutrality than from 
our alliance. 

But whatever light it may be viewed in as to them, it is in 
respect to us a detestable project. I learn that some sea- 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 289 

men have lately by British cruisers, who claim to be Ameri 
cans. I presume that the claim will not be admitted, but if 
the government should cause them to be executed as Pirates, 
a knowledge thereof would go a great way to prevent our citi 
zens from engaging in a war, contrary to the wishes of 
our government, especially if, as I doubt not, the President 
should by proclamation, enjoining the observance of a strict 
neutrality, declare that all those who contravene shall be at the 
mercy of the party by whom they may be taken, and not en 
titled to the protection of the United States. 

I am the more solicitous on this subject, in that we may 
well expect a back game of the same kind by Britain, and in 
such case it would be impossible for the French to distinguish 
among their prisoners, between those who were and those who 
were not English. As there is nothing more destructive to 
morals than the spirit of gambling, especially when murder is 
placed among the means of gaining the property of others, 
and as the security and happiness of the United States depend 
so essentially on the morals of their citizens, I feel a more 
than usual solicitude to prevent a practice inconsistent with all 
good principles. 

I have no late news from America, and none of any date 
which you would wi^h to know. Our Secretary of State seems 
much attached to brevity, and reminds me of a maxim of his 
predecessor, that least said is soonest mended. The length 
of this letter will show you that I have not profited by such 
wise lessons, but it will also show you, I trust, the confidential 
esteem with which I am, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL. 

Paris, March 4th, 1793. 
My Dear Sir, 

Since I had the pleasure of writing to you on the fourth of 
VOL. ii. 25 



290 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

January by our friend, Mr Short, I am without any of your 
letters. I lament this, because they always communicate to 
me both pleasure and instruction, 

As far as I can judge, this nation approaches to the point 
where the vigor of laws must supply the place of enthusiastic 
zeal, for this latter begins to abate. There will, however, be 
enough to furnish out a considerable force, when the weather 
grows a little warmer, especially should events somewhat dis 
tant, and rather untoward, require great exertion. Another 
supposition, (for I do not here notice that continuation of vic 
tories which people can easily reconcile themselves to,) another 
supposition is a heavy reverse at a distant point. Now the 
effect of this would, I think, be various, according to the na 
ture of the calamity. If for instance the enemy should strike 
a blow, it would probably rouse the nation into effort. If a 
great project should fail, it would probably spread despon 
dency. 

So much for calculation, which after all must depend on 
some moral causes, which neither France nor the Allies seem 
sufficiently to estimate, but which with me have very great 
weight. I believe it more easy to conquer by laws than by 
arms ; and had I been counsellor to the Duke of Brunswick 
and Company, I would have repeated to hid from Shakspeare, 
that when lenity and cruelty play for kingdoms, the gentlest 
gamester is the surest winner. And so, my dear old friend, 
adieu. Reproach yourself sometimes for not writing often, 
and always believe me with truth and affection yours, &c.

Paris, March 7th, 1793. 

Dear Sir, 

Enclosed you have copies of what I had the honor to write 
on the twenty-fifth of January, and thirteenth of February ; also 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 291 

the copy of a letter of the twelfth of February, from Mr Pinck&gt; 
ney, with my answer of the eighteenth. I send these last, to 
the end that due attention may be paid to such vessels as may 
be furnished with his passports, and which may perhaps prove 
to be British bottoms. 

I am so well persuaded that the United States will strictly 
observe the laws "of nations, and rigidly adhere to their neu 
trality, that [ am solicitous to prevent a practice which might 
expose us to suspicion, and finally involve us in war. On 
this chapter it is proper also, that I should communicate a fact 
which I have mentioned to Mr Pinckney, and desired him to 
transmit. 

Monsieur Genet took out with him three hundred blank 
commissions, which he is to distribute to such as will fit out 
cruizers in our ports, to prey on the British commerce. I 
am convinced that few of my countrymen will be so lost to all 
moral sense, as to embark in a game so abominable, where the 
murder of their fellow creatures enters as a leading chance. 
I am apprehensive, however, lest some profligates may be led 
to fix a blot on our national character, and deprive both them 
selves and their countrymen of the great and certain advanta 
ges to flow from honest industry on the present important oc 
casion, an occasion, which, duly attended to and properly 
cultivated, will give to our navigation an increase too rapid al 
most for conjecture, and place us in the happy situation to be 
in two or three years the exclusive carriers of our immense 
productions. These considerations weigh much, but they are 
still but a feather in the balance with those of a much higher 
nature, which stand in connexion with the nature of our govern 
ment, and of course with the happiness of generations to come. 
I know of nothing so dangerous, and I might say fatal to morals, 
as the sudden acquisition of wealth by bad means. Industry 
is thereby discouraged, and honesty discountenanced. The 
vulgar are soon dazzled by the glare of prospering vice, and 
the young are seduced from the paths of virtue ; and virtue 
once gone, freedom is but a name ; for I do not believe it to be 



292 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

among possible contingencies, that a corrupted people should 
be for one moment free. Excuse, I pray, my dear Sir, these 
observations, which I cannot restrain. They flow from the 
conviction of my earliest reason, and are strengthened by the 
experience of twenty years. 

In mine of the thirteenth of February, I mentioned to you 
that this country would procure the five hundred thousand 
men required, and at that time there was every reason to think 
so, because the recruiting service went on well for all the new 
corps which had been ordered ; but it now appears that this 
arose from little circumstances of dress and flattery, calculated 
to catch idlers, and that there is a real scarcity of men. The 
losses of the last campaign are sensible in the mass of popula 
tion, so that notwithstanding the numbers thrown out of em 
ploy by the stagnation of some manufactures, and the reduc 
tion of private fortunes, the want of common laborers is felt 
throughout the whole country. Already they talk of drafting 
for the service, an experiment of very doubtful and dangerous 
complexion. Jt would however succeed just now ; but if de 
layed it would not, I believe, go down ; and at any rate would 
not produce in season the required force ; especially if the en 
emy should have any considerable successes; for you must 
not imagine that the appearances in this country are all real, 
and you must take into your estimation, that the Convention is 
falling into contempt, because the Tribunes govern it imperious 
ly. They try to save appearances, but the people cannot long 
be dupes. It is the old story of King Log, and how long it 
may be before Jupiter sends them a Crane to destroy the Frogs 
and Froglings, is a matter of uncertainty. Already they begin 
to cry out for a Dictator. An insurrection also is brewing, 
whose object I am told is to destroy the faction of the Gironde. 
I think I mentioned to you, that the death of the King would 
be but the forerunner of their destruction. And already they 
see the sword hanging over their heads. The majority of the 
Convention is clearly at the disposition of their enemies. 
The consuls will forward to you, and you will see in the 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 293 

gazettes, the decree for opening all the ports of this nation to 
our vessels on equal terms with their own. You will be so kind 
as to observe, that this was done on a report of the Committee 
of Safety. Now you must know that the members of this 
Committee, or at least a majority of them, are sworn foes to 
the members of the Diplomatic Committee. This is necessa 
ry to explain a little of what is said in mine of the 13th, about 
the latter Committee. I have received indirectly a kind of 
assurance from the former, (which disposes entirely of the 
Convention) that they will do anything for the United States 
which I will point out, but in fact I know not anything which 
we ought to ask 5 the decrees above mentioned contain, I be 
lieve, all that we want. The history of them is not material. 

I had the honor to mention to you also, that I did not be 
lieve the attempt against Holland would succeed, and also that 
time was extremely precious to both parties, especially in re 
gard to Maestricht, in whose fate was involved perhaps that of 
the whole campaign. This town had, I am told, offered to 
capitulate, but terms of such rigor were insisted on, as to in 
duce a longer defence, and this delay has saved them. The 
siege is raised, and unless the French army should gain a vic 
tory, I do not see how they are to escape, provided the enemy 
exerts himself. Dumouriez had taken Breda, and was prepar 
ing to enter Holland, being ordered by the Minister of War ; 
to whom he replied, that he would go in, but the Minister 
must find his way out. This latter may be no very easy 
task. The enemy on the side of Maestricht are, I believe, 
superior in numbers ; and certainly if the French in that quar 
ter are beaten, the Allies may cut off the retreat of Dumou 
riez, in which case his fate must depend not only on the 
strength of his army, not over numerous, but also on the state 
of his magazines, which I believe to be bad. Should Val 
ence be able to make good a gentle retreat, then he may be 
joined perhaps by Dumouriez at Louvain, and together they 
may cover Brussels. 

But all these things, again, depend on some moral contin- 
25* 



294 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

gencies, such for instance as the following questions. What 
will be the temper and spirit of those departments nearest to 
the scene of action ? What will be the degree of hope or ap 
prehension among the inhabitants of the Low Countries ? As 
to them you will see by the gazettes, that they are fast express 
ing their adherence to the French Republic freely pronounc 
ed. 

But since it has been no small question among metaphysi 
cians, what it is that constitutes the freedom of the will, there 
is no small question also on this subject among politicians, as to 
the case before us. Are men actuated by interest, are they 
instigated by desire, are they seduced by hope, are they com 
pelled by fear? Alexander, you know, cut the knot which he 
could not untie, and the French have imitated the example of 
that conqueror. Some striking examples of those, who op 
posed the union with France, induced all the rest to give both 
their speedy and their free consent. It is therefore a problem 
to be resolved, what degree of force must be produced by the 
Allies to operate on the free will of this people, in a counter 
sense. I think the solution of that problem is in Brussels. 

On the w r hole, my dear Sir, the hour is big with important 
events. As soon as I learn anything more, I will communicate 
it ; in the mean time accept the assurances of that respect, with 
which I have the honor to be, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Paris, March 8th, 1793. 
Dear Sir, 

In reading over my letter of yesterday, I find that I omitted 
to mention the war with Spain. The truth is, that it was a 
matter so much of course and of so little importance, that it 
escaped my recollection. Our Commissioners will doubtless 
turn it to account. 

Last evening I was informed that the French army in Flan- 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 295 

ders has been defeated, but as this is not an official account, I 
merely mention it as it is, viz. a letter sent express by an 
individual at Brussels on seeing sundry runaways arrive, and 
stores, &c. &c. coming in at sixes and sevens, with the re 
port that the enemy were at the gates. On the other hand, 
you must take into account that the siege of Maestricht being 
raised only the third, one day s rest was necessary for the 
troops, which had come on by forced marches. Now as the 
action must have taken place at Tongres, about forty miles 
from Brussels, and the courier in question left that city in the 
night of the fifth, it would follow that the enemy must have 
marched from Maestricht in the night of the fourth, and at 
tacked at break of day ; otherwise the runaways would hardly 
have got in by the evening of the fifth. On the whole, there 
is but just time enough for such an affair to have happened, 
and that is all. If there is any confirmation I will mention it. 
I am, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Paris, March 9th, 1793. 

Dear Sir, 

The intelligence communicated in mine of yesterday is fully 
confirmed. The accounts given to the Convention are so lame 
and blind, that one is obliged to piece them out like a tattered 
writing, where whole sentences are wanting. 

It would seem, then, that the enemy, though at what time 
is yet uncertain, made an attack on the army which had be 
sieged, or rather bombarded Maestricht, and which was then at 
Tongres. The route has, I believe, been complete, and the 
enemy, by pushing on to St Tron, have cut off the retreat of 
those who were at Liege before the battle, or who fled to it 
afterwards ; so that in all human probability the greater part 
of them have fallen, with all their artillery and stores. They 



296 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

had indeed one road open, viz. that along the banks of the 
Meuse up to Huy and Namur ; but whether the enemy in Lux 
embourg have detached on that side, seems as yet uncertain. 
Probably they have not. It would seem that such of the 
French army, as escaped by the way of St Tron, have been 
totally dissipated, for it is said that the enemy is in possession 
of Brussels ; and of course he must have come on from eighty 
to a hundred miles in the space of four or five days. 

The French have sent off everything they could save to Val 
enciennes, which is about sixty miles on this side of Brussels, 
and in which the broken remnants of their army will probably 
be collected. Going on the supposition that the allied army is 
at Brussels, it appears to me that Dumouriez is completely cut 
off, unless he be possessed of very considerable magazines, for 
he is, you know, in a horrible country. In front, a navigable 
river, and in the rear a pitiless desert until he gets back to the 
neighborhood of Antwerp, Malines and Louvain. 

Now the enemy could be at Malines as soon as at Brussels, 
these places being equidistant from LouvaiOj through which 
they must in either case have passed, and the distance from 
Malines to Antwerp is about one third of what Dumouriez had 
to pass over, unless he began his march as soon as he received 
the news, that the enemy were on their way to Maastricht. 
This intelligence did not I presume reach him till the night of 
the third, or morning of the fourth ; and it is a question of mo 
ment, whether he took instant, measures for his retreat, which 
must of necessity be slow through the very bad roads which 
he has to struggle with, till he gets to the pavement within 
about a league, if I remember right, of Antwerp. The inten 
tion of the enemy is, I am certain, to cut him off; and if that 
be done, God knows what will happen ; for the frontier towns 
are almost without garrisons, the whole force having been call 
ed off to the expedition against Holland. 

The force in the low countries has been stated very highly 
by those, who counted on success in that quarter, but I do not 
believe that the whole amounted to more than fifty, or at most 



THF FRENCH HFVOTJITION. 297 

sixty thousand ; and should those events, which are now pro 
bable, take place, very few of that number will get back again 
to France. I understand that the militia are to be drafted im 
mediately, and what may be the success of that measure can 
not be foreseen. I have not sufficient data on which to fix an 
opinion, but should it be accompanied by delay, or encounter 
opposition, the safety of Paris is more in distance than in 
force. I am, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MoRRIS. 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Paris, March 13th, 1793. 
Dear Sir, 

In mine of the ninth instant I mentioned to you&gt; that the 
enemy was in possession of Brussels, and so it was then assert 
ed by authority, but it seems that he confined himself to Ton- 
gres and Liege, leaving the French army in possession of St 
Tron. At the same time it appears, that he was employed in 
pushing forward a column on his left, to turn their right flank, 
and had that movement been completed, the French army 
would, in all human probability, have been destroyed. To 
prevent the threatened danger, Miranda fell back to Lou vain, 
keeping open thereby the two roads to Antwerp and Brussels. 

As the enemy will doubtless endeavor to cut him off from 
the latter, I suppose that Dumouriez, relinquishing his expe 
dition against the Netherlands, will form a junction with Mi 
randa. In this case a battle must decide the fate of Flanders, 
and both parties will collect for the purpose all the force they 
can muster. I do not think the position taken at Louvain is 
tenable, because Brussels may be reached by the route of 
Namur, towards which the enemy will probably turn his 
attention in the first instance. 

Great exertions are making here to reinforce Dumouriez, 
and still greater to bring about a new revolution, whose effect, 



298 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

if successful, would be, I think, the destruction of what is call 
ed here the faction of the Gironde, and which calls itself the 
republican party, qualifying its enemies by the term Anarch 
ists. To avoid if possible the carnage of the second to the 
eighth of last September, a tribunal, called the Revolutionary 
Tribunal, is organised, with very large and wide powers. It is 
one of those instruments whose operations are incalculable, 
and on whose direction depends the fate of the country. 
Opinion seems to set very strongly against the Convention. 
They are supposed to be incapable of steering the State ship 
in the present rough weather, but it must blow yet a little 
harder before they are thrown overboard. 

I believe I never mentioned to you that a constitution was 
reported ; but the truth is, that it totally escaped me. A 
paper of that sort was read at the Convention, but I learnt 
the next morning, that a council had been held on it over night, 
by which it was condemned ; so I thought no more of it, 
neither have I heard it mentioned until yesterday by one of 
my countrymen, which brought me to recollect that in my 
correspondence I had not noticed it. I am, with great respect 
and esteem, yours, 

GOUVEUNEUR MORRIS. 



TO M. LEBRUN. 

Translation. 

Paris, March 24th, 1793. 

Sir, 

Many complaints have reached me respecting the outrages 
committed against American vessels, by the French privateers. 
I have taken no notice of it to you, Sir, until now, in the hope 
that such examples would not multiply ; and 1 have replied to 
many letters on this subject, which were addressed to me by 
our Minister Plenipotentiary at London, in a way to tranquillize 
the fears, with which the enemies of the French nation endeav 
ored to inspire my countrymen. But it appears to me of the 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 299 

utmost importance to prevent, as speedily as possible, such vio 
lations of the law of nations and of treaties. 

I have already been informed of the capture of the ship 
Aurora, of Baltimore, by the privateer Patriot, of Marseilles ; 
of the brig Bacchus, also of Baltimore, by a privateer of Cette ; 
and of the ship Laurens, of Charleston, by the privateer Sans 
Culotte, of Honfleur. I will spare you, Sir, the melancholy 
recital of the violence committed on these different occasions; 
and which was the less excusable, as it was done after posses 
sion had been taken, and when no resistance was made. But 
I earnestly entreat you to give the necessary orders, that for 
the future these illegal acts, whose unhappy consequences are 
incalculable, may not be permitted. 

I take the liberty to recall to your mind on this point, the 
provisions of the fifteenth article of the treaty of commerce and 
amity between France and the United States of America, 
which was concluded at Paris, on the 6th of February, 1778. 
Your justice, as well as your good sense, Sir, warrant me in 
the belief, that you will labor effectively to preserve the union 
between France and the United States ; a union, which will, I 
hope, subsist forever, and become more and more a common 
bond of prosperity and happiness. I have the honor to be, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



GEORGE WASHINGTON TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

Philadelphia, March 25th, 1793. 
My Dear Sir, 

It was not till the middle of February, that I had the pleas 
ure to receive your letter of the 23d of October. 

If you, who are at the fountain head of those great and im 
portant transactions, which have lately engrossed the attention 
of Europe and America, cannot pretend to say what will be 
their event, surely we, in this distant quarter, should be presump 
tuous indeed in venturing to predict it. And unwise should 



300 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

we be in the extreme, to involve ourselves in the contests of 
European nations, where our weight could be but small, 
though the loss to ourselves would be certain. lean however 
with truth aver, that this country is not guided by such a narrow 
and mistaken policy, as will lead it to wish the destruction of 
any nation, under an idea that our importance will be increas 
ed in proportion as that of others is lessened. We should 
rejoice to see every nation enjoying all the advantages, that 
nature and its circumstances would admit, consistent with civil 
liberty and the rights of other nations. Upon this ground the 
prosperity of this country would unfold itself everyday, and 
every day it would be growing in political importance. 

Mr Jefferson will communicate to you such official infor 
mation as we have to give, and will transmit the laws, public 
papers, &;c. 

I have thought it best, my dear Sir, not to let slip this oppor 
tunity of acknowledging the receipt of your letter, lest no other 
should occur to me very soon, as I am called to Mount Vernon 
by the death of my nephew, Major Washington, and am on 
the point of setting out for that place tomorrow. I need not 
tell you that this is of course a very busy moment with me. 
It will therefore account for the conciseness of this letter, by 
which however you must not measure my regard. 

You see me again entering upon the arduous duties of an 
important office. It is done so contrary to my intention, that 
it would require more time, than I have allowed myself, to as 
sign the reasons ; and therefore I shall leave them to your 
own suggestion, aided by the publications which you will find 
in the gazettes. I am your sincere friend and affectionate 
servant, 

GEORGE WASHINGTON. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 301 

TO THOMAS JEFFERSON, PHILADELPHIA. 

Paris, March l&gt;Cth, 1793. 

Dear Sir, 

I enclose a copy of the letter from Dumouriez to the Con 
vention, of the twelfth instant, which, not having been publicly 
read, he has caused to be printed in Flanders, and the enclosed 
is from Brussels. This letter, and the proclamations which 
accompanied it, form a singular contrast with the conduct pur 
sued by that General on entering victoriously into the country, 
which I had the honor to communicate in mine of the twenty- 
first of December. It accords but badly also with a later 
transaction. He had opened a large loan, on his private cre 
dit and account, at Antwerp ; but the capitalists having no 
great confidence in him, it went on slowly ; and to stimulate 
their zeal, he threatened them with something very like milita 
ry execution. 

Having mentioned, here, my letter of the twenty -first of 
December, I cannot avoid observing to you that the correspon 
dence between Pache and Dumouriez, as published by the 
latter, shows that the orders given by Pache to reinforce Cus- 
tine were far more extraodinary than I had conceived ; seeing 
he was directed to march in midwinter across the pathless 
mountains of the Ardennes, in which he could have found 
neither food, forage, nor shelter from the storms. Similar or 
ders to Beurnouville had pushed him, as I therein informed 
you, on the road to Treves. No good opportunity offering, 
I did not then communicate the result of that expedition ; 
which by the bye was never made public here ; but the fact 
is, that he lost one half of his army, and those who returned 
were as fit for the hospital as for the field, almost ; so that 
the Austrian General, Beaulieu, pushed his advanced posts 
forward with impunity to the French frontier. 

In the enclosed letter of Dumouriez are three things worthy 
of notice. First, the great diminution of the French ar 
mies in that quarter ; secondly, the violence used to obtain 
VOL. ii. 26 



302 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

an appearance of union with France ; and thirdly, the tem 
per and disposition of the Flemish nation. On the first of 
these points, I refer for the force which he commanded on en 
tering the Low Countries, to the above mentioned correspon 
dence with Pache, mutilated as it is, and from which you will 
find that the account I had given you of his numbers was ex 
act. Between one hundred and one hundred and ten thou 
sand Frenchmen broke into the Low Countries last autumn, 
and yet what I told you on the first day of the present year, viz. 
that the effectives under Miranda and Valence, when united, did 
not exceed thirty-five thousand, is strictly true. But there 
were sundry posts and garrisons spread through the country, 
and all along to the sea coasts, making up about ten thousand 
more ; and it is true that many have come out of the hospitals, 
and many recruits have been sent on ; but some have gone in 
to the hospitals, and straggling parties have constantly returned, 
so that forty-five thousand men were about the existent force, 
previous to the efforts for the expedition to Holland, about all 
which I shall say more presently, and only observe here, that 
he states the army as being reduced by sickness, skirmishes, 
and desertion, to less than one half of their force. Such, says 
he, was our situation, when on the first of February you de 
clared war against England and Holland. 

The second point, namely, the manner of obtaining the^ree 
vote of the Belgic people for a union with France, I had men 
tioned to you in mine of the seventh instant, upon very full in 
formation from various quarters of that country. The account 
which Durnouriez gives, is a curious piece for history. The 
conduct, which may naturally be expected from men so abused, 
I had mentioned to you on the twenty-fifth of January, and as 
signed on the thirteenth of February the reason why they had 
not already avenged the injuries they had received. But no 
sooner did the movements towards Holland lessen the garrisons 
distributed among them, than the smothered flame began to 
break out, and the French have already paid pretty severely 
for a conduct, of which the instances in modern times are 
rare. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 303 

Tn my last I mentioned to you that a battle appeared pro 
bable, and that it would decide the fate of the Low Cou tries. 
This battle took place definitively on the eighteenth, having 
been preceded by some warm skirmishes on the preceding 
days. As I mentioned on the ninth the whole force of the 
French, as not being more than from fifty to sixty thousand men, 
it may not be amiss to give here some general state of the force 
now at the disposition of the Republic. Speaking in round 
numbers, the force required was, about five hundred thousand, 
to complete which, an apportionment was made on the first in 
stant of near three hundred thousand, viz. two hundred and 
ninety -six thousand five hundred and fifty- three, on the differ 
ent departments, exclusively of the army of reserve, which we 
may suppose to consist of the paper surplus beyond five hun 
dred thousand, whatever that may be. Thus it would seem? 
that the existent force on the first instant, as borne on the re 
turns, was about two hundred thousand. 

This force is divided, and to be divided, into eight different 
armies, viz. that of the North, commanded by Dumouriez ; the 
Ardennes, by Valence ; the Moselle, by Beurnonville ; the 
Rhine, by Custine ; the Alps, by Kellermann ; Italy, by Biron ; 
the Pyrenees, by Servan ; and the Sea Coast, by Labourdon- 
naye. Deducting from the supposed existing force, for garri 
sons, sick, posts, and communications, and the numberless 
contingencies of service, eighty to ninety thousand, we have 
remaining a total of one hundred and ten thousand to one hun 
dred and twenty thousand, in the different armies under arms. 

So much for a general view. I will now give a more par 
ticular one coincident therewith. The army of Dumouriez 
may be stated at ninety thousand, that of Custine fifty-four 
thousand, that of Biron at eighteen thousand, those of Valence 
and Beurnonville, each seven thousand, those of Kellermann, 
Servan and Labourdonnaye each nine thousand, making togeth 
er two hundred and three thousand. But of these there are 
only the three first worth noting here, as the others are all in dif 
ferent posts and garrisons. And, by the way, that we may fin 
ish at once with Biron s army, (intended to be about fifty thou- 



304 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

sand strong, but avowedly defective on the first instant about 
thirty two thousand,) as it has been in a kind of small action 
for the last three months, and must keep up sundry posts in the 
county of Nice, and on the communications, the total opera 
tive force cannot exceed twelve thousand men. 

We shall come to Custine by and bye ; but at present we 
will return to the northern army. As this was to be exposed 
to the greatest efforts of the enemy, and as the government 
counted on success in that quarter for the means to dictate its 
own terms of peace, the force of it was to be one hundred 
and forty thousand ; but the avowed deficiency being fifty 
thousand, leaves the above number of ninety thousand, deduct 
ing therefrom twenty-five thousand for the several garrisons 
(of which there are at least a dozen) and for the sick, we have 
a remainder of sixty-five thousand, of which fifteen thousand 
were under Dumouriez in Holland. 

The armies, then, of Miranda and Valence did not exceed 
five thousand, and the enemy give an account of above ten 
thousand of these in the affairs of the 28th February to the 
4th March, besides what may have gone off in different direc 
tions. The army, therefore, which Dumouriez commanded at 
Louvain on the fifteenth instant, could not exceed forty thou 
sand. His loss between that and the nineteenth was at least 
twenty thousand. He cannot therefore on the twentieth have 
had more than twenty thousand left. Probably about fifteen 
thousand. From the Dutch expedition, if ever they get back, 
not more than ten thousand can ever join him, because the 
losses in that quarter also have been considerable. When the 
want of discipline and the desertions are considered, you will 
see that there remains but a very trifling force to be scattered 
through the frontier towns, in addition to the very weak garri 
sons above mentioned. If this army be cut off, it seems to me 
that the towns cannot be all defended, and if ever it should re 
turn, a very strict defensive is the utmost which can be ex 
pected. 

It is proper, in this place, to say something about the plans 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 305 

and movements of the enemy. From the best information I 
have been able to procure, it seems that the Allies intended to 
open the campaign in the first fortnight of April, at which peri 
od the different armies were to be completed. The Austrians 
under the Prince de Cobourg, including those on the Moselle un 
der the Prince de Hohenloe, were to be near ninety thousand 
strong ; the British and Hanoverians were to be twenty thou 
sand ; the Prussians, with some troops of the Empire, about 
twenty to thirty thousand. The Dutch contingent depended 
on circumstances. The scattering bodies of emigrants also 
formed an eventual force. The whole might perhaps be car 
ried to one hundred and fifty thousand, from which it might 
be well to deduct one third for posts, garrisons, contingencies, 
maladies, and deficiencies. On the first of April, therefore, 
the Prince de Cobourg would have been at the head of at 
least one hundred thousand men, although not all united. 

He was obliged to commence his operations a month or six 
weeks sooner than had been agreed on, because the Prince of 
Hesse, commanding in Maestricht, informed him that he could 
not answer much longer for the defence of that place, a great 
part of his garrison being illy disposed, and the citizens unwil 
ling to resist while their houses were crumbling about their ears 
I have reason to believe that the information I received of an 
offer to surrender was unfounded. In this state of things a 
council of war was held, and it was resolved to undertake, at 
all hazards, the raising of the siege. This was done by the 
Prince of Cobourg, at the head of about twenty-five thousand 
men. The Prussians, under Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, 
came up the Meuse on the side of Cleves and Wezel, with a 
body of ten to fifteen thousand men, and drove the French 
from Ruremonde. The French lost in these affairs not less 
than twelve thousand men, killed, wounded, and taken, besides 
the dispersion of their troops in different directions. 

The stores taken at Liege were immense. Of artillery 
alone, above one hundred pieces of different caliber, as is 
said. The Austrians suffered very little, since it was rather 
26* 



306 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

a rout than a battle. The Prussians lost some men. These 
last marched, soon after, to Bois le Due, to effect a junction 
with the British troops. The Austrians prepared for action 
again as soon as they were recovered from their fatigue, and 
had made the needful dispositions. To this effect, orders 
seem to have been given to General Beaulieu to advance 
towards the Meuse from Luxembourg, and to the Prince de 
Hohenloe to replace the force of Beaulieu ; but this line being 
long and parallel to the French frontier, the movements must 
be made with caution ; and the more so, as a month was to 
elapse before the corps of Beaulieu and Hohenloe were to be 
completed. 

The Prince de Cobourg seems to have sent off, however, a 
column of between eight and ten thousand men on the side of 
Namur, for the purpose of dislodging the French, opening, the 
whole course of the Meuse up to the French frontier, forming 
a junction with the army of Beaulieu, and eventually cutting 
off the retreat of the French army, by possessing a post in 
their rear between Mons and Brussels, should they retire 
towards Valenciennes. 

Such was the state of things when Dumouriez joined the 
army, which had fallen back to Louvain. He sent off, I 
presume, his orders immediately to evacuate Holland, so as 
to form a junction with those troops, and make good his 
retreat ; but shortly after, finding that the column of Austri 
ans just mentioned was advancing rapidly on his right, 
sensible that his enemy would, if suffered quietly to collect 
his force, be soon superior in numbers, and that his whole 
army must, in consequence, be cut off; he determined as a 
last resource, to fight them, because a victory would give him 
time to receive reinforcements, and secure the doubtful junc 
tion with the army in Holland. 

The army of the Prince de Cobourg must, at this time, 
have been inferior to Dumouriez, because, even supposing 
that he had collected from the Rhine men sufficient to occu 
py the posts in his rear, and to carry his army to the number 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 307 

of near thirty thousand, yet the detachment on his left had 
reduced it to twenty thousand. He had pushed forward his 
advanced posts to Tirlemont, but the army of Dumouriez 
drove them back, and this latter General marched forward by 
his right, so as to cut off the communication between the 
main body of the Austrians and the corps, which had been de 
tached on their left. If under these circumstances he had 
gained a victory, it would have been decisive. It was on the 
same field that the Mareschal de Luxembourg beat King 
William, the twenty-ninth of July, 1693, and nearly in the 
same respective positions. 

The event however was reversed. The action was very 
warm, and although Dumouriez writes to one of his officers 
that the retreat was a knowing or skilful one, (savante) he 
appears to be more indebted to the night, than to his general 
ship, or to the manoeuvres of his troops, for his left wing was 
cut to pieces, and his right very severely handled. The 
great superiority of the enemy s cavalry would, in those cir 
cumstances, have wholly destroyed his army, had the day 
light continued. Although we have no account of the 
enemy s loss, we may well suppose it to have been consider 
able, and of course much was to be done before they could 
attack the French, w T ho had taken a strong post near Lou vain, 
and the more so, as by persisting in his movement to the left, 
the Prince de Cobourg might hope to prevent Dumouriez 
from getting back to the frontier towns, and in the mean time 
his reinforcements were coming on. 

It was under these circumstances that Dumouriez prepared 
for his retreat. To that effect, after having collected his scat 
tered forces at Cumptich, he retired to Louvain, and sent off 
his stores and artillery from Brussels. The sick were taken 
away, as I am told, by water on the twenty-second, when the 
Commissioners from the National Assembly also left Brussels, 
and then some parties of the Austrians had, it is said, appeared 
in the neighborhood. It would seem, then, that the plan of 
Dumouriez, who is said to be on his retreat towards Mons, is 



308 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

to go to Tournai, in order to form there a junction with the 
troops from Holland, to whose protection it would seem that 
he has committed his sick and wounded, who may be forward 
ed to Ghent, and thence by the canals along through West Flan 
ders to the French territory. 

In this way he will cover the retreat of the troops from 
Holland by the Scheldt, and the reinforcements intended for 
his army will be thrown into Valenciennes, and he himself 
will take post eventually near Lisle. This plan supposes the 
evacuation of all Flanders, which indeed seems to be indispen 
sable, for in three weeks from the present time the enemy will 
be in complete force. He may, as it were, immediately col 
lect fifty thousand men, by bringing up the Prussian and Brit 
ish troops, and these again may be followed by the Dutch and 
Hanoverians. 

Now on the supposition that Dumouriez should extricate 
himself in the course of ten days, he would not, on the whole 
frontier from Valenciennes to Dunkirk have more than fifty 
thousand men ; and that, on the supposition that the recruits 
should have joined, to the number of ten thousand, so as to 
replace deserters and supply the deficiencies of sick and 
unfit for duty, which bear daily a greater proportion to the 
whole number, as losses in action and by desertion increase. 

I expect that in a very few days the campaign will open on 
the side of the Rhine, and this circumstance will leave the 
Prince de Hohenloe more master of his motions, seeing that 
a column of troops under the orders of the Duke of Brunswick 
will be of course sent to occupy the passes along the Rhine 
above Coblentz, and as the two armies of the Ardennes and the 
Moselle (which on the first of the month did not exceed 
from sixteen to twenty thousand men) cannot be increased in 
any reasonable time, beyond what may be necessary for the 
garrisons on that frontier, and to prevent the enemy from en 
tering by the Meuse. The left of the Prince de Cobourg s 
army may bend all its efforts that way, and I daily expect to 
hear of a stroke in that quarter. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 309 

What may be the fate of Custine, I know not. He has 
taken great pains to fortify himself, and to defend the banks of 
the Rhine from Switzerland to below Mayence ; but these 
very precautions would seem to render the passage certain, 
because it is next to impossible that a line so long should be 
defended through all its extent. 

. The King of Prussia seems determined to take Mayence, 
let it cost what it may. The inhabitants are universally in his 
favor, and should Custine, who is a brave but a blundering 
soldier, be taken with his army, the whole province of Alsace 
is lost. It may indeed fall in a different way, for I am well 
convinced that the imperial troops will make a serious effort in 
the upper end of it ; and here the conduct of Switzerland be 
comes important. People differ much on that subject, but I 
believe that England will have a very large body of Swiss in 
her pay to act in conjunction with the Austrian troops, and 
that having penetrated to Befort, which is but about thirty miles 
from Basil, the ulterior movement will depend on the existent 
state of things between the armies at Mayence. In one contin 
gency an effort may be made to penetrate to Besan^on, distant 
about fifty miles, and thence to Lyons, which is distant from 
Besan^on, along the rivers Doux and Soane, by Dole and 
Chalons, about one hundred and fifty miles, but by the road, 
seventy. I need not say, that the possession of Lyons would 
oblige both Kellermann and Biron to retreat, and open the 
whole of that country to the troops of Savoy, whatever might 
have been the previous situation of those armies ; for you 
know, that on that quarter the difficulty of subsisting in the 
country is much greater than that of keeping the enemy out 
of it. 

I had mentioned to you, in mine of the seventh instant, my 
idea as to the recruiting, if forced forward immediately. It 
has been tolerably successful. In some places very much so. 
In others it has met with serious opposition. Upper Britanny 
is in revolt, and both Nantz and Rennes are menaced, while 
a descent is apprehended at St Malo. Does the insurrection 



310 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

proceed from a plan laid by the enemy, or from impulses of 
the moment? Both may have concurred, but I think that, 
like the campaign, it has happened sooner than was expected. 
It is, however, very serious, and should they take St Malo, 
and receive a supply of arms, ammunition, and provisions, with 
a few troops and a little money from England, it is not possi 
ble to calculate the extent of mischief; for Normandy is, I am 
persuaded, ready to revolt as soon as a fair opportunity offers ; 
and it is in that quarter, that I supposed a descent would be 
made, and I am still of that opinion, and that the movements 
mentioned in mine of the thirteenth of last month will take 
place. 

In the midst of these troubles, with an expense which last 
month exceeded the receipts near two hundred millions of 
livres, (worth at present prices at least four millions sterling) 
the insurrection which I formerly mentioned, as likely to take 
place against the Brissotins, is still in agitation, and will in a 
few days, most probably, take effect. 

I enclose a copy of my letter of the 24th instant to M. Lebrun, 
respecting the capture of American vessels, which will suffi 
ciently explain itself. I ought also to mention to you, which I 
omitted in its due season, that M. Genet before he went hence 
called to take leave, and apologised for M. Lebrun, on account 
of his constant business, for not calling on me to present M. 
Genet, &c. &c. The truth is, that I attach very little impor 
tance to these matters, whether of compliment or inat 
tention, and I believe that I estimate them at their true 
value. I am, &c.

Paris, March 29th, 1793. 
Sir, 

I have received the letter you addressed to me yesterday, 
as also the accompanying papers. I sent a copy of them 



THE FBENCH REVOLUTION. 311 

immediately to the Minister of the Marine, praying him to take 
the most prompt measures to procure for Captain Todd the 
satisfaction due to him, and to prevent, for the future, the 
vessels of our good allies from being exposed to the attacks of 
our ships of war and privateers. 

The inconvenience, which many of your fellow citizens have 
lately experienced, arises in part from the difficulty of distin 
guishing an American from an English vessel; and from the 
connivance there may be, among many individuals of both 
nations, for making disguised expeditions. In order to pre 
serve to the citizens of the United States all the advantages, 
which result from their neutrality, it is the interest of the 
American Government to prevent this fraud ; and I have every 
reason to believe, that the laws which determine, in the United 
States, the national flag, are clear and precise. I know that 
these laws require not only that the vessels be of American 
construction, but that the Captain and a great part of the 
crew be Americans. 

I pray you, Sir, to communicate to me the last statute made 
on this subject by Congress, that I may give information of it to 
the officers of our ports, and through them to the commanders 
of our ships of war. This measure seems to me essential, in 
order to prevent all the disputes, which might arise on this 
subject. 

In my last letter I assured you of the sincere desire of the 
French Republic, not only carefully to avoid whatever might 
disturb the perfect harmony between the two nations, but to 
draw more and more closely the fraternal bonds which unite 
them. You have seen proofs of this in the various decrees, 
which have been passed by the National Convention, in 
favor of the commerce of the United States. I have the 
honor to be, &c.

Sir, 

Yesterday afternoon I was arrested in the street, and con 
ducted to the Section de la Butte des Moulins, because I had 
not a Carte de Citoyen. Fortunately a person who knew me, 
having heard what had passed, came to my rescue, and 
brought me out of the affair, on his own responsibility. I have 
the honor to send you, herewith, the copy of the pass given 
me by the Section. I beg, Sir, that you will have the good 
ness to secure me against similar accidents, troublesome in 
themselves, and scandalous from their publicity. 

I pray you, also, to grant me protection from domiciliary vis 
its. Armed men came into my house yesterday, and although 
I had every reason to be satisfied with their conduct, (for they 
went away as soon as I convinced them of the impropriety of 
their proceedings,) yet I think that when general orders are 
given for these visits, such houses ought to be excepted as are 
under the protection of the Law of Nations. 

Will you do me the favor also to send me a passport for tra 
velling into the interior ? In the month of January it happen 
ed to me to be arrested and sent back to Paris, under pretence 
that the passport you gave me was out of date. I am in ex 
pectation of going forthwith to pass a few days at my coun 
try house, and it may be that I shall be again stopped. 

Will you have the goodness, Sir, to sign the enclosed certi 
ficates for the members of my family ? I have the honor 
to be, &c.

Paris, April 1st, 1793. 

Sir, 

I had the honor of receiving yours of the 29th of March, and 
in consequence I send the enclosed formula of the certificates 
of registry, with which American vessels ought to be furnished. 
Our government grants these certificates only to those vessels, 
which belong exclusively to American citizens. They must 
also have been built in the United States, or at least have 
belonged since the sixteenth of May, 1789, to American 
citizens. The law of the United States also exacts, that the 
captain be an American citizen, and that before the vessel is 
recorded, one of the owners shall make attestation under oath, 
of the truth of these facts. In fine, captains and owners are 
forbidden to give, sell, or lend these certificates, and in case 
they are made use of by any foreign vessel under the Ameri 
can flag, the offender shall incur the penalty of confiscation. 

Such, Sir, are the regulations made on the 1st of Septem 
ber, 1789; and I have not learned that since that time there 
have been others. I have read, it is true, in one of our ga 
zettes, that in the course of the month of January, a new law 
on the subject had been presented to the President of the 
United States for his acceptance, but I am ignorant of its con 
tents, not having yet received a copy of it. I am persuaded 
however that it does not differ essentially (as to the subject 
in question) from that which I have just had the honor of pre 
senting to you. I shall hasten to communicate it to you as soon 
as it arrives, for it is my inclination, as well as my duty, to 
prevent as much as possible foreigners, and especially the ene 
mies of France, from enjoying the privileges of our neutrality. 

I am fully persuaded, Sir, of the friendly disposition of the 
French republic towards that of America, and I shall continue 
to render a faithful account of it, for I sincerely desire to 
strengthen more and more the bonds, which unite the two coun 
tries. Will you have the goodness to give me a copy of the de-

the very uncertain channel of the gazettes. I have the honor 
to be, &c.

Paris, April 3d, 1793. 
Sir, 

I have received the letter, which you addressed to me on 
the 29th of last month. 

The affection of the French Republic for the United States 
is too marked to admit the possibility of an unfavorable inter 
pretation being given to the accident, which befel you on the 
28th instant. The precautionary measures taken on that day 
extended to all the inhabitants of the city of Paris, and a proof 
that they had no reference to you personally is, that at the mo 
ment your name and rank were known, you obtained the jus 
tice due to you. 

The domiciliary visits were an equally general measure, 
from which no house in Paris was exempt. I see with pleas 
ure, that the Commissaries of the Section, who entered your 
house, withdrew after the explanation you gave them. The 
respect, which they have shown you, is proof of the belief of 
my fellow citizens, that the Minister of a free nation, an ally of 
France, is incapable of receiving into his house disaffected 
persons. The exemption, which you claim, would have had 
the pernicious effect of affording the ill disposed a facility for 
calumniating your motives, in order to disturb the entire har 
mony, which subsists between the two nations.

THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Paris, April 4tb, 1793. 

Dear Sir, 

Enclosed you have copies of M. Lebrun s letters to me of 
the twenty-sixth of March, mine to him of the twenty-eighth, 
and his to me of the twenty-ninth. I also enclose under this 
cover the journal of the debates and decrees. These will 
give you the present state of our news up to the last even 
ing. 

You will perceive, that all my conjectures respecting the 
army of Dumouriez are more than realized. From the 
letters of Custine you will perceive that he has been totally 
defeated, for he found it necessary to fall back about forty 
miles, leaving a garrison in Mayence, which must fall of course, 
and we may hourly expect to hear of farther misfortunes in 
that quarter. Perhaps the Prussian army may stop to besiege 
Mayence, but I think a part of their force will be sufficient 
for that purpose. The country, as I have mentioned in a 
former letter, is universally indisposed to France, and I can 
say on good information the same thing of Savoy. 

It is now very fine weather in this city, and if the season 
be proportionably advanced in other quarters, the campaign 
will be soon opened on every side. There will be a great 
want of bread before we have another harvest, unless peace 
should take place. If Lisle and Valenciennes should surren 
der at once, the campaign in that quarter will not be so much 
advanced as might be apprehended, because as yet the m aga*- 
zines are not brought up, and time must be allowed for that 
purpose. 

It seems indeed probable, that the enemy have taken con 
siderable magazines belonging to France, but even these are 
at some distance. I expect every hour to hear of an attempt 
upon Givet or Maubeuge, and it would seem from the best in 
formation to be had, that neither of these places can be defend- 



316 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

ed long. In short, on every side, the horizon looks darkly. 
Whether Dumouriez will be able to lead his army against Pa 
ris, seems as yet uncertain. Perhaps he may experience a 
similar fate to that of Lafayette, but he is in much better cir 
cumstances for a high game, and much abler to play it. At 
any rate, the enemy derive advantage from the squabble be 
tween him and the Convention. Here they are not yet fully 
apprised of their danger. Like those who die of a hectic, 
hope gleams to the last, and the latest breath is spent in ex 
pression of some splendid fancy. In the expiring struggles, 
however, let them happen when they may, we shall experi 
ence new horrors. Such, at least, is the probable chance. 

The constant complaints on account of the capture of Ame 
rican vessels, and the necessity of giving protection to such of 
our countrymen, as are here, have prevented me hitherto 
from leaving Paris. At present, the barriers are strictly guard 
ed, and those who have applied lately for passports have been 
disappointed ; but in a few days we shall know something 
more upon this subject. The ministry seem to be in a fair way 
towards an entire dissolution. In short, everything here is in 
almost as much confusion as on the frontiers. I am, &tc.

TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Paris, April 5th, 1793. 

Dear Sir, 

I did myself the honor of writing to you yesterday. Colo 
nel Touzard, who takes charge of my letters, having been 
detained a day longer, it furnishes the opportunity of sending 
this day s gazettes, and such intelligence as is now arrived. 

It appears that the army of Dumouriez is attached to him, 
and will go all the lengths which he desires. What is worse, 
te that the militia also adhere, so that he has all chances now 
in his favor, and probably as soon as the magazines are duly 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 317 

replenished he will advance, for under such circumstances we 
are not to expect much resistance from the frontier towns. 
The affair of Custine has been very serious. 

The garrison of Mayence is shut up in that town, and if it 
capitulates the enemy will derive from the magazines lodged in 
it the means needful for ulterior operations. Hence I conclude, 
that such terms will be offered as will be accepted. Custine s 
left flank is entirely open, and in all human probability the 
several passes in the Vosges mountains will be occupied by 
the column of Hessians, and in that case his retreat to France 
becomes impossible, and he must make the best of it in 
Alsace. Every hour is now big with important events, and 
how matters will go in this city, the Lord knows. I am, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MoRRlS. 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Pans, April 19th, 1793. 
Dear Sir, 

Since mine of the fifth, I learn that the militia have, in gene 
ral, quitted the standard of Dumouriez, but he has about twelve 
thousand of the regular troops, and there is reason to believe 
that others mean to join him. The terror excited by his de 
fection begins to subside, or rather it is suspended until some 
great blow shall be struck. There seems to be more of trea 
son in this country than was imagined, and every day increases 
suspicion, which, whether well or ill founded, has always the 
effect of distracting the public councils. 

Most people wonder at the delay of the Prince de Cobourg; 
but, besides the necessity of collecting his magazines, artillery, 
&c., which is a very heavy affair, I have reason to believe that 
he waits until some other schemes are ready for execution, 
and, therefore, it may be yet four or five days before he com 
mences the siege of Valenciennes. Conde is a needful pre- 
27* 



318 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

liminary, as in that place he must receive the various supplies 
which come up the Scheldt. It cannot hold out long. 

You will observe that Dumouriez, and, after him, the Prince 
de Cobourg, declare themselves in favor of the late Constitu 
tion, with such alterations as the nation may adopt ; and the 
latter gives the most solemn assurances, that he will not meddle 
with the internal affairs of France. His conduct is wise, and 
will doubtless gain them a considerable party in the country, if 
they act consistently with those declarations. It is said here, 
(and those who say so to me, tell me that they speak on good 
authority,) that the powers allied against France begin already 
to be disunited. That they will disagree, if very successful, 
there can be little doubt, because they are actuated by differ 
ent interests and motives ; but, I think that at present, those 
who assert the disunion rather speak from induction than from 
information. Custine has retired, you see, to Weissenbourg, 
and there he has a bad position. The enemy will probably 
attempt to cut off his retreat, before they attack him in front. 
As yet, we do not learn that the Austrians have crossed the 
Rhine in Upper Alsace, and that will be, perhaps, a prelimina 
ry to the operations against him. 

As far as I can judge of the public mind, it appears that 
there is a general state of suspense. Success, on either side, 
will fix the opinions of a very great number, who will then act, 
to show their sincerity. Here, they hang people for giving 
their opinion in favor of Royalty, (that is, they cut off their 
heads,) but yet, I am told, that such opinion is openly avowed 
and supported in the streets. I am told, that there is a majori 
ty, even of the Convention, who think a King necessary ; but, 
as they see the loss of their own lives, in connexion with the 
re-establishment of the throne, it is not to be supposed, that 
they would tell such thoughts ; and, therefore, the information 
may well be suspected. Time will show that there are among 
them some false brethren; and, certainly, the most intelligent 
must be convinced, that the republican virtues are not yet of 
Gallic growth. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 319 

The Duke of Orleans is in the way of reaping the fruits of 
his conduct, being, as you will see, sent a prisoner to Marseilles. 
The storm thickens all around us ; but, as yet, one cannot cer 
tainly determine how it will burst. The attempts made to ex 
cite disturbances in Paris have hitherto proved ineffectual ; but 
that stroke seems to be reserved for the moment when the 
Deputies, now in commission in the departments, shall return. 
It is possible, merely possible, that all may go off smoothly ; 
but the chances are greatly the other way. I am, &LC. 

GOUVERNEUR MoRRIS. 

P. S. I should have mentioned that, I am told, there is a 
plan in operation here to detach Great Britain from the con 
federation, and to make a separate peace with her; but I am 
persuaded that the attempt, in itself vain, must fail, from the 
parties said to be employed, if from no other cause. 



TO M. LEBRUN, MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS. 

Translation. 

Paris, May 14th, 1793. 
Sir, 

I have just learned that the National Convention, in its ses 
sion of the ninth, has authorised French ships of war and priva 
teers to stop, and bring into the ports of the Republic, neutral 
vessels which shall be found loaded, wholly or in part, either 
with eatables belonging to a neutral power, shipped for enemies 
ports, or with merchandize belonging to enemies, which mer 
chandize is declared good prize. 

I am ignorant, Sir, of the reasons which might explain the 
motives that led to the making of this decree, but I think I 
foresee, that the regulations just adopted by the Convention re 
specting eatables, will be eagerly followed by its maritime ene 
mies, and that in future the speculations of neutral commerce 
will, in fact, depend on the naval superiority of the belligerent 
powers. 



320 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

As to the dispositions of the decree, with respect to enemies 
merchandize shipped on board neutral vessels, I might go in 
to minute observations on the subject, if this point were to be 
decided upon by a treaty now to be made; but this being al 
ready definitely determined by the treaty of commerce, be 
tween France and the United States of America, I will only 
observe, Sir, that by the general terms in which the decree is 
expressed, its provisions might be extended to American ves 
sels, which certainly could not enter into the views of the 
Convention. 

It seems to me then of immediate importance, that a decree 
should be made supplementary to that of the ninth, limiting the 
application of it, in accordance with justice and the good faith 
of the French nation. I have the honor to be, &c. * 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Sainport, near Paris, May 20th, 1793. 

Dear Sir, 

You will see by the gazettes the state of affairs as given to 
the public ; but much allowance must be made, as I have 
already had occasion to mention. It is, however, clear that 
the greater part of those troops, which adhered to Dumouriez, 
have returned to their country and many to their standards. 
It is evident, also, that the Prince de Cobourg s conduct in 
holding out against the old constitution has been disapproved 



* On this point M. Lebrun replied on the seventeenth of May. * In 
consequence of your reclamation, I wrote immediately to the ComiU 
de Salut Public, desiring them to make a report of it to the National 
Convention. The Committee approve your observations on the sub 
ject, and they will without delay request the Convention to make an 
exception in favor of neutral ships, which, by virtue of specific stipula 
tions of commercial treaties, are not subject to the decree of the ninth.

oy his masters and their associates, since he has found it pro 
per to recall that proclamation ; but whether it be for what is 
there said as to the government, or as to the territory of 
France, may admit of doubt ; perhaps there may be a little of 
both in the objections made against it. 

The delay to be noticed in the operations of the allied 
armies proves, in my opinion, two important facts ; one, that 
they mean to leave as little as possible to chance, and, there 
fore, wait the arrival of all their forces ; and, the other, that 
the original plans of the campaign are to be steadily pursued. 
Hence I infer, that the supposed disunion, mentioned in my 
last, does not exist in any essential degree. It seems that the 
Austrian artillery was not come up, until very lately, so as to 
open the trenches against Conde, which hitherto has been 
rather invested than besieged. It seems also that the Han 
overian troops have come on so slowly, as to have given every 
advantage to the French armies in Holland, if the successes 
of the Prince de Cobourg in Flanders had not rendered the 
proposed invasion abortive. However, the period being now 
arrived, about which it might reasonably be expected that the 
weather would permit of offensive operations, and the coun 
try afford resources to the cavalry of the armies, we shall 
soon know somewhat of the comparative strength of parties. 

On the northern frontier, they have to besiege not only 
Conde, but Valenciennes, Bouchain, and Cambray, in order 
to open a road in the direct line of advance ; besides which, 
it would seem, that they want Douay and Arras on the right, 
with Bavay and Maubeuge on the left, to cover their flanks. 
Hence results the formation of seven sieges after Conde, in 
order to open the road fairly to Paris, while on the sea coast 
they would want only Dunkirk and Calais ; after which, they 
might march surely along the coast, taking possession of the 
ports, and erecting slight works to cover their retreat, should 
retreat become necessary. I am persuaded, therefore, that 
the main efforts will be made still in that last direction, unless 
intelligences are established in the towns on the other route. 



322 THE FKENCH REVOLUTION. 

I learn, but on slender authority, that the citizens of Valen 
ciennes and the regular troops are not disposed to resist. 
The militia, or volontaires, are, however, well determined. I 
know that the government are very apprehensive as to Nor 
mandy, and I still believe in a descent there, and consequent 
revolt. You will have seen that the insurgents on the south 
west of the Loire have had hitherto very great success, 
although the gazettes have teemed with accounts of the vic 
tories obtained over them. That they have hitherto received 
no succor from abroad, confirms me in my opinion, that the 
main blow is to be struck on the side of Normandy, unless 
indeed the enemies of France are absolutely blind. 

I learn that the army of Biron has suffered very severely 
in the defeats, all published as victories gained over the Pied- 
montese. However, as yet the French territory, notwith 
standing the numerous foes, remains untouched, though on all 
sides greatly menaced. 

Enclosed you have copies of my letters of the twenty- 
eighth of April and fourteenth instant to M. Lebrun, the 
minister of Foreign Affairs, with that of his answer of the 
seventeenth, and my reply of to day. These pieces require 
no comment. I have, &c.

Sainport, near Paris, June 5th, 1793. 
My Dear Sir, 

When yours of the twenty-eighth of January reached me, 
(long after it was written) the war with Spain, with (but to 
cut short all enumeration,) the European world, put it out 
of my power to send you an answer. I write now merely to 
take the chances which may offer, and to tell you that I stil 
exist. I will tell you further, that I am here on the banks of 
the Seine, in a neat little house, in a pretty little garden, with

some green trees, and more green grass than my neighbors, 
for you will observe, that we are so scorched by a long 
drought, that, in spite of all philosophic notions, we are begin 
ning our processions to obtain the favor of the bon Dieu. 

Were it proper for un homme public et protestant to inter 
fere, I should be tempted to tell them, that mercy is before 
sacrifice. I remember that about a year (or indeed eighteen 
months) ago, I was desired in a large society to draw the ho 
roscope of France, to which I answered, that it might be done 
in three words Guerre, Famine, Peste. This, which appeared 
to me at the time more than possible, has long been certain as 
to a part, and but too probable for what remains. I pray God 
the prediction be not fully accomplished. 

I will not speak to you of news or of politics, because I will 
give no temptation to interrupt my letter, and because the 
contents would not deserve the name of news, when they 
should happen to arrive. Adieu, my dear Sir.

Dear Sir, 

I have now the honor to transmit the copy of the decision 
made by the municipality of Dunkirk, on the third instant, re 
specting the ship Fame, which I received last night, in a letter 
from that place, of the seventh, which informs mo that the 
ship had then sailed. 

I have just now written to M. Lebrun, (who, by the bye, is 
en etat d arrestation) a letter of acknowledgment, a copy of 
which is enclosed. I did this the more readily, because I 
shall have new complaints to make, in all human probability, 
for in the best regulated governments it is difficult to prevent 
the violation of the rights of neutral powers, and much more 
so, where, in the tempest of a revolution, government resem-

THOMAS JEFFERSON TO GOUVERNEDR MORRIS. 

Philadelphia, Jane 13th, 1793. 

Dear Sir, 

It has long since been observed, that, of the three millions of 
livres given by the court of France to aid us in the commence 
ment of our revolution, one million was unaccounted for by the 
hands into which it was paid. The date of the payment is 
fixed to have been the 10th of June, 1776. But to whom it 
was paid has never been known. Suspicions are, that it was 
to Beaumarchais ; and that with this very money he purchased 
the supplies furnished us by him, for which large sums have 
been paid him already, and a farther large sum. is lately certi 
fied to b6 due to him as the balance of that account. I enclose 
you a letter from the Secretary of the Treasury on this subject, 
with all the papers relative to the same, which his office can 
furnish ; and as you are on the spot, I must beg the favor of 
you to make an immediate and thorough investigation of it. 
No reasons of State can now exist for covering the transaction 
longer under mystery. 

I have the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem, dear 
Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant, 

THOMAS JEFFERSON.

TO M. LEBRUN. 

Translation. 

Sainport, June 19th, 1793. 

Sir, 

I have just received the copy of a declaration, made by the 
captain and crew of the American ship, the Little Cherub, 
which proves that this ship, having taken on board thirty French 
passengers, whom the Spanish government had sent away, 
conducted them to Havre ; which place he left on the third in 
stant, provided with a passport from the Executive Council, for 
going to Hamburg ; that, on the evening of the sixth, being 
then near Dunkirk, he was taken by the privateer, le Vrai 
Patriote, and the lugger, FJlrgu-s, belonging to the Republic, 
and conducted to this latter port ; that the captain and crew 
have been very ill treated, although they made no resistance ; 
and that the French having entire possession of the American 
ship, one of them seized the second mate by the collar, and 
without the slightest provocation blew his brains out. Facts 
of so serious a nature oblige me, Sir, to make complaint to 
you, and earnestly beg that a strict search may be made into 
this business, and in case they should be proved to be such as 
they were represented to me, that the murderer may be pun 
ished with death. 

I was much astonished, Sir, to learn, some days since, that 
the Convention had repealed, on the 28th of last month, its de 
cree of the 23d, and that consequently the provisions of the 
decree of the 9th, acknowledged to be contrary to the treaty 
by that of the 23d, were again in force. I could not believe 
it, but a copy of the decree has been sent to me. 

I see that the Committee of Public Safety, in conjunction 
with that of the Marine, was charged with making a definitive 
report on this affair, in the course of three days. It is very 
important to pass a definitive resolution respecting it, for the 
fate of a rich cargo is already depending on it, and we must 
expect to see contests of this kind multiply, in which cupidity

M. LEBRUN TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

Translation. 

Paris, June 21st, 1793. 

Sir, 

I hasten to reply to the letter, which you did me the honor 
to write to me on the nineteenth instant. 

Infinitely pained at the afflicting details contained in that 
letter, I thought it my duty to communicate it immediately to 
the Comite de Salut Public, a copy of whose report I send 
herewith. You will here find a sincere expression of senti 
ments, which I approve, and of the opinion of the Executive 
Provisory Council. I have the honor to be, &c. 

LEBRUN. 

Report of the Comite de Salut Public. 

The Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States has just 
exhibited complaints of a very serious nature against a viola 
tion of the right of nations, and of treaties concluded with free 
Americans. 

If the statements set forth therein are accurate, it is not on 
ly the interest of the Republic, but the part of honor and jus 
tice, to avenge this atrocious violation of all law, and to give 
to the captain of the Little Cherub every satisfaction, which 
is due to him. This crime is so much the more punishable , 
as the captain had sailed from Havre, for the purpose of taking 
from that place a large number of our brethren inhumanly 
driven from Spain, and thus the captures have, in his case, in 
fringed not only the laws of war, but those of hospitality and 
gratitude. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 327 

The Minister of the United States makes complaint, also, 
that the decree of the twenty-third of May, which orders that 
ships of the United States shall not be comprised in the dis 
positions of that of the ninth of May, has been repealed by the 
decree of the twenty-eighth, and that a definitive report, 
which, by the terms of the decree, ought to have been made 
three days afterwards by the Comite de Salut Public, and that 
of the Marine united, has not yet been presented. The con 
sequence of this delay is, that several American vessels, and, 
among others, one with a very rich cargo, have been sequester 
ed, to the great prejudice of the owners and masters. 

The Minister of Foreign Affairs thinks it his duty to insist 
strenuously on a prompt decision, concerning these complaints 
of the American Minister. He observes, that, besides the 
ties of fraternity, which unite the two nations, the Republic has 
the strongest interest to favor the free Americans, and to take 
their vessels under its special protection. The United States 
are becoming more and more the granary of France and her 
colonies ; they manifest the best dispositions to aid us ; and 
the courage which they have manifested in formally recogni 
zing the French Republic, in spite of the menaces and intrigues 
of England, prove that their friendship for us is above all politi 
cal and interested views, which might be thought to incline 
them to follow the direction which England, Spain, and Hol 
land have vainly endeavored to give them. 

In view of these consideration it is evident, that the murder 
committed on board the Little Cherub ought to be severely 
punished ; that the captain should receive ample indemnity, as 
well for the loss and injury sustained on board, as for the de 
lays he experienced ; and that, in conformity with the six 
teenth article of the treaty of commerce between France and 
the United States, American vessels should enjoy fully, and 
without any exception, the advantage which results from their 
neutrality, in as much as this neutrality facilitates the supplies 
of provisions to the Republic and to her colonies. 



328 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION . 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Sainport, June 25th, 1793- 

Dear Sir, 

This will, I expect, accompany my last, of the twelfth 
instant, no opportunity having offered since it was written, I 
do myself the honor to enclose herein the copy of what I wrote 
on the nineteenth instant to M. Lebrun, respecting an atrocious 
violation of our Flag, and respecting a very extraordinary step 
taken by the Convention in the repeal, on the motion of a 
member, of the decree by which our ships were exempted 
from the seizure, to which those of others were exposed. I 
was informed that the object of the decree I complain of was, 
to effect the confiscation of a large cargo belonging to citizens 
of the State of South Carolina, and which has been some time 
since acquitted at Havre ; but an appeal was made from the de 
cision of the court, though grounded on the clearest principles. 
The captors then declared, that they would obtain a decree 
for the confiscation, by means of their friends in the Conven 
tion, and some time afterwards that of the ninth of May 
appeared, in which a retrospective clause covered precisely 
the object they had in view.* Such a coincidence of circum- 



* The articles of this celebrated decree of May 9th, are as follows; 

ART. i. Ships of war and privateers are authorised to seize and 
eariy into the ports of the Republic, merchant vessels which are wholly 
or in part loaded with provisions, being neutral property, bound to an 
enemy s port, or having on board merchandize belonging to an enemy. 

* ART. ii. Merchandise belonging to the enemy is declared a lawful 
prize, seizable for the profit of the captor. Provisions being neutral 
property, shall be paid for at the price they would have sold for at the 
port where they were bound. 

ART. in. On every occasion neutral vessels shall be immediately 
released, the moment the provisions found on board are landed, or the 
seizure of the merchandize shall be effected. The freight shall be 
settled at the rate paid by the charterers; a proper compensation 
shall be granted for the detention of the vessels by the tribunals, who 
are ready to adjudge the prizes. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 329 

stances was somewhat remarkable. However, I made no 
allusion to it in my first application, which, as you will have 
seen, produced the desired effect, being the decree of the 
twenty-third of May.* The interested parties, as soon as this 
decree was passed, went to work, as I was afterwards 
informed, and by force of money, as my informant says, pro 
duced the decree of the twenty-eighth. Certain it is, that the 
former was not sent to be enregistered until after the latter had 
passed, and then both were immediately forwarded together. 
It did not become me to give ear to calumnious suggestions, 
nor yet could I be totally deaf to a matter of such general 
importance to the United States. You will perceive, in the 
close of my letter to M. Lebrun, some general observations, 
which will render the corrupted members (if such there be) a 
little more cautious. I shall enclose herewith M. Lebrun s 
answer of the twenty-first instant to mine of the nineteenth. I 
had directed Mr Coffyn, the agent at Dunkirk, to cause a 
prosecution to be commenced against the murderer of our 
fellow citizen. 

In a letter written long since, I mentioned to you, Sir, that 
I was in quest of Monsieur M. I have since found him and 
conversed with him. He is immensely rich, but seems to 
have been the father of his own fortune, amassed, as fortunes 
frequently are, without rendering the possessor respectable. 
If I can judge from his countenance, the inquiry was set on 
foot in the hope of negative answers, and the affirmative is, of 



*ART. iv. These tribunals shall cause to be made out, within three 
days after the judgment has been given, a copy of the manifest of the 
provisions and goods found on board, to the Minister of Marine, and 
another copy to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. 

* * THE National Convention, after having heard the report of its Com 
mittee of Public Safety, desiring to preserve the union established 
between the French Republic and the United States of America, 
decrees that the vessels of the United States are not comprised in the 
regulations of the 9th of May, conformably to the 16th article of the 
treaty, passed the 16th of February, 1778. " 



330 THE FRENCH DEVOLUTION. 

course, not pleasing. Certain it is, that he showed no inclina 
tion to spare to the necessities of his nephews a part of his own 
abundance ; but this is the less reprehensible, in that he treats 
himself no better than his needy relations. 

Your favor of the twentieth of April reached me two days 
ago,* and now I have those of the eighth of that month, and 
twelfth and fifteenth of March. To the contents of the last 
mentioned letter, I shall pay all due attention, whenever 
opportunities can be found or made for the purpose. I am 
happy to find, by what you say in the beginning of yours of the 
twelfth of March, that your sentiments accord so entirely 
with those, which I had the honor to express in mine of the 
twenty-second of August, and that the conduct, which I had 
thought it proper to pursue, is thereby justified. My corres 
pondence with Mr Short will have shown you, Sir, that I have 
been very far from questioning the principles which you state, 
and 1 perfectly agree, that there is little difficulty or embarrass 
ment in the application of clear principles, when the facts are 
clear. 

But while events are doubtful, the feebleness of human 
foresight may, I hope, be pardoned for hesitating, where things 
of vast moment depend on the steps to be immediately taken. 
A man of eminence in the late revolution, and who has since 
left France, urged me much to go away shortly after the tenth 
of August. As I had not, and have not, any reason to ques 
tion, either on my own account, or on that of my country, the 
sincerity of his advice, I could only examine the ground of his 
judgment, which has always been esteemed a good one. We 
differed in opinion ; but this sentiment he expressed strongly, 
In your case, said he, I would go to England or Holland, 
and from thence state the existing facts, and ask my Court to 
decide on my conduct, without waiting for future events. As 
it was clear from hence, that his reflections turned principally 

* Jefferson s Writings, Vol. iii. pp. 211, 214. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 331 

on my personal situation, I told him that my conduct would be 
influenced by considerations totally different ; and, therefore, 
conceiving it to be most conducive to the interests of the Uni 
ted States, I should stay. 

In the present moment, you will observe, Sir, by the public 
papers, that a majority of the departments declare themselves 
against the authority of the present Convention, after the ar- 
restment of their fellow members, just as in the month of June 
last, a similar majority declared their execration of the at 
tempts on Louis the Sixteenth. But who will venture to tell us 
what August is to produce ? No small part of France is in 
open war with the rest; and wherever the insurgents arrive, it 
appears that the whole country is friendly to them ; so that, if 
one were to judge by what passes in that quarter, France 
would be nearly unanimous in the re-establishment of royalty, 
should they come in force to Paris. Then the established prin 
ciple of administration would undoubtedly be, that all which 
has been done within the last year was an abominable usurpa 
tion, &LC. &ic. And without questioning our principles of gov 
ernment, they might dissent from the application of them, by the 
subtle distinction between the voice of a nation, and what would 
then be called the voice of a faction. Under circumstances 
of this sort, I am particularly happy to have received your or 
ders, which I shall implicitly obey. Accept, I pray you, 
my sincere thanks for having given them so opportunely. 

I will apply to the Minister for the orders you wish respect 
ing payments to our citizens, and I make no doubt that they 
will be transmitted. -And, indeed, I should suppose that if, 
without such orders, the payments were made by the treasury 
of the United States, the government of this country (let what 
ever government may be established) would allow the justice 
of a deduction to the amount from what we owe. It is possi 
ble that we may hereafter have occasion to insist on that prin 
ciple, among other reasons, because of the plundering of our 
ships, of which complaints are daily made to me; and which 
the present government of this country is too feeble to prevent. 



332 THE .FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

Doubtless there are many things of the sort, which do not 
come to my knowledge ; for, in some cases, the masters and 
crews, being taken out of the American ships and put on board 
the privateers, are carried very far from where their vessels 
arrive, and put on shore where chance directs or circumstances 
permit ; and, as many of the privateers are taken by British 
cruisers, some of our citizens may find their way to England, 
and some to the British colonies and foreign possessions. 

I am very happy to find that it has been in the will, and in 
the power of the United States, to make advances for the col 
ony of St Domingo, and also to send supplies of bread to this 
country. On the 27th of September I mentioned to you the 
plan of a speculation, on drafts to have been made on the United 
States, could my concurrence have been procured. Events 
have shown that this speculation would have been a good one 
to the parties, who would have gained, (and the French na 
tion, of course, have lost) about fifty thousand pounds sterling, 
in less than eighty thousand. I was informed at that time, that 
the disappointed parties would attempt to have me recalled, and 
some more tractable character sent, who would have the good 
sense to take care of his own interest. Well, Sir, nine months 
have elapsed, and now, if I were capable of such things, I 
think it would be no difficult matter to have some of them 
hanged. Indeed, it is highly probable that they will experi 
ence a fate of that sort. It is a year ago, that a person, who 
mixed in tumults to see what was doing, told me of a Sans 
Culotte who, bellowing against poor Lafayette, when Petion 
appeared, changed at once his note to vive Petion, and then 
turning round fc) one of his companions; Vois tu ! C est notre 
ami, n est ce pas ? Eh bien&gt; ilpassera comme les autres. And 
lo ! the prophecy is fulfilled ; and I this instant learn that Pe 
tion, confined to his room as a traitor or conspirator, has fled, on 
the twenty-fourth of June, 1793, from those whom he sent, on 
the twentieth of June, 1792, to assault the King in the Tuile- 
.ries. In short, you will find in the list of those, who were or 
dered by their brethren to be arrested, the names of those who 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 333 

have proclaimed themselves to be the prime movers of the 
revolution of the tenth of August, and fathers of the Re 
public. 

I am hurt and vexed at the delay of my letters. By what 
you say of the advices you had received on the eighth of April, 
mine, down to the thirteenth of February, ought to have reach 
ed you by that time ; and, indeed, notwithstanding the length 
of winter passages, there was room enough for their arrival. 
But the mischief arises from the ports where vessels are put 
up, as to sail on one day named, and some four or five weeks 
after, we learn that they are still detained. 

I have not yet received the plans of the federal town, which 
you were so kind as to send, which I am sorry for, because, if 
there is any part marked out for sale in Europe, I think, in 
the present critical moment, purchasers would be found. By 
the bye. I think a plan might be formed for purchasing land, 
and building houses there, by way of actions, but I shall not 
dwell thereon at present, and will write more fully about it, 
when I receive the plans and letters accompanying them. 

By the first very good conveyance which may offer, I will 
send out the dies you order. At present I have none such, 
and only time to write by the person who takes this with him, 
and who is to sail from Havre for New York. I would rather 
give them in charge to some one who is himself going over, for 
great neglects happen in the ports, as I know by frequent ex 
perience. 

Mr Pinckney has doubtless informed you long since, that 
Mr Droz declines going out to America.* There was some 
misunderstanding on the subject, between him and Mr Short, 
which he entered into a long history of, and desired me to 
communicate it to you, for whom he expressed the utmost de 
ference and respect. As I found it to be impossible to get him 
into the service of the United States, which was the main ob- 



*To fill the office of Chief Coiner in the Mint. 



334 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

ject, I thought it unnecessary to trouble you with a long chap 
ter of little sorenesses, which were, I could clearly see, the ef 
fect of prudent caution in Mr Short, on the irritable delicacy 
of the Artist. I am sorry, however, for the thing, because the 
conversation I had with him, and the inquiries I made, lead 
me to believe that he would have been a very faithful and use 
ful officer. 

The assurances you give in your letter of the twentieth of 
April, that our fellow citizens are disposed to preserve an ex 
act neutrality, give me sincere pleasure, as you will find from 
what I took the liberty to say on that subject in former letters. 
I fear that the frequent violations of our neutrality by the pri 
vateers, fitted out in the French ports, may provoke a change of 
sentiment. T labor incessantly to keep things quiet in that re 
gard, and I think it likely that some of my countrymen may 
think me too much attached to France, because I do not enter 
into the violence of their resentments, for which there is, as 
you will see, more ground than I choose to acknowledge to 
them. 

How long the war may last I know not ; but this I know, 
that it is very much our interest not to be drawn into it. The 
new constitution, upon which, at present, I shall make no re 
marks, but send you a copy, may, if adopted with enthusiasm, 
be the means of lengthening out the struggle, in which case 
France, or rather the ruling party in France, might triumph 
over all opposition. Otherwise, it would seem, humanly 
speaking, that if there be a perfect accord between the differ 
ent powers without, and the royalists within, this campaign 
must put an end to the whole affair. Yet who can answer for 
the contingencies of war and the fluctuations of opinion ? I 
have the honor to be, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 335 

TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Sainport, near Paris, June 25th, 1793. 

My Dear Sir, 

I have just received yours of the twenty-fifth of March. 
Not having had time to read the gazettes , which are but just 
(and but in part) arrived, I cannot from them derive the in 
formation you allude to, but my first glance at them shows 
what I am sorry to see, and from thence I am induced to 
quote a sound maxim from an excellent book. { JL house di 
vided against itself cannot stand. 

As to your re-acceptance, Sir, you know my sentiments, 
which on that, as on some other subject, are, I think, unchange 
able. It wil Ibe time enough for you to have a successor, when 
it shall please God to call you from this world s theatre. If 
such successor is then able to fill the President s chair, it will 
be matter of surprise to those, who can from a competent idea 
of the office, but during your life I consider the thing as utter 
ly impossible. And do not imagine, my dear Sir, that you can 
retire, though you may resign. You will in such case become 
the man of the opposition, however your good sense may differ 
from their madness, and your ^irtue from their villany. De 
pend on it, theyw ill cite you as being of their sentiment. If 
you are silent you assent, and if you speak you are committed. 
In the mean time your poor successor is obliged to struggle 
under all the weight of your reputation, as well as that of the 
office ; and he must be a strong man who can carry either ; of 
course a very rash man who would attempt to take up both. 

I am very happy to find, that the determination to maintain 
a strict neutrality is so general in America. I shall not dwell 
on that topic, because my several letters to Mr Jefferson con 
tain enough of it to weary your patience. By the bye, I am 
mortified more than I can tell you, at the delay my letters ex 
perience in their passage. I task my mind to its utmost bent 
to discover those events, which are most likely to happen, in 
order that (so far at least as my judgment can be relied on) 



336 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

you may be duly prepared, and after all you hear of the event 
before my almanac comes out. This is provoking, and would 
be much more so, did I not find from experience that the 
things I wish are done as well, and perhaps better than if my 
conjectures had reached you. 

I trust that long ere this you will have received what I had 
the honor to write on the twenty-eighth December, sixth and 
tenth January, and fourteenth February. You will have seen 
that in the end of last month and beginning of this, the long 
expected insurrection took place, by which a new set of men 
are brought into power. Sould the present society be able to 
establish themselves, I think M. Genet will have a successor ; 
and if, the revolution completed, things return to the point 
from whence they started, I am sure M. Genet will have a 
successor. As to those who rule, or rather the few by whom 
they are directed, you may depend that they have just ideas 
of the value of popular opinion. They are not, however, in 
a condition to act according to knowledge, and should they be 
able to reach a harbor, there will be quite as much of good luck 
as of good management in it. At any rate, a part of the crew 
will be thrown overboard. It is my opinion that the mem 
bers of the Convention lately arrested will do nothing, for the 
greater part of them have only parole energy ; and if I were 
called on by any cogent motive to act, it should be in conform 
ity to that idea. In my letter to Mr Jefferson of this day I 
tell him, that I shall implicitly obey his orders; but this is in 
reply to the broad hint, that my embarrassments may have 
arisen from inattention to the principles of free government. 
You may rely, Sir, that I shall be cautious to commit the 
United States as little as possible to future contingencies. In 
my last letter I gave you my idea of popularity : 

I have never thought that three parties would conveniently 
exist in any one country, and therefore it seems to me that 
one of those into which they who call themselves democrats 
are divided, must join the royalists. I do not inquire what 
negotiations are carried on to that effect, for I have no desire 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 337 

to meddle with such affairs, directly or indirectly, and should 
be very sorry to have the appearance of siding with any one 
party or faction whatever, being convinced that I can best do 
the business of the United States by keeping aloof from them 
all. 

Those who command the royal or Christian army, as they 
call themselves, on the Loire, are good o fficers. Their ene 
mies have, in my mind, passed the highest eulogium on tlrem, 
in saying that the soldiers are brought to such a pitch of folly 
and madness, as to rush on, armed only with clubs, and pos 
sess themselves of the artillery to whose fire they were expos 
ed. As far as I have been able to learn, they profess them 
selves the friends of order and justice, and act conformably to 
such professions, protecting both persons and property wher 
ever they arrive, and paying for whatever they take. Hence 
it happens, that their dominion is constantly extending itself, 
and if they should get possession of Nantes, which seems to be 
their present object, they will be truly formidable, because 
then by means of the Loire a passage will be opened into the 
heart of the kingdom for as many troops as foreign powers 
may choose to send thither, or if they should prefer fighting 
the battle with Frenchmen, they, need only furnish money and 
warlike stores, and they would have as many men as they 
please, and the most fertile part of France to subsist in. 

Farewell, my dear Sir ; may God bless and keep you, not 
merely for your sake, and still less for that of your friends, but 
for the general good of our country.

Paris, June 27th, 1793. 
Sir, 

My predecessor has sent me a letter, which you wrote to 
him on the nineteenth instant, demanding reparation for an 
outrage committed on board the American ship, Little Cher 
ub. The report made on this subject has been transmitted 
to you. 

The numerous occupations of the Comite de Salut Public 
not having yet allowed them to pursue the matter, I have 
thought it my duty to press a decision by a letter, of which I 
send you a copy, and I hope to announce to you in a short 
time the reparation you demand in the name of your constitu 
ents. 

I seize with eagerness this occasion to assure you, that 
the change of the chief in the department of Foreign Affairs 
will, in no degree, influence the amicable dispositions, which 
have hitherto existed in your political relations with this de 
partment. These dispositions are those of the whole nation, 
and every agent of the French people should be obliged to 
conform himself thereto, even if he had not, as in my case, 
the highest esteem, and fraternal attachment for the United 
States. 

1 trust, Sir, that events more propitious, than those now in 
question, will become the subject of our correspondence, and 
that, instead of reparations, I shall have to announce to you 
only the spontaneous testimonies of the friendship of all my 
fellow citizens for their allies. I have the honor to be, &c.

Sainport, June 27th, 1793. 
Sir, 

The United States of America, faithful to their friendship for 
the French nation, in compliance with the request made them 
by M. Ternant,* have engaged in the assistance of St Do 
mingo, in consequence of the decree passed by the National 
Assembly ; and the payment of the four millions, which oc 
casioned that decree, has been completed. In consequence of 
this same friendship, and in conformity to another request of 
M. Ternant, the necessary arrangements have been made for 
placing at the disposal of this Minister a sum of three mil 
lions, which is to be appropriated to the purchase of provisions 
for France. 

The government of the United States, in communicating to 
me the measures which I have the honor to lay before you, 
has informed me, that the administration of the Colony of St 
Domingo had purchased several cargoes, sent to that island by 
American merchants, that it had seized others, and that in 
payment of the whole it had given drafts on the representative 
of the French nation at Philadelphia, who, for want of funds, 
has been unable to honor them. No one suspects that France 
will fail to discharge at last a debt so sacred ; but in a case 
of this kind, delays are very prejudicial to the persons concern 
ed. Consequently, Sir, I have received orders to solicit from 
the French Republic instructions to her Minister in Philadel 
phia to answer these drafts, by appropriating to this purpose a 
part of the funds to be paid to him by the Treasury of the 
United States. I have the honor to be,

Sainport, June 28th, 1793. 

Sir, 

I have just received your letter of yesterday, and it gives 
me much pleasure to be able to congratulate you upon your 
nomination, at the same time that I thank you for the friendly 
sentiments you do me the honor to express for the United 
States, as well on your own part, as on that of the French na 
tion. The good will of the United States is by no means 
equivocal, and my personal attachment to France is of long 
standing, and sincere. I shall therefore feel double pleasure, 
whenever opportunities occur for giving new strength to the 
bonds which unite the two nations. I most ardently desire, 
that nothing may disturb the harmony subsisting between 
them. 

Permit me, Sir, at this time, to renew to you my solicita 
tions respecting the decree of the Convention of May 28th. 
I learn with satisfaction the daily arrival of wheat and flour, 
sent to you from America, but I feel some uneasiness respect 
ing that which has not yet arrived. Indeed, how can the en 
emies of France be prevented from following, with regard to 
us, the example she has set them, and especially England, 
who, not being restrained by the faith of treaties, (since we 
have made none with her,) will follow no impulse but that of 
her own interests. And how can we complain of it, after the 
marked preference we have given to France, and the decree 
of the 9th of May ?* 

I say nothing to you, Sir, of the impression which this decree 
will necessarily produce in America. I would rather that 



* As an act of reprisal for the decree of May 9th, England de 
clared, on the 9th of June, all the ports of France to be in a 
state of blockade against neutral ships, laden with provisions and 
destined to those ports. Such ships were to be stopped, and taken 
into British ports. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 341 

such considerations should be presented to you, by your own 
reflections, than in consequence of mine. But it is of moment 
that the Convention should come to a definitive decision, be 
cause this delay, leaving the decree in force, exposes you to 
all the inconveniences which must result from it, and without 
any advantage. I ought moreover to observe to you that it 
will be very difficult, and perhaps impossible, to prevent your 
privateers from committing illegal and outrageous acts, as long 
as they are permitted to bring into your ports all the Ameri 
can vessels laden with eatables for countries at war with 
France. I receive many complaints to this effect, and often 
what was destined for another port is brought into a French 
one, which is the cause of great inconveniences. I have the 
honor to be,

Paris, July 3d, 1793. 

Sir, 

I have received the letter, which you did me the honor to 
write on the 27th of last month. 

It is unfortunate, that the administration of St Domingo did 
not make arrangement with the French Minister in Philadel 
phia, to provide the means for paying their drafts. I have 
given to citizen Genet the necessary instructions for meeting 
them. The government of the Republic has already charged 
that Minister to testify to the President of the United States, 
its just estimate of the efforts made by our compatriots to suc 
cor the inhabitants of St Domingo. This act has confirmed 
the opinion, which we have always entertained of their attach 
ment to the French Republic. 

The National Convention, justly indignant at the violences 
committed on board the Little Cherub, have passed the de 
cree, of which I enclose a copy. I hope the reparations or-

dered by the Representatives of the people will appear to 
you satisfactory. 

I send likewise a copy of a decree, which exempts Ameri 
can ships from the dispositions of the decree of May 9th. I 
am happy to have it in my power to give this new proof of the 
fraternal sentiments of the French people for their allies, and 
of their firm determination to use every means in their power 
to maintain the treaties, which subsist between the two Repub 
lics. I have the honor to be,

Sir, 

I have just received the letter, which you did me the honor 
to write me on the third, with the accompanying copies of the 
decrees. The reparation enjoined by the representatives of 
the French nation is worthy of its justice, and consequently 
the United States will be perfectly satisfied with it. 

They will also discover, Sir, in that which exempts their 
vessels from the dispositions of the decree of May ninth, a 
new proof of the fidelity of the French in fulfilling their en 
gagements. I shall give them an account, at the same time, of 
the instructions which you have the goodness to send to citi

TO M. DEFORGUES. 

Translation. 

Sainport, August 6th, 1793. 

Sir, 

I have had the honor of receiving your two letters of the 
twenty-ninth and thirtieth July. I thank you for your atten 
tion to the affair of the brig Patty, and your services in that of 
the ship Laurens. I received, at the same time, a letter from 
Havre, dated the first of this month, and with it the copy of a 
decree, passed July twenty-seventh, upon the petition of the 
owners and crew of the privateer, le Sans Culotte, of Honfleur. 
This decree upholds the dispositions of that of May ninth, 
relative to neutral vessels, and annuls all measures which may 
contravene it. 

I cannot think, Sir, after all the Convention has done in this 
matter, that it has decided to break the treaty with the United 
States of America. I therefore persuade myself, that its good 
faith has been betrayed into passing the decree in question. 
In any case, it is of great moment that we should know on 
what to depend. The decree of May ninth was announced 
to me from Havre, before it w r as passed. The means employ 
ed to obtain it were pointed out to me ; but I persisted in be 
lieving, that such means could never succeed, the rather, as 
the interests of the French Republic seemed to me obviously 
opposed to it. The decree, however, was passed. And you 
see, Sir, that England has adopted its provisions. I have no 
doubts that Holland and Spain will imitate her example, and that 
the representations of the Ministers of the United States will 
be met by this decree of May ninth. It has been twice sol 
emnly repealed, in consequence of the representations which I 
had the honor to make ; but it has twice been revived again, 
at the solicitation of the same persons, and to obtain the con 
fiscation of property, which I was assured was American. 

I have been further assured, that the hope of the owners is 



344 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

founded solely on the want of certain formalities, required by 
the French laws&gt; but not by ours, and in themselves unimpor 
tant. I see, with regret, Sir, that great national interests thus 
become the sport of petty intrigues, and I believe the Conven 
tion will feel indignant at beholding the measures into which it 
has been led, with regard to this subject. First, a decree is 
surreptitiously obtained from it, which infringes its treaty with 
the United States, and endangers the subsistence of the peo 
ple, which they are expected to furnish in a time of scarcity. 
Then this decree is modified with respect to the United States, 
in conformity with the terms of the treaty, and the principles 
of good faith. But, a few days after, these modifications are 
annulled. Better informed, the Convention re-established 
them, and notwithstanding this, some persons dared to declare 
to the tribunal, that they should again be made void before the 
thirty -first of July ; and in effect they succeeded in destroying 
them on the twenty-seventh of that month. 

It is for the wisdom, the justice of the Convention, Sir, to 
decide at length this great question, and if it desires to main 
tain the treaty, as 1 have every reason to believe, it will be pro 
per to declare plainly and simply, that the treaty concluded 
on the 6th of February, 1778, with the United States of 
America, holds good in every point ; that every resolution op 
posed to it is null, and that henceforward no decree can im 
pugn it, unless the treaty be particularly designated. Such a 
measure, Sir, would prevent all imposition, and, by showing 
respect for the principles of good faith, would afford a ne\v 
proof of republican integrity. I have the honor to be, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Sainport. August 7th, 1793. 

Dear Sir, 

Enclosed herewith you will find my account up to the first 
of last month. I did not send it sooner, because I wished to 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 345 

comprise therein those of the Consulates, none of which are 
come forward. I shall, therefore, write to them on the sub 
ject. You will observe, that I charge therein twenty-four 
livres, given to an American sea officer. He appeared to be, 
and really was, in very great distress, so that I could not 
avoid giving what I conceived needful to carry him to the 
nearest seaport. He has since applied to me again repeated 
ly, but he has been refused all farther aid. 

You will find also a charge for engraving passports. 
This became necessary, because from the time of my arrival, 
or very shortly after it, the difficulties in the way of travelling 
were so great, that people, with all the formalities required by 
law, could scarcely get along ; and among the municipalities a 
handsome piece of paper, with a seal to it, had much more 
effect than the ministerial signatures. If, however, either or 
both of these charges be deemed improper, let them be re 
charged to me. 

I sent out more pamphlets than those I have brought to 
account, because, when an opportunity offered, I put up not 
only those I had procured for your office, but all others which 
were at hand, and which having been originally purchased for 
my own information, I did not think it proper to charge them 
to the United States. 

I also enclose herein a table of the value of the jlssignats, 
compared with specie, for one year ending with the last of 
June. During the month of July, they may be stated at 
about twenty per cent ; but upon that value, as well as on 
those contained in the table, it is necessary to observe first, 
that the fluctuations of exchange are great ; so that, to deter 
mine with precision the value requires information, which I 
believe it is impossible to obtain. For instance, louis d ors 
have sometimes borne a premium of above five per cent 
compared with silver ; and at other times have gone at par. 
Nay, this change has taken place from one day to another ; 
and on the same day there has been a difference of above five 
per cent in the price of specie. It would be necessary, there- 



346 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

fore, to know at which of two such different prices, the great 
est sum was negotiated ; and also, in other cases, whether the 
principal negotiations were in gold or silver. At first sight, 
indeed, it might be supposed that the metal of highest price 
was the one principally bought ; but I am assured that this 
rule did not hold good ; and as for the reason why it did not 
hold, we must seek it in the trick of the day, or the lie of the 
day. Sometimes, also, in the searchings and plunderings. 

But, secondly, this table, however accurate it might be, 
would not, I conceive, form a proper standard on which to 
proceed in our custom houses, because the value of commodi 
ties has been by no means dependent on that of the assignats. 
The prices have considerably increased, but not proportionate 
ly ; and the particular increase depends on the article, so that 
a history of each would be necessary. Bread, although sup 
plies have constantly been brought from abroad, has been 
kept very nearly to the old standard. Flesh is more than 
double. Vegetables four, or five, or six, times as dear as 
formerly. Merchandizes for export have not risen in propor 
tion. Wines and brandies were getting up rapidly, but the 
war damped them. They took afterwards a great rise from 
the demand of the armies, so that the low Burgundies were 
getting up to the price of the high almost. 

I am not enough acquainted with the subject to go into the 
needful details, and only say thus much, to show that mer 
chandizes did not depend for price on the same principles 
as the precious metals, since these last were purchased by 
the Nation for its armies, by the emigrants for their support, 
and by people in general, as a resource in the moment when 
paper should be decried. 

Lastly, the price of specie did not go on regular principles 
of apportionment or comparison with the mass of paper. In 
the months of May or June, 1 792, it rose, because the old 
Ministers having purchased large sums of specie, their succes 
sors found that they could dispense with immediate supplies. 
In July, August, and September, notwithstanding the political 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 347 

events, it was kept tolerably steady by the stockjobbing ma- 
Doeuvres, backed with the sums in the Treasury, and also by 
the fear of plunder after the tenth of August ; for many were 
plundered during the visites domiciliares, and it was given out 
by authority, that specie would be taken by force, and paper 
given in exchange. The benefits, which those at the centre 
of these operations expected to derive^ were prevented by the 
great, and unlocked for, successes of the French arms in Oc 
tober and November. In the end of November, and in the 
beginning of December, the proportion was about seventy- 
three per cent, being higher than is stated in the table, be 
cause in November, the exchange was lower in the beginning, 
and in December at the end of the month 5 wherefore the 
average of each is diminished. 

In the month of December, the trial of the King, the proba 
bility that he would be put to death, the consequences natural 
ly resulting from that catastrophe, the certainty of another, and 
more serious campaign, the situation of the armies, and, in fine, 
the abundance of the Assignats, when the cold weather forced 
back presumptuous hope into the region of austere reflection, 
brought down the exchange to about sixty per cent. In Jan 
uary it was tolerably steady at about fifty-eight, and in Febru 
ary at about fifty-six. The paper during this period went on 
in its natural course of gentle decay. In the beginning of 
March it was still at about fifty-six ; but the successes of the 
enemy shortly after reduced it to forty-eight. In the begin 
ning of April, it was brought down to about forty-four; so that 
in one month s time it lost about one fifth of its value. From 
that time it went on gradually again, being about forty-two at 
the end of April, and then rapidly, so as to be about thirty in 
the end of June, consequently the degradation monthly, for 
those two months, was about one sixth each. 

But in July it took a terrible plunge, viz. from thirty to 
twenty, being one third of the value taken off in a few 
days. This was owing, in part, to a view of public affairs 
both foreign and domestic, and partly to stockjobbing manoeu- 



348 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

vres carried on by authority, with a view to ruin the stockjob 
bers. These manoeuvres had, in part, their effect, for having 
forced the exchange below its natural level, it rose towards the 
end of the month, and, of course, those who speculated on a 
farther fall were taken in. The prime movers did, indeed, 
expect a wonderful rise, from the taking out of circulation 
about 1,700,000,000 of livres, on which the king s head is 
impressed ; but this stroke was broken, by the necessity of 
confining it to one half the sum, being the large Assignats, because 
the small ones dispersed in the hands of the Sans Culottes 
might have deprived the government of the support of its 
friends. 

But, besides this, the stroke was in itself a bad one, because 
it injures the paper more by depreciating its credit, than it 
benefits what remains by lessening the mass, even could the 
mass be thereby lessened, which it is not, for all the effect is to 
give a different direction to the proscribed paper in those dis 
tricts which respect the decree. Many people persist in be 
lieving that the Assignats, with that condemned impression, are 
better than the others, and even that their value is increased 
by the decree, which, drawing a line of division between 
them, leaves the future government at liberty to annul the cir 
culation now favored with an appearance of justice. 

You will observe, that men calculate upon the dissolution of 
the present system as on a datum, although the period, in 
which it is to arrive, is considered as uncertain. It is far from 
being impossible that they reckon without their host ; but the 
opinion is as important as the thing in respect to a species of 
money, whose value depends on opinion. Another circum 
stance, which should have been taken into consideration, and 
which was not duly weighed, is, that the value of the mass 
of paper depends on the course in the capital, and there the 
new Assignats must be rather more plentiful than the old ; of 
course destroying the old cannot do much good to the new. 
And, besides, the holders of the old, as well as the new, being 
in effect the great money dealers, can by their united efforts 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 349 

apportion the value to each as they please, and their common 
interest will excite a common action ; and they have over the 
government an advantage, which no power of legislation can 
compensate, because they act with the paper in circulation, 
and the government with that which goes to increase the circu 
lation, and which, of course, lessens the value which they wish 
to increase. 

From all this I conclude, that the paper must go on perish 
ing day by day, and, like other consumptive patients, be alike 
weakened by the doctor and the disease. On the whole, Sir, 
to return to your original object, I believe the safest way in 
America, and the most equitable, would be to value articles im- 
ported.from this country at the prices of 1788. I am, &ic. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Sainport, August 13th, 1793. 

Dear Sir, 

Enclosed herein you will find copies of my letters of the 
twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth of June, and sixth of August, 
to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, with copies of his letters 
to me of the third, nineteeth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth of July. 
From these you will perceive, that my application for an or 
der to the Minister of France in America to pay, out of the 
funds to be furnished by the United States, the drafts made on 
his predecessor from St Domingo, produced the desired effect. 
Some subsequent circumstances have induced me to believe, 
that under that cover an attempt will be made to pay the bills 
drawn on Europe in favor of French citizens. I have certi 
fied signatures which seemed to be calculated for that pur 
pose ; but, as I presume that measures will be taken of a cau 
tionary nature, I shall not pretend to suggest any. 

You will perceive, Sir, in this correspondence one of the 
many violations of our flag in the case of the Little Cherub, 
VOL. ii. 30 



350 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

which, being attended with circumstances of peculiar atrocity, 
called for more pointed animadversion. The conduct of the 
government on the occasion was perfectly proper. The per 
son, who committed the murder has, however, been acquitted 
on the testimony of his companions, in direct contradiction to 
that of the American master and crew. The case of the ship 
is still depending, and I know not what will be the event. It 
now appears that a part of the cargo on board of her was for 
account of Flemish merchants, and to be delivered at Ostend. 
But more of this presently. 

I must, however, take the liberty of recommending to the 
notice of government, Francis Coffyn, of Dunkirk, an old dep 
uty of Mr Barclay, while he was Consul General. On many 
occasions, especially in the affair of the Little Cherub, he has 
behaved with much sdnse, spirit, and industry. The conduct 
of such business is by no means pleasant, neither is it without 
some personal danger, for, in the present situation of this coun 
try, the laws are but little respected, and it would seem as if 
pompous declarations of the rights of man were reiterated, on 
ly to render the daily violation of them more shocking. 

You will see, Sir, in my letter of the fourth of July, a 
clause asking the liberty of an American citizen. In my ap 
plications on that subject, I have been very cautious, fearing 
that I might be deceived by British seamen, and, consequent 
ly, that our countrymen might afterwards be without redress ; 
as, in such case, the government here would throw all the 
complaints aside as being unfounded. Among others, who 
have asked the protection of the United States, are some Nan- 
tucket whalemen. And, at first, their requests were so artful 
ly made, that I was near being the dupe. I have, however, 
declined all interference in their favor, telling them that when 
they embarked under a foreign and rival flag, they forfeited 
by their own act the protection afforded by that of the United 
States, and must console themselves in their present situation 
by the privileges, which they formerly enjoyed, and which 
tempted them to engage in the British service. This is the 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 351 

general idea I have held out, but differently modified accord 
ing to the various circumstances, which individuals have 
brought forward. These people are a sort of citizens of the 
world, and, wherever they went, were the most pernicious en 
emies to their native country ; because everywhere they so 
licited, either exclusion of, or else heavy duties on, the pro 
duce of our fisheries. At present, those who were settled 
at Dunkirk have, I am told, engaged in privateering. Pro 
bably, if the war lasts, the whole hive may settle again within 
the territory of the United States, and the more they endure, 
in the mean time, the sooner will they adopt that salutary de 
termination. 

The decree respecting neutral bottoms, so far as it regards 
the vessels of the United States, has, as you will see, been 
bandied about in a shameful manner. I am told from Havre, 
that it is by the force of money, that the determinations, which 
violate our rights, have been obtained; and on comparing 
dates, events, and circumstances, this idea seems to be but too 
well supported. I will make no comments on the facts, 
because my opinions are of no consequence. The true state 
of them will result from the enclosed pieces, and the United 
States will judge thereon. I have, &c.

loss, but to take in return commodities and articles manufac 
tured in France; that many of them have freighted their 
vessels to carry merchandize to the French colonies, for 
French merchants; that the exportation of all merchandize 
being prohibited, they will be obliged to discharge what they 
have on board, and to depart in ballast, in consequence of 
losing the considerable freight which had been stipulated. 

I do not pretend, Sir, to interfere in the internal concerns 
of the French Republic, and I am persuaded that the Conven 
tion has had weighty reasons for laying upon commerce the 
restrictions of which the American captains complain. The 
result will nevertheless be, that this prohibition will seriously 
aggrieve the parties interested, and will put an end to the 
commerce between France and the United States, which was 
beginning to be brisk, and promised us fortunate results. It is, 
then, from a sincere desire to see the bonds of amity between 
the two nations more closely drawn, that I beg you, Sir, to 
have the goodness to examine whether there be not some way, 
either by an exception to the law, or by especial permission, 
to let the vessels of the United States depart, with their cargoes, 
for the ports of the said States, or the French Colonies. I 
have the honor to be, &tc.

THOMAS JEFFERSON TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

Philadelphia, / ngust 22d, 1793. 

Dear Sir, 

The letter of the 16th instant, with its documents accompa 
nying this, will sufficiently inform you of the transactions which 
have taken place between M. Genet, the Minister of France, 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 353 

and the government here, and of the painful necessity they 
have brought on, of desiring his recall. The letter has been 
prepared in the view of being itself, with its documents, laid 
before the Executive of the French government.* You will, 
therefore, be pleased to lay it before them, doing everything 
which can be done on your part, to procure it a friendly and 
dispassionate reception and consideration. The President 
would, indeed, think it greatly unfortunate, were they to take 
it in any other light ; and therefore charges you very particu 
larly with the care of presenting this proceeding in the most 
soothing view, and as the result of an unavoidable necessity on 
his part. 

M. Genet, soon after his arrival, communicated the decree 
of the National Convention of February 15th, 1793, authorising 
their Executive to propose a treaty with us on liberal princi 
ples, such as might strengthen the bonds of good will, which 
unite the two nations ; and informed us in a letter of May 23d, 
that he was authorised to treat accordingly. The Senate be 
ing then in recess, and not to meet again till the fall, I apprised 
M. Genet that the participation in matters of treaty, given by 
the constitution to that branch of our government, would of 
course delay any definitive answer to his friendly proposition. 
As he was sensible of this circumstance, the matter has been 
understood to lie over till the meeting of the Senate. You will 
be pleased, therefore, to explain to the Executive of France this 
delay, which has prevented as yet our formal accession to their 
proposition to treat, to assure them that the President will 
meet them with the most friendly dispositions, on the grounds 
of treaty proposed by the National Convention, as soon as he 
can do it in the forms of the constitution, and you will of 
course suggest for this purpose, that the powers of M. Genet 
be renewed to his successor. I have the honor to be, &ic.

354 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Sainport, September 22d, 1793. 
Dear Sir, 

My last was of the thirteenth of last month. This will ac 
company a triplicate of what I had the honor to write on the 
seventh of August, also some copies of letters to the Ministers. 
By the bye, I shall cease to send you copies of my various 
applications in particular cases, for they are so numerous, that 
they will cost you more in postage than they are worth. I 
suppose Mr Pinckney has his hands full of similar business, 
for I learn, now and then, that the British privateers make as 
free with our vessels as the French have done. 

I understand that it is still in contemplation to repeal the de 
cree I complained of, and that, in the mean time, it has not 
been transmitted to the tribunals. We shall see, in effect, 
that this decree can do very little harm, because the fleets of 
this country are confined by those of the enemy, and the priva 
teers by a decree of the Convention. 

The exchange, during the last month, experienced great 
shocks, owing to the violent measures pursued by the govern 
ment to support it. On the whole, they have kept it at about 
two and a half to three for one. But merchandizes have risen 
rapidly in price, and must continue to rise ; among other rea 
sons, which will easily suggest themselves to your mind, be 
cause the compression on the paper mass in one place must 
force it out in another. Even lands feel the effect, although 
the market has been for two years, at least, greatly overstock 
ed with that article. 

The paralyzing of apart of the Assignats had, as I told you, 
an effect which could be but momentary. A further decree 
was therefore passed against them, whose effect also diminish 
ed in the first moment. To prevent agiotage, the Effets 
publics were ordered to be recorded, and the India Compa 
ny s property was seized ; and as this was not sufficient, the 
Caisse d Escompte was abolished. Still the immense amount 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 355 

raised by political gas, could not but bring down with it the 
supporting balloons ; wherefore, at last the bankers and bro 
kers were laid hold of. I am told that amid the menaces 
against those who may remit to foreign countries, agents of the 
government offered some bills cheap, and that the purchasers 
were imprisoned as Gens suspects. However, experience 
shows that evils inherent in the nature of things cannot be pre 
vented, otherwise than by destroying the things themselves. 
By the law, it is death to sell or buy specie, and yet specie is 
publicly bought and sold every day. 

You have, I hope, received the new constitution, which you 
see is suspended, until the revolution shall be finished. You 
will have seen also, that the party of the Girondes, or Brisso- 
tins, is quite down ; but as yet none of them have been exe 
cuted. Probably the first great misfortune will call them from 
their dungeons as expiatory victims. I am not possessed of the 
proofs which exist against them, and it is, you know, a maxim 
of our law, that every man is presumed to be innocent, untft 
his guilt is proved. If one may judge from the infinite precau 
tions taken, one w r ould conclude that the very great majority 
in this country is become royalist. I think I have already 
mentioned my conviction, that there cannot long exist three 
parties. It is said that the Brissotins, as soon as their adver 
saries gained the upper hand, enlisted themselves, in secret, 
under the royal banner ; but I think strong proof should be 
required before that fact is admitted. 

I do not mention to you the military events, because you 
will learn them fully from the different gazettes, and because I 
do not think military events decide so much as is generally 
believed. If the success be nearly balanced, France is so far 
victorious. But her resources are wearing away very fast, and 
the period seems to approach when the state of her finances 
will be of little moment, because the needful things will no 
longer exist ; and, of course, they can neither be bought with 
money, nor seized by force, nor obtained through solicitation. 
Will the allied armies push on to Paris ? What would be 



356 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

the effect of their appearance? Two important questions, 
To answer the first would be presumption, and to answer the 
second would look like madness. I am, &c.

Sainport, October 1st, 1793. 
Sir, 

I have the honor to send you herewith, the copies of two 
judgments, rendered with regard to the American vessel, the 
George. By the first, the tribunal, in conforming itself to the 
treaty of 1778, declared her unlawful prize; but by the sec- 
ondj a part of the cargo is condemned, as hostile property ; 
and the tribunal has founded its decision upon the decree of 
the twenty-seventh of July. 

Captain Richard Stevens, of the American vessel, the 
Hope, also complains very bitterly of a sentence rendered late 
ly against a part of the cargo of this vessel, which is incontest- 
ably American property. This captain informs me, that the 
tribunal of St Brieu has founded its decision on the circum 
stance, that in the invoice, the owners of the vessel had added 
their commission to the price of the articles therein comprised ; 
a thing in use among merchants, who by this means insuring 
the whole shelter from maritime danger, the price of their 
labor, as they do that of their merchandizes. I do not cite, 
Sir, this sentence in the form of a complaint, first, because 
I have not yet received an authentic copy of it, and above all, 
because I am persuaded that the superior tribunal, to whom an 
appeal must be made, will not fail to render justice. 

I desire only to let you see, Sir, how much discontent the 
execution of the decree of the 27th of July must excite. 

Persuaded that the Convention wishes to maintain the clos 
est connexions between our two Republics, I have given to 
our Ministry the most positive assurances of it ; but they will 



THE FBENCH REVOLUTION. 357 

be contradicted by the injured persons, who doubtless will ac 
cuse the Minister with supineness, who does not adopt the feel 
ings of his fellow citizens ; and my efforts will fail of their ef 
fect, as soon as it can be imagined, that I do not render a faith 
ful account of the dispositions of the French Republic, from 
the want of intelligence or exactness. 

I request you, Sir, to pardon an observation which regards 
the particular interests of France. The circumstances of the 
moment prevent the fitting out of privateers, consequently, it 
would cost her nothing to cause the treaty to be observed with 
the greatest exactitude. Then the contrast, which the Ameri 
cans would make between the conduct of France, and that of 
her enemies, could not but be favorable ; but at present, on the 
contrary, every time we complain of the conduct of the Eng 
lish, they shut our mouths by this decree of the 27th of July. 
Nothing is more embarrassing for our Minister at London, and 
nothing can be more injurious to the French Republic, in the 
opinion of the neutral powers. 

I hope, Sir, that you will observe in the freedom of the ob 
servations I have just made to you, the amicable and fraternal 
dispositions, which have dictated them. I am sure, at least, of 
conforming to the views of the United States, in following my 
own inclination, to remove everything that might change the 
good harmony, which exists between two nations, allied as well 
by the force of sentiment, as by that of treaties. I have the 
honor to be, &tc.

therefore hasten to send you them, in the original r begging you

sincere attachment on the part of the United States, and of

Sir, 

I have received the letter, which you did me the honor to

I shall give the Council an account of the punishable (pun- 
issable) conduct of their agent in the United States, and I 
can assure you, beforehand, that they will regard the strange 
abuse of their confidence by this agent, as I do, with the live

done justice to our sentiments, in attributing the deviations of 
the citizen Genet to causes entirely foreign from his instruc

your government, that so far from having authorised the pro

360 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Paris, October 10th, 1793. 

Dear Sir, 

I have written a short letter this day, in answer to your 
despatches. Herewith I do myself the honor to transmit the 
copy of what I wrote on the 22d of last month. The 
exchange has been sustained as there mentioned. 

On the eighth of last month, I desired Mr Jones (with 
whom Mr Fenwick had entrusted his consular affairs during a 
voyage he made to England) to give you his opinion respect 
ing the situation and temper of Bourdeaux, with the reasons 
therefor. The gazettes will have shown you, that apprehen 
sions were entertained respecting the dispositions of people in 
that quarter. I believe that there is still cause to apprehend, 
more especially as the insurrection in the Vendee is more 
menacing than ever. 

The conduct of the Convention respecting our treaty, will 
have formed a useful reinforcement to those, who would pre 
serve our Constitution. My efforts to support the treaty have 
been constant and persevering, although, in my private judg 
ment, the breach of it on the part of our allies, by releasing us 
from the obligations it has imposed, could not but be useful 
under the present circumstances. 

I am very anxious that Consuls and Vice Consuls should be 
appointed in all the ports. My countrymen are incessantly 
applying to rne from every quarter about property taken 
from them. I am desired from abroad to claim such property. 
The courts chicane very much here, under the pretence that 
claimants do not produce proper authority from the owners, fee. 
I have decidedly refused to lend my name on such occasions, 
because I am certain that I should be thereupon represented as 
a party interested, and, of course, my representations against 
the iniquitous proceedings, which are but too frequent, would 
be disregarded. It happens also that I am called upon to 
name proper agents in the ports where there is no Consul. In 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 361 

such cases, I must take the recommendation of a banker, and 
incur the risk of placing a person, interested in a capture, as 
protector of the property taken. 

The state of public affairs here involves me in another 
very disagreeable predicament. My fellow citizens are ag 
grieved and apply for redress, to which they are justly enti 
tled, and which they are led to expect with the greater cer 
tainty, as every public act breathes warm attachment to the 
United States. On the other hand, it is frequently impossi 
ble to obtain redress, because the government, omnipotent in 
some cases, is, in others, not merely feeble, but enslaved. I 
am forced to see that my demands must embarrass and fre 
quently irritate them. The ministers, who ought to be 
accountable agents of public authority, are placed in such 
direct subordination to the Comite de Salut Public, that even 
the common routine must await their fiat, and they are unac 
countable, and swayed by the terror of an insurrection, which 
may be excited at any moment, should they displease the 
leaders of this city. Consequently, while they see and 
lament the consequences of many acts, they are obliged to 
commit them. 

A knowledge of this reduces me to the necessity of choos 
ing between national and particular interests. In preferring 
the former, the latter become clamorous, and I am sure that 
I shall be represented as an idle and unprofitable servant. 
To this inevitable evil I must submit. But another has 
arisen out of it, which gives me concern. In assigning to 
complainants the reasons why their expectations must be dis 
appointed, I have been obliged to state things, which, being 
repeated and misrepresented, have produced a disagreeable 
effect in the minds of those, who are to decide on the appli 
cations I make. 

This will appear more clearly from an example. On the 
twentieth of August a deputation of four ship captains, chosen 
by their brethren of Bordeaux, called upon me with a rep 
resentation of the injustice they experienced in being prevent- 

VOL. II. 31 



362 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 

ed from sailing with their cargoes, &c. Their suffering was 
occasioned by one of those decrees, which, being commanded 
by the popular cry in a time of violence, the legislature, 
though it may perceive the impolicy, dares not repeal. The 
deputation, as is natural, had flattered themselves with imme 
diate and ample redress. It was my duty to moderate their 
expectations, and to explain the difficulties. Interest is often 
blind and seldom just. My moderation was ill suited to their 
wishes, and my letter to the minister, of which a copy is en 
closed, seemed to them rather an abandonment of their cause, 
than the prosecution of the only redress which appeared to 
me attainable, and in the only way by which it might be 
effected. I had cautioned them particularly not to ask too 
much, because they would thereby run the risk of not obtain 
ing what they asked, or, if they should obtain ft, of seeing 
their hopes blasted in the bud, by a repeal of an indulgent 
decree. 

What had passed respecting the article of our treaty, favor 
able to the navigation of neutral vessels, was an instance so 
clear of the influence which prevails in the Convention over 
the principles of policy, as well as of justice, that, while it 
gufded my advice, it ought to have swayed their conduct. In 
closed you have a copy of their memorial to the Convention. 
I have not thought it worth while to inquire by whom it was 
written. The style shows it to be from a French hand. I 
learn that a favorable reception was secured by repeating 
such parts of my conversation, as might at once irritate the 
members of the Comite de Saint Public, and justify the per 
sonal application of American citizens while their Minister 
was on the spot. A decree was obtained, and before it 
could be executed was repealed. 

Thus it has happened, that they did mischief, without any 
benefit to themselves, and only served an ambition so con 
temptible, that I shall draw over it the veil of oblivion. The 
important facts of this matter came to my knowledge in the 
close of the last month, and, therefore, in mine of the first 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 363 

instant to M. Deforgues, of which a copy is enclosed, I took 
occasion to meet the mischief without going out of my way 
to seek it. This was the situation of things, when I receiv 
ed your important despatches. I need not comment upon it, 
because you will naturally place yourself in my situation and 
feel its unpleasantness. 

I will not now give you anything in the style of news, de 
ferring that until the moment when Captain Culver shall be 
about to depart. In the mean time, I pray you to accept the 
assurances of that esteem and respect, with which I have the 
honor to be, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO M. DEFORGUES. 

Translation. 

Paris, October 12th, 1793. 

Sir, 

I have the honor to send you herein enclosed, the copy of a 
letter, which has been addressed to me by citizen Postic, a 
lawyer residing at Morlaix. It appears, that in the proceed 
ings of which he has given an account, there are extraordina 
ry irregularities, and I think it my duty to inform you of them, 
as on the justice of tribunals often depends the salvation, and 
always the prosperity of a State. 

I request you at the same time, Sir, to permit me to make 
two general observations on the whole of this business; one of 
which applies to the organization, and the other to the pro 
ceedings of the commercial tribunals. The referring of ques 
tions on sea prizes to these tribunals, appears to me dangerous, 
since they involve the interpretation of the treaties, and the 
application of the law of nations ; consequently of peace and 
of war. Now we may be permitted to entertain some doubt, 
as to the knowledge of the judges, and we ought besides to 
fear, lest they may be interested, as owners of privateers, in 
the questions which are submitted to them. 



364 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

But whatever may be the organization of the tribunals, it 
appears to me essential, Sir, that in their proceedings they 
should receive all the claims which may be made to them ; 
that they should even invite, without waiting for the authority 
of the persons interested, who are often at the distance of one 
thousand leagues. The jurisdiction of the tribunals, within 
whose cognizance are the questions of prize, is in rem. They 
take possession of the thing, and by that means render them 
selves responsible for it. Now as the tribunals, which are the 
depository of the thing, ought not to dispossess themselves of 
it, without a formal authoritative act of the true proprietor, it is 
their duty, not only to admit, but also to seek proofs, which 
may establish to whom the property truly belongs. This is a 
double duty, towards the neutral proprietor, and towards their 
own nation ; for every government, which permits its citizens 
to fit out privateers, arms with the destructive sword of war, 
hands which are interested to extend its ravages, and renders 
itself responsible for the abuses, which result from so danger 
ous a delegation of sovereignty. For the purpose of repress 
ing them, the Admiralty tribunals have been established 
throughout the different nations of Europe. In these tribunals, 
the government furnishes the means of information, by the fa 
cility with which it admits therein every species of claim. It 
preserves, by appeals, the right of deciding in the last resort 
on the contests which therein arise ; and it gives the necessary 
time to enlighten its conscience on thorny questions, before 
the pronouncing of a sentence, which might extend or prolong 
the horrors of war. 

These, Sir, are the reflections which experience has dicta 
ted to me. They daily make on me a more lively impression, 
on account of the claims addressed to me by my countrymen, 
of which 1 have communicated to you but a very small part. 
I always send to the tribunals the injured persons, by giving 
them the most positive assurances, that they will there obtain 
complete and prompt justice. I have the honor to be, &c. 

GoUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 365 

M. DEFORGUES TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

Translation. 

Paris, October 14th, 1793. 
Sir, 

You have complained of the fraud committed by the captors 
of the ship Peggy, in taking away the papers, which proved her 
cargo to be American. The lawyer, who informed you of 
this fact, proposes to collect the necessary proofs. It is deter 
mined, as soon as your correspondent at Morlaix shall trans 
mit these proofs, to punish the guilty according to the utmost 
rigor of the law. 

You observe that it is to be feared, that the judges may be 
interested in the cases submitted to them. To avoid such an 
inconvenience, the law grants to the injured party the resource 
of an appeal, and in the last resort a direct intervention of the 
administration, and legislative body. 

The extreme rigor, with which the English and the oth 
er belligerent powers treat all the neutral vessels destined for 
France, has put the Republic to the painful necessity of ar 
resting, by way of reprisal, in such vessels the provisions be 
longing to its enemies. This severe measure, clearly explain 
ed in the decree of the ninth of May, of which I enclose you 
a copy, is the result of the most imperious circumstances. It 
will continue only as long as our enemies employ against us 
means disapproved of by the laws of humanity, and by those 
of war. In casting your eye on this law, you can hardly, Sir, 
avoid the conviction, that it was necessary and just ; that the 
Republic could no longer, without inattention to itself, preserve 
tolerable decency towards its implacable and ferocious enemies, 
and that the system of depriving them of foreign produce was 
also to dissipate its means of offence. 

In comparing this law with the declaration made by the 
British government, at Stockholm, Copenhagen, Florence, and 
probably at Philadelphia, you will observe an extreme differ 
ence between our manner of thinking and that of our enemies. 
31* 



366 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

You will see on the one hand, the firm determination of de 
stroying several millions of victims, merely to satisfy a spirit 
of vengeance or of ambition, and on the other, the desire of 
repelling unjust aggressions by severe laws, and a regret at be 
ing reduced to that extremity. 

Here then, Sir, in tw r o words is the situation in which the 
Republic stands. Its enemies have openly usurped the right 
of seizing all the provisions, which are destined to it, and even 
all the Frenchmen found on board of neutral vessels. But 
it seems that France, attacked on all sides, abandoned to its 
own strength, without allies, without foreign succor, should 
confine herself scrupulously to the maxims of the law of na 
tions, so cruelly violated by her enemies. Hence it would 
result, that the neutrality of several powers would be partial, 
that it would operate only in favor of our enemies, whose 
commerce would be peaceably carried on under the shelter of 
a borrowed flag, while ours could not under any flag what 
ever. 

The law of the ninth of May is conditional, whilst the de 
clarations of the combined powers are positive. It is in their 
power to put a period to the execution of this law, by permit 
ting neutral vessels to communicate freely with France. 

These observations, Sir, which you are too just not to appre 
ciate, apply to the greater part of the claims, which you have 
addressed to me for some time. I have done, with respect to 
several of them, all that depended on me, in order to obtain in 
favor of your countrymen an exception of the general mea 
sures, adopted with regard to neutral nations. I have used, 
among others, all the means with which your letters furnished 
me, to have restored the ship Laurens ; but I have met with 
insurmountable obstacles, in the established laws, and in the 
opinion of the commercial tribunal of Havre. The tribunal 
has neglected nothing to render justice to the owners of this 
vessel. It has consented among other things, to have transla 
ted two hundred and sixty-one letters, merely to prove in the 
most authentic manner the property of the cargo. The in- 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 367 

terested have besides avowed themselves, that they had neg 
lected an essential formality required by our laws. 

You must be satisfied, Sir, with the manner in which the re 
quest, presented by the American captains from Bordeaux, 
has been received. This fact&gt; and several others of the same 
kind, which could not escape your attention, must have con 
vinced you, that when the particular circumstances of the Re 
public permitted the administration to favor your countrymen, 
it was eager to give to them testimonies of the desire, which it 
always has had, of bringing nearer and nearer the citizens and 
the interests of the two countries. 

We hope, that the government of the United States will 
attribute to their true cause, the abuses of which you complain, 
as well as other violations of which our cruisers may render 
themselves guilty, in the course of the present war. It must 
perceive how difficult it is, to contain within just limits the in 
dignation of our marines, and in general of all the French pa 
triots, against a people who speak the same language, and 
have the same habits, as the free Americans. The difficul 
ty of distinguishing our allies from our enemies, has often been 
the cause of offences committed on board your vessels ; all 
that the administration could do, is to order indemnification to 
those who have suffered, and to punish the guilty. 

I enclose herein several copies of the navigation act, de 
creed by the representatives of the people. I request you to 
make the dispositions of them known to the government of the 
United States. It will there find the basis of a system con 
necting more and more the interests of the two nations. 

DEFORGUES. 

P. S. I enclose herein, Sir, an arret of the Committee of 
Public Safety, which fulfils in part the object proposed in 
your letter of the 13th of this month. I shall have the honor 
of communicating to you the measures, which shall be taken 
in the sequel. 



368 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 



TO ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 

Paris, October 17th, 1793. 

My Dear Sir, 

Mr Livingston delivered to me yours of the 25th of July. 
He says that you alone gave him an idea of this country like 
the reality. His astonishment proves that he did not believe 
you, and, could you hear him, you might, in your turn, be as 
tonished to find that your sound understanding, while it grasp 
ed the future event, had never contemplated the progressive 
circumstances. I leave to others the painful task of drawing 
pictures, which, to resemble the truth, must, like an Indian 
warrior, be painted red and black. 

* It is in your character of Financier, that I transmit the 
annexed report, which suspended for a few doubtful days the 
weight which, with crushing force, falls on the monied men. 
Early in 1789, I ventured to declare, from what I then ob 
served, that the laws of property being violated, all would, in 
their turns, be sacrificed on the same altar. Already the 
Church, the Magistrature, the Nobility have passed away. 
Bankers, merchants, and manufacturers are now in the crucible. 
I leave to your algebraic science to resolve the problem of 
how long a supposed society can exist, after property shall 
have been done away. Perhaps you may be too busy to form 
equations, and may reply as a statesman, that government be 
ing instituted to protect property, is respected only in propor 
tion to the fulfilment of that duty, and durable only as it is re 
spectable. I respect you too much to contradict your opinions, 
and therefore confine myself to the more agreeable task of as 
suring you that I am, &c.

THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 369 

TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Paris, October 18th, 1793. 

My Dear Sir, 

You will see by the official correspondence, that your or 
ders are complied with, and that your intentions are fulfilled. 
Permit me on this occasion to remark, that had the people of 
America been well informed of the state of things on this side 
of the Atlantic, no one would have dared to adopt the conduct 
which M. Genet has pursued. In reading the few gazettes 
which have reached me, I am surprised to see so little sound 
intelligence. 

The present government is evidently a despotism both in 
principle and practice. The Convention now consists of on 
ly a part of those, who were chosen to frame a constitution. 
These, after putting under arrest their fellows, claim all power, 
and have delegated the greater part of it to a Committee of 
Safety. You will observe, that one of the ordinary measures 
of government is to send out Commissioners with unlimited 
authority. They are invested with power to remove officers 
chosen by the people, and put others in their places. This 
power, as well as that of imprisoning on suspicion, is liberally 
exercised. The revolutionary tribunal established here to 
judge on general principles, gives unbounded scope to will. 
It is an emphatical phrase in fashion among the patriots, that 
terror is the order of the day. Some years have elapsed since 
Montesquieu wrote, that the principle of arbitrary govern 
ments is fear. 

The Queen was executed the day before yesterday. In 
sulted during her trial, and reviled in her last moments, she 
behaved with dignity throughout. This execution will, I 
think, give to future hostilities a deeper dye, and unite more 
intimately the allied powers. It will silence the opposition of 
those, who would not listen to the dismemberment of this 
country, and, therefore it may be concluded that the blow by 
which she died was directed from a distance. 



370 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

But whatever may be the lot of France in remote futurity, 
and putting aside the military events, it seems evident that she 
must soon be governed by a single despot. Whether she will 
pass to that point through the medium of a triumvirate, or 
other small body of men, seems as yet undetermined. I think 
it most probable that she will. A great and awful crisis seems 
to be near at hand. A blow is, I am told, meditated which 
will shroud in grief and horror a guilty land. Already the 
prisons are surcharged with persons, who consider themselves 
victims. Nature recoils, and I yet hope that these ideas are 
circulated only to inspire fear. I am, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MoKUIS, 



TO M. DEFORGUES. 

Translation. 

Paris, October 19th, 1793. 

Sir, 

The attention, which several pressing affairs required, made 
it impossible for me sooner to answer the letter, which 
you did me the honor of writing to me on the 14th. I 
have examined, with respectful care, the decree of the 9th of 
May, emanating from the conduct of your enemies, and sup 
ported by some reasons to which you have given their 
greatest lustre. 

It is possible, Sir, that the difference of our position leads 
us to see the same object in a different manner. But although 
T cannot be of your opinion, I do not intend farther to discuss 
the considerations, which have produced the decision of the 
French government. I confine myself to the rendering of a 
faithful account of it to the government of the United States, 
and I am persuaded that in considering them, liberal friend 
ship will put in the balance the difficulties of a revolution, and 
of a war without example. 

I ought, however, to observe to you, Sir, that the question 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 371 

does not appear to me to turn on the law of nations, but on an 
exception to that law, by the stipulations of a treaty. This 
treaty, in derogating from this law, in favor of merchandizes of 
your enemies found in our vessels, has derogated, in like man 
ner, from it, to the prejudice of our merchandizes found in the 
vessels of your enemies. We have seen at Philadelphia the 
public sale of a cargo, the property of one of our citizens, tak 
en by a French privateer on board an English vessel. All 
opposition was of no avail, because, according to the constitu 
tion, our treaties are the supreme law of the land. You will 
agree, Sir, that it is hard for my fellow citizens not to have 
the advantage either of the treaty or of the law of nations ; to 
lose their merchandizes by the treaty, and not to be able to 
compensate themselves for it, under the protection of this same 
treaty, by the freight of enemy s merchandizes. In comparing 
the facts of the same epoch, you will be amazed on seeing 
what passed at Paris and at Philadelphia. Your good sense 
will lead you to anticipate the claims of our merchants, and 
the insinuations of our enemies. I have the honor to be, &LC. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Paris, October 19th, 1793. 
Dear Sir, 

My last will accompany this, and I enclose herein the co 
pies of letters from the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the tenth, 
fourteenth, and seventeenth instants, and also copies of mine to 
him of the llth, 12th, and 13th, and also one just written. 

By his letter of the tenth, you will see the determination to 
act decisively. In a subsequent conversation he assured me, 
that Genet should be punished. I replied that the United 
States had only ordered me to ask his recall, and I could go no 
farther. The idea is to send over a Commission of three or 
four persons; and to authorise that board to send him over a 



372 THE TRENCH REVOLUTION* 

prisoner. I kept the advice boat here a week, in order to em 
bark the Commissioners on board of her. But although the 
instructions are all ready, there remains some little embarrass 
ment about the appointment of one of the persons. This 
prevents them from being ready ; and, as it appears to me 
very important that you should have early advice, I cannot 
by any longer delay risk the near approach of winter on the 
American coast. 

It is probable that the successor of M. Genet may ask the 
interposition of our government in the discussions likely to 
arise. I have given assurances to the extent of what our laws 
and constitution may authorise. You will be able to measure 
better than I can that extent, and, at any rate, this hint will be 
kept secret, for that is, as you will readily see, of the utmost 
importance. 

In M. Deforgues letter of the fourteenth, and the decree 
which accompanied it, you will see the reasons assigned for 
violating the treaty. You will see, also, that it was not from 
the difficulty of refuting them, that I declined entering into 
the controversy. In effect, he had acknowledged and lament 
ed to me the impropriety of the decree, but, unable to prevail 
over a greater influence for the repeal of it, he is driven to 
the necessity of excusing a step, which it is not possible to 
justify. There is no use in arguing with those who are alrea 
dy convinced ; and, where no good is expected, some evil 
may follow. I have, therefore, only stated the question on its 
true ground, and leave to you in America to insist on a rigid 
performance of the treaty, or slide back to the equal state of 
unfettered neutrality. Your orders will, of course, be given 
to me according to the determination, which the President 
shall take, and until then I hold the matter open. 

We have constantly the news of victory, but the public is 
incredulous. Lately orders were expedited to attack in ev 
ery quarter; and as this is a measure originating with the 
government, those who pretend to judge of intelligence be 
forehand, say, that it must be favorable. There is, at any 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 373 

rate, the resource of concealing it, and although it would, at 
first sight, appear next to impossible that, in a country flooded 
with gazettes, there should he no note of long and bloody 
battles, yet the severity of the decrees against those who dis 
courage the exertions of the Republic, and the greater severity 
with which all such decrees are executed, awe the boldest 
printers, and hush even the whispers of private information. 
You must not be surprised, therefore, to find in the Dutch 
and English gazettes the account of actions, which are passed 
over in silence by those I send you. 

It is unfortunate that you are thus disabled from comparing 
different accounts, and forced to judge from partial recital, 
The best remaining resource is to contrast the ministerial and 
opposition prints. Among the persons best informed, it seems 
to be doubtful, whether the Allies will push on towards the city, 
or wear away the national resources by warring on the front 
iers. The former would have consisted better with a determi 
nation to restore the monarchy, and the latter seems to indi 
cate a projected dismemberment. 

In the mean time, the expense of blood and treasure to this 
country is inconceivable. Already artisans and laborers of ev 
ery kind are extremely rare. The price of mechanics is risen 
to twelve livres, that of common hands to five livres, and this, 
notwithstanding the regulation of subsistence to something ve 
ry near the ancient standard. Manufactures are becoming 
very dear, and the attempt to limit prices, though enforced by 
the dreadful guillotine, cannot but produce the reverse of what 
it is intended for. 

The ensuing winter, unless some important changes take place, 
must be productive of scenes most melancholy and distress 
ing. If the enemy possesses himself of the strong holds along 
the northern frontier, he will undoubtedly ravage Picardy with 
his immense cavalry during the winter season, and thus destroy 
one great granary. The resources of Barbary, Sicily, and 
Italy are already cut oft from the south. The Vendee is in 
VOL. ii. 32 



374 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

train to become a desert. The army of the Republic lays it 
waste with fire and sword. I will not endeavor to paint the 
various wretchedness, which has been described to me as ex 
isting in that quarter. If the war continue another year, the 
wishes of those who meditate the ruin of France will be so far 
accomplished, that many years of peace will not be able to re 
store her wealth and population. This will, I think, be a mis 
fortune to the United States, and in all possible events the 
present turmoil of Europe will furnish terrible examples to the 
present age, and to a distant posterity. I am ; &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

P. S. I have paid four hundred and forty livres for pack 
ing up the statue of General Washington. Is this to be charg 
ed to the United States ? Or will you receive it for me from 
the State of Virginia ? 



TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Paris, October 19th, 1793. 

My Dear Sir, 

I had hopes until last evening, that the persons, who are to go 
out as Commissioners from hence, would have embarked with 
Captain Culver, but circumstances have delayed the appoint 
ment. The plan which was in agitation, and which will 
probably be carried into effect, is to send over three or four 
Commissioners, one of whom will be charged with Letters of 
Credence, but instructed to conform to the directions of the 
Board. It is probable that the new Minister, immediately on 
being presented, will ask you to aid in securing the person 
and papers of the old one. My public despatch of this day 
contains a remote hint to lead the investigation of the Secretary 
of State. I did not choose to be more particular, because you 
can both give and take the informations you think proper. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 375 

I have favored, or rather excited the idea of this procedure 
for the following reasons. First, such a public act will place 
in a contemptible light the faction connected with M. Genet. 
Secondly, the seizure of his papers, by exposing his connexions 
with prime movers, will give a lesson to others. And thirdly, 
the Commissioners who exercise this high handed authority 
will, on reflection, feel the necessity of respecting your gov 
ernment, lest they should meet a similar fate. Having alarmed 
their apprehensions, as to the effect which M. Genet s impru 
dence might produce, and knowing the public and private 
views of the parties, I have insinuated the advantage which 
might result from an early declaration on the part of the new 
Minister, that as France has announced her determination not 
to meddle with the interior affairs of other nations, so he can 
know only the government of America. In unison with this 
idea, 1 told the Minister that I had observed an overruling 
influence in their affairs, which seemed to come from the other 
side of the Channel, and at the same time had traced the 
intention to excite a seditious spirit in America. That it was 
impossible to be on a friendly footing with such persons, but 
that at present a different spirit seemed to prevail. This 
declaration produced the effect J intended. The Minister has 
himself the wish to go out to America as Plenipotentiary, and 
M. Otto, his principal secretary, having the same wish, they 
will, I believe, endeavor while they stay to put things in good 
train here. 

It may be an important^ we^ cia/ question, how far the Minis 
ter is protected by the law of nations, after the arrival of his 
successor. In my opinion the same principles, which exempt 
him from the municipal law, subject him to the will of his 
sovereign, and of course the aid given to the new Minister is 
not an act of the judiciary but of the executive, performed as 
an ally and friend, and is merely discretionary. I find that 
this Commission will endeavor to get hold of the debt from 
America to France by anticipation. If no other reasons milita 
ted against the advance, the advantage of a pledge to satisfy 



376 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 

damages, which our citizens may sustain during the present 
violence, is considerable, and will not, I presume, be overlooked. 
I am, &c.

TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Paris, October 20th, 1793. 

Dear Sir, 

I intend to despatch Captain Culver tomorrow morning, and 
shall give into his charge a box containing three dies of medals, 
and three boxes containing each one pair of dies. Whether 
he will be able to take them to you is uncertain, owing to 
trifling circumstances. I have not yet got the passports for 
them ; and he tells me, that his vessel is in the basin at Havre,, 
consequently must come out at the present full tides, or stay a 
long time; so that, if I have not the passport in the morning, I 
will take the chance of sending it after him. 

It appears that the French army has forced the Prince de 
Cobourg to raise the siege of Maubeuge ; but he has crossed 
the Sambre in good order, and perhaps we may soon hear of 
him again. Be that as it may, the French have experienced 
a complete defeat in Alsace. The lines of the Lauter have 
been forced, and they have lost everything. A great part 
of the army is cut to pieces, and the rest is we know not 
where. 

I have been told that a plot for delivering up Strasbourg has 
been discovered, and that a great majority of the inhabitants 
are concerned in it. Also that serious apprehensions are yet 
entertained for the fate of that city. The advanced period of 
the season is, however, favorable to the party which is on the 
defensive in that quarter. November generally brings foul 
weather there ; so that the assailants must, I think, look out for 
winter quarters instead of pushing into the country. I am, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 377 

TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Paris, November 12th, 1793. 

My Dear Sir, 

M. de Laforest called just now, while I was at the Minis 
ter s, to inform me that he will probably leave Paris tomor 
row morning. I, therefore, write this as an introduction to 
you, and proceed to give a hasty sketch of the form in which 
the business now stands. 

A Commission is named, (the appointments not yet gone 
through the forms,) to consist of four persons. The Minister 
is M. Fauchet, Secretary of the Executive Council, a young 
man of about three and thirty, whom I have not yet seen, but 
he is said to possess genius and information. The Secretary 
of Legation is M. Leblanc, a man of about fifty, and who 
was lately at the head of the Police Department in this city. 
Him also I am, as yet, unacquainted with ; but he is mention 
ed to me as a prudent, sensible man. 

M. de Laforest goes out as Consul General, and M. Petrie, 
his friend and companion, as Consul in the port of Philadel 
phia. These two will undoubtedly draw together, and will 
probably sway the conduct of the Commission ; for the Minis 
ter is to take no important steps without being previously 
authorised by the Board. 

I understand that a kind of etiquette has been established, 
by which the Consuls, as not being properly diplomatic char 
acters, are not received or invited with the Minister, and I 
perceive that there is a strong wish to enjoy the exterior 
respect of office, as well as the solid authority. I cannot 
pretend to judge, nor even to guess how far anything of this 
sort consists with the general rules, which you may have 
found it proper to establish ; but, I think, I can perceive that 
the two Consuls expect to govern the Commission by two 
means ; one, their greater knowledge of our country, laws, 
and inhabitants ; the other, a persuasion to be inculcated on 
the Minister and Secretary, that they enjoy the confidence of 
32* 



378 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 

our government. Perhaps a little vanity may also be for 
something in the business ; but your judgment will well dis 
cern motives, and, therefore, I only give hints. 

I think that M. de Laforest and his friend, being men of 
understanding, will endeavor to keep things in a line of pru 
dence and propriety ; therefore, being uncertain, at present, 
as to the personal characters of the other two, it seems to be 
well that the Board is to be kept steady by the anchors we 
are acquainted with, and as the others unfold themselves, it 
will appear what reliance can be placed on them. 

The Minister, in the conference I had with him just now, 
has again reiterated the assurance, that he and the other mem 
bers of this government have the most sincere desire to be on 
the most cordial terms with us, and I am the more disposed 
to believe in their assurances, because America is the only 
source, from whence supplies of provisions can be drawn to 
feed this city, on which so much depends. The coming 
winter will be, I believe, dreadful, and the spring, should the 
war continue, must open with partial scarcities, if not general 
want. To the sufferings, unavoidable from many other 
causes, no small addition will be made by the laws limiting 
prices, enforced by the iron hand of necessity. I am, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Sainport, November I6th, 1793, 

Dear Sir, 

My last was of the twentieth of October. Captain Culver 
did not, I find, get out of the port of Havre till the first instant. 
He took with him the medal dies. 

The Consul charges me with- a balance of nineteen hundred 
and ninety-three livres, eight deniers, nine sous, telling me, that 
bethinks, by your letters, that you would choose that he should 
draw on you, but that it would be very difficult, and therefore 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 379 

prefers receiving payment from me. I shall accordingly ad 
vance this sum ; and, as I understand from Captain Culver that 
he paid a considerable part of the disbursement for his vessel 
by dollars sold at twelve livres, I suppose that the owners 
of the vessel will charge you for the whole, to wit, five thou 
sand seventy-three livres, eight deniers, nine sous, at that rate 
being one hundred sixty-six dollars and seventy-nine cents. 
Wherefore, I will carry to the debit of the United States 
the sum above mentioned at the same rate, being one hun 
dred sixty-six dollars and eleven cents, so that you will owe 
only two hundred fifty-six dollars and sixty-eight cents to them. 

In my last, I had the honor to inform you, that the rate of 
depreciation had continued nearly about what it was on the 
twelfth of September, viz. two and a half to three for one. But, 
since that time, it has been approaching, at first gradually, and 
now rapidly, to par. When I left Paris, two days ago, gold 
was at about one and a half, and silver at about one and one 
tenth. The reason of this difference will go far to explain the 
phenomenon of a paper money rising in value, while the sum 
emitted goes on increasing. Gold is more easily concealed 
than silver. Whatever is discovered hidden is confiscated, and 
that which is not hidden is taken to the treasury, to be paid in 
Assignats at par hereafter. 

There is, however, another reason ; the war tax on the rich, 
added to the other taxes, disables them from placing their con 
tingent of the forced loan, and therefore they are reduced to 
the necessity of selling what they possess most valuable, and 
the treasury, which can alone purchase with safety, fixes its 
own price. If, therefore, louis d ors should at length be under 
par, I should not be surprised. The sum of precious metals 
and materials in the treasury and mint is already very great ; 
(they say a milliard., or forty millions sterling) ; it is, I sup 
pose, exaggerated, but it is daily increasing. And. at the rate 
things go on, government will have accumulated in the city of 
Paris all the gold and silver, and a great part of the diamonds, 
pearls, &ic. of France. Of course, they will be in a condition 



380 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

to dismiss the Assignats from all farther employment, and to 
begin a new system full handed. 

They seern to think that, in this way, provision will be made 
for two campaigns, and that their enemies, astonished at such 
an immense resource, will be inclined to treat. A previous 
difficulty is, however, to be removed ; that is to say, some one 
person, or some small number of persons, must be named, who 
shall hold the unlimited power of treating and of executing the 
treaty. This will, I suppose, be speedily effected. It will re 
main to be discovered, whether those who are so sanguine, as 
to the dispositions of some, if not all of the Allied Powers, do 
not reckon without their host. 

I must, by the way, drop one word as to the overthrow of 
the Catholic religion. It is now expiring under wounds from 
the true French weapon, ridicule. The people who, five 
years since, fell down in the dirt as the consecrated matter 
passed by, now dance the carmagnole in holy vestments, and 
perform other mummeries, which it might seem profane to 
mention. The late Feast of Reason is a very striking feature 
in the countenance of the revolution. You know the opera 
girl, Saunier, who is, though very beautiful, next door to an 
ideot, as to her intellectual gifts. It is said also that she is 
anything, except \vhat the French call sage. It is she, who 
lately asked the painter, David, to invent for her (to appear in 
the Ballet of Paris) some dress which should be more indecent 
than nakedness. And the painter, it seems, had genius 
enough to comply with her wish. But I speak only from hear 
say, not having been at any of the theatres for nearly two 
years. 

Well, Sir, it so happened that this actress, remarkable for 
fine attitude in dancing, was pitched upon to represent Reason 
in a kind of opera performed at Notre Dame. In the course 
of it, she stood in the place ci-devant most holy, and was 
there adored on bended knees by the President of the Con 
vention, and other principal characters. At this spectacle, the 
devout will unquestionably be scandalized, and it seems, in ef- 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 381 

feet, to be a strong experiment on the national feelings. The 
burning of legs, and arms, and grinders of saints, male and fe 
male, with relics from the wood of the original cross, must 
have the good effect of undeceiving those, who imagined there 
were miraculous qualities inherent in those crumbling materi 
als. But the dismission of all the bishops and curates is a 
matter of more serious import. A national economy of near 
four millions sterling will be thereby effected ; but what de 
gree of ferment may be excited by the disbanding of those 
ecclesiastical regiments, is yet a problem. 

I now proceed to state to you the grounds, on which differ 
ent advocates erect their fabric of probabilities. To begin 
with those who calculate on the success of France. They 
say, that along the northern frontier from the ocean to the Ar 
dennes, the campaign is null. That the enemy must winter in 
his own country, which, not being covered by fortresses or by 
natural defences, must be open to incursion all winter. That 
the army in Alsace, if Landau and Strasbourg be not taken, 
will find it difficult to retreat, and impossible to stay ; so that 
a Burgoynade may ensue. That from the falls of the Rhine 
to the Mediterranean, the untouched frontier is now guarded 
by impassable snows in the gorges of the Alps, leaving the re 
public in quiet possession of Savoy. That Toulon will soon 
be attacked with such vigor that it must fall. That the Pyre- 
nean mountains now render all attempts on the part of Spain 
abortive. And that the flame kindled in the Vendee must be 
speedily extinguished, so that they will be able with undivided 
energy to oppose, nay attack, their enemies next spring, should 
they persist in hostility, and hence is adduced the probability 
of a peace, on such terms as France may dictate. , 

On the other hand, it is said, that Valenciennes ana other ad 
jacent places will cover the heart of Flanders and open that of 
France. That the sluices, especially in winter, form a suffi 
cient defence for the maritime Flanders, and that a great superi 
ority of cavalry will enable the enemy to lay waste Picardy, as 
soon as the French troops shall leave the field and go into winter 



382 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

quarters ; that Landau will be taken and Strasbourg surrender 
ed, as it has neither garrison nor magazines ; in which case Al 
sace is irrecoverably lost, and the enemy, who can occupy the 
passes of the Vosges, will have an easy task to enter Cham 
paign next spring ; that in the mountains of Franche Comte a 
second Vendee is preparing, and waits only the favorable 
moment to break out; that the Lyonese are impatient under 
the yoke, to which they have been compelled to submit, and 
will, of course, take arms whenever an opportunity offers ; that 
Toulon cannot be taken by a coup de main, and the same 
causes, which render the Alps and Pyrenees secure for the 
French, give like security to Spain, and Sardinia, wherefore 
their troops can go to Toulon ; that a numerous French army 
cannot long be subsisted there, in as much as the great city of 
Marseilles was formerly supplied from the coast ofBarbary; 
and thence it is inferred, that, the attempt on Toulon failing, 
Provence must fall, because the French troops must retire to 
a more plentiful country, so the durance will cover the pos 
session of the enemy, and enable him to turn his attention to 
wards Cevennes, in which there exists great discontent and strong 
dispositions for revolt; that should the Franc Comtois engage 
heartily in the royal cause, the Swiss may be brought into the 
league, and, pressing towards Lyons as soon as the campaign 
opens, oblige the French to retire from Savoy, and perhaps to 
abandon all to the eastward of the Rhone ; but at any rate, to 
hold a precarious possession of it until the troops, which win 
ter in Piedmont, can advance into Dauphine. I believe that, 
on almost any hypothesis, it must be admitted that the Dau- 
phinois can dispose of their own country. 

It is contended further, that the insurgents in the Cevennes 
and Auvergne could easily overrun the country along the Gar 
onne and as far as Bordeaux, because the people are alrea 
dy indisposed, and only kept under by the fear of instant 
death. 

On the Vendee much is said. Fire and sword have been 
carried through that unhappy country ; of course, the proselytes 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 383 

made will return to their original sentiments, as soon as the 
incumbent terror is removed. It is here that the strong prin 
ciple of religious fanaticism is to be calculated on. The fu 
ture conduct cannot be defined, or even conjectured, on the 
ground of reason merely human. The firm persuasion, that 
death in the cause of God gives immediate possession of an 
endless beatitude, is capable of converting timidity into hero 
ism. Already the effects have been wonderful, and we ob 
serve that very few of the men, who have been sent to subdue 
the Vendee, have ever returned. 

A large party, which, at the lowest estimation, is not less 
than 15,000, have crossed the Loire, and marched into Lower 
Normandy and Brittany. That in this quarter they will find 
many congenial spirits is considered as certain, and also that 
their measures are combined with the British cabinet. At a 
distance from their home, nothing remains for them but victory 
or death. It is in this quarter, that the destruction of the 
Catholic religion is supposed to be most obnoxious. The 
clergy being driven to despair,. it is supposed that such of them 
as possess personal courage will march in the ranks. The 
insurgents are commanded by able men ; and the troop is com 
posed of the remnant of many battles. Hence it is concluded, 
that no opposition made to them by the raw levies from Nor 
mandy and Brittany can have any effect, and, of course, that 
the troops in the Vendee must go in pursuit of them. It is 
averred that in such case, the Vendee would rise, like a 
Phoenix from its ashes, more formidable than ever. That there 
is a corps of 12,000 men still remaining on the island of Noir- 
moutier and that neighborhood, which will come forward im 
mediately and recover all that has been lost and more. 

Lastly, it is said, that however splendid may be the financial 
arrangements, it will be impossible to hold out, unless the peo 
ple can be taught to eat silver and gold, for that famine already 
partially felt must become general. This assertion is exagge 
rated, but I think much distress will be experienced on that 
account. 



384 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

Having thus given you the pros and cons, I leave you to 
make up your judgment. For my own part, I have observed 
that mankind are generally deceived both by their hopes and 
by their fears; and I persist in believing, that the fate of so 
great a country as this must ever depend much more upon 
interior sentiment, than on exterior operations. As to the 
operations of the insurgents, who are supposed to have in view 
either the town of St Malo, or an irruption into Normandy, or 
a march to Paris, I consider the last as the easiest and safest 
operation ; among other reasons, because it appears most diffi 
cult and hazardous. But I do not believe it will be attempted. 

The second, which would look like a serious combination to 
terminate the war, by re-establishing the monarchy, seems to 
me somewhat beyond the degree of talents, which has hitherto 
directed the Allies ; and, on the whole, I conclude that Britain, 
looking with an eye of cupidity at the port of Brest, wishes to 
get possession of St Malo, and extend a defensive line along 
the Ranee and Vilaine rivers, so as to include Lower Brittany, 
and try what can be done by force and persuasion towards the 
possession of that country. Whether this be the plan is one 
question. Whether it will succeed is another. Time will, 
discover the answer to one, and, perhaps, to both. I am, &LC.

TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Paris, November 26th, 1793, 

Dear Sir, 

In mine of the sixteenth, I omitted to mention the fall of 
the Brissotin party and of the Duke of Orleans ; but it was a 
thing so much of course, that you had, doubtless, anticipat 
ed it. 

I mentioned to you that silver was nearly at par. In 
effect, it is now under par. Crowns, I am told, sell at two 
per cent discount, and bullion, I know, is at fifty two livres 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 385 

per marc, and the price for many years preceding the revo 
lution was fifty-four, as I am told. For some days past there 
has been no foreign exchange. There are no buyers, be 
cause the person, who takes a bill, is considered as suspect 
ed, and persons suspected are put in prison, and persons in 
prison are so numerous, that none can get out, because, in the 
multitude of applications, there is no time to examine any 
particular complaint. 

You will form some more accurate idea of this situation, 
when I tell you that a young American by the name of Grif 
fith, having lost at Havre my certificate that he was an 
American citizen, was taken up. I declined interfering for 
him at first, because I suspected that the certificate had been 
made use of for some sinister purpose ; but, when all matters 
were cleared up to my satisfaction, I applied to the Minister, 
and he to the Committee of Safety. I have repeated my ap 
plications for a month past, and, he has repeated his, and as 
yet nothing satisfactory is done, although I have no doubt of 
the disposition of government to give us satisfaction. 

They deliberate at present on the means of bringing their 
system a little more into form, and the Minister tells me that, 
as soon as that is effected, I shall have less frequent reason to 
complain, and more speedy and effectual redress. I hope 
this may be the case, for at present it is terrible. 

We have, as Mr Fenwick informs me, ninety-two sail of 
vessels at Bordeaux. I have formerly mentioned to you the 
embargo laid in that port. It has, at length, produced the 
greatest distress. The crews have consumed their provisions. 
The merchants will be saddled with heavy loss and cost. I 
have made reiterated applications ; but the situation of that 
city has prevented the Comite de Salut Public from a direct 
interference. The Commissaires have persisted in their 
measure of shutting the port. They promise Mr Fenwick 
redress from day to day. The Minister cannot promise 
redress to me, but he promises to try for it, and I believe he 
does try ; but I am sure that it is as yet without effect. 
VOL. ii. 33 



386 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

In my last conference on the subject, two days ago, after 
having advanced the various reasons arising from the justice 
of the demand, and after stating to him the very great hard 
ship of the case, I hinted the extreme bad policy which 
would deter any American vessel from coming to France, 
unless reparation were made. I know not, as yet, the effect ; 
but I am sure that all commerce between this country and 
America must soon terminate, unless a more regular and 
orderly system shall soon take place. I expect that all the 
ports of America will be filled with complaints. And, from 
what Mr Fenwick writes, I suppose the public servants will 
be criminated, because France is without a regular govern 
ment. This, to be sure, is not very just, but it is very nat 
ural. A choleric man beats the post, which he has struck his 
head against. I am, &c.

TO M. DEFORGUES. 

Translation. 

Paris, December 9th, 1793. 
Sir, 

I had the honor of receiving your letters of the 7th, 14th and 
17th instants. I thank you for your attention in expediting the 
exequatur of the Sieur de la Motte, and in obtaining the liber 
ation of the American citizen, Mountflorence. Citizen Griffith 
is still detained. 

I receive, every day, letters which present to me the sad 
picture of what the commerce of the United States suffers at 
Bordeaux. Our vessels came on the faith of treaties. 
Some carried provisions there, others went to take as freight, 
cargoes for the French Colonies, or foreign ports. Many 
were to return loaded with corn, flour, salt provisions, and 
other eatables. All are detained there. 

I will not repeat to you, Sir, the various observations, which 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 387 

I have had the honor to make to you at different times on 
this subject, for the principles of justice are so evident, that it 
is useless to speak of them. I will only mention, therefore, a 
motive of a different kind, but yet deserving attention. The 
advantage, not to say the necessity, of obtaining supplies of 
provisions for France, from foreign sources, is readily acknowl 
edged. Everything then which opposes this, is prejudicial to 
the most important interests of the Republic. Now, how can 
you persuade neutral vessels to enter French ports, when it 
will be obvious to them that they incur the risk of being 
detained there ? I should ill fulfil my duty, as the representa 
tive of a friendly and allied nation, did I not point out to you 
the danger to which the provisioning of France, and especially 
the capital, is exposed. 

It is true, interest is the moving spring of commercial opera 
tions, but the American owners, who have made voyages for 
France, in preference to the other countries of Europe, have 
also followed the impulse of feeling, which always influences 
the judgment, and consequently the calculations. Those of 
your friends, then, who are most attached to you. are the suf 
ferers from this detention. I leave it to your good sense, Sir, 
to infer the consequences, and flatter myself that a just indem 
nification for this detention, and speedy permission to depart, 
will soon efface the unpleasant impression of the losses, which 
they have sustained, and that a hundred vessels, which are in 
the port of Bordeaux, will return loaded with flour, in three 
or four months, and thwart the designs of those who wish to 
starve the city of Paris. I have the honor to be, &tc. 

GOUVEJINEUR MORRIS. 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Paris, December 12th, 1793. 

Dear Sir, 

I transmit to you enclosed a letter received open from Mr 
Cathalan, who has been disappointed in giving the needful 



388 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 

surety for the due execution of his office, by the delay of his let 
ters during the seige of Lyons, and other circumstances result 
ing from local situation. It seems probable that my corres 
pondence with him may be soon cut off, for if the French ar 
my does not speedily get possession of Toulon, I. think they 
will be obliged to abandon the enterprise, from the difficulty 
of obtaining subsistence. In that case Marseilles will fall of 
course, as well as the county of Nice, which has already cost 
much blood and treasure. 

The insurgents of Vendee, who had broken into Lower Nor 
mandy, seem to have divided themselves into various bands, 
and to have been attended with a varied success ; but, on the 
whole, the theatre of their operation is considerably extended, 
and we may hourly expect- to hear that they have received 
considerable reinforcements by sea. I persist in believing that 
to be the tender part of the French Republic, for many things 
concur to show, that a very large portion of the people are 
disposed to a counter revolution ; but they dare not stir until 
a sufficient force shall appear ; for they are without arms, or 
union, or any means of understanding each other, while the 
examples are so striking and terrifying, that every individual, 
whatever may be his political tenets, trembles at the exercise 
of that authority which, whether willingly or unwillingly is a 
matter of indifference, he contributes to support. 

Since my last, the new organization, or rather regulation, of 
the government system has taken place ; but, to my poor con 
ception, it appears as inefficient and as discordant as ever. If 
I am not mistaken, it must soon undergo farther changes. 

I enclose also herein a copy of my letter of the ninth to the 
Minister, by which you will observe that I endeavor to obtain, 
by a sense of their own interest, the release of our ships from 
the harbor of Bordeaux, since the sense of justice has not yet 
produced the effect. To reason at a distance, and in generals, 
it would seem almost impossible that this outrageous grievance 
should be continued ; but yet I do not dare to flatter myself 
with the removal of it. The Representatives of the people 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 389 

sent into the departments are vested with unlimited power. In 
the exercise of it they suspend decrees of the Convention, fine, 
imprison, in short, do everything, which to them appears need 
ful for the public safety. They assign their reasons after 
wards, if called on by the Convention for that purpose. But 
it seems to be understood, that their acts must not be reversed 
until after their return, unless they should indeed be charged 
as contre-revolutionaires, and then everything is overturned. 

I need not dwell on such a state of things, for you will 
readily draw all the perplexing and vexatious consequences. 
Happy they, who contemplate them at a distance. A view of 
what our countrymen suffer in this respect so torments me, 
that it is very difficult to be patient. I am, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO M. DEFORGTTES. 

Translation. 

Paris, December 29th, 1793. 

Sir, 

A letter, which 1 have just received from the citizen Grif 
fith, informs me that he has been two months in prison, with 
out any charge whatever being exhibited against him. It i 
a long time since I solicited the liberty of this citizen, with the 
persuasion of his innocence, but his long detention induces 
me to apprehend that I may have been mistaken. I pray 
you, Sir, to favor me with the cause of his detention, that I 
may render an account of the same to the United States. 

Daily complaints are addressed to me from Bordeaux, 
where the embargo is still in full force. Some exceptions in 
favor of those vessels, said to be loaded on account of that re 
public, have produced the effect, which might have been ex 
pected. Some, from a principle of respect for the govern 
ment, suppose that these are individual speculations made on 
33* 



390 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

the general misfortune, in the hope that the markets of the 
United States, unfurnished in consequence of the embargo, 
will offer an early and advantageous sale for the cargoes, 
which have lately been despatched to them. Others insist 
that the speculations in question are on the account of gov 
ernment, and you may easily conceive the sensations which 
this idea produces. 

However it be, it seems to me necessary on every possible 
account to remedy the evil as soon as possible. I demand 
justice for my countrymen from the French Republic, not 
only from a sense of duty to the United States, but also from 
regard to France. Be assured, Sir, that your enemies could 
not mark out for you a course of conduct more to your disad 
vantage, than that which I have just laid before you. 

I have the honor to subjoin to this letter, the copy of a pe 
tition sent to me by the American citizen, John Gray. He 
informs me that on his arrival, on the loth of December, a 
guard was placed on board his brig, and that a member of the 
Committee at Subsistence told him, that he would be personally 
responsible, if any portion of the rice were discharged, even 
to nourish his own countrymen. He offered the cargo to this 
Committee, which referred him to the Committee appointed to 
purchase goods arriving in neutral vessels. This latter com 
mittee told him that they were not provided with the powers re 
quisite to grant to any person whatever the conditions set forth 
in his petitions, and that he must apply to the representatives 
of the people in this city. These are too much occupied to 
pay the least attention to his business. He therefore says to 
me, as I can sell my cargo neither to the nation, nor to individ 
uals, as I am forbidden to distribute it among my countrymen, 
who are in a state of extreme suffering, let me at least be per 
mitted to depart, and seek commerce and liberty elsewhere. 

You will observe, Sir, in the petition of citizen Gray, that he 
was informed, during his passage, of the state of things at 
Bordeaux, and that he decided to continue his route, only in 
the opinion that the news he received was merely a calumny 
invented by the enemies of France. I have no doubt that this 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 391 

intelligence is now spread abroad in America. Judge then 
whether it be not of moment to efface as soon as possible the 
impression it may make. I have the honor to be, &tc.

ney General of the United States, is appointed by the Presi 
dent, and approved by the Senate, as Secretary of State. He

letters not yet acknowledged by me, and will answer in detail 
such parts of them as may require special answer. I beg 
leave to conclude this last of public correspondence with you, 
with very sincere assurances of the great esteem and respect, 
with which I have the honor to be, dear Sir, your most obedi

THOMAS JEFFERSON. 



EDMUND RANDOLPH TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

Philadelphia, January 10th, 1794. 

Sir, 

I do myself the honor of enclosing to you a letter from Mr 
Jefferson, announcing my succession to him, as Secretary of 
State. His resignation, which took place on the 31st ultimo, 
was accompanied with a general regret, founded on his ac 
knowledged qualities for that department, and the important 
services rendered by his labors. 

The only letter, which I find, Sir, from you unanswered, is 
that of June 25tb, 1793. It is thought advisable by the 



392 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

President to defer all animadversions upon the decree, to 
which it relates, and indeed upon any of the affairs of France, 
until the temper of that country towards the United States 
shall be disclosed by your communications, subsequent to the 
receipt of Mr Jefferson s letter to you, of the 16th of August, 
1793. 

The journals and pamphlets, now sent, will inform you of 
the progress made by Congress on the very interesting sub 
jects, which have hitherto occupied them. 

Suffer me to tender to you, on this first occasion of our 
correspondence, the great and sincere respect, with which I 
have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient servant, 

EDMUND RANDOLPH. 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Paris, January 21st, 1794. 
Dear Sir, 

I do myself the honor to transmit herewith duplicates of 
mine, of the sixteenth and twenty-sixth of November and 
twelfth of December. I also enclose copies of my letters 
of the twenty-ninth of December to the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs and of his answer ; of mine of the fourth of Janua 
ry, introducing the deputation sent up from Bordeaux, and 
of his of the twenty-sixth of Nivose in reply to it. 

The young man, Mr Griffith, whom I mentioned in mine 
of the twenty-sixth of November, is at length out of prison ; 
but another, of the name of Hoskins, still remains in confine 
ment, and this merely because the multiplicity of business be 
fore the Committee prevents them from attending to anything. 

I learn that the number of persons arrested in this city 
amounts to fifteen thousand, and that through the Republic is 
more than tenfold more numerous. The petitions before 
them could not be read through in less than a year, supposing 
ten hours a day appropriated to that purpose ; and, as the 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 393 

arrestations are daily continued, those who are confined are in 
a sad and hopeless condition. 

The wiser part of those, who are at the head of affairs, are 
sensible that such severe measures must prove injurious, and 
perhaps fatal ; but they dare not appear as the advocates for 
the unfortunate, lest they should partake of their situation. 
Late experiments justify their apprehensions, and, if I may 
judge, the outs, who wish to be ins, will use this as a lever to 
overturn the power of their opponents ; so that the general 
gaol delivery, if effected, will come from those who inveigh 
against, not from those who propose it. The reason is clear. 
To advocate such a measure exposes to the charge of Moder- 
atisme ; and you will observe here, that as Brissotisme suc 
ceeded to Fayettisme, which has succeeded to Aristocratic, so 
Moderatisme is now heir to all the odium of Brissotisme. 
Robespierre has luckily hit on the term Ultra-revolution- 
aire, and brought it with good success into the field against 
the term Contre-revolutionaire ; but it seems likely that 
Moderatisme, will prove too hard for Ultra-revolutionaire. 

I cut short these observations, to give you a sketch of the 
state of parties. Previous to which, however, lest I should 
forget it, I must mention, that Thomas Paine is in prison, 
where he amuses himself with publishing a pamphlet against 
Jesus Christ. I do not recollect whether I mentioned to 
you, that he would have been executed along with the rest of 
the Brissotines, if the adverse party had not viewed him with 
contempt. I incline to think that, if he is quiet in prison, he 
may have the good luck to be forgotten. Whereas, should 
he be brought much into notice, the long suspended axe 
might fall on him. I believe he thinks, that I ought to claim 
him as an American citizen ; but, considering his birth, his 
naturalization in this country, and the place he filled, I doubt 
much the right, and I am sure that the claim would be, for 
the present at least, inexpedient and ineffectual. 

There seems to be at present three parties among the doers 
of the day ; for I except those, who are entirely indisposed to 



394 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

the government. The one may be called the Dantonists, 
with whom Robespierre is connected, and who wish, by 
mildness and something like a government of laws, to inspire 
a sort of attachment to the revolution, apprehending that the 
people, so often disappointed in the expectations held out to 
them, may at length, by a kind of general effort, arising not 
from any particular plot or conspiracy, but from the universal 
sense of oppression, overturn the whole affair, which, what 
ever may be its future and national effect, must necessarily 
occasion their immediate and personal ruin. 

The second may be called the Parisian party, being those 
who wish by a new blow from the populace of this city to make 
a second edition of the piece acted on the 31st of May last, 
and thereby put themselves in the places of such as may be 
then sent to the guillotine. 

The third may be called the Ministerial party, and although 
the Ministers are, at present, no more than a kind of clerks, 
subject to the imperative, and too often the imperious, mandates 
of a Committee, yet as they are supported privately by those 
who wish to bring forward the Constitution, and as they have 
the natural advantage of men doing business with Committees, 
to see how much is sacrificed, and how much neglected, and 
thence show the great abuses inseparable from that sort of 
government, they have more weight and consistency, than 
would, at first sight, be imagined. As the present actors have 
more energy, as well as more experience, than those who 
suffered themselves to be elbowed off the stage on the 31st of 
May, I presume that things will be brought much sooner to a 
crisis. 

There is at present a plot in petto, which may, perhaps, 
blow up the Dantonists. I have heard different versions of it, 
and, therefore, will not give you any of them, because it is well 
known that matters of that kind undergo many changes before 
they are exhibited, and, besides, the whole affair may die 
away ; especially if any general danger should oblige the par 
ties to be friends for a month or two longer. Let parties rise 



THE TRENCH REVOLUTION. 395 

or fall as they may, I do not think the present form of govern 
ment by Committees can long stand. We have seen such a 
system fall by its own weight, when exercised on a much 
smaller scale, and any one who has anything to do with Com 
mittees here complains, which is the first step towards their 
ruin. 

The successes of the Republic will give pleasure to all those 
who are attached to France ; for whatever may be the opinions 
as to a government, which may undergo yet a dozen changes, 
it seems to be demonstrable from facts, that the plan of 
dismemberment, which I long since communicated, really 
exists, and it is that plan which has foiled the Allies. Admit 
ting what has been asserted by persons in a situation to know 
the truth, and deeply interested to prove the contrary of their 
assertion, that nine tenths of the nation are inimical to the 
government, it is an undoubted truth that ninety-nine hun- 
dredths are opposed to all ideas of a dismemberment, and will 
fight to prevent it. Hence it happens, that so few have joined 
the enemy on any part of the frontiers, except the inhabitants 
of Alsace, who have been, in their hearts, Germans; and hence 
also it happens, that the Vendee has been so vigorous in its 
operation, as in that quarter they fought simply to restore the 
ancient government and religion. If the allies had given them 
aid, God knows what would have been the consequence; but 
as the clear object, when aid was at length offered, consisted 
only in possessing themselves of strong holds for their own use, 
the whole plan has fallen through, and a great number of those 
poor people have been sacrificed. Exaggerated accounts state 
the destruction of the human race in that quarter at near a 
million of souls. It certainly has been very great, though not, 
perhaps, more than half that number. I am much mistaken if 
the spirit of revolt be quelled, although, for want of opportunity, 
it may not again perhaps break out. 

Toulon was evacuated rather than taken. Perhaps, if the 
evacuation had not been decided on, it would have been kept; 
but certainly the brisk attacks of the French precipitated very 



396 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

much the measures of the enemies. In my opinion, it was a 
great blunder not to throw succors into that place ; for, if it 
had been held a little longer, the French army must have re 
treated, from the want of subsistence. 

In like manner, it is now evident that if Bordeaux, Mar 
seilles, Lyons, and Toulon, had all declared at the same time, 
instead of showing their evil dispositions one after the other, 
the whole southern part of France was irrecoverably lost to the 
Republic. And if the good faith of the enemy had not been 
suspected, this union of measures would have taken place. I 
learn, in like manner, that Strasbourg would have been deliver 
ed up, if the Emperor had not desired to take it in his own 
name, instead of that of Louis the Seventeenth. The Allies, 
not being able to possess themselves of this place, (in which 
the plan of surrendering was discovered, and its effects pre 
vented,) and failing at the same time in their blockade of 
Landau, which held out longer than they had calculated, were 
obliged to retire into winter quarters, and as this could not be 
unknown to the enemy, of course, they were attacked on all 
sides, and by a vast superiority of numbers. At first, the 
French were repulsed everywhere ; but the repetition of at 
tacks, (for there were in the whole between thirty and forty), 
wearied the defendants, who, by no resource of the military 
art, could bear up against the bodily fatigue of constant fight 
ing. The physical constitution of the French is more adapt 
ed to this service, than perhaps any other on earth. T &gt; re 
treat became necessary, and a retreat once begun, was con 
tinued from necessity, because the French kept pouring in 
fresh supplies of men when opposed, and continued their rapid 
advance wherever they were victorious. Mayence and Fort 
Louis could alone stop their pursuit. 

They are now taking off everything in .the country, which 
they have possessed themselves of, and in so doing, they form 
a barrier against themselves ; but what is to them of more impor 
tance is, that they form also a barrier against their enemies. 
On the north, it seems to be determined not to give the Allies 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 397 

any rest, and the calculation is simple. The soldiers brought 
from a distance cannot easily be replaced, and by constant 
fighting they may be destroyed, for their country being open, 
they have nothing to defend them but posts, which, however 
strong, may be carried by superior numbers. It is true that 
every one of the Germans so destroyed, may cost a dozen 
Frenchmen ; but, it is said that the dozen can be replaced 
more easily than the one. Mutual plunderings form a part of 
this warfare. Judge, then, how it must thin the ranks of man 
kind. 1 believe that nothing like it has appeared in Europe 
since the crusades. 

The resources of this country, its real resources I mean, are 
wearing away very fast, and if it be true, as it is said, that the 
population is already diminished one tenth within the last two 
years, it will have, at least, this one good effect, that the con 
sumption of provisions must diminish in the same proportion. 
The fear of famine seems to be general ; and although I flatter 
myself that its greatest ravages may be avoided, yet I do not 
readily see how the resistance of the next campaign is to be 
effected, if the whole force engaged against France should 
continue its operation. 

I am premised daily, that the embargo laid on our ships in 
the port of Bordeaux shall be taken off, and an indemnification 
be granted for the losses which it has occasioned. I have 
never been able to learn why it was laid ; but have some rea 
son to believe, that just ground of suspicion had been given as 
to the voyages, the cargoes, and even the property of some of 
the vessels then in that port. The deputation now here is pur 
suing the affair before the Committees, and will, I trust, be suc 
cessful, as it had already been resolved on to give adequate 
redress, and I presume that they will not impair the favorable 
intentions which existed previous to their arrival. 

The ratio between paper and the precious metals remains 
about the same as it was when I last quoted it. Foreign ex 
changes have received a sad stroke. Monsieur Cambon had 
declared last June, that by the first of January the exchange 
VOL. ii. 34 



398 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

should be at par. As the measures of policy, on which his 
prediction was founded, had not met with all the success de 
sired, it became necessary to supply the deficiency by force. 

You will learn with some surprise, perhaps, that all the 
funds belonging to French citizens in foreign countries have 
been put in requisition. Every man is called on to declare 
not only his own property abroad, but also that of others, 
which may have come to his knowledge ; the whole under 
the usual penalty of the guillotine. Such sums as are thus dis- 
coverexl are to be paid for at par, and every one is prohibited 
from purchasing bills on any pretext whatever. If this mea 
sure furnishes the expected resource, which I doubt, it cuts 
off all future hope. And if it does not furnish a very great re 
source, there will exist in the national affairs a deficit of seri 
ous magnitude, for they must face the demand abroad, or re 
nounce the hope of supplies from thence, and on the expecta 
tion of such supplies depends the hope of avoiding in this city 
the evils of want, if not of absolute famine. 

It is a long time since I had the honor to mention to you 
Mr Francis Coffyn, acting at Dunkirk as Consul of the United 
States. This worthy man s interference in the affair of the 
Little Cherub (which, by the bye, remains yet undecided) has, 
through the intrigues of those concerned in the privateer, been 
the occasion of putting him in prison as a suspected person. 
The ground of which suspicion is. the having corresponded with 
Calorine, while Minister on the affairs of the town of Dunkirk, 
which had, it seems, some demand on the court. I have, in 
his absence, desired his son to attend to the affairs formerly in 
the hands of his father, and as he is a man of business, and by 
no means deficient in understanding, I trust that he will be 
able to conduct them well. 

I cannot, however, avoid repeating my wish, that Consuls, 
and Vice Consuls were appointed everywhere, for there is 
great need of them. It would have been happy had some one 
been named in this city as Consul, or by any other name or 
title, who might have followed up the Committees, waited day 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 399 

after day in their ante-chamber and the like, so as to plague 
them into decisions. The Ministers, as I have already men 
tioned, stand in such a situation that they dare not push the 
Committees very hard. You will easily see, that I cannot quit 
the regular line of application through the channel the govern 
ment has thought proper to institute for the purpose. And, 
indeed, besides the impropriety of putting off the character of 
Minister to put on that of intriguant, or at best of a solicitor, I 
know that it would be a useless, as well as pernicious sacri 
fice of the national dignity. 

I have been requested by some to r&gt;ame a person for that 
purpose ; but I have many objections to that measure, among 
which it is no small one that I have not the right to do it ; and, 
moreover, the state of things has long been, and still continues 
to be so critical, that every man, having even the shadow of a 
public character, is liable to the danger of compromising him 
self every instant. Hitherto, therefore, [ have left every one 
to choose his own agent for the conduct of his business, be 
cause the blame, which must inevitably fall, will then lie on 
the individual. I say that blame must fall, because those at a 
distance, judging only from appearances and from professions, 
form golden expectations, and imagine that nothing more is 
necessary, in order to realize them, than to bring forward 
something in the shape of an American. Facts are very dif 
ferent from such appearances. 

T suppose that the new Minister has, or shortly will have ar 
rived at Philadelphia. I did not see him, for just as he went 
away, I was forced by one of the Committees into a dispute, 
which put them all out of humour, although they were soon 
sensible they were wrong. It is not worth while to go into 
the history of it, because the affair is blown over, and because 
the conduct of men in the midst of a revolution is not to be 
judged so severely as under a regular government. 

It is a long time since I learnt the attack of the Algerines, 
but as I knew that advices had been sent off to you, I did not

mention it, not having then an immediate opportunity. I shall 
have occasion to say something on the subject shortly. I 
am, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Paris, February 5th, 1794. 

My Dear Sir, 

In a newspaper of this day I find the translation of your 
message of the fifth of December to Congress, and observe, 
that after stating the violation of the treaty by a decree of the 
National Convention, you tell them I have been instructed to 
make representations on the subject. 

Now this, my dear Sir, is the first I hear, and all I know 
of such instructions. Indeed I have received no letters, news 
papers, or other intelligence from America, since those which 
Captain Culver brought. I suppose this arises from the diffi 
culty of communication ; but whatever be the cause, I feel 
the effect. It would be of some use if a clerk in the office of 
Foreign Affairs had by triplicates mentioned from time to 
time which of my letters were received. Thus on the pres 
ent occasion, I should know whether my correspondence with 
the Minister on the subject of this obnoxious decree was be 
fore you. 

As it is, not being able to determine the nature of the rep 
resentations, which you have desired me to make, I am 
obliged to be silent. And unless more than one copy has 
been sent, I may never receive your orders, and at any rate it 
will be at no early day. I am sure it is superfluous to tell 
you, how painful it is for a person in my situation to be totally 
ignorant of what passes in his own country, and whether the 
conduct which, under circumstances continually changing, he 
finds it necessary to pursue, does, or does not consist with the 
views of government. Blaming a wrong step would prevent 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 401 

a repetition of it ; but really at present I walk in the dark, or 
at best by the feeble light of my own conjectures. 

I know not whether my brethren have the same dearth of 
intelligence. Mr Short complained of it much when I last 
saw him, and has since mentioned the same thing from Ma 
drid, so that I conclude the evil to arise from the negligence 
of those to whom letters are entrusted. Might it not be ad 
visable to send every month a small packet to Europe ? 
They might come alternately to Havre and Lisbon, and that 
which arrives at Lisbon come on thence to Havre, that which 
arrives at Havre go from thence to Lisbon. In this way a 
regular correspondence would be kept up, and by seizing for in- 
important communications the private conveyances which offer, 
full intelligence would be given and received. Six packets 
would be amply sufficient for the service, and if, as I believe, 
small schooners could be safely employed, the prime cost 
would not be above three thousand pounds sterling, and the an 
nual expense, I should suppose, not more than half of that sum. 

I beg your pardon, my dear Sir, for troubling you with this 
groaning epistle. I will not say one word of news, as in sup- 
poseable circumstances it might prevent this letter from reach 
ing you. I adhere to the opinions expressed in my last. 
Adieu.

Thomas Paine has just made application to me, to claim

chosen a member of the Convention. His conduct from that 
time has not come under my cognizance. I am ignorant of 
the cause of his present detention in the prisons of Luxem 
bourg ; but I pray you, Sir, if any reasons with which I am 
unacquainted oppose his liberation, to have the goodness to 
inform me of them, that I may communicate them to the gov 
ernment of the United States. I have the honor to be, &c.

TO JAMES DONATUS LERAY. 

Instructions. 

Paris, February 22d, 1794. 

Sir, 

The government of this country having resolved, in execu 
tion of the eighth article of the treaty of amity and commerce, 
concluded between the United States of America, and his 
most Christian Majesty, on the sixth day of February, 1778, 
to employ their good offices with the Regency of Algiers, to 
bring about a treaty of peace, have desired me to nominate 
and appoint some person on the part of the United States, to 
be present and assist at the negotiations to be had and 
made for that purpose ; and, you having consented to under 
take that office, I have by a commission of this day authoris 
ed you to negotiate and conclude such treaty on the part of 
the United States of America. It becomes necessary, there 
fore, to explain to you my situation, and thence, as well as 
from the circumstances of the moment, to deduce rules for 
your government. 

And, first, you are to know that my appointment of you is a 
mere assumption of power on my part, no such authority be 
ing given to me as that which is implied in your commission. 
I act on this occasion upon the principle, that where great 
public interests are concerned, and when, from .the nature of 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 403 

the case, it is impossible that the will of the government can 
be seasonably expressed, the confidential servants of the pub 
lic are in duty bound to imply that will. But your good sense 
will show you, that by reason hereof, a more critical degree of 
responsibility is incurred. And hence results two rules for 
your guidance. 

1. Avoid as much as possible all interference, leaving the 
business to the agents of this government, and only advising 
with them, so as to secure to the utmost the interests of the 
United States, in the treaty which they may be able to con 
clude. 

2. In any such treaty, whether you do, or do not, appear 
as a Commissioner, take care that it be limited to a short peri 
od, (such, for instance, as one year,) unless approved by the 
United States. Such approbation to be expressed by the 
President of the said States, agreeably to the Constitution 
thereof. 

I give you herewith a copy of the treaty concluded between 
the United States and the Emperor of Morocco, which will 
serve as a model or groundwork for you to go by. I expect 
that the Regency of Algiers will be exorbitant in their demands 
of money, as heretofore they have been ; and I presume that 
some unfriendly European powers (I might say unchristian 
powers) may endeavor to counteract you ; the rather, as I am 
informed, that a British Consul in that quarter has declared 
that America will never obtain a treaty with Algiers, but 
through the medium of his government. It is proper, there 
fore, that the business be conducted with the utmost secrecy, 
and that you appear, what by birth you are, a Frenchman, at 
least until some good purpose can be answered by the exhibi 
tion of your true character and country. It will be useful to 
inculcate on your companions the same secrecy, which I have 
just requested you to preserve. 

The method by which, as far as I can learn, a treaty has 
hitherto been avoided, and which may perhaps be still pursued 
is, by demanding of the United States a sum of money out of 



404 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 

all proportion to the object. And as far as it has come to my 
knowledge, the disposition of America is divided between the 
obtaining such treaty by purchase or by force. We have 
heard, I know not with what truth, that the United States are 
fitting out thirty frigates. Be it as it may, the report can be 
turned to account on the present occasion. It may be insinu 
ated to the Dey and his Ministers, that the United States will 
send a fleet into the Mediterranean manned with the best sea 
men in the world, (for such the seamen, natives of America, 
unquestionably are,) with orders to cruise continually and in 
tercept all vessels whatever going to or coming from the port 
of Algiers. That with this fleet are to be connected some 
light armed schooners, and a body of riflemen hunters, whose 
skill, whose activity, and whose courage are unequalled ; that 
this armament will be directed to rendezvous in the port of 
Malta, in order to commence their operations. 

It will be proper to state the greatest amount of all their 
captures from the United States, since the year 1783 to the 
present hour, and, without making any deductions therefrom 
for the expense of the armaments against our commerce, (and 
which would probably exceed the value of the prizes,) divide 
the same by ten for the number of years. t It will then appear 
of how little value is the object, even could it be longer pur- 
*sued without risk or inconvenience. It will appear that, if the 
whole amount had gone into the Dey s coffers, he would not 
be much benefitted thereby, and he should be made- to ob 
serve, that if the Americans pursue their plan, and obtain, as 
they may, subsidies from the Italian States and others, their 
armaments will cost them nothing, and he will lose the sum he 
now receives for preserving peace with those States. 

The United States have less shipping than is needful to 
carry their produce, and the latter increases faster than the 
former ; so that they can easily forego the commerce of the 
Mediterranean, seeing that they would then be unable to get 
back, of course they could take nothing from us, and would 
lose much by engaging with us. 






THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 405 

From what I have just said, you will see that it is my object 
to obtain a peace with the smallest possible sacrifice of money, 
for nothing, if you can. But whether a treaty be, or be not, 
made, it will be proper to get back the unfortunate men who 
are captives in that country. If a peace be obtained, their re 
lease should be one article of it. If not, you must contrive to 
get them away for as little money as possible. And it would 
be well to obtain such passports as may carry them home, lest 
they should be intercepted in their return. 

Before I conclude, it is proper to mention the expense to 
be incurred on this occasion ; and this I divide into two parts, 
national and personal. This government will make due pro 
vision for the former, and it must be your object to confine it 
within narrow bounds. It is true that neither you nor I can 
incur any responsibility in relation to that object, beause I have 
fully expressed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs my total 
want of authority ; and, consequently, their acts*are purely their 
own ; but, still, as the United States will be under a kind of 
honorary obligation to discharge the debt, which may thus be 
incurred, it is our duty to render it as light as possible. 

As to your personal expense, I will pay it, and I pray you to 
be as economical as circumstances will permit; for I must 
again repeat to you, that, having no authority to act, if my 
conduct should be disapproved, it is but just that the cost be 
defrayed by me. 

And now, Sir, I commit you to your own understanding and 
discretion, of which you have a plentiful share, and to the 
protection of God. If you succeed, as I hope and believe 
you will, 1 doubt not you will receive the grateful acknowl 
edgements of America. My thanks are already due for the 
readiness with which you have undertaken this task, which is 
by no means a pleasant or agreeable one. I am, &tc. 

GOUVERNEUR MoKRIS. 



406 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 



TO M. DEFORGUES. 

Translation. 

Paris, February 27th, 1794. 

Sir, 

The Captains of American vessels brought into your ports, 
and persons interested in the said vessels and their cargoes, 
address to me very serious complaints, which seem but too 
well founded. 

I will not here examine the measure itself, excusable per 
haps on account of the extraordinary circumstances in which 
the Republic is placed. But even could severe necessity 
justify a violation of the rights of a neutral and allied nation, 
she ought, at Jeast, to expect to suffer only the inevitable 
grievances arising from this violation. She has a right to 
expect, that the French Republic will be so much the more 
liberal and prorhpt in making compensation for these forced 
supplies, as the method by which she took possession of them 
was uncommon. 

But T see with regret that those who, sailing for France, had 
the misfortune to be carried into England, have had less cause 
of complaint, than those who have been brought into the ports 
of the Republic. Here delays and expense consume the 
whole. Some of the American vessels have been retaken, 
but the Captains, kept with part of their crews, on board the 
French vessels, which had captured them, have not been 
informed of their recapture until their arrival in some port of 
the Republic, where for months they have solicited indemni 
fication, assistance, means of subsistence, and permission to 
depart. I am sorry tp add that all their solicitations have 
been fruitless. The Captains Florence, Donavan, and Ben 
jamin Rogers, carried into Brest by the ship VImpetueux, 
Captain 1 Eveque, are in this predicament. 

Many vessels and American cargoes, among others the 
cargo of the Danish ship, le Krageroc, are in the same port, 
and I am told, that there is no one there, authorised by the 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 407 

Republic, to treat for the cargoes, to pay the freight of the 
vessels, or to fix the indemnification, xvhich the aggrieved 
persons think they have a right to demand. Thus the unfor 
tunate men captured at sea, by the ships of an allied nation, 
and carried prisoners into her remote ports, find themselves, 
although without means and almost destitute of resources, 
obliged to undertake a long and expensive journey to obtain 
that justice, which at least can only be rendered to them in the 
ports which they have left, since it is there that the articles 
must be proved, and their prices regulated according to their 
quality. 

I hope, Sir, that the most precise orders will be despatched 
to remedy these grievances, and that you will soon enable me 
to give a satisfactory account of them to the American 
Government. 1 have the honor to be, &LC. 

GOUVERNEUR MoRRIS. 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Sainport, March 6th, 1794, 

Dear Sir, 

My last was of the 21st of January. I am still without any 
advices from you since your letters by Captain Culver, which 
I attribute to the interruptions, to which all communication 
with this country is exposed, and which for that, among many 
other reasons, I much lament. Amid the political storms 
which vex this hemisphere, the opinion of the United States is 
the polar star, which should guide my course, but which is to 
tally concealed from my view. 

Hoskins, whose imprisonment I mentioned in my last, has 
been liberated. I mentioned also that there had been some 
feeble attempts to adopt lenient measures, and substitute a 
government of law to the present system ; but hinted, at the 
same time, my apprehension that they would prove unsuccess 
ful. You will see by the late decree that this apprehension 
was well founded, and that entire reliance is placed on se- 



408 THE* FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

verity and the resulting fear. This may perhaps succeed, 
but is exposed to a double danger. First, it facilitates the in 
trigues and the operations of the foreign enemy, by exciting 
attachment to the former, and aversion to the present govern 
ment ; and, secondly, it breaks the minds of the people, and 
prepares them for an abject submission to an usurper, should 
any such arise in the course of successful war, either civil or 
foreign. 

I have mentioned Mr Paine s confinement. Major Jackson, 
who, by the bye, has not given me a letter from you, which he 
says was merely introductory, but left it with the Comite de 
Surete Generate as a kind of letter of credence, Major Jack 
son, relying on his great influence with the leaders here, stepped 
forward to get Mr Paine out of gaol, and, with several other 
Americans, has presented a petition lo that effect, which was 
referred to that Committee and the Comite de Saint Public. 
This last, I understand, slighted the application as totally 
irregular ; and some time afterwards Mr Paine wrote me a 
note, desiring I would claim him as an American, which I ac 
cordingly did, though contrary to my judgment, for reasons 
mentioned in my last. The Minister s letter to me of the first 
Ventose, of which I enclose a copy, contains the answer to my 
reclamation. I sent a copy to Mr Paine, who prepared a long 
answer, and sent it to me by an Englishman, whom I do not 
know. 

I told him, as Mr Paine s friend, that my present opinion 
was similar to that of the Minister, but I might, perhaps, see oc 
casion to change it, and in that case, if Mr Paine wished it, I 
would go on with the claim, but that it would be well for him to 
consider the result, that if the government meant to release him 
they had already a sufficient ground ; but if not, I could only 
push them to bring on his trial for the crimes imputed to him ; 
seeing that, whether he be considered as a Frenchman, or as 
an American, he must be amenable to the tribunals of France 
for his conduct while he was a Frenchman, and he may aee in 
the fate of the Brissotins that to which he is exposed. I have 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 409 

heard no more of the affair since ; but it is not impossible that 
he may force on a decision, which, as far as I can judge, 
would be fatal to him ; for, in the best of times, he had a lar 
ger share of every other sense than of common sense, and lately 
the intemperate use of ardent spirits has, 1 am told, consider 
ably impaired the small stock, which he originally possess 
ed. 

The plan communicated to you of a requisition on all bank 
ers, merchants, and others, to furnish bills for their funds 
abroad, and receive payment in Assignats at par, has totally 
failed, as might have been supposed. It was the boy in the 
fable who killed the goose which laid golden eggs. As a suc- 
cedaneum, they have obliged the same people to execute joint 
and several obligations (billets solidaires) payable to the bear 
er for fifty millions of livres, say a forced loan of two millions 
sterling. These are to be negotiated in foreign countries, and 
the nation agrees to take them up again hereafter. What is 
somewhat extraordinary is, that a few of the monied men 
seem to believe in the success of this measure ; but I own I 
can scarcely conceive of it, for if foreigners believe in the ulti 
mate success of the Republic, and in the integrity of her future 
government, the intervention of private credit would be un 
necessary ; and, if not, it must be useless ; because, should 
the Republic be overturned, the plea of duress, by the individ 
uals who have signed, must defeat all hope of recovery ; and 
because, if the Republic succeedirig, should be deficient in her 
integrity, the individuals would be of course covered by law 
against all judicial pursuit. Add to this, that there is a kind 
of absurdity in signing such obligations, by which the richest 
man binds himself for four times as much as he is worth. On 
this pin, however, is suspended, for the present, all hope of 
facing numerous and pressing engagements for indispensable 
supplies from abroad. 

I told you in former letters, that I apprehended a great 
scarcity of food for the present, or rather the coming cam 
paign, should the Allied Powers persist in their hostility. 
VOL. ii. 35 



410 THE TRENCH REVOLUTION. 

They do persist, though the King of Prussia, taking advan 
tage of circumstances, insists on being paid for the blood of 
his subjects. Food is already very scarce. Flesh is hardly 
to be obtained in Paris, and the drought of last summer re 
duced the crop of garden produce so low, that it is now near 
ly exhausted, and no great addition to be expected for three 
long months. 

You, who know the abundance of former times, will per 
haps form a better judgment by price than by description. 
Take therefore, as a sample, cabbages twenty-four sous, and 
carrots eight sous a piece, and other things in proportion ; 
sea fish are reduced in quantity, by reason of the war and 
the total want of flesh on the sea coast, to a degree incredible. 
For instance, the wealthiest families in Rouen, Havre, &ic. 
are obliged for many succeeding days to content themselves 
with two or three pounds of very bad salt pork, half a pound 
of bread each, and such few vegetables as they can procure. 
The distant departments have many of them been at short al 
lowance for three months past ; others for a shorter period ; 
and Paris has been supplied as long as possible. But the re 
sources for flesh being at an end, the bulk of the inhabitants 
must soon come to bread alone. Now supposing a very 
doubtful fact, that the magazines of corn are sufficient for 
common times, and that no difficulty be experienced in the 
manufacturing and transportation, yet, as the consumption oi 
that article must be increased by the want of all others, very 
serious evil is to be apprehended. As I write, I recollect 
some other articles of price, which during my late residence in 
Paris I heard mentioned. Eggs ten sous each, and salted 
herrings the same price. These last were the only things, 
which the poor could get the day before I left town, viz. the 
first of March, and these bad. Pulse is at thirty sous a 
quart. 

The enemy is collecting himself for an immense effort on 
the northern frontier. The troops of the Republic have long 
been assembling in the same quarter. Will the supplies be 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 411 

sufficient for the army and for the capital ? That is a ques 
tion of serious magnitude. If Paris runs resty, the revolution 
is done. If the army disbands, the game is equally over. 
And such events have taken place since the government 
adopted terror for its maxim and support, that if once that 
terror were, by superior force, to receive a counter direction 
the Jlncien Regime, or any other Regime, would, I think, be 
submitted to without the slightest struggle. 

The Vendee, so often and so totally destroyed in reports 
made to the Convention, seems still to exist, and to wait for 
the meditated descent from Great Britain, to break out with 
more violence than ever. If the royalists should again collect 
an army in that quarter, I believe it will become on both sides 
a war of extirpation. Torrents of blood have been already 
shed there, and, if the accounts from thence be not greatly ex 
aggerated, another campaign like the last would convert the 
whole country into a desert. Barrere, in assigning at the bar 
of the Convention the causes of the present scarcity, said, that 
the Vendee, which used to furnish Paris market weekly with 
six hundred large beeves, now wants provisions ! 

I have often had occasion to mention the embargo laid at 
Bordeaux, and the sufferings of our countrymen consequent 
upon it. I have also mentioned the arrival of a deputation 
from that port to solicit the business in Paris. The day pre 
ceding their arrival the Minister told me, that everything 
should be settled to my satisfaction in two or three days. The 
deputation, to whom I communicated this intelligence, seemed 
very apprehensive lest their claims for damages should be re 
ferred to persons on the spot, which 1 own appeared to me 
both fair and natural; but they assigned reasons against it, 
which were satisfactory to themselves, and as they were de 
termined to have everything adjusted in their own way, and 
were well convinced that their representations must have the 
desired effect; as they seemed, moreover, to be filled with 
suspicions of Mr Fenwick, which seemed to me ill founded, 
and therefore very liable to adopt them in respect to any other 



412 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

of the public servants, I thought it best to leave the business to 
their own management. I asked them, therefore, what they 
wished me to do, after having shown them what had already 
been done. They hesitated a little, as is usual when men 
have not thought of any course of procedure before they be 
gin to act. They desired an introduction to the Minister, 
which I immediately gave, and they went to him next day, 
but came back much out of humor. They afterwards pre 
sented a petition to the Convention, which was referred to the 
Comite de Salut Public, and there the affair seems to have 
ended, for all their urgency to that Committee has not got 
them one inch forward. 

I apprehend that they may have injured their own claim, by 
interfering unnecessarily in other matters; one instance of 
which I shall presently have occasion to mention. They have 
at length called on me to make new demands, declaring their 
intention to abandon the property of their vessels. I expected 
that they would have gone back, but find that they determine 
to remain still longer in Paris, which may, I fear, prove detri 
mental. 

However, on the twenty-seventh of last month, the day af 
ter I received their letter, I wrote to the Minister on the sub 
ject. I send herewith a copy of my letter, with one of the 
same date respecting the vessels and cargoes brought in by 
French frigates, contrary not only to our own treaty, but to 
every principle of the law of nations. These captures create 
great confusion, must produce much damage to mercantile 
men, and are a source of endless and well founded complaint. 
Every post brings me piles of letters about it from all quarters, 
and I see no remedy. You have a copy of the Minister s an 
swer to my letter, holding out the hope of a speedy decision; 
but it may be very long before it can be obtained. And, in 
the mean time, if 1 would give way to the clamors of the injur 
ed parties, I ought to make demands very like a declaration of 
war. 

What am I to do in such cases ? It is impossible for me to 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 41 3 

guess the intentions of government, and indeed, Sir, the 
responsibility is great and distressing. Our countrymen here 
find, that it is the easiest thing in the world to carry any point 
with the Committees, until they have tried. In the mean time, 
I am exposed to their clamors in this country, and most 
probably to their censures in my own, for not performing 
impossibilities. In order to complete the business, nothing 
more is necessary, than that the rulers of this Republic, 
wearied with my complaints, should apply for my recall, in 
order to get rid of a troublesome fellow. I think it is very 
likely to happen, if it be not already done. I beg your par 
don, Sir, for saying so much of myself, but it is a troublesome 
thing to navigate in the dark between Scylla and Charybdis, 
without chart or compass. 

I send you enclosed the copy of a letter I received on the 
fifth of last month from a number of Americans here, (includ 
ing therein some of the Bordeaux deputation,) with a copy 
of my answer of the sixth. I sent copies of both to the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, and called on him shortly after to 
mention several things, some of which I have already noticed. 
Among them was the long depending affair of the Laurens, at 
Havre, and the decrees made in her case violating our treaty. 
I took occasion then to mention again, what I had said in 
answer to the letter from my countrymen, viz. that I was in 
hourly expectation of instructions respecting those decrees. I 
told him that, until they arrived, I should forbear any formal 
application ; but, under the existing circumstances, 1 would in 
a friendly manner take leave to express some single idea ; that, 
if the government meant to abide by the treaty, they had 
better anticipate the arrival of those instructions, and by a 
voluntary step preserve an air of dignity and good faith. But 
if, on the contrary, they meant to persist in the violation, then 
it would be well to consider the events likely to take place, 
and to provide for them in season. He felt much obliged by 
this mode of treating the affair, and told me that the thing was 
already before the Committee in the case of the Laurens, and 
35* 



414 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

that he would endeavor to procure a speedy and satisfactory 
decision. 

You will find herein the report made by Jean Bon St 
Andre, which is fully confirmatory of the treaty. Some little 
matters (errors) of form have impeded the execution of the final 
decision, and the communication which he is to make to me ; 
but I thought it a proper moment to bring forward the case of 
the Enterprise, which is the subject of the above mentioned 
letter from Ingraham and others to me. I, therefore, having 
previously concerted measures with the Minister, prepared a 
short petition from Captain Ingraham to the Comite de Salut 
Public, as an appeal . from the decision of the Executive 
Council, and sent it to the Minister, who forwarded it to the 
Committee, and intends to support before them the principles 
of the petition, and labor for a reversal of the judgment. 

I send you enclosed the copy of my letter to the Minister of 
the 22d of last month, respecting the imprisonment of our 
Vice Consul at Havre, and of his answer. I shall pursue this 
business to obtain his liberation. Poor CofTyn is still con 
fined. 

While on the subject of violations of personal liberty, it is 
proper to communicate a step, which late circumstances indu 
ced me to take. I have already hinted at a little dispute I had 
with the Comite de Surete Generale. It arose about the ar 
rest of a person in my house. Particular reasons prevented 
me from pushing the matter to a serious issue then. I shall 
perhaps, take occasion to communicate them hereafter, when I 
am sure of my conveyance. The Committee were made sen 
sible that they had done wrong, and that was all which I 
thought necessary. 

They have since (though not towards me) gone greater 
lengths, by arresting the Charge d AfFaires of Malta. This ren 
dered it proper to make a more pointed animadversion on their 
conduct, and produced the enclosed pieces of the 27th of 
February. The Minister s answer of the eleventh Ventose is 
also enclosed, and I find by the gazettes, that on the report of 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 415 

the Comite de Salut Public a decree has been passed in the 
premises, of which I have not yet received communication 
from the Minister. 

The Comite de Salut Public and the Comite de Surete Gen- 
erale are not, I am told, on the best terms together, and will 
probably come to something more overt than words ere long. 
It is of little importance under what forms parties or factions 
may present themselves ; their real origin is in the political 
form of the society ; and if anything prevents their rage, it 
must be the situation of Foreign Affairs. It is supposed that 
the approaching famine will be the signal for hostilities between 
the contending parties ; but it would seem not over prudent 
in any man, or set of men, to aim at power under present cir 
cumstances. I am, &tc.

TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Sainport, March 7th, 1794. 

Dear Sir, 

Shortly after the intelligence of hostilities by the Algerines, 
I applied to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, as being inter 
ested in putting a stop thereto, in order to cover the arrival 
of provisions in our ships. It was agreed that the Republic 
should, in conformity to our, treaty, endeavor to obtain a 
treaty for us with the Algerines. But as it was uncertain 
whether the Dey would negotiate such treaty with the agents 
of France, I was desired to name one for the United States. 

I therefore stated my want of power ; but it being impossi 
ble to get a seasonable answer from America to letters on the 
subject, I agreed to make the appointment of a person, who 
should come forward in case of necessity. I accordingly 
have sent M. James Leray, a naturalized citizen of America, 
to accompany the French Commissioners. He will appear 
as a Frenchman, unless circumstances call for the production 



416 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

of his powers. My instructions to him, after stating my want 
of authority, are, in substance, to aid in obtaining the best 
possible treaty for the smallest possible sum, and to confine 
the duration thereof to one year, unless approved of by the 
President, and to procure the liberation of our captivated fel 
low citizens. 

The French Commissioners are not yet gone, though it is 
now two months since everything was agreed on. Such are 
the delays, which result from the disorganized state of affairs 
in this country. I am, &tc. 

GOUVEHNEUR MORRIS. 



TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Sainport, March 13th, 1794. 
My Dear Sir, 

I send you herewith a duplicate of my last letter, in the close 
of which I mention my adherence to the opinions expressed in 
my last. But on recurring to my private letter book, which 
was not then before me, I find that the letter I there alluded to 
was written on the eighteenth of October. It went by Cap 
tain Culver, and has, I hope, arrived in due season. Every 
day confirms what is contained in that letter ; but parties are 
so balanced, and .the impending force from abroad is in such 
threatening attitude^ that the present state of things drags on 
its existence rather from surrounding circumstances than from 
internal vigor. And strange as it may seem, the impending 
change may arise from a victory, or from a defeat, or from a 
famine. 

The gazettes tell us that Mr Jefferson is coming to Europe ; 
some of them say as my successor ; others say it is a secret 
mission. I have heard it said that he is to negotiate a peace 
among the belligerent powers. For my own part, I hold in 
politics the opinions which prevail in physics among sound 
philosophers, viz. that it is proper to determine facts before we 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 417 

attempt to discover causes. I wait therefore patiently the 
event. Major Jackson, who has been here for some time, 
gave me two successors ; first, Mr Bingham, and then Mr 
Pinckney ; giving in the latter case Mr Pinckney s place to 
Mr Bingham. So it is easy, you see, to fill up vacancies. 

The probable events of the campaign about to open, are not 
favorable to the French Republic. It will be extremely diffi 
cult for them to subsist the armies needful for their defence, 
and the extreme severity exercised by the present government 
will, in case of adverse events, excite a universal insurrection. 
At present, the people are restrained by fear from showing any 
sentiment unfavorable to the existent authorities, but as is usu 
al in like circumstances, should that fear be removed, it will be 
succeeded by sharp resentments. If, however, the armies of 
the Republic should prove successful, they would, in my opin 
ion, be the first to overturn the Convention ; for such is the 
usual course of things. A terrible perspective this, my dear 
Sir, for those who are at present in the saddle ; no wonder, 
therefore, if they ride hard. It is not the least of their misfor 
tunes to be fully sensible of their situation ; and it results there 
fore, that as much time is consumed in providing for their de 
fence against adverse factions and contingent events, as in pre 
paring for the general defence of the country ; more perhaps. 

How different "was our situation in America. Every one 
performed cheerfully his part, nor had we anything to appre 
hend but from the common enemy. Such is the immense 
difference between a country which has morals, and one which 
is corrupted. The former has everything to hope, and the 
latter everything to fear. 

Adieu, my dear Sir; may God in heaven bless, and pre 
serve, and prosper you.

418 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 



TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Sainport, April 10th, 1794. 

My Dear Sir, 

In a letter, which I had the honor of writing to you on the 
10th of January, 1793, I gave you some traits respecting Mr 
Westermann, and as my public despatches had already com 
municated the plans of Damon, you will not have been sur 
prised at what has lately happened to them. I wrote to you 
on the 25th of June, that those who ruled had just ideas of 
the value of popular opinion. Also, that should they reach a 
harbor, it would be as much by good luck, as by good man 
agement, and that at any rate, part of the crew would be 
thrown overboard. Those I had then particularly in view 
were Chabot and company, of which company a part still ex 
ists. 

On the eighteenth of October, 1 gave you a short view oi 
the nature of the then government, and added what seemed to 
be the probable termination. I therein observed that, whether 
France would pass to that point through the medium of a Tri 
umvirate, or other small body of men, seemed as yet undeter 
mined; but that I thought it most probable she would. At 
that period things were wound up very high, and ever since 
the utmost uncertainty has prevailed, as to the stroke which 
would be given. 

I enclose herein a copy of what I wrote on the twelfth of 
last month, since which, both the Dantonists and Hebertists 
are crushed. The fall of Danton seems to terminate the idea 
,of a Triumvirate. The chief, who would in such case have 
been one of his colleagues, has wisely put out of the way a 
dangerous competitor. Hence it would seem, that the high 
road must be laid through the Comite de Salut Public; unless, 
indeed, the army should meddle. But as to the army, no 
character seems as yet to have appeared with any prominent 
feature ; neither is there so much discipline as would give an 
aspiring character just ground of hope. It is a wonderful 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 419 

thing. Sir, that four years of convulsion, among four and twen 
ty millions of people, has brought forth no one, either in civil 
or military life, whose head would fit the cap which fortune has 
woven. 

Robespierre has been the most consistent, if not the only 
consistent. He is one of those of whom Shakspeare s Caesar 
speaks to his frolicsome companion, He loves no sports as 
thou dost, Anthony. There is no imputation against him for 
corruption. He is far from rich, and still farther from appear 
ing so. It is said that his idol is ambition ; but I think that 
the establishment of the Republic would, all things consider 
ed, be most suitable to him. Whether he thinks so is another 
question, which I will not pretend to answer, nor how far such 
establishment may appear to him practicable. If it be sup 
posed that a man in his situation should absolutely despair of 
the Republic, and have so much diffidence either in his abili 
ties or his influence, as to despair also of obtaining, much less 
of preserving the supreme power, then it might be supposed 
that Danton s plan would be by such person carried into exe 
cution. Yet all this supposition is but conjectural foundation 
of new conjecture. 

And what are the Allies about? Forming schemes to be 
executed, if they should continue to be Allies. I am, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MoRRIS. 



TO EDMUND RANDOLPH, SECRETARY OF STATE. 

Sainport, near Paris, April 15th, 1794. 

My Dear Sir, 

This letter will accompany the duplicate of my last to Mr 
Jefferson, of the 6th of March. Be so kind, I pray you, as to 
let me know which of my letters are missing. I presume 
there must be great chasms in my correspondence, as I have 
received the acknowledgement of very few of my letters; and 
yet I have written always by duplicates, frequently by tripli 
cates and quadruplicates. 



420 THE ERENCH REVOLUTION. 

Permit me, my dear Sir, to congratulate you on your 
appointment. It is honorable to you, and will, I believe, be 
useful to the United States. The more so, as your convictions 
respecting our form of government will restore that harmony 
to our Executive departments, a want of which gave much 
pleasure to the enemies of America. I flatter myself also, that 
your habits of attention to business will produce a more 
active correspondence w r ith the public servants abroad. 

Mr Jefferson desired me some time ago to mark the state of 
depreciation to him ; which I continued to do, but omitted in 
my last, because it continued nearly in the same situation as 
when I last communicated it. The fact is, that there is now 
no certain or steady rate, because, as you will see by the ga 
zettes, dealers in that business are frequently guillotined. 
There is no foreign exchange, and in purchases very little, if 
any, allowance would be made on payments in specie ; and 
yet bullion is higher than it was before the Assignats were 
issued. The exact rate I do not know. Louis d ors, I am 
told, are much higher than they were, owing, as I have for 
merly mentioned, to the greater facility of concealing or trans 
porting them. 

I have long since pointed out the danger of something very 
like a famine, which has indeed in many parts put on its most 
distressing forms. Men have literally expired for the want 
of food, with the means of buying it in their possession, could 
it have been bought. Luckily, or rather providentially, the 
season advances with a rapidity scarcely ever experienced. I 
have rye in the ear, and sanfoin in blossom. It is true, that 
the sandy soil contributes to push forward vegetation ; but still 
it is a phenomenon. Apricots as large as a pigeon s egg in the 
middle of April, and that in the latitude of forty-eight to forty- 
nine. These facts, which, in common cases, would be more 
properly communicated to an agricultural society than to a 
Minister of State, are of vast importance, for the great bulk of 
this nation live chiefly on vegetable substances ; and in the 
south, where the scarcity was greatest, I presume, from what 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 421 

I see here, that the earth begins to furnish a tolerable support 
to its inhabitants. A frost, such as we experienced in the end 
of last May, would do more towards the starvation system, 
than all the armies and fleets in Europe. 

In my last, I mentioned that the King of Prussia persisted 
in the alliance, although he intended to be paid for his efforts. 
I am still of the same opinion, though it is confidently asserted 
that he means to withdraw, leaving only his contingent as a 
co-estate of the Empire. His past conduct gives no room to 
suppose, that a sacred regard to engagements taken would 
prevent him from abandoning his allies ; but I think there is 
the stronger tie of a common interest. Austria and England, 
particularly the latter, are more pointedly interested than he. 
I conclude, therefore, that the business will wind up by a good 
round subsidy, (perhaps a million sterling,) and inconsequence 
of it a very large body of Prussian troops added to the army 
in Flanders. 

By garrisoning a few posts along the Rhine, and leaving 
the country exposed to incursion, the allies will force the 
German militia to defend themselves ; and as to the ravages 
which may be committed, a few consolatory phrases will, per 
haps, be the only compensation, which the sufferers will ever 
receive. If this conception of the business be just, the Prus 
sian Cabinet will keep up the idea, that it means to recall its 
arrnie^, until the last moment, and those armies will then 
turn off to the left into the Low Countries, or perhaps be 
transported by water. Something or other of an extraordinary 
nature is in agitation o~ both sides, for the armies have been 
long looking at each other, without striking or even aiming a 
blow. I have no doubt but the Allies count on the public 
discontents here, and certainly they have some foundation ; 
but as, on their side, there is no one chief who can act deci 
sively, or form solid engagements for the whole alliance, it 
is not possible to take that advantage of those discontents, 
which certainly would not escape the intelligent mind of a 
Ca3sar or an Alexander. 
VOL. it. 36 



422 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

In the course of my correspondence with your predecessor, 
I have endeavored to communicate to him my views of men 
and things, and to prepare his mind for events, which appear 
ed to me probable, and which have in due course of time 
taken place. This is what I conceived to be one of the 
most important duties of my station ; and if I have not 
been more full and particular, it is because the names 
of those, who, in their turn, were to rule and to per 
ish, seemed to me of secondary moment ; and because, 
judging, in my lamentable dearth of intelligence, from such 
feeble lights as I could collect in scattered rays from dif 
ferent quarters, it seemed to me that my letters would 
have been more acceptable, had I been deceived as to facts 
and probabilities, or capable of communicating sentiments 
and opinions I did not entertain. 

It has appeared to me, that Paris decides for the whole of 
France, and that the Sans Culottes (alias populace) decide 
for Paris ; that, of course, factions would continually arise, 
waging inexplicable war with each other, and that the 
momentary influence of each, being founded on fear only, 
could not take on any stable form, or possess any durable 
existence ; that each new stroke of the guillotine would 
weaken the force of liberal sentiment, and, consequently, 
diminish the chances of a free system. 

I must repeat here, that plots and conspiracies are not to 
be attributed to the genius and temper of those who plot and 
conspire, but to the state of society ; for it would be, I think, 
inconsequent, to imagine that in a given number of individu 
als, born in different countries or places, there should be a 
very great disproportion of talents and qualities. It seems 
more regular to believe, that in a virtuous and just society, 
the good qualities which exist are drawn into action, and the 
bad repressed by despair of success ; while, on the contrary, 
in a depraved and vicious society, the good must remain inac 
tive for the want of confidence and support, while the bad, 
released from the fear of shame, and prompted by cupidity or 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 423 

ambition, count on the submission of the society, if they ac 
quire the means of inspiring fear into the great mass, of which 
each individual pursues his personal interest unrestrained by 
moral principle. 

After this preface, which might better, perhaps, have been 
spared, -I proceed to mention, that many different schemes 
were, I think, carrying on to destroy the existent government. 
As to the idea that foreign powers excited the parties, 1 am 
not disposed either to adopt or reject it. I do not consider it 
as being at all r necessary to the formation of a conspiracy, al 
though very necessary to the destruction of those engaged in 
it. I explain ; the pride of the nation will at any time rouse 
them from the perfect insensibility with which they would 
behold the Convention, and all its Committees, thrown into 
the river ; and therefore it is useful to rouse that pride, by stat 
ing every attempt to overturn the government as originating 
with the foreign foe. And I remark here, that in the different 
reports made respecting these conspiracies, and the accusa 
tions against those engaged in them, it is as it were taken for 
granted, that the people would quietly submit to those, who 
by a coup de main should put themselves in possession of self 
created power. 

I do not say that this is true, but I have no doubt that a 
certain duration of general terror, as the basis of a system of 
government, must inevitably produce that effect. The period 
of duration, required for any particular nation, will depend 
somewhat on the national character, but more on the morality 
of the people. To reason therefore a priori on the subject, 
our ideas must take on as much of an algebraic as logical 
form. 

In examining historical facts, on the contrary, we are too apt, 
I think, to ascribe to individuals the events which are produced 
by general causes. The two factions lately crushed may be 
called the Dantonist and Hebertist. I should more readily 
attribute to the latter, than to the former, a connexion with for 
eign powers. I have strong reasons to believe that Danton 



424 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

feared from them, and hoped from those who destroyed him. 
The Hebertists, however, may be considered, I think, as the 
Anti-Conventional, and the Dantonists as the Royal, faction. I 
except always the Aristocrats, who are in fact null., and who 
in the various changes which impend will, I am persuaded, 
have very little, if any, share. The more ardent spirits among 
them flew off long ago, either into foreign countries or the Ven 
dee. I speak in generals, not universals. Those who remain 
are of that waxen substance called the men of property, who 
in foreign wars count so much, and civil wars so little. 

Danton always believed, and, what is worse as to himself 
at least, always maintained, that a popular system of government 
for this country was absurd ; that the people were too igno 
rant, too inconstant, and too corrupt to support a legal admin 
istration 5 that, habituated to obey, they required a master ; and 
that, even had they been educated in the principles of free 
dom, and joined to the energy of sentiment the force of habit, 
yet like ancient Rome they had reached the period in which 
Cato was a madman, and Ca3sar a necessary evil. His con 
duct was in perfect unison with those principles when he act 
ed ; but he was too voluptuous for his ambition, too indolent 
to acquire supreme power. Moreover, his object seems rather 
to have been great wealth, than great fame. He has fallen 
at the feet of Robespierre. 

As to the Hebertists, whatever may have been the ultimate 
view of some, I presume that the greater number had nothing 
more in view, than a second edition of the 3.1st of last May. 
The destruction of all these Chiefs has given great power to 
the Comite de Salut Public, whose monthly renewal is so 
much a thing of course, that they may be considered as a per 
manent body. Hence it follows, that the next considerable 
party ought to arise there. The Hebertists believed the Con 
vention to be so low in public opinion, that they could overturn 
it without the aid of its own members. They were deceived, 
or at least they were anticipated. The Dantonists supposed, 
that in the want of respect for their rulers, the people would 
readily turn on the little prisoner in the temple, that enthusias- 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 425 

tic sentiment so congenial to the heart of man, so essential 
to that which beats in a French bosom. They also were anti 
cipated ; but if they judged rightly, they have unveiled a 
dreadful mystery. 

Some one observed the other day, in conversation, that 
all the men of the tenth of August have passed away already, 
and those also of the second of September. It is certain that 
the tenth of August is chiefly to ba attributed to Westermann, 
one of those lately guillotined, and that Danton was among 
the prime movers of the scenes of September. The reason for 
that massacre will be found, perhaps, in the old adage, dead 
men tell no tales. Oliver Cromwell understood well the value 
of mob sentiment, when he replied to his chaplain, vain of the 
applauding crowd which thronged round his master s coach, 
there would be as many, and as glad, to attend me at the gal 
lows. t do not believe that a good man in America can feel 
all the force of that expression ; and, therefore, I believe it is 
very difficult to form on certain subjects a just opinion. 

You will ask, perhaps, whether these factions are totally 
crushed, and whether, if so, similar factions are likely to arise. 
T think I have anticipated that question ; and the general re 
flections, which, perhaps, have already fatigued you, contained 
the anticipated reply. I will not, therefore, repeat ; and, be 
sides, in the vast field of conjecture, each man is free to take 
the path which his judgment may direct, or inclination choose. 

I have repeatedly mentioned the embargo at Bordeaux. 
Mr Fenwick, our Consul, came on lately to solicit redress on 
behalf of all the neutrals concerned, being furnished with the 
special powers of the other Consuls. Previous to his arrival, I 
had written to the Minister a letter of the eighth of last month, 
of which I enclose a copy. Mr Fenwick, after a sedulous 
attendance on the Comite de Salut Public, was so happy as to 
obtain a decision. By the bye, the Charge d Affaires of Den 
mark told rne last December, that he was confidentially inform-: 
ed, that the embargo would not be taken off till the month of 
April. 

36* 



426 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

In the course of the investigations, which lately took place 
respecting plots and conspiracies, some of the Ministers were 
arrested, and among them the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The 
system also is changed, as you will see by the gazettes, so that 
in future these agents are to be in name what they were be 
fore in fact. The Charge. Provisoire of the department of 
Foreign Affairs has sent me a copy of the arrete of the Comite de 
Salut Public, of which, as well as of his note and my reply, you 
will find copies enclosed. I also enclose a short correspon 
dence with the Charge d Affaires of Malta. I have, &c. 

GoUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO EDMUND RANDOLPH. 

Sainport, April 18th, 1794. 
Dear Sir, 

My last was of the fifteenth. This is written merely to 
cover copies of mine to the Minister of the eleventh of March, 
twelfth and twenty-second of March, of his answer of the 
sixth Germinal, mine of the second of April, and the answer 
to it of the twenty-third Germinal, written by Buchot, a second 
Charge Provisoire of the department of Foreign Affairs. 

You will, perhaps, ask why my letters to the Minister are 
in French, rather than in my own language. It is not to save 
time or trouble to myself, as you will easily suppose , but 
there are two strong reasons for it. First, it cuts off one 
source of delay which, in the tediousness of transacting busi 
ness at present, is important, and the more so, as the objects 
once thrown off the Minister s table upon a translator s desk, 
might run the risk of not being taken up again. Another rea 
son, of a different complexion, is, to avoid misinterpretation 
and mistake. A slight change of idea in changing the phrases 
might have unpleasant consequences, for men are very ticklish 
in such revolutions as the present; and, therefore, it becomes 
me to be cautious, so as not to say either too much or too little ; 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 427 

and, moreover, to use an Eastern phrase, not to put my 
tongue in the mouth of another. 

Tn reading over the letters, of which copies are enclosed, I 
am reminded of what I wrote very long ago respecting Mr 
Coffyn, the agent at Dunkirk, who has expressed a wish to 
be appointed Vice Consul at that place, having heretofore 
acted in that capacity under the auspices of our Consul Gene- 
eral, and of Dr Franklin. If I did not impose upon myself 
the obligation never to recommend to appointments, which I 
have no right to interfere in, the conduct of that gentleman, 
and his general good character, would have drawn from me a 
recommendation. As it is, I do not yet know whether my 
letter was ever received. 

In mine of the twenty-first of December, 1792, I mentioned 
the plan of Danton, adding that I believed that it had never 
been wholly abandoned. His late execution will show that 
faith to have been well founded. And I am now told that, 
when condemned to death, he declared that he was glad to be 
rid of a state of society so abominable. I am, &c.

Sir, 

Immediately on the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, 
respecting our Minister at Paris,* I communicated it to the

the honor of verbally informing you, that the President did not 
hesitate to do the reciprocal act, which was requested. From 
that moment to this, we have been anxiously seeking a suc

EDMUND RANDOLH TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

Philadelphia, April 29th, 1794. 
Dear Sir, 

From the moment of my coming into office, I have sought 
opportunities for France ; in order that I might communicate 
to you the events of our country. But no direct one having 
presented itself, until the other day, when some of M. Fau- 
chet s squadron sailed; and the stoppage of the vessel, said to 
have his despatches on board, having arrested a private letter, 
which I had written to you, you can have received only my 
public letter of the tenth of January last. 

The severity practised upon us by Great Britain, in her 
instructions of the 8th of June and 6th of November, 1793, 
has caused various movements in Congress. Mr Madison s 
resolutions, of which I before informed you, were discussed 
with great vehemence ; but seem at length to be swallowed up 
in the contemplation of measures of more eclat. A proposi 
tion, dictated by the daily reports of capture and condemnation 
in the British West Indies, was made for sequestering British 
debts ; but it did not include those due from the United States 
in the shape of stock. Warm debates ensued ; when this 
motion gave way to a proposition from Mr Abraham Clark, of 
Jersey, to break up all intercourse with Great Britain, until 
we should obtain satisfaction for the wrongs, under which we 
have so long labored, in commercial and other points. You

-will observe by a copy of the original resolution, of the amend 
ment, and of the Bill, every form, which it assumed in its 
passage through the House of Representatives, and its final 
defeat in the Senate. 

However, you \vill not conclude from this miscarriage, that 
it has been produced by any other cause, than the desire to 
try once more to preserve harmony by negotiation. It is now 
nearly a fortnight, since Mr Jay was nominated as Envoy 
Extraordinary to London. The Senate were occupied in this 
business for some days ; objections of various kinds mingling 
to interrupt it, such as a supposed inutility of the mission, the 
sentiments of Mr Jay upon matters, with which he may be 
charged, and the constitutional incompatibility or expediency 
of the Chief Justice exercising diplomatic functions. He was 
confirmed, as the extract from Brown s paper states, and will 
take ship at New York in about a fortnight, or a few days 
more. The irritation, which appears in all classes of people, 
renders it probable that if he fails in his errand, the United 
States will risk all the cons equences of strong measures. You 
will immediately ask, what provision has been made for reve 
nue, and an army ? To this I must postpone my answer, 
until Congress shall have prepared it. They have before 
them plans of many sorts ; but I cannot foresee which will be 
adopted, or how efficacious any of them may be. 

A letter, which I received from France some time ago, inti 
mated that you wished to return home. But I paid no respect 
to it; as you had never expressed this sentiment in the most 
distant manner, as far as I could collect from your official 
correspondence, or the knowledge of your friends. But, 
reflecting on the thing as possible, I was happy to believe, that 
your separation from France would be no great object of solici 
tude with you. This tribute of my own sensations is due to 
you ; because, from my acquaintance with your correspondence, 
I am free to declare, that they afford proofs of an enlightened 
and deserving Minister. 

During the present session of the Senate, your letters were 



430 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 

called for by them. The President, after much deliberation, 
thought it right to forward such of them as related to informa 
tion merely; and to withhold such others, and such parts of 
all of them, as might hazard your informant, divulge anything 
pending, or be reverberated on you to your disadvantage. 
The President, Colonel Hamilton, and myself, went over the 
letters, under the influence of these ideas ; and, if we have 
committed to the eye of the Senate a syllable, which may not 
accord with your opinion, it has not been from the want of the 
best disposition towards you, and your character. But even 
what was sent to them, was announced to be in confidence. 
The result, I believe, was much to your reputation, in the 
opinion of the most dispassionate members; and I am very 
certain, that nothing has been moved since, with any hostile 
intention to you. Perhaps I should not go too far, if I sup 
posed, that the disclosure of the bulk of your official agency 
has suppressed many little murmurs, which we were continu 
ally hearing, before the truth of your conduct was brought to 
light. 

You have been assailed, however, from another quarter. 
Nothing has been ever said to any officer of our government 
by the Ministers of France, which required attention, until the 
ninth day of April last; when M. Fauchet communicated to 
me a part of his instructions, indirectly, but plainly, marking a 
wish for your recall. In a few days afterwards, a letter was 
received from the Executive Provisory Council, expressive of 
the same wish. M. Fauchet was answered by me, under the 
direction of the President, as I am sure your good sense will 
think inevitable, that what the act of reciprocity demanded, 
should be performed. I enclose a copy of my letter to him, 
that you may see the footing, upon which alone the President 
places this concession to their request. He means to pursue 
the same idea in the nomination of a successor. Perhaps 
before this letter is closed, I may be able to send you a copy 
of the nomination. 

In the letter of form accompanying the gentleman, who will 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 431 

replace you, it will be my study to manifest, that it is not from 
a dissatisfaction, which the President has conceived at your 
conduct, but from reasons of a different sort, irresistible in 
themselves, that. the step is taken. And I am thus explicit in 
my own opinions, because I do not distrust, that in the inqui 
ries, which you shall make on your return, you will find, that 
at least candor and honor have been observed towards you on 
my part. I have the honor, Sir, to be with true regard and 
respect, your most obedient servant, 

EDMUND RANDOLPH. 



TO EDMUND RANDOLPH. 

Paris, May 6th, 1794. 

Dear Sir, 

This will accompany duplicates of my letters of the 1 5th 
and 18th of last month. The season continues fine and for 
ward, with every appearance of an abundant crop; and, judg 
ing from the productions now at market, the harvest will pre 
cede the usual time near a month. 

You will see in the gazettes the taking of Landrecy, and 
the foreign papers, particularly the English papers, will give 
you the details on that subject which we want. There has 
been much fighting in that quarter, and although, as is usual, 
the success may have been varied, it appears definitively to 
have rested with the Allies, seeing that they have not been 
forced to raise the siege, but have taken the town. 

I am told that the Republic now feed ten hundred and 
thirty thousand infantry, and ninety-four thousand cavalry. 
This is an immense army even on paper, and although we 
may easily suppose that there is some little exaggeration in the 
numbers, that there are some abuses in the account, and that 
casualties diminish considerably those who are really on the 
rolls, still it will appear that the force is very great. The dai 
ly expense of the provision department is about a million of 
dollars. 



432 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

I learn also, that the Comite de Salut Public have agreed to 
be unanimous, so that the minority always adhere to the ma 
jority. This Committee, and that of Surete Generate must, I 
think, be either melted into one, or else have a contest for su 
periority. At present, the efficient power of the State is lodg 
ed with those Committees, and the former begin to publish 
their decrees, which have the force of laws, modifying, adding 
to, and repealing those of the Convention. It seems to rne 
that this Committee are not yet fully apprized of the extent of 
their own authority ; that is to say, of the wide and deep effect 
of the terror, which has been excited by such frequent and 
abundant executions as take place throughout France. I 
think they may do what they please, provided the revolutiona 
ry tribunals remain in their hands. We shall see what system 
is to follow therefrom. 

I am told that Robespierre s wish is to retire to private 
life, so soon as the peace shall have established that form of 
government, which may be finally adopted here. 

Enclosed you have the copy of a letter of the 22d of April, 
from Mr Anderson at Nantes, to me, and of my answer. I 
am, &tc. 

GOUVERNEUR MoKRIS. 



TO EDMUND RANDOLPH. 

Sainport, May 31st, 1794. 

Dear Sir, 

This will accompany a duplicate of my last, of the sixth in 
stant, also copies of my letter of the tenth instant to the Commis 
sioner of Foreign Relations, 7)f his answer of the fourth Prairial, 
or twenty-third instant, and of my reply of the twenty-sixth. 
You will perceive that Mr Warden had been so imprudent as 
to lodge the despatches entrusted to his care with the Justice 
of Peace at Morlaix. This was done by the advice of John 
Diot. acting there as Consular Agent. Whether that advice is 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 433 

to be attributed to ignorance or design, I know not ; but it 
might easily have been foreseen, that the deposit would not 
be safe. I hope your despatches are in cypher, if they contain 
anything which is not of a very public nature. 

The gazettes will communicate to you such intelligence as 
we have here, and you will obtain from other channels much 
fuller and earlier intelligence, as to what is called news, than 
any which I can give. Moreover, this letter may be long ere 
it reaches you, for I have not any present opportunity ; and such 
is the state of things, that, unless letters be committed special 
ly to the care of some trusty person, there is very little chance 
that they will ever reach you. 

I have not received a line from you, nor from your prede 
cessor, posterior to the despatches by Captain Culver, desiring 
M. Genet s recall. 

We have had a sort of novel, or farce, lately, the subject of 
which was, that certain Commissioners had arrived from the 
United States at Brest. You will see in the gazettes what re 
lates to them so far ; and now I arn told, that Mr Jefferson is 
one of them, that he has been in Paris, and is gone to Switzer 
land, where a Congress is to be held of the neutral powers. 
And, what is more extraordinary, this intelligence comes 
through a confidential channel, in general well informed. Now 
as I do not conceive it possible, that any commissioners from the 
United States should have passed through Paris without seeing 
me, I am at a loss to conjecture with whom the honor of the 
invention lies, and also what can have been the object. For 
as to foreign powers, they cannot be the dupes, and as to the 
people here, they think more of the guillotine than of anything 
else. 

In my last I mentioned to you the omnipotence of the two 
Committees. Apparently this term is applicable only to that of 
Satut Public ; but the inquisitorial powers lodged with the oth 
er (and by means of which, they can arrest whom they please) 
give them great weight in the general scales. It is, I presume, 
needless to repeat what is mentioned to me, that the Conven- 
VOL. ii. 37 



434 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 

tion, as well as all those other authorities, who once could in 
fluence its deliberations, view with jealousy, but with appre 
hension and deep awe, these colossal pillars of the Republic, 
which they have raised, or permitted to be raised. This, as 
well as the ferment inherent in the nature of all such bodies, 
you will certainly perceive at the first glance, and your judge 
ment will seize the remote consequences intuitively. On my 
part, therefore, it is more fitting to observe, that these conse 
quences are more remote than might be supposed. A convic 
tion of that instability which attends all fortuitous greatness, 
more especially such as is founded on fear, and the certainty 
of complete ruin, should they be overthrown, will long smoth 
er all minor discontents ; moreover, the apprehension from the 
foreign enemy will, in my opinion, both promote their concord 
and support their power. 

Should the convoy of provisions expected from America be 
intercepted by Lord Howe, it might cause a great commotion, 
because it would undoubtedly affect the subsistence of Paris, 
and no individual will take on himself any responsibility respect 
ing that object. Hence might arise crimination and recrimin 
ation, of course discord and all its consequences. If no exte 
rior causes should preserve union, a very little experience of 
human affairs would enable us to pronounce, that it could not 
long exist. 

This leads me to say one word about the northern army, 
premising that all the other armies taken together are but 
trifling diversions. The late arrangement made by Mr Pitt 
with the King of Prussia, by concentrating the interest and ob 
jects of the two chief powers, Britain and Austria, gives 
much more consistence to the war on the part of the Allies. 
They seem also to have found out at last, what indeed the 
Convention has proclaimed a dozen times, that all the magic 
of the Revolution is contained in the single word, Paris. Now 
the high road to that city is from Flanders by Valenciennes, 
Landrecy, Cambray, &tc. If matters are to be decided in the 
plains of Picardy, numbers will, I think, avail but little against 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 435 

a formidable cavalry. You will see that no quarter is to be 
given to the British and Hanoverian troops. The Austrians 
are, already, but little disposed to give quarter. The corps 
of emigrants and deserters will naturally sell their lives as 
dear as they can. This campaign, therefore, will be one of 
the bloodiest in the annals of history. I am, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO EDMUND RANDOLPH. 

Sainport, May 31st, 1794. 
Dear Sir, 

I have already written to you a letter this day on the cur 
rent affairs. This will be devoted to a different object. I 
have lately seen in a gazette your report on the inquiries re 
ceived from the belligerent powers, and also some debates in 
our House of Representatives on a discrimination between 
those nations with whom we have a commercial treaty, and 
those with whom we have none. I observe that some frigates 
are to be built for the protection of our trade. These things 
have suggested, or rather recalled, ideas which I will venture 
to communicate at the risk of tiring your patience. 

While I had the honor to sit in Congress during the war, it 
w T as my lot to oppose what then appeared to me a rage for 
treaties ; and yet the respectability, which our cause was sup 
posed to acquire by the acknowledgment of European Poten 
tates, militated in favor of those, who wished to extend our 
diplomacy. At the peace, however, that ground of argument 
was removed. Moreover, we found ourselves in a situation 
unfavorable to the forming of treaties, because there was no 
constitutional authority to enforce the observance of them. 
Those powers, therefore, who might contract with us, were 
exposed not only to the common danger of a wilful violation 
on our part, but to that also of a general non-performance and 
of individual injury, without the permission, and beyond 
the control, of government. The obligations, therefore, not 



436 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 

being equal, it was not deemed prudent by some to enter into 
engagements with the United States ; and thus we fek our 
selves sinking beneath the level of national character. 

Our new Constitution made ample provision on that sub 
ject ; and,, if I mistake not, a steady adherence to its princi 
ples will place us first in dignity, as in good faith, among 
political societies. Our treaties now form the supreme law of 
the land, and therefore our situation, in respect to foreign 
powers, is reversed ; for they can violate their contracts with 
us, but we cannot violate our contracts with them ; neither 
have we, perhaps, any constitutional means of annulling our 
obligations, when they shall have broken their engagements, 
I will not here inquire how far it would be proper to make 
a provision of that sort, as an amendment to the Constitution, 
nor whether it would not in effect destroy the clause, which 
has rendered treaties on our part inviolable ; but I will ven 
ture to infer from this our relative position, that we should 
be cautious what treaties we form,, and with whom. What 
treaties, because, if contingent engagements become onerous 
to us, we must comply with them ; whereas, should they be 
come onerous to those with whom we have contracted, they 
may release themselves. We should be cautious also with 
whom we treat, because in the contingency last stated, some 
nations will release themselves, and others will not. Now, in 
political as in natural bodies, decisions of the will depend, so 
far as good faith is concerned, on moral character and con 
stitution. 

We have at present to complain, that both Britain and 
France have violated their treaties with us. Yet I can by no 
= means consider the cases equal ; for as to Britain, the act 
proceeded from cool meditation of regular government ; but 
in France, it is one among many bad effects of that extraordi 
nary situation into which she is thrown. Without dwelling 
farther on this distinction, I shall endeavor to state those 
objections to the multiplication of treaties, which formerly 
swayed my opinion ; and, first, it is no small one, that we 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 437 

should be thereby drawn into the vortex of European politics, 
which we should, I think, avoid as much as possible. Not 
that we should be wholly unmindful of what passes in this 
hemisphere ; on the contrary, I am persuaded that we ought 
to be extremely watchful ; but I would draw a strong broad 
line between vigilance and activity. 

Secondly, it has always appeared to me, that the less we 
are fettered by diplomatic engagements, the better shall we be 
able to preserve a firm and equal conduct in difficult cases. 
The law of nations may be likened to the common law, in that 
all cases heretofore doubtful have been settled by able judges ; 
whereas each treaty, like a new statute, gives rise to intricate 
questions, and the ultimate mode of determining them makes a 
good mind shudder. 

Thirdly, it has also appeared to me, that in most controver 
sies between European powers, we should preserve an exact 
neutrality. We may safely leave them to adjust their bal 
ance of power in their own way, because, if either of the 
scales should prove too heavy for us, the means of lighten 
ing it are at hand, and completely within our grasp. Now 
I am convinced that a neutrality may be most easily preserved, 
when no belligerent power can rightfully claim any privilege ; 
because, by conferring such privilege at our pleasure, we can 
sufficiently punish either of the parties for the injuries and 
indignities we may have cause to complain of. 

Lastly, I cannot but think that our present, compared with 
our future situation, is such that in treating now, we must make 
bad bargains, even were there any tribunal to enforce the per 
formance in a peaceable way. The paucity of our numbers, 
the apparent feebleness of our pecuniary resources, the want 
of naval and military force, even the extent of our dominion, 
which is, from that circumstance, of difficult defence and easy 
invasion, will prevent others from granting, will even prevent 
us from asking, what we ought to have, in order that a treaty 
made now should be reasonable in ten years, or tolerable in 
twenty. Whatever may be the intrinsic worth of these reasons, 
37* 



438 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

certainly they derive weight from that morality of our national 
constitution, which has been already noticed. 

This constitution was made subsequent to our existent trea 
ties, and even after the violation by Great Britain of that which 
concluded the war. Happily she has hitherto eluded a com 
pliance, and thereby prevented the forming of a commercial 
treaty. I say happily, because I am persuaded that in a few 
years we shall have occasion to rejoice, and the British to re 
gret, that perversity of counsels, which prevented their Minis 
ters from meeting our advances. 

We complain justly also, that France has broken her treaty 
with us, more especially to confiscate goods of her enemies on 
board our ships. This decree is evidently against her own 
interest ; but, in my opinion, the clause in our treaty, thereby 
annulled, was injurious to our interest. As to the maxim, that 
free ships make free goods, the arguments pro and con are 
familiar to us, and, therefore, I shall not enter into them. But 
the fair conclusion of those in favor of it goes to a protection 
of all commercial property on the ocean. Therefore, the 
maxim, even were it just, would not be generally admitted un 
til the practice of making prizes were wholly abandoned. 
Then all such clauses in a treaty would be superfluous, and 
until then, unless enforced by a strong marine, they will be 
nugatory. 

But it seems to me, from the view which I am enabled to 
take of our commerce, that however the transportation, in our 
ships, of goods belonging to subjects of a belligerent power, 
might prove a momentary advantage to our merchants, it must 
be injurious to our general interests. I take it for ganted, that 
our shipping is not sufficient to pursue the fisheries and to car 
ry our own produce to market. But if it were, I should con 
sider those as the proper employments, and 1 should reason 
thus. By putting half of the navigation employed in transport 
ing our own productions into this neutral carrying trade, half 
of those productions must remain on hand, or be transported 
by the belligerent powers, and in either case our agricultural 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 439 

interests must suffer ; for, as to other neutrals, their shipping 
will be employed in the same neutral carrying trade. Now if 
this reasoning be just, on the ground that we had a sufficiency 
of shipping, how much more forcible is it in the fact of an in 
sufficiency. But it may be said, that the neutral carrying 
trade, by giving encouragement to our shipping, would greatly 
increase the amount. I answer, of our fictitious shipping, 
yes; of our real shipping, no; and merchants will understand 
me. 

Moreover, I state hypothetically, either we have the tonnage 
needful for 1 our commerce, or we have not. If we have not, 
the increased freight of our own commodities will, in time of 
war, be a sufficient encouragement, and draw into that channel 
as much of the national strength and wealth as is consistent 
with the general welfare, and more perhaps, if we extend our 
views to all the moral effects of commerce, especially when it 
engages a disproportionate part of the society. If our naviga 
tion be equal to the employment our commerce can give it, 
any increase would be doubly pernicious. First, because 
throwing the surplus out of employ would occasion loss to 
owners in general, since they would be forced to underwork 
each other, till, by the ruin of some, things w r ould return to 
their natural level. And secondly, because, whatever differ 
ence there may be in opinions, as to the propriety of taking 
men from the plough, in a thinly peopled country, to ply the 
loom or bend the sail, while manufactures and navigation are 
unequal to the demand, no man of sound mind will contend, 
that we should leave our fields untilled to rival populous coun 
tries in the carrying trade. In our vast territory, a fertile soil 
and excellent clime invite to rural and domestic bliss, the 
source of a vigorous and virtuous population. Why then 
should we imitate those who, by the severity of nature, are 
driven to seek on the ocean a subsistence, which the land de 
nies, and who find, in the casualties of that dangerous element, 
a resource against excessive numbers ? 

Having said thus much on treaties, I come now to their 



440 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

sanction, an American marine. Whatever apprehensions may 
be entertained from a standing army, nothing is to be feared 
from a standing navy ; wherefore, 1 think we should not fol 
low the European example of building ships to lie idle, until a 
war calls them into action, at a great increase of expense, and 
by great injury to commerce. This may suit the ambitious, 
who wish to extend their possessions ; but a peaceable nation, 
placed as we are, should, I think, make perpetual provision 
for every ship lhat is built, and her fleet should be annual 
ly manned, victualed, and equipped, and should cruise dur 
ing the fine season. I believe that we could now maintain 
twelve ships of the line, perhaps twenty, with a due propor 
tion of frigates and smaller vessels. And I am tolerably cer 
tain, that while the United States of America pursue a just 
and liberal conduct, with twenty sail of the line at sea, no na 
tion on earth will dare to insult them. I believe also that, not 
to mention individual losses, five years of war would involve 
more national expense, than the support of a navy for twenty 
years. One thing I am thoroughly convinced of, that, if we 
do not render ourselves respectable, we shall continue to be 
insulted. And let it not be supposed, that a remedy for our 
weakness can be found in Conventions with other powers for 
preserving neutrality. In such Conventions there are often 
dupes, and it is the weaker who go to the wall. 

During the last war, no sooner had the Dutch acceded to 
the armed neutrality, than Great Britain fell upon them, and 
those who set the plan agoing looked on with all imaginable 
composure. In the late treaty between Denmark and Swe 
den, you will observe that time is given to the belligerent pow 
ers for repentance and amendment, before any hostile act of 
resentment by the contracting parties. You will observe, also, 
that the period specified is sufficient to permit the arrestation 
of all supplies shipped for this country, during the present sea 
son. Thus the next autumn and winter are left clear for ne 
gotiation, should the Mies be unsuccessful in this campaign. 
That treaty, therefore, may be considered as a demonstration 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 441 

of a force and temper, which do not exist ; and no one in this 
quarter is the dupe of such appearances. 

But what can be done by the weak, to preserve their little 
air of dignity ? They do not wish to join the coalition, and 
they dare not connect their fortunes with the French Repub 
lic, lest in a sudden change of government she should join 
those now acting against her. All that is left, therefore, is to 
temporize with the best grace they can. 

It is time to conclude this too long letter. Believe, I pray 
you, in the sincerity of that esteem and respect, with which I 
have the honor to be, &c.

Philadelphia, June 10th, 1704. 

Dear Sir, 

The letter, of which I had the honor of enclosing a copy to 
you in mine of the twenty-eighth of April last, was written as 
soon as the application came from the French Minister here. 
The embargo, which continued from the twenty-fifth of March 
lo the twenty-fifth of May, has rendered it very uncertain, how 
much sooner than this you will receive the original of that. 
Colonel Monroe, your successor, will show to you a copy of 
my answer to M. Fauchet s demand, and the President s nom 
ination of him. From all which you will collect, that the 
moving cause has been the irresistible call for an act of reci 
procity. Under this impression, and with the knowledge of the 
sentiments of the President, I have not thought it necessary 
to prepare formal letters of recall, begging you to consider this, 
as the most respectful mode&gt; which I can devise, of communi 
cating to you the new arrangement. 

The letter, now enclosed for taking leave, is sent solely for 
the sake of form and your own accommodation ; and it may 
be delivered or not, as you think proper. I have the honor

to be, with great repsect and esteem, dear Sir, your most 
obedient servant,

GEORGE WASHINGTON TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

Baltimore, June 19th, 1794. 

My Dear Sir, 

The difficulty, under existing circumstances, of knowing 
what to write to you, had determined me to write nothing, but 
to let the matter rest altogether upon the public communica 
tions from the Secretary of State. 

Coming to this place, however, on a flying visit to Mount 
Vernon, and finding the vessel, of which Mr Monroe is on 
board, had not left the river, I have so far departed from my 
determination, as to be seated in order to assure you that my 
confidence in, and friendship and regard for you, remain undi- 
minished. 

To time, and your own observations, if you should return 
immediately to this country, I commit the rest ; and it will be 
nothing new to assure you, that I am always and very sincere 
ly yours, affectionately, 

GEORGE WASHINGTON. 



TO M. BUCHOT, COMMISSIONER OF EXTERIOR RELATIONS. 

Translation. 

Sainport, June 21st, 1794, 
Sir, 

During the last war, France furnished several sums of money 
to the United States of America, both under the head of loans 
and that of gratuities. The first of these advances was a mil 
lion of livres, and it appears to have been made on the tenth of 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 443 

June, 1776. It is entered among the gratuities, but it is not 
known to whom it was paid, nor how it was appropriated. 
Doctor Franklin, in settling the accounts of the United States 
with the French Ministry, neglected to ask for the papers, 
which relate to this subject; and afterwards, when the banker 
of the United States applied, (in the months of August and Sep 
tember, 1786,) to M. Durival, in order to obtain them, he as 
sured him that he had communicated the request to the Count 
de Vergennes, who said that the receipt in question could be of 
no use to the banker, since he was not entrusted with the pecu 
niary affairs of the United States till January, 1777, and that 
this payment was made on the tenth of June, 1776. 

Our Ministers were also given to understand, that it was use 
less to urge the demand for a paper in proof of a payment, 
which would be of no account in the reimbursements to be 
made by the United States. Dr Franklin concluded from this, 
that the advance had been lodged in the hands of M. Beau- 
marchais, and that it was a cabinet mystery, whose eclaircise- 
ment ought to be a matter of indifference to us, at least till it 
became necessary to set this sum against the demands of 
Beaumarchais, for the supplies which he had furnished to the 
United States.* 

This occasion has now arrived, but without this you will per 
ceive, at the first glance, that the payment having been acknow 
ledged by the United States, the receiver, whoever he may be, 
ought to give them an account of the manner in which he employ 
ed it. Besides, mysteries serve too often only to cover waste 
ful expenditures, of which the people are the victims. It is 
therefore given me in charge to solicit the papers, acknowledg 
es the payment of a million of livres, as a gratuity made by 
France to the United States of America on the tenth of June, 
1776. I think they will be found among the accounts of M.

Durival, then head of the Treasury department for Foreign Af 
fairs ; and I apply to you, in these circumstances, with the 
more confidence, as I am fully convinced of the good will of 
the French government towards the United States. I have 
the honor to be, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



GEORGE WASHINGTON TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

Mount Vernon, June 25th, 1794. 
My Dear Sir, 

The sole object of the enclosed letter was to evince to you, 
that, notwithstanding your recall, you held the same place in 
my estimation that you did before it happened. 1 expected to 
have got the letter into Colonel Monroe s hands, before the ves 
sel in which he sailed, had left Patapsco river ; but a fresh 
fair wind coming up, prevented its reaching him. 

Since my arrival at this place, I have been favored with your 
private letter of the 12th of March, enclosing the duplicate of 
the 5th of February. For both I thank you. To common 
accidents, or to the interception of letters for purposes that 
may be guessed, are to be ascribed those disappointments of 
which you complain ; for I am almost certain, that information 
of what was going forward in this country was regularly trans 
mitted to you ; possibly, and probably, not by duplicates, 
which ought to have been the case, for the greater certainty of 
getting it to you. 

The uncertainty, when letters are not entrusted to confiden 
tial persons, or sent by special messengers, of their coming to 
hand, will restrain me from going into detail at this time. I 
shall only add, therefore, to the acknowledgment of the re 
ceipt of the above letters, that I am entirely ignorant of the 
source from whence, or the foundation on which, Major Jack 
son has erected the fabrics of your recall, and of your succes 
sor. Neither directly nor indirectly could he have derived them 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 445 

from me, for the best of all reasons, viz. that not until some 
considerable time after M. Fauchet had arrived in this coun 
try, did I entertain an idea of the former, or contemplate the 
latter; for until then, I had supposed you stood well with the 
persons in power. Sure I am, nothing short of evidence 
to the contrary, with the request that accompanied it, would 
have induced the measure. To Major Jackson I have never 
written a line since he left this country, nor received one 
from him. 

The prospective you have drawn is not very pleasing ; but 
it serves to make one more anxious for a nearer view. 

The affairs of this country cannot go amiss. There are so 
many watchful guardians of them, and such infallible guides, 
that one is at no loss for a director at every turn. But of 
these matters I shall say little ; if you are disposed to re 
turn to it, I will leave you to judge of them from your own ob 
servation. My primary objects, and to which I have steadily 
adhered, have been to preserve the country in peace if I can, 
and to be prepared for war if I cannot ; to effect the first, 
upon terms consistent with the respect which is due to our 
selves, and with honor, justice, and good faith to all the 
world. 

Mr Jay, and not Mr Jefferson, as has been suggested to 
you, embarked as Envoy Extraordinary for England, about the 
middle of May.. If he succeeds, well ; if he does not, why, 
knowing the worst, we must take measures accordingly. I 
am yours, affectionately, 

GEORGE WASHINGTON.

Paris, July 7th, 1794. 

Sir, 

In your letter of the twenty-first ultimo, you request of me 
the communication of the papers, which explain in what man-

446 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 

ner the million advanced to the United States, on the tenth of 
June, 1776, was paid. 

I sent your request to the Comite de Salut Public, to whom 
it appeared just, in this respect, to render to the United States 
the satisfaction, which was denied to them by the ministers of the 
ancient regime. In consequence, I caused the necessary re 
searches to be made, and I here subjoin a copy of a receipt, 
dated June tenth, 1776, which appears to be the one desired 
by the United States to regulate their accounts.* 

As you have well observed, there is no occasion for mystery 
between two nations united by all the ties of friendship, and 
of a common interest, I have the honor to be, &c.

Sainport, July llth, 1794, 

Sir, 

I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 7th in 
stant, and pray you to accept and present to the Comite de 
Salut Public my thanks, for the communication of the receipt 
of Caron de JBeaumarcbais. 

I think it my duty to observe to you, with regard to this 



* The following is an exact copy of the original receipt, as transmit

subject, that considerable sums have already been 
by the United States for various objects, arms, ammunition, 
and habiliments, which he sent to America during the last war. 
Now there is reason to believe, that a part of these supplies 
were taken from the public magazines of France, and in this 
case it seems right, that he should be accountable for them to 
the French Republic.* I have the honor to be, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MoRRIS. 



TO EDMUND RANDOLPH. 

Sainport, July 22d, 1794. 
Dear Sir, 

This letter will cover the state of my account with the Uni 
ted States, made up, on the first instant, agreeably to the in 
structions given by Mr Jefferson on that subject. No oppor 
tunity has since presented for the transmission. 

The bankers of the United States in Amsterdam wrote to 
me on the twentieth of June, that they have reasonto appre 
hend, that it will be extremely difficult for them to supply me 
in future for the amount of my salary and expenses attending 
my mission. This arises from a law they have passed in 
Holland similar to the British statute, which prohibits the 
payment of funds belonging to those, who were in this country 
during a certain time. This same statute has, I understand, 
locked up my money in England ; but I have written on that 
subject to Mr Pinckney. I expect also that the Dutch ad 
ministration will except my drafts from their general system. 



* In replying to this letter, M. Buchot observes ; I have made use 
of the suggestion, which you gave me respecting the supplies rendered 
by M. Beaumarchais to the United States during the last war, and I 
have communicated it to a suitable person to search for such proofs as 
may exist, as to the part of these supplies, which may have been taken 
from the magazines of France, and for which in such case this 
citizen is indebted to the Republic. 



448 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

If they do not, I must employ other resources. In this coun 
try, as you will have seen by my former letters, exchange is 
fixed at par. I have, however, in my account charged the 
value of sums paid at the time of payment, or rather carried 
to the credit of the United States the difference, as you will 
perceive. 

It is difficult, at present, to determine the value of Assig- 
nats compared with bullion. The sale of coin is prohibited 
on pain of death, so that no fixed course obtains. To judge 
by the prices of goods and provisions, bread excepted, the 
paper money is not worth above half its nominal amount, but 
the same articles are not to be obtained cheaper for hard money, 
and silver in bullion is by no means at double the former 
price. It has risen during the last spring from par to about a 
third advance, and is now perhaps something higher. 

I pray you will pay to Monsieur Nagot, the superior of the 
Catholic Seminary at Baltimore, or to Messieurs Chicoisneau, 
Tessier and Gamier, the directors thereof, the sum of two 
thousand four hundred and thirty dollars, and fifty-five cents, 
for which I have received the value here, and shall give credit 
therefor in my next account. I am, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MoRRIS. 



TO EDMUND RANDOLPH. 

Sainport, July 23d, 1794. 

Dear Sir, 

This will accompany a (duplicate of mine dated the thirty- 
first of May. For the reasons mentioned in the beginning of 
that letter, I have not since written to you as I could have 
wished ; but in the interim I have received yours of the tenth 
of January, covering one of the third from your predecessor. 
Having already expressed my congratulations on your ap 
pointment, I shall not here repeat, but only confirm, what I 
then wrote respecting it. But I will mention my perfect sat- 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 449 

isfaction in perusing Mr Jefferson s statement of our dispute 
with Great Britain, which is, in my opinion, a masterly per 
formance. I hope his abilities will not be lost to the public. 

At the same time, however, and with the same sincerity, I 
declare my belief, that the United States will gain by the 
change made in your department. Without balancing dif 
ferent qualities and qualifications, a difficult and unpleasant 
task, it is sufficient that we may now hope for a union of 
counsel and action among the different members of the Exe 
cutive ; a thing which appears* to me essential, and the want 
of which, or at least the idea that it was wanting, has, I know, 
been injurious. 

If my several letters have reached you, they will have 
communicated from time to time the best view which I could 
form of parties, temper, and opinions here. All these, how-* 
ever, are from the nature of things changeable, and it is only 
upon the final organization of a permanent government, and 
view of the territory over which it is to extend, that we 
can decide as to the prevailing interests and the system, which 
may thence originate. In all events, it appears probable that 
a friendly intercourse between the United States and the 
French nation will be mutually useful and desirable. Cir 
cumstances yet unborn may tend to relax or to strengthen our 
connexion. As they arise, and as they promise to arise, I 
shall study to communicate them. 

In mine of the thirty-first of May, I sent a copy of what I 
wrote on the nineteenth of that month to the Minister of Ex 
terior Relations. I now transmit the copy of his answer 
of the tenth Prairial, or twenty-ninth of May, and eighteenth 
Prairial, or sixth of June, with my reply of the tenth of that 
month. Mr Warder came on hither the fourth of the present 
month, and has since pursued his route by the way of Swit 
zerland ; but I have as yet heard nothing farther of the des 
patches he was charged with, although frequent inquiries 
have been made. I trust that they were not important, and- 
38* 



450 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

am the less solicitous about them, as Mr Jay has doubtless 
taken over duplicates of everything essential. 

The gazettes will communicate, ere this reaches you, the 
great success of the French arms. As far as can be judged 
here, the King of Prussia has, according to custom, played a 
double part, and his troops, instead of joining those of the 
other Allies in Flanders, have remained where they were, 
while the French armies filed off to the left, and broke with 
irresistible impetuosity into the .Low Countries. These being 
quite open belong always to the party superior in the field. 
As yet, this Republic seems disposed rather to lay them 
under contribution, than to hold the possession ; but, if Valen 
ciennes should submit, a different determination might take 
place. However, the sieges needful to secure them as far as 
the Rhine would consume more time than remains in this 
campaign ; for besides Luxemburg, Maestricht, and the citadel 
of Antwerp, which are on centrical situations, the whole fron 
tier of Juliers, Guelderland, Cleves, Dutch Brabant, and 
Dutch Flanders, are stuck full of fortified towns. 

The success of the French arms will have secured that of 
Mr Jay s mission, whose object I learn from common report. 
The justice of the British Cabinet (whose sincerity the Presi 
dent is well acquainted with,) will, I am persuaded, submit to 
the forcible arguments, which Mr Jay is directed to use ; for 
the nation is not now in a temper to indulge Mr Pitt and Mr 
Simcoe in their projects. If I am rightly informed, there is an 
end to the coalition. Each party will retire as well as he can, 
and Britain will cover herself behind her wooden walls. In 
the case of a maritime struggle, they will not find the enmity 
of America to be a very pleasant thing. Of course, you will 
have abundant professions of good will, brotherly affection, &c. 
&c., and I believe they will now make sacrifices to keep us 
quiet, much more so to gain our assistance. But I will dwell 
no longer on this chapter, postponing all farther remarks, till 
the government of this country shall have adopted a plan for 
her ci-devant colonies. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 451 

As to the interior affairs of France, one prominent and 
pleasant feature is an early and most abundant harvest. This 
is now gathering, and what is singular is the ripeness of 
wheat, barley, and oats at the same moment. In a few days, 
the whole crop will be secured, and they will begin to eat of 
it ; for there remains scarcely anything of last year s produce ; 
so that if the present had not been fit for use till towards the 
end of the next month, as is usually the case, God knows 
what would have become of us all. The abundance of the 
present year extends to every object, forage, pulse, roots, and 
other vegetables, as well as grain. The vineyards also prom 
ise more liquor than there are vessels to put it in. I conclude 
that we shall find little vent for our productions here, except 
ing our salted provisions, which must be in great demand. 
Moreover, I incline to the opinion that our vessels will not 
meet henceforward with the same vexations, which have been 
hitherto experienced , so that exportations of salted fish and 
flesh, may, I think, be safely encouraged for this country. To 
these may be added pot and pearl ashes, some flax seed and 
rice, also fish oil; and, in payment, our merchants will receive 
wines and brandies. 

There is at present a considerable ferment of parties, whose 
object, on the one hand, is to overturn, and, on the other, to 
preserve the colossal power of the two great Committees. 
Sooner or later that ferment must lead to an explosion, and 
the apprehension from the foreign enemy being greatly 
lessened, men turn more easily to the consideration of their 
domestic system. By a late decree, the Committee of Salut 
Public has secured to itself the promotion of one third to all 
places in the army, which gives them a stronger hold of that 
unwieldy instrument. Sooner or later, it must, unless dissolv 
ed, escape from the grasp of a multitudinous body. Such is 
the law of nature ; but that catastrophe is yet at a distance, 
and depends, I think, on the continuance of the war. Proba 
bly before it happens, the Committee will no longer exist in 
its present form ; for the mass of power there collected will, in 



452 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 

the natural order of things, either excite so much envy as to 
dissolve the Committee, or, forcing them in self defence to 
increase it by severe and frequent exercise, so as to destroy 
all opposition, will generate in its bosom the causes of change. 
These are evils resulting from that state of violence in which 
society now exists, because in such state nothing can obtain a 
firm foundation ; and how long this may continue, God only 
knows. Hitherto power and property are at war, and the 
latter is a daily victim ; whereas it is their union, which can 
alone establish permament systems of government. 

Mr Jefferson s letter of the thirteenth of June, 1793, reached 
me above a year after its date. Immediately on receipt of it, 
I wrote to the Commissioner of Exterior Relations the letter da 
ted the twenty-first of June, of which I enclose a copy, as also 
a copy of his answer of the nineteenth Messidor, or seventh in 
stant, from which you will learn, that the million of livres, hith 
erto unaccounted for, was received by M. de Beaumarchais, and, 
of course, ought, in a new statement of his accounts, to be car 
ried to his debit at the date. The operation will then, in all 
probability, be such as to eat up the balance reported to be due 
to him. I hope this information may reach you in season. It 
would have been transmitted long ago, if, by good fortune, a 
copy of that letter of the thirteenth of June, 1793, had been 
sent by Captain Culver. 

I trouble you, Sir, with copies of my letters of the twenty- 
third and twenty-ninth of last month to the Commissioner of Ex 
terior Relations, his of the sixteenth Messidor, or fourth of July, 
and of one just received from him of the thirtieth Messidor, or 
eighteenth of July, from which it would seem, that my numer 
ous complaints are at length to be attended to. I am inclined 
to think that this will happen, and I am persuaded that in pro 
portion as our administration is firm and united, it will be pow 
erful at home and respected abroad. I am, &c. 

GoUVERNEUR MoRKIS. 

P, S. In making up my letter it occurs to me, that I had ta 
ken no notice of the strange complaints made against me by 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 453 

M. Genet, in his letter of the eighteenth of last September to the 
Secretary of State. I do not think it worth while to enter into 
the investigation of them ; and the more so, as the falsity of 
some, and the folly of others, are evident from facts in posses 
sion of your office, and from the style and nature of the com 
plaints themselves. But, while on this subject, it may not be 
amiss to mention, that, during the last winter in conversation with 
the then Minister of Foreign Affairs, (who, I am pretty sure, had 
instructed M. Fauchet to apply for my removal,) I told him that 
if this government wished for any person in my place, the best 
way would be to tell me so, and I would apply for my own re- 
cail. He answered by assurances of esteem. &tc. &LC. 



TO ROBERT MORRIS. 

Paris, August 14th, 1794. 
IVIy Dear Friend, 

I am preparing for my departure ; but as yet can take no 
step, because there is a kind of interregnum in the government, 
and Mr Monroe is not yet received ; at which he grows some 
what impatient. The intelligence you give me respecting 
myself is particularly pleasing. I desired much to be recall 
ed, but I would not ask it, because I conceived my honor con 
cerned in seeing the thing out. My only remaining wish is, 
that the measure may be as useful to the United States as it is 
pleasing to me. I am, &ic. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO EDMUND RANDOLPH. 

Paris, August 18th, 1794. 
Dear Sir, 

This will accompany a duplicate of what I had the honor 
to write on the twenty-third oflast month. Since which, viz. 
on the sixth instant, I received yours of the tenth of June ; 



454 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

that of the twenty-ninth of April has not arrived. If I could 
have permitted myself to have formed a personal wish, it 
would have been precisely what has happened. To be recall 
ed on the application of the Committee of Salut Public, and 
to preserve, at the same time, the confidence of government, 
is getting out of a wretched position on better terms than I 
ever hoped for. Accept, therefore, my thanks, my sincere 
and hearty thanks, and present them, I pray you, to the 
President. My only remaining wish respecting this affair is, 
that my successor may fully succeed, and realize the expecta 
tions of the United States, or even surpass them. 

It is, I think, proper to correct two things in my last now 
enclosed. First, as to the dissolution of the alliance against 
France. I incline to think, at present, that it will take on a 
new form, instead of being dissolved. Secondly, as to the 
harvest. It is less abundant than was supposed. I will not 
say anything, just now, respecting Robespierre, &c. &tc. If 
my return to America should be delayed, I will inform you 
pretty fully of the state of things by the first safe opportunity. 
Accept, in the mean time, the assurances of that esteem and 
respect, with which I am, my dear Sir, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



TO EDMUND RANDOLPH. 



Paris, August 31st, 1794. 

Dear Sir, 

Yours of the 19th of April has at length reached me. It 
came through the hands of the Comite de Salut Public, and 
was, of course, read by them, which is well. I thank you for 
the information which it contains respecting public affairs ; and 
it affords me much pleasure to reflect, that my successor will 
probably receive from you similar communications, which will 
be highly useful. I have in former letters said so much on 
that subject, that I will add nothing here. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 455 

The history you give of my recall is perfectly satisfactory, 
so far as I am personally concerned. I have never doubted 
an instant, that I should be treated with candor and honor, and 
I have even the confidence, that I shall always be blest with 
the friendship of those holiest men, who administer the govern 
ment of the United States. 

I have said above, so far as I am personally concerned. It 
may be necessary to explain myself, and I cannot do it better, 
than by making a kind of testamentary request on behalf of 
my successor, should any of the factions or parties, which may 
prevail in this country, solicit his recall, supposing always that 
his conduct be proper in regard to the United States ; I ask 
then for him, under that restriction, the confidence and 
protection of the American government, to the end that it may 
be known and felt here. I hope a thorough conviction may 
be made to exist, that he is unmovable. T put out of ques 
tion an extravagant conduct like that of M. Genet, for T am 
sure that he will not sin on that side of the line, and I hope will 
not err on the other. Whenever a stable government shall be 
established in France, it will be certainly right to have here a 
man agreeable to that government, ; and I think a coincidence 
of mutual interests will render the place of such a man easy 
and pleasant. Until that period, pardon me, my dear Sir, 
for saying, that I think a firm and decisive tone and conduct 
will best preserve the peace, as well as the dignity, of our 
country. Switzerland will not be insulted, and yet there is 
no extended waste of waters to separate her from France. 

I will not communicate my sentiments of public affairs, 
because 1 cherish the hope of doing it in person, and have 
written this letter to provide against the untoward events to 
which maritime affairs are subjected. I am, &c. 

GoUVERNEUR MoRRIS. 



456 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 



TO EDMUND RANDOLPH. 

Paris. September 18th, 1794, 

My Dear Sir, 

I shall write but a few lines by this conveyance. The re 
sources of this country will hold out till the end of April next, 
but then things will appear in a situation truly deplorable. 
Orders are given to push into Spain with all the force which 
can be collected. The object is to obtain a separate peace. 
Attempts will be made also to obtain peace with Savoy and 
Italy. These failing, to supply the south with food is impos 
sible. Spain offered peace some time ago, but met with a 
contemptuous refusal. As yet the enemy seem to be unac 
quainted with the true state of things. I am, &c. 

GOUVERNEUR MoiiRIS. 



TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Hamburg, December 30th, 1794. 

My Dear Sir, 

At this late hour, and from this remote corner, J am to ac 
knowledge your favors of the 19th and 25th of June. I did 
not reply from Paris, because 1 wished for a safe conveyance ; 
and although none offers itself at present, yet I will write what 
occurs for communication, and take a future chance for trans 
mission. 

The assurances of friendly esteem, which your letters con 
vey, are very pleasing ; but, indeed, I never doubted of the 
sentiments you express, and even go so far as to natter myself, 
that the measure in question was not agreeable to you. It 
was highly so to me, and although I am persuaded that you 
will believe me, on my word, I will nevertheless assign some 
reasons why a change of situation was desirable. 

And first, you will see from what is publicly known respect 
ing those, who administered the French despotism, how pain- 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 457 

ful it must have been to represent our virtuous Republic to 
such persons. I had stayed, at some risk, after the 10th of 
August, because I thought the interests of America required 
it, and I did not ask my recall at a subsequent period, because 
it would not have been honorable to abandon a post which, if 
no longer unsafe, was at least very unpleasant. I felt that I 
was useless, and indeed that nobody could be useful, until 
some permanent system should be established. I saw misery 
and affliction every day, and all around me, without power to 
mitigate, or means to relieve ; and I felt myself degraded by 
the communications I was forced into with the worst of man 
kind, in order to obtain redress for the injuries sustained by 
my fellow citizens. 

During that state of things, I was grossly insulted by the ar 
rest of a lady in my house, by order of the Committee of 
General Safety. I could not resent this, as I ought tp^ have 
done, by quitting the country, because a great number of our 
citizens were then detained in France, with much of their 
property, and I knew the violence which those who adminis 
tered the government were capable of. Moreover, I saw with 
regret, that the temper of America was not such as her best 
citizens could have wished ; and the conduct of Britain, ren 
dered a temporizing conduct with France indispensable. My 
representations obtained a half apology and promise of satisfac 
tion, but occasioned the order to solicit my recall ; of which I 
was apprised within four and twenty hours after it was given, 
and might easily have shown whence it originated ; but, to tell 
you the truth, I was inclined to wish that 1 might be removed 
on their application. I really believe it was necessary to my 
reputation. So long as they believed in the success of their 
demand, they treated my representations with indifference and 
contempt ; but at last, hearing nothing from their Minister on 
that subject, or indeed on any other, they took it into their 
heads that 1 was immovable, and made overtures of concilia 
tion. 

At this time I began to apprehend, that we should be plung- 
VOL. ii. 39 



458 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

ed into a war with England, in which case it would have be 
come my duty to aid the French as far as my abilities might 
go; but as I knew their temper, I replied to the advances 
made, that I was not to be affected by smooth words, so that 
they must begin by complying with the various demands I had 
made, and show me by facts that they were well disposed. 
Shortly after this, I received a volunteer letter from the Com 
missary of Exterior Relations, (a poor creature, who scarce 
dared to do anything without an order from the Committee of 
Safety), assuring me that he had transmitted my various rep 
resentations to the Commissary of the Marine, and expected 
soon to give me satisfactory answers. It was written ten days 
before the death of Robespierre, shortly after which, Mr Mon 
roe arrived. He was fortunate in not reaching France at an 
earlier period ; for, if I may judge by what fell within my ob 
servation, he would have bee^i a little too well with that party, 
to be viewed in a neutral light by their opponents. I hope he 
may succeed in obtaining the redress of those grievances, 
which our countrymen labored under ; but on the 12th of Oc 
tober, when I left Paris, nothing was done. I build my pres 
ent hopes, however, on Mr Jay s treaty, for they will now be 
somewhat more cautious respecting us than they have been. 

In reply to what you say about my return to America, I 
must tell you, that I could not depart in such season as that 
my communications could be of much importance, and there 
fore as I must have exposed myself to the inconveniences of 
a winter s passage, I deferred my voyage ; and the rather, as I 
have some affairs in London which I wish to wind up. I 
should have gone thither for that purpose direct, but the 
French would have harbored jealousies respecting my jour 
ney, which for many reasons I wished not to excite, and 
therefore I came round through Switzerland to this city, in 
which I am now weather bound. So much for my history. 

As to the state of political affairs, the Polish insurrection 
is, as you know, completely subdued, and of course the at 
tention of Europe is all turned to France, which has lately 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 459 

triumphed in every quarter by the extreme misconduct of her 
enemies. It seems at present that they are coming to their 
senses, and if I am rightly informed, they have at length 
abandoned the idea of a dismemberment, and mean to pursue 
simply the re-establishment of the throne. If they act wisely 
and vigorously in that direction, it seems to to me that they 
must succeed, for the French are wearied and exhausted by 
the contest. They detest and despise their present rulers, 
and as far as I have been able to judge, they ardently desire 
the restoration of their Prince. 

You will ask, perhaps, why then do they not restore him ? 
It is because they dare not act, nor even speak, so that they 
do not know each other s opinions, and of course each indi 
vidual apprehends from the general mass ; but everything 
which has taken place leaves them to look back with regret 
to their ancient situation. In judging the French, we must 
not recur to the feelings of America during the last war. We 
were in the actual enjoyment of freedom, and fought not to 
obtain, but to secure its blessings. The people elected their 
magistrates during the continuance of the war. The property 
of the country was engaged in the Revolution, and the op 
pressions w T hich it occasioned were neither great, extensive, 
nor of long duration. 

But in France they have been lured by one idle hope after 
another, until they are plunged in the depth of misery and 
servitude ; servitude so much the more degrading, as they 
cannot but despise their masters. I have long, you know, 
predicted a single despotism, and you have seen how near 
they have been to that catastrophe. Chance, or rather the 
want of mettle in the usurper, has alone saved them to the 
present moment ; but I am still convinced, that they must end 
their voyage in that port, and they would probably reach it, 
should they make peace with all their foreign enemies, through 
the channels of a civil war. Adieu, my dear Sir. I wish you 
many and happy years, and am very truly yours,

FRENCH AFFAIRS. 



OBSERVATIONS 

ON GOVERNMENT, APPLICABLE TO THE POLITICAL STATE OF 
FRANCE. 



Written in Paris, July, 1789. 



THAT the French have not those manners, which are suited 
to a free constitution, is a reflection by no means dishonorable 
to that nation. It applies with equal force to all others, whose 
political situation is similar. Voltaire has called his country 
men, laches courtisans mais braves guerriers. Had the des 
potism been more complete, that moral painter would perhaps 
have said vils courtisans et laches guerriers. 

But whence this deprivation of morals in arbitrary govern 
ments ? The Almighty, for wise purposes, has formed man in 
such manner, that he lives not in himself, but in the opinion of 
others. In monarchies he looks upwards, and each contrives 
hew best to gain the good opinion of his immediate superior. 
Begin then at the point of the pyramid, where the crown is 



464 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

placed, and in each degree of descent you will find that, to 
flatter the prevailing folly or the ruling vice, obtains the good 
opinion of the superior, and opens the way to fortune. The 
vulgar, who are at the base of the pyramid, dazzled by the 
splendor of the great, suffer their opinion to be captivated by 
show, and adore the idol that is raised for their devotion. 
With them a golden calf commands the respect, which is due 
to the Lord of Hosts. 

In a republican government, those who wish to be great 
must begin by obtaining the good opinion of their equals. For 
this purpose they must be virtuous, or appear so ; and the 
appearance has, generally speaking, the same advantages, as 
to the community, with the reality ; because the example is 
the same, and because the opportunities of ruining the nation, 
by vices long concealed, are not frequent. But remark, that 
the possession or appearance of virtue will not alone suffice. 
In this kind of government, as in the other, the prevailing 
follies and vices must be flattered. The Roman must be 
brave, the Athenian polite, the monk devout ; and each must 
prefer the interest of his society to those of mankind, and the 
rules of his Order to the principles of justice. In pursuing 
these reflections, we shall find the source of an important 
maxim, which Montesquieu has advanced ; That laws and 
manners have a mutual influence on each other. To fit us for 
a republic, as for any other form of government, a previous 
education is necessary. But what is education ? Let us not 
confound things. Education of the head, learning, pedantry, 
superstition ; these are what the college confers. Education 
of the heart, manners, these we derive from the society around 
us. Hence the Dutchman is avaricious, the Englishman 
proud, the Frenchman vain ; and yet each has read the same 
Livy, the same Cicero, the same Horace. 

The education, even the scholastic education, of a free gov 
ernment is more virtuous, because the tutor is obliged to sac 
rifice to public opinion ; and the pupil does not see a horrible 
contrast of divine precepts and diabolical practices. In free 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 465 

governments, men are obliged to pay inviolable regard to their 
promises, because falsehood is a crime which cannot be con 
cealed, and which, as it exposes to infamy, is sure to impede 
the march towards that greatness, which can only be obtained 
by public favor. This is a trait of infinite consequence, be 
cause men, being able to trust each other, perform cheerfully 
the part allotted to them, either for the acquirement or for the 
defence of liberty. 

Lastly, in free governments the laws being supreme, and the 
only supreme, there arises from that circumstance a spirit of 
order, and a confidence in those laws for the redress of all inju 
ries, public or private. The sword of justice is placed in the 
hands of the constitutional magistrate, and each individual 
trembles at the idea of wresting it from his grasp, lest the 
point should be turned upon his own bosom, or that of his 
friend. In despotic governments the people, habituated to be 
hold everything bending beneath the weight of power, never 
possess that power for a moment without abusing it. Slaves, 
driven to despair, take arms, execute vast vengeance, and 
then sink back to their former condition of slaves. In such 
societies the patriot, the melancholy patriot, sides with the 
despot, because anything is better than a wild and bloody 
confusion. Those, therefore, w ho form the sublime and god 
like idea of rescuing their fellow creatures from a slavery, 
they have long groaned under, must begin by instruction, and 
proceed by slow degrees, must content themselves with plant 
ing the tree, from which posterity is to gather the fruit. 

But to quit metaphor, which, though it may enforce senti 
ment, very rarely conveys a clear and precise idea; and leav 
ing these general observations, in order to apply more particu 
larly our investigations to the facts immediately before us, it 
must be remembered, that, as each individual is governed by 
the opinion of the public, so each contributes to the formation 
of that very opinion. Thus, a thing not unfrequent in moral 
action, the effect becomes, in form, the cause. Those things 
then, which command the public opinion, command the public. 



466 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

A reverence for religion gave power to its ministers. Again, 
destroy at once an opinion, without raising at the same time 
another, you destroy all which stands connected with that 
opinion. Bring the people to despise their priests, and their 
religion is gone, unless you introduce enthusiasm to drive out 
superstition. The French have a blind deference for their 
nobles, and a warm attachment for their Prince. Bring them 
to detest the one and despise the other, what have you gain 
ed? A multitude ungoverned, and very soon ungovernable. 
Will you preach to them as a philosopher, the dignity of man, 
the empire of reason, the majesty of the laws ? You might 
as well talk of the centripetal and centrifugal forces in the so 
lar system, or the reflection and refraction of the rays of light. 
To such fine discourses, you will receive your answer from 
some decollated victim at the Place de Greve. 

And what end are we to look for as the result of unbridled 
licentiousness? History tells us of but one. Reason can discover 
but one. Experience proclaims that it is despotism. If then 
from history, from reason, from experience, we may derive 
one lesson, as to our political conduct, we must agree in the 
propriety of preserving those objects, which now command the 
reverence of opinion, till time shall raise a new generation, ed 
ucated in different opinions. Leave to the people a corps, 
which they may consider as the common enemy, and which 
may, from that circumstance, unite them in a steady and con 
stant support of the rights of mankind, the object for which 
they long contend will be endeared by the contest. By de 
grees they will/ee/, that which now they only think, and they 
will love that liberty, which they at present admire. A body 
constantly opposed to the popular wish, nay, constantly labor 
ing to oppress, will save the mfrom their most dangerous en 
emy. It will save them from themselves. They and their rep 
resentatives will always be as desirous of oppressing the no 
bility, as that nobility can possibly be of debasing the people. 

In the legislative struggle, where each having a veto neither 
can prevail, the good of all must be consulted, to obtain the 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 467 

consent of each. It is not the number of chambers in which 
laws are discussed which is important, but the spirit which pre 
vails in the discussion ; and that prevailing spirit will depend 
on the prevailing interest. The pride of nobility is offensive ; 
but to whom ? Not to the humble. Pride stimulates \hegreat 
to rise. And pride prompts the little, who cannot rise, to pull 
down the mighty from his seat. Reduce the noble, against 
whom envy now points her arrows, reduce him to the common 
level, there remains no other mark but the Prince. 

But in destroying orders, do you destroy the natural inequal 
ity of man, or the artificial inequality of society ? In attacking 
one effect, do you remove the general cause ? If you cannot 
alter the nature of man, why not consent to treat him according 
to that nature? Suppose all distinctions gone, and one body of 
representatives appointed for this great kingdom, on whom will 
the choice fall? This question demands a solemn pause. In 
the answer is involved all future consequences. Will not the 
rich and the great be chosen ? Have wealth and grandeur 
lost their influence ? Have the people of France attained to 
that philosophic contempt of splendor and riches, which indu 
ces men to perish inactive, and starve with tranquillity ? The 
rich and great, possessed of power which is only not absolute 
because there is a king, will they not desire to remove the only 
obstacle to the increase of their greatness ? Or will pity restrain 
them from those impositions on the people, which will increase 
their wealth ? Will not a very slight reflection convince us, that 
the methods pursued by some to overturn the authority of the 
great, must tend eventually to fix that authority, and to give le 
gal sanction to what is at present perhaps an unjust usurpation? 
Is it not most wise to put all these enemies in one body togeth 
er, and not suffer them to elude the vigilance of observation, 
by dressing in the popular garb ? Why suffer the wolves, (if 
wolves they be) to occupy the place, which should be reserved 
for the shepherd ? 

Again, let us not in our zeal for momentary reformation, lose 
sight of the probable consequences. Where the national char- 



468 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

acter is base, the national government cannot be pure. Let the 
legislator then always bear in mind an attention to the means 
of preserving and exalting the character of his nation. This 
is particularly needful, when we would form a free constitu 
tion. In absolute monarchies, as has already been observed, 
the Prince gives the tone to all subordinate ranks. Cyrus com 
mands the brave Persians, and Darius the voluptuous. But a 
free people take, by degrees, their distinctive traits, which are 
indelible. You would destroy the nobility of France. You 
say, that the respect paid to a titled fool is misplaced, and that 
the Conde of today should not be decorated with the insignia 
of his heroic ancestors. You reason on the equality of man 
kind, till you believe in it yourself, and become convinced that 
the whole nation are of your opinion. They think that they 
believe the same thing, and yet they are deceived. Such 
rooted sentiments are not to be in a moment eradicated. 

But suppose it were as you imagine. Your nation, no longer 
influenced by the splendor of rank and titles, will pursue more 
steadily the objects of ambition and avarice. Remember that 
you are to be free, and have much to apprehend from ambition. 
You will of course render the acquisition of power difficult, the 
possession precarious, the abuse fatal, and consequently the 
pursuit will be confined to those few, whose souls are form 
ed with loftiest views, and who can be happy only in command. 
Such men there are in all societies, and such will risk all 
things, and suffer all things, to obtain their darling superiority. 
The great mass, however, terrified at the rugged ascent, at the 
uncertain stand, and the tremendous fall, will prefer a hum 
bler walk in life. 

Suppose then, that you have arrived at the philosophic sit 
uation, where a love of power is repressed, and a love of titles 
annihilated. You have cut clown ambition, and torn up vani 
ty by the roots. What then ? Why then the great, rich, fer 
tile, commercial kingdom of France is to be under the base 
dominion of avarice. Everything is to be rated at its price in 
gold. And do you imagine that liberty will be the only ex- 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 469 

ception in such a general sale ? God has formed man with a 
variety of passions, but man would be wiser than his Creator, 
and simplify the principles of human action. Alas ! in pro 
portion to his success, will be his misfortune. What shall we 
think of the musician, who cuts three strings of his violin, and 
plays upon one ? And yet he may plead in excuse, that an 
instrument with but one string is more easily kept in tune. 

Suppose for a moment that man could be reduced to this 
standard, and that a wise legislature were about to form a con 
stitution of government for such mea. Would he not foresee 
and anxiously provide against the dangerous consequences of 
that overruling, base, inordinate propensity ? And in the midst 
of this anxiety would he not rejoice to meet with some one, 
who could awaken the bosoms of his countrymen to new and 
livelier emotions ; to those passions, whose quick and ener 
getic action briskly agitates the national manners, and dissi 
pates all stagnant and putrescent scum ? Would he not thank 
the man, who should give to youth the headlong fury of love, 
and to manhood the insatiate thirst of applause ? When 
these restless passions prevail, they chase ambition and avarice 
from the stage. By the prodigality of youth, riches are as 
lightly squandered, as they were busily or basely collected. 
And ofttimes the victorious general in catching at a feather 
lets fall his sword. 

But farther, let us suppose an excellent constitution estab 
lished. This alone is not sufficient. Next year perhaps it will 
be destroyed. We ought, therefore, to provide as well for the 
preservation as for the establishment. And how is that to be 
done ? Quit your philosophic closet, and look abroad into 
the world. Behold those numerous swarms of human insects, 
all busy, all intent upon some pursuit. What is it, which 
animates them ? Observe a little nearer and you will see that 
it is interest. No matter whether well or ill understood, no 
matter whether the object be salutary or pernicious, it is still 
self-interest, or if you please self-love, which, to obtain that 
desired object, sets all in motion. Be pleased then to con-

470 THE rkENCH REVOLUTION. 

sider, that in society there will always be a great number, who, 
from their natural propensities or peculiar situation, must feel 
a direct interest in the overturning of actual establishments. 

Here then is a constant cause, which must have its effect, 
and produce a constant and persevering effort to destroy the 
constitution. The acting individuals will change forever, but 
the action will forever be the same. As in a siege, the bul 
lets are successive, but the direction and operation continual. 
How are we to obviate the fatal consequences of this evil, 
which is unavoidably interwoven into all possible societies ? 
We may venture to say with geometric certitude, that to a force 
constantly acting, a similar force must be opposed. To bal 
ance this permanent interest, another must be raised equally 
permanent. An order of men with distinct privileges will feel 
a constant and regular desire to prevent innovations and change. 
But a hundred mouths are open to exclaim, why prevent 
any change ? Have not the people a right to alter the con 
stitution and laws as they think proper ? 

Such questions require no answer with men acquainted with 
affairs, and to others it is difficult to give an answer which will 
be understood. Perhaps it is best to ask this other question, 
why should we have any laws at all ? No man will deny, that 
a government greatly defective and oppressive ought to be 
changed, and that laws manifestly cruel and unjust ought to be 
abrogated. But a very little experience will convince any 
thinking man, that frequent variations in the law are a serious 
evil, and that frequent changes in the form of government are 
the most afflicting misfortune. From these must follow a loss 

o 

of commerce, a decay of manufactures, a neglect of agricul 
ture, and thence poverty, famine, and universal wretchedness. 
It is not worth while then to dispute about the inherent right, 
which man enjoys to plunge himself into this situation, for 
surely all will agree, that to exercise such right is madness in 
the extreme. 

But another violent cry is raised from a different quarter. 
What beautiful and pathetic dissertations have we not heard, 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 471 

about the natural equality of mankind ! A thing, which the 
writers themselves do not believe in, or they would never have 
taken so much pains to show their own superiority. How 
unjust that we are not all born Dukes ! True ; but still more 
unjust that we are not all born Kings. Is the establishment 
of distinct orders in a monarchy necessary to the national hap 
piness ? If it be, let the establishment be made, or being made, 
let it be preserved. But you complain that you do not pos 
sess nobility. The road is open. Deserve it. But many 
are noble who never deserve it. True. And many are rich 
by no better right. You will not violate the laws of property, 
because it is necessary to the national prosperity that they be 
held sacred. If then the privileges of a distinct order be equal 
ly necessary, why will you violate them ? But you will not 
impair the rights of property ; why then will you take away 
from the son those privileges, which his father bought ? Surely 
the one property should be as sacred as the other. And if you 
respect the eminence, which was bought, can you despise that 
which was earned ? If you acknowlege the titles paid for with 
gold, will you deny those which were purchased with blood ? 

Lastly. Examine the history of mankind, and find, if pos 
sible, the instance where a monarchy has existed in which the 
people were free without an intermediate order. If there be 
none such, consider the vast sum which France must stake 
upon a new experiment. The happiness or misery of twen 
ty millions. But is it a new experiment? Has it not been 
tried ? And have not events demonstrated, that all such trials 
terminate in despotism ? 



472 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 



NOTE 

ADDRESSED TO THE QUEEN OF FRANCE, ON THE COURSE TO 
BE PURSUED BY THE KING. 

Translation. 



January 26th, 1790. 

THEY advise the King to present himself to the Assembly, and 
to place himself, as they say&gt; at the head of the revolution. The 
trade of a revolutionist appears to me a hard one for a Prince. 
I did not hesitate to say directly, that it was foolish or perfid 
ious advice. He has gathered but bitter fruits from his inter 
course with the Assembly hitherto. Inaction is not only the 
surest course for him, but the only one which is not extremely 
dangerous. That they, who fear the consequences of having 
pushed everything to extremities, should wish to put them 
selves under the shelter of circumstances, under the shadow of 
royal authority, is all very natural. That they too, who have 
commenced the revolution, and who, in attaining their object, 
see themselves outstripped by their followers, should seek sup 
port against the violence which they have excited, is also nat 
ural. That the most cunning among them should desire to pre 
serve, for some years, the name of Monarchy, in order the more 
fully to destroy the substance, is not to be wondered at; 1but that 
the Monarch should second these schemes, that he should run 
headlong into the net, which they spread for him ; Alas, how 
much he is to be pitied ! 

But what must he do? Nothing. The children of the 
Count d Artois are already out of the kingdom ; so the royal 
family, being no longer entirely within the hands of its enemies, 
will respect what is there, for fear of what is not there. Let 
them alone then. In a short time every thing will be shaken to 
its foundation, and those who have poured insult upon the 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 473 

royal heads, and bitterness into their hearts, will feel in their 
turn the evils, which they have occasioned. 

War will come at the moment, when the general weakness 
shall promise to the enemy a sure prey. It shall come to res 
cue the state, and re-establish its affairs. The finances, even 
in skilful hands, will be benefitted thereby. Means are not 
wanting to France, it is only the talent to make use of them. 
But let it not be supposed possible to replace things where they 
were. No ; France must henceforward have a wise constitu 
tion, which assures to the people all the liberty of which they 
are susceptible, or it must have a frightful tyranny. This last 
is by no means suited to a wise and benevolent King. We must 
then have the first, and to attain this, we need only do noth 
ing. 

Let the people become disgusted with the novelties of which 
they are so fond. Time changes everything, and henceforth 
tranquillity will be in its turn the object most earnestly desired. 
Then they will come forward to meet the King, and offer him 
the spoils, which they have wrested from him, and it will de 
pend on him alone to insure forever the happiness of 
France. 



PLAN 

OF A CAMPAIGN FOR FRANCE. 



Written in June, 1790, and submitted at that time to Gen 
eral Lafayette. 



In the present state of Europe, it is natural to ask ; 

I. Whether Peace or War be most for the interest of 
France ? 

II. Should the latter take place, a question of equal impor 
tance arises as to the manner of prosecuting it. 

40* 



474 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

III. And this again is nearly connected with an inquiry into 
the means of supporting it. 

IV. The objects to be obtained will naturally disclose them 
selves. 

I. The fashionable rage of philanthropy bids us decide ; 
without hesitation, against the horrors of war; but statesmen 
must be governed by reason, not rhetoric. To the wailings 
of affected sentiment we might shortly reply, that in the usual 
course of human affairs a war is inevitable; but the subject 
demands more particular attention. To form, then, a proper 
judgment, it will be needful to examine the situation of 
France; first, in regard to her interior affairs ; and, secondly, 
as to her exterior connexions and relations. 

In the former point of view, that which immediately arrests 
our attention, is a revolution effected as it were by magic ; so 
easily have all ancient forms and establishments been abol 
ished. The preponderating force, which accomplished that 
miracle, will naturally impress us with a sense of its greatness. 
But it would argue a profound ignorance of human affairs to 
suppose, that the same force will be exerted to support the 
new constitution. All those, who are in uneasy situations, 
readily flock to the standard of change, and there is an enthu 
siasm in the first pursuit of freedom, which exceeds calcula 
tion. But the instant a regular system is adopted, many of its 
advocates wish again for something new. Some people would 
change governments like fashions, from inconstancy of temper; 
some from the derangement of their affairs, and some from 
ambition. Reflection on these circumstances will show, that 
the discontented party must receive accessions of strength, if 
they have the wisdom to be quiet, till the fervor of the moment 
has evaporated. The interior divisions, therefore, which have 
been unhappily excited, demand a serious notice, and the 
more so from their intimate relation to the finances. These 
must continue in a state of wretchedness, until order shall be 
established. But that derangement of the finances, which first 
opened the way to a change of government, is now unfavorable 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 475 

to the new order of things ; because it will enable the disaffect 
ed to excite murmur sand complaints against every tax, which 
it may be needful to impose. The call for a contribution 
patriotique has been prevented from doing mischief, by the 
wonderful working of the term Aristocrat; and other measures 
owe their success to the same cause. But the time approaches, 
when the torrent of enthusiasm will have spent itself for the 
want of opposition. Something, therefore, must be done to 
support the popular ardor; and there is no*word perhaps in the 
dictionary, which will take the place of Aristocrat so readily as 
Anglais. 

The dangers just stated are not perhaps the greatest. Anar 
chy is fatal to freedom. They cannot exist together, and 
if the former continue for a length of time, it generally ends in 
despotism, because the people become wearied by the pursuit 
of what they cannot obtain, and each suffering in turn the want 
of legal protection, all finally agree to give power in exchange 
for peace. Hence it follows, that the establishment of order 
is ardently to be desired. But it cannot be effected without a 
strong executive authority ; and it is to be feared, that much 
time may elapse, and many concussions be felt, before that 
event takes place, unless powerful circumstances be called forth 
to influence the public opinion. 

Neither is it unworthy of attention, that should such circum 
stances now arise or be produced, the executive authority will 
be delegated to supporters of the revolution, provided a due 
share of discretion be used in distinguishing between the 
advocates for anarchy, and the friends of freedom. But if the 
present opportunity should slide away, it is not impossible that, 
by degrees, the whole military force may be acquired by men 
not over temperate in the use of it. 

If we look beyond the limits of France, her Colonies first 
attract our notice, as being most intimately connected with the 
metropolis. The situation of things in this respect is unpleas 
ant. The maxims of abstract right established by the Assem 
bly prove a great deal, and it will be difficult to persuade the 



476 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

colonist, that he should not enjoy the right of seeking his own 
wealth and happiness in a free trade. In the present posture 
of affairs, those colonists may decide on their own fate, for they 
will certainly receive succor from Britain, should that become 
necessary. It is therefore prudent to treat with them on terms 
of liberal policy. They will probably demand a free commerce 
with the United States of America, and perhaps with all the 
world. If they confine themselves to the former, such limita 
tions may be fixed as that, without injuring either the Colony 
or parent State, it shall be beneficial to both. If they insist 
on the latter, the wisest course will be to grant them indepen 
dence at once, and to guaranty it ; inviting the United States 
to become parties in the guarantee. That example would 
catch in the British possessions. Perhaps the Colonies would 
assume a part of the public debt, proportioned to the revenue 
now drawn from them, and if so, their independence would not 
be a bad bargain. The terms to be made with them will 
depend on their temper, and that upon circumstances. If 
Britain had declared war, in 1774,, against the House of Bour 
bon, the now United States would have bled freely in her 
cause. 

Next in order to the Colonies, is the commerce of France. 
It is her happiness to depend less on foreign trade, than many 
other nations. With the East she can have little intercourse, 
because there is little consumption in France for the commodi 
ties of India. With her Colonies, even should they become 
independent, her commerce will be considerable, because they 
will use her brandies, wines, fruits, oil, vinegar, silks, and fine 
cloths, and she their sugar and coffee. But her interior com 
merce is most important. The wealth, which must flow from 
establishing freedom and free intercourse, throughout the space 
which nature seems to have allotted for her limits, is almost in 
conceivable. To derive full benefit from her local advantages, 
she wants only an accession of commercial capital, and those 
habits of industry, from which her Lsighbors have derived their 
importance. It must however be observed, that if Britain 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 477 

should establish the claims lately set up against Spain, the 
commerce of France must suffer severely, and her territorial 
interests will also be materially affected. 

This leads to a consideration of the alliances of France, 
which, according to the calculations of human prudence, tended 
to ensure her happiness. If they do not produce that effect, 
candor must acknowledge that the fault is in her, and not in 
them. Passionate zealots have indeed complained of the 
connexion with Austria, and now lately of the family compact; 
but surely these alliances were wise. Let it be remembered, 
that Europe will ever be divided into two great parties, so that 
you have only to choose whether your neighbors shall be for 
you, or against you. Some talk of an alliance between France 
and England between Rome and Carthage. It is not worth 
while to reason about a thing which cannot happen. The true 
question therefore is, whether you wish that England, Austria, 
Flanders, and Spain, shall be allied against France. On this 
supposition, how would she make head both by land and by 
sea? Without mentioning St Domingo, without thinking of 
the Mediterranean trade, let it only be remembered, that 
under circumstances less unpropitious, Maryborough was in full 
march for the gates of Paris. 

Even in time of peace, the expense of the additional troops 
to guard her frontiers would be ruinous to France, unless her 
navy were neglected, and that would give her adversaries the 
uncontrolled dominion of the sea. Britain derives from her 
insular situation the advantage of not being forced into a land 
war, unless slie thinks proper, or has brought herself into such 
condition by unwise connexions or engagements. Evidently 
it is the interest of France to preserve the family compact, and, 
if possible, to derive benefit instead of sustaining injury from 
the vicinity of Flanders, unless it can be supposed both prac 
ticable and prudent to form a close connexion with Britain. 
But the first article of such an alliance must be the superiority 
of one, which the others would not submit to. Ancient rivals 
in arts and iri arms, neither will trust the other ; so that they

would be placed in that suspicious relation, which involves the 
expense of war, without destroying the benefits of peace. 
Shall it be said that both nations being free, they would from cir 
cumstances be friends ? Free nations have ever been hostile to 
each other, from the little Grecian Republics down to those of 
Italy. The wars of Rome and Carthage convulsed the world. 
The delenda est Carthago has been repeated in the British, 
and will be repeated in the French Senate. The chance in 
deed is, that Carthage must be again destroyed, because the 
resources of trade cannot always avail against a great territo 
rial power. 

In the present moment, Britain is determined to give law to 
the allies of France, upon the principle that she cannot, or will 
not, perform her engagements to them. The affairs of Hol 
land have given a severe lesson, that allies when abandoned 
become dangerous enemies, and the wise will learn prudence 
from misfortune. If, therefore, either the foreign or domestic 
affairs of France be duly considered, it will appear proper to 
take a decisive part in the affairs of Europe, and exert her ut 
most force to preserve that rank to which she is entitled, that 
good faith which ought to be her glory, and that interior tran 
quillity which can alone secure her happiness. 

II. The manner of prosecuting a war falls next under con 
sideration. And here it becomes proper to consider the in 
struments which she possesses, and the operations of which they 
are capable. 

France has a numerous militia, but her army is not numer 
ous nor well disciplined, and her navy cannot act extensively 
from the want of resources. What can be done by such in 
struments ? 

As Poland and Prussia come into the war this campaign to 
the aid of the Porte, the war in Flanders must be particularly 
distressing to Austria. A powerful diversion against the Turk, 
might enable the imperial courts to possess themselves of a part 
of Poland, and Austria might recover Silecia. Hence it would 
seem, that a cession to France of his rights to the Low Countries 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 479 

might be obtained from the King of Hungary, and that the 
troops now serving there might also be obtained, as auxiliaries 
to France. A squadron from Toulon and Carthagena, with 
French and Spanish troops, could proceed to the neighborhood 
of Constantinople, and, having secured a proper post, could 
so far obstruct the communication with Egypt and the Arch 
ipelago, as to straiten that city for subsistence. Very pro 
bably, too, the appearance of a considerable force might excite 
the Greek Christians to revolt. By such powerful diversions 
the places acquired from the Turk by the imperial courts would 
be secured, and they might turn the principal part of their 
force against Sweden and Prussia. If the Elector of Bavaria 
wou^d be induced to take part in the quarrel, the advantage is 
evident. Great Britain, having no port in the Mediterranean, 
could not without great hazard oppose the operations in that 
quarter. 

Should such treaty take effect, it ought to remain secret until 
the moment of operation arrives, but it would be proper imme 
diately to march a considerable body of French troops to the 
neighborhood of Calais and Dunkirk, and there to construct 
vessels to be worked by oars, and to carry in their bows what 
the Russians call Licornes, which, by discharging Brandts- 
wogles, set ships on fire. Common coasting vessels would an 
swer this purpose, with very little alteration. It would be 
proper to prepare some flat-bottomed boats, to carry light can 
non on deck, and high enough to scour the country from the 
canals of Flanders and Holland. The object of this armament 
should be to menace the Island of Britain, but in fact to 
attack Amsterdam. The vessels first mentioned could go 
round into the Texel, and enter that city from the sea side. The 
ships would make but little resistance. The other vessels 
would be employed in the interior navigations. By menacing 
Britain, she would be obliged to keep some ships at home, 
and to call out her militia. This would greatly enhance her 
expense, and at the same time her attention would be drawn 
from the place, on which alone an attack should be made. The 



480 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

regiments in the French service, speaking the German language, 
should be brought by degrees upon the frontiers of Flanders. 

If the attempt on Amsterdam succeeds, the advantages 
speak for themselves. If it does not, perhaps Rotterdam might 
be secured, which is a place of infinite importance to the ene 
my, and in connexion with it must be considered Dordrecht 
and Gorcum. At any rate it might be possible to secure 
Flushing, and such other parts of the Dutch territory near 
Antwerp, as impede the navigation of the Scheldt. Or in the 
last resource, these troops might be useful in the main design 
against Flanders. 

With respect to this, it would seem proper to enter the 
country the beginning of October, (as subsistence would then 
be abundant,) in two columns of regular troops ; the one upon 
the sea coast from Lisle, so as to secure Neuport, Ostend, and 
Ecluse, and then march through Bruges and Ghent to Antwerp. 
The other column to descend along the Sambre, and joining 
the Austrians at Namur, endeavor to possess both Liege and 
Maestricht. The last might perhaps be easily taken with the 
aid of money, and when taken would form the advance point 
to be opposed to the troops of Prussia, Holland, and perhaps 
England and Hanover; for both may be brought up the 
Meuse with ease and expedition. A great body of militia 
might at the same time march by different routes to Brussels, 
and if the King should go in person, attended by a part of the 
Parisian militia, it would not be productive of bad consequen 
ces. By bringing them frequently into severe skirmishes, some 
would make good troops, and the others become reconciled to 
having regular armies for the defence of France. It is need 
less to say, that the force at Maestricht should be great ; for 
the possession of it and that of Antwerp being duly preserved, 
and the various communications attended to, the whole country 
would be easily defended ; and, as the state of the inhabitants 
would be better under the French constitution, than under their 
wretched aristocratic hierarchy, the chance is, that they would 
themselves fight against their present allies. At any rate, the 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 481 

parties would be well balanced. The French property, with 
moderate taxes on the people, would pay the charges of the 
campaign. 

In turning from hence towards the western world, it seems 
desirable that Spain should immediately send a considerable 
force to Newfoundland. By taking the seamen, and destroy 
ing the ships on that station, a heavy blow would be struck at 
the British marine. This same fleet might also interrupt the 
homeward bound ships from the West Indies, all of which sail 
by the middle of July, and pass near to Newfoundland. France 
might send to Brest the Irish troops in her service, with some 
French regiments, and quarter several regiments of cavalry in 
Britany, under pretence of disturbances in that quarter, and 
plots of the Aristocratic faction. A vigorous press might also 
be made in the large cities, (Paris in particular) and all idle 
vagabonds be sent on board the fleet, which should be double 
manned, one half being of these people. The declared object 
might be to defend the French Islands, and additional cloth 
ing for the troops taken on board. Their fleet might sail in 
the end of October, and go far to the southwestward, because 
at that time of the year there is a certainty of westerly winds. 
The British home fleet would then naturally sail for the Islands, 
and of course stand away to the southward, to get within the 
tropics. The armament from Brest, (after going a hundred 
leagues to the westward,) might return toTorbay. The troops 
landed there might, by sudden movement, get possession of 
Plymouth, and extend from the city of Exeter across to the Irish 
channel. The impressed men might then be turned over to 
the French regiments. The Irish regiments might get many 
recruits in Cornwall, and the officers and privates of the cavalry 
being brought over from St Male s, might he readily and well 
mounted in that part of Great Britain. The line across the 
Island could be easily defended, and the possession of Plym 
outh would be the means of intercepting totally the British 
commerce. 

It would be proper to send over, after the first attack, at 

VOL. II. 41 



482 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

least a thousand Chasseurs, excellent marksmen. Should this 
expedition be successful, a proclamation releasing the people 
from all internal taxes, and reducing the duties on wine and 
brandy one half, would induce many of them to favor the in 
vasion ; and by means of the contraband commerce thus laid 
open, not only the revenue of Great Britain would be injured, 
but a considerable sum would be received from those low du 
ties; probably sufficient to defray the expense of the arma 
ment. In the supposition that the great object of Flanders 
should be obtained, and this descent be effected, another de 
scent near London might still be threatened, or from Dieppe 
to Brighthelmstone ; this would prevent the detaching of force 
to the westward, or oblige the enemy to double his efforts. 
Add to this, that a long march in December, with a Janua 
ry campaign, could only tend to destroy his army, without ef 
fecting his object. 

Secresy in design, and suddenness in execution, are essen 
tial requisites to success. Britain may, and probably will, at 
tempt a different operation. With Prussian and Dutch troops 
on one quarter, and a large body of British and Hanoverian, 
troops on another, joined to the Flemish, it is not imposssibft 
to make the river Sornme the northern boundary of France ; 
especially if England has, as there is some reason to suspect, 
a considerable party among the disaffected in French Flan 
ders and Artois. If France, therefore, instead of going into, 
is drawn into the war, it will be perhaps for the defence of her 
capital, which is on that side wholly uncovered, from St Quin- 
tin southward, except by the river Oise. A landing might 
easily be effected in Picardy, or near Boulogne, and then the 
French garrison must surrender the fortified towns in Flan 
ders to one set of assailants, or leave the whole country and 
the capita] open to the other. 

III. It may however be said, that although the situation of 
France renders war in a manner inevitable, yet such is the de 
rangement of her finances, that it is to be avoided at every 
hazard, and almost at every loss. This objection leads us to in- 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 483 

quire into the means by which a war can be supported. And 
here we must suppose a failure in the designs abovementioned, 
and we must found no expectancy upon the restoration of 
credit. Neither must we be flattered by those appearances, 
which have resulted from issuing the Assignats. They are fal 
lacious. The Assignats are a paper currency, which is a legal 
tender, bearing interest, and founded on the future sale of 
lands. They carry therefore a legal evidence of inferiority to 
coin. The premium of interest will not be equal to the loss 
by depreciation, consequently will not prevent depreciation; 
which is inevitable, because few are desirous of acquiring land 
in comparison to the many who want to purchase other things. 
The public, especially, have many wants, and their resources 
from taxation must be retarded by a depreciating currency, 
since it is every one s interest to delay that payment, whose 
value is daily diminished. And for the like reason, the pub 
lic expenses will be accelerated, because no one will give 
credit. But expenses accelerated and enhanced, with reve 
nues retarded and diminished, must destroy all equilibrium. 

This being then the inevitable result, we ought to guard 
against it. For this purpose, an idea long since advocated 
might now be adopted. The public debts might be founded 
upon particular revenues, and the public service be provided 
for by others. These last should be payable only in specie ; 
and since, in time of war, each citizen owes his service to the 
community, a poll tax on the men not in actual military ser 
vice, might come in to the relief of extraordinary expenses. 

Many other taxes might be imposed ; for instance, on male 
domestics, on carriages and horses of pleasure, on cards and 
dice, on the use of ardent spirits, on legacies, and on sales of 
lands, a general stamp tax, &c. ; none of which would be op 
pressive ; and there are particular resources, among which may 
be reckoned a share in prizes made by ships of war. 

But one of the greatest resources consists in the kind of war, 
which, though expensive to the enemy, would cost little to 
France. The Islands would be secured by the incapacity of 



484 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

the enemy to send a force against them, and even if taken, must 
be restored at the peace. Having no possession in India, no 
expense need be incurred on that account ; but ships of war, 
a Hacking the British commerce to that country, might even 
produce money to the treasury. The French commerce 
might for a while be wholly restrained, and individuals be en 
couraged to fit out strong vessels of war, which would be a 
good annoyance. It would perhaps be wise not to risk na 
val engagements, and whenever any of the enemy s vessels 
were taken, the seamen should by all means be secured, and 
should not be exchanged, but sent into the interior country, 
and there employed in such manner as to alter their habits of 
seamanship ; and as the northern powers are at war, the Brit 
ish will find it extremely difficult to procure sailors both for 
their commerce and marine. But if the former suffer, the 
latter must be impaired from the want of money, as in the oth 
er case from the want of men. And if from any cause the 
navy of Britain be considerably reduced, she then loses the 
great advantage of her insular position. Should they make a 
similar disposition of French seamen, it would involve them in 
great difficulties ; for it would be easy to approach the place 
where the French seamen might be, and of course to favor their 
escape. Unless every party was well guarded the keepers 
would frequently be subdued, and the expense of such numer 
ous guards would be oppressive. 

In looking back it will give some satisfaction, perhaps, to the 
philosophic mind, to observe that success in the measures just 
mentioned would give freedom to Flanders, and perhaps to 
Holland. That the condition of Poland might be mended. 
That, possibly, Greece might be liberated from the Turkish, 
and India from the British yoke. That, by opening the navi 
gation of the Black Sea, a new theatre will be displayed for 
commercial industry. And that, in shaking the Ottoman Em 
pire to its centre, Eygpt might become independent, and the 
piratical powers of Barbary be restrained. 

Lastly. If France should, (with the loss of all her Colonies 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 485 

and a great addition of debt,) get possession of Flanders, and 
establish the free navigation of the Scheldt ; if, above all, she 
should firmly fix a free constitution, she will be a vast gainer 
by the conflict, and must from that moment be considered 
as the greatest and happiest nation on earth. 



NOTE 

WRITTEN FOR THE COUNT DE MONTMORIN, CONTAINING SUG 
GESTIONS RESPECTING A CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT. 

Translation. 



The date of this paper is uncertain, but it was handed to 
the Count de Montmorin before the 25th of May, 1791. 



In the present state of France, it is impossible to establish 
a moderate government. Between hereditary royalty, and 
representatives chosen for two years, the struggle cannot be 
of long duration. If, then, the King can preserve, or rather 
regain the means of preserving order, he will soon be master. 
If, on the contrary, they persist in making barriers against 
what they call the abuse of authority, Monarchy is at an end. 
Force must succeed anarchy, and then the most sue cessful 
commander will have the most extensive authority. There is 
no doubt, that the Royal Family will be previously expelled, 
and if it is ever re-established, that event, always uncertain, 
cannot take place except after a long interval. 

Men are governed only by force, or by opinion, and 
force ever depends only upon opinion. Thus, between 
absolute and moderate governments, there is no other dif- 
erence, than that of opinion, more or less general. Under 
the first, everything depends upon the army ; under the sec 
ond, upon tbe mass of good citizens, who call themselves the 
41* 



486 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

people. When there is no longer a government, there is no 
longer a people. It is then the populace which governs, be 
cause it is that, which, having nothing to lose, hopes to gain 
everything, and which thus becoming the only active force, 
alone inspires terror. 

Nothing is more wretched, than the sad necessity of becom 
ing master, or of remaining a slave, more especially as the 
most despotic sultan is always governed by his own instru 
ments, and trembles at the appearance of the force, which in 
timidates his subjects. It would then be consistent equally 
with goodness and wisdom, for a virtuous prince to establish a 
constitution, which would reconcile the interests of the mon 
arch with those of his people. In France, this would be even 
indispensable, since the generally diffused ideas w r ould not per 
mit a very severe regime long to exist. 

But at the present moment it is necessary to choose be 
tween two extremes. It is necessary to be all, or nothing. 
The choice being made, it remains to be known what are the 
means of escaping from this paralysis, with which the govern 
ment has been struck. If the chiefs of the opposition were 
virtuous, but misguided, the thing would perhaps be impossi 
ble ; but everything is to be hoped from the dispositions, 
which have hitherto destroyed everything. Considering them 
selves out of the administration, they have endeavored to 
plunder it in the hope of partaking of its spoils. A coalition 
has in fact been made between opposite parties, in the fear 
lest authority should be strengthened by their mutual opposi 
tion ; and the object of this union seems to be, to place the 
King in the unhappy posture of losing all, or granting all to 
them. No doubt these same persons would desert their con 
stituents, if they could hope to derive any advantage there 
from. 

The step to be taken, then, is simple. It is necessary to 
secure, not the coalition, but the violent, (enrages) because it 
is necessary to have those who cause fear, not those who feel 
it. For this purpose you must give to the chiefs of the Ja- 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 487 

cobins the hope of entering into the administration of affairs. 
You must promise it, and you must keep your word. As 
soon as they are persuaded, that the way is open, they will 
cause the decree of four years to be revoked, and will also 
decree the re-eligibility. These form the grand basis of every 
good operation. You must give these gentlemen places at a 
favorable moment, give them all necessary confidence, always 
keeping the secret. You must displace them likewise at a fa 
vorable moment, always gaming something, in proportion as 
circumstances shall require a greater trust of power in the 
hands of the king. The populace, always inconstant, will not 
hesitate to break the idols of their worship. By preceding 
them a little, you will have the appearance of leading them, 
and by that means you will direct them ; because the weak, 
that is to say, the great majority of mankind, unite themselves 
to those who appear to be the strongest. 



LETTER 

TO THE COUNT DE MONTMORIN, ON THE STATE OF PUBLIC 
AFFAIRS. 

&gt; Translation. 



May 25th, 1791. 

I desire, my dear Count, before leaving Paris, * to say one 
more word to you on the posture of affairs ; and I put you to 
the trouble of reading this letter, rather than to occupy a few 
more minutes of your time in conversation. 

You answered me very well the other day by asking me, 



* Four days after the date of this letter Mr Moms left Paris for 
London. 



488 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

t who then are the persons, who, at the present moment, stand 
well with the people ? If it were as easy as it is difficult to 
reply to your question, it would still remain to be known how 
many days these same persons would preserve the good will of 
the people, or rather of the populace. I do not conceal from 
myself the difficulty, as you perceive. But I beg you, at the 
same time, to attend to another matter, which is very clear. 
You know very well that there are men, and women too, who 
are detested, very unjustly, but still very heartily, and in all 
sincerity. Now it is very possible, that we may not make a 
good choice, but still it will be well to change. When the new 
comers grow unpopular, it will be necessary to change again, 
since the objection will be always against the subalterns, and 
not against the chiefs. 

I am fully persuaded, that if the persons whom you like 
preserve their stations for some months longer, public affairs 
will be re-established. Already it begins to be apparent, that 
anarchy will soon destroy everything, unless some remedy be 
speedily applied. This remedy is the authority of a chief, and 
as everything depends on opinion, some time is necessary to 
make the people feel this great truth. 

In the mean time I earnestly beg you to consider, that the 
Assembly, that the departments, have solicited the removal of 
several persons, that the disorders inseparably connected with 
a depreciated currency will constantly fall on the lower classes 
of society, that thenceforth we shall see arise a sort of division, 
between the partizans of the old and new regime ; perhaps 
between the King and the Assembly ; for it cannot be doubted, 
that each will endeavor to throw the blame on the other. If, 
at this moment, the court finds itself surrounded with those, 
who have drawn upon themselves the unjust hatred of the 
populace, who shall answer for the consequences, particularly 
if France is at the same time threatened from without? You 
know the combinations, which the malevolent have long been 
making, and you will see that the good father Duchene, whom 
I have the honor to present to you, begins already to instruct 
his dear flock in them. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 489 

Adieu. I promise myself the pleasure of seeing you tomor 
row at your coffee-house, and I shall then beg you to return me 
this paper, with two other little pieces which you recollect. 

P. S. It is always necessary to remember, that it is no 
longer a question of liberty; it is simply, who shall be master. 
If I could feel easy, with respect to the fate of the Royal 
Family, I should still be apprehensive for that of France, if 
it is determined, (to make use of a fashionable expression,) 
to change the dynasty. 



NOTE 

COMMUNICATED TO THE COUNT DE MONTMORIN. 

Translation. 



July 30th, 1791. 



Would it not be well, that the King arid Queen should forbid 
every one to speak to them on the subject of the Constitutional 
Charter, and the Ministers from taking any part in it, and that 
this restriction should be known to every one ? The reason to 
be given, is a very simple one. l We would not influence or 
prejudice the question, since it is agitated in a solemn conven 
tion between the nation and its chief. 1 

These are the consequences of such a step. 

The Assembly, in the uncertainty as to what line of conduct 
the King may pursue, will have another motive to grant him 
some authority. Then the persons, who are suspected of 
influencing his conduct and that of the Queen, will be clear of 
the affair, even in public opinion, end that is necessary. 
Finally, his Majesty will preserve the means of acting in the 
sequel with more dignity. It may be, that he will decide to 
accept it, but it is not necessary that this decision should be 



490 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

known. Certainly it is necessary to make some observations 
upon the articles, but not to have the trouble of speaking of 
them before they are decreed. The King will yet have a fair 
opportunity, and it will be possible for him, by wise and noble 
conduct, to regain all he ought to desire. The future will 
present the harvest of the seed which is now sown. 



SPEECH 

COMPOSED FOR THE KING OF FRANCE, WITH SOME OBSER 
VATIONS ON THE CONSTITUTION. 



The first Constitution of France was more than two years 
under deliberation by the National Assembly before it was 
completed; that is, from June seventeenth, 1789, to Septem 
ber third, 1791. Several weeks, however, before it was com 
pleted, it was presumed, that such would be the result, and 
that this Constitution would be accepted by the King. A 
draft of it was already before the public, and it became a 
question with the Ministry, or with certain individuals among 
the King s friends, whether it should be adopted by him, with 
out an expression of his or their sentiments on some of its 
more prominent features. 

It was probably at the suggestion of the Count de Mont- 
morin, that Mr Morris drew up the following SPEECH and 
OBSERVATIONS, intended to be delivered by the King to the 
National Assembly, on the occasion of his taking the oath to 
observe the constitution. This paper was handed to the 
Count de Montmorin on the twenty-seventh of August, and 
returned to Mr Morris again on the eighteenth of October, 
Meantime the King took the oath on the fourteenth of Sep 
tember, without reservation, or any public declaration of his 
views, this course having doubtless been deemed the most 
expedient by his counsellors. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 491 

Gentlemen, 

It is no longer your King who addresses you. L uis the 
Sixteenth is only a private individual. You have just offered 
him the crown, and informed him on what conditions he must 
accept it. 

I assure you, Gentlemen, that if I were a stranger to France, 
I would not mount the slippery steps of the throne. But the 
blood, which flows in my veins, does not permit me to be 
insensible to the fortunes of the French. Descended from a 
long line of Kings, the remembrance of those who are no 
more, the rights of future generations, and my paternal love for 
the people whom Divine Providence has once placed in my 
care, everything, in fine, forbids me to abandon my post. I 
must at least maintain it, so as to secure you from anarchy, and 
from civil war. In this perilous position, I have taken counsel 
only of my own conscience. It is this, which has decided me 
to accept your Constitution. May it ensure the tranquillity of 
the kingdom, and contribute to its prosperity ! 

France, in granting you its entire confidence, has placed 
you in possession of the whole power. You have therefore 
become responsible, before the throne of the Almighty, for the 
happiness of this immense people, whose fortune is in your 
hands. I have been a King. Nothing remains to me now, 
either of authority or of influence. Yet I have a last duty to 
fulfil. It is that of imparting to you my reflections on your 
work. I pray you to hear them with serious attention. 

OBSERVATIONS ON THE CONSTITUTION. 

Previous to any examination of the Constitution, it is proper 
to acknowledge, in the most explicit manner, the eternal maxim 
of reason and justice, that all government ought to be instituted 
and exercised for the benefit of the people. And, parting from 
that principle, we should in any particular society seek that 
form of government, which is best calculated to protect its citi 
zens against foreign invasion, and secure domestic tranquillity, 
with the enjoyment of liberty and property. 



492 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

F You have determined on a hereditary monarchy, and by 
that means you have the certainty, that the chief executive 
magistrate must ever desire the prosperity of France. A King 
of France can have no interest distinct from that of the peo 
ple. Their happiness, their power, and their glory must ne 
cessarily be the source of his. Every other public person may 
have other objects ; but your King can aggrandize himself on 
ly by increasing the wealth and influence of the nation. He 
may be mistaken, and he may be misled, but he cannot be 
bought. It is the misfortune of his situation to see with the 
eye and act with the hands of others ; it is, therefore, evident 
ly his interest, that the representatives of the people should 
watch over his Ministers, and that they should be punished 
for misconduct, whether arising from incapacity or any other 
cause. He cannot but wish also for a strict and regular ad 
ministration of justice, since that is alike necessary to his glory 
and to the national prosperity. 

These are among the advantages of hereditary monarchy. 
Whether you have provided against the evils to which it is 
liable, and secured the good of which it is susceptible, is a 
question deeply interesting to France, and to the human 
race. 

You begin with a declaration of the rights of man, but 
since the instruments of this sort, which have hitherto appear- 
edj have occasioned much metaphysical discussion, it may well 
be supposed, that a King whose occupations require a knowl 
edge of man, such as he exists, and not such as he may be 
imagined in abstract contemplation, is little fitted to decide on 
the merit of such compositions. There seems, however, to be 
some inconvenience in joining it to a constitution, because if 
the constitution secures those rights, whatever they may be, it 
is unnecessary, and otherwise it is useless ; but there is in 
every case the risk of seeming contradictions. Controversies 
may thence arise, and whoever may be the judge of such con 
troversies, becomes thereby arbiter of the constitution. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 493 

To show that this inconvenience is not imaginary, it will per 
haps suffice to recal to your recollection the first article of your 
declaration, that men are born and exist free and equal in 
rights. You have decided, however, that the representatives 
shall be distributed among the eighty threo departments, ac 
cording to the three proportions of Territory., Population, and 
Direct Taxes. It results, therefore, that a given number of 
men, in one of the departments, will have the rights of electing 
more representatives, than the same number in another depart 
ment. They might then imagine, that they are not equal in 
the very important right of choosing the members of the Legis 
lative body. 

You have also declared, that the law is the expression oj 
the general will; that all citizens have the right of concurring 
personally, or by their representatives, in its formation ; and 
that, all citizens, being equal in the eye of the law, are equally 
admissible to all dignities, places, and public employments, 
without other distinction than that of virtues and talents. 
On the other hand you have established, * that to be an effec 
tive citizen, it is requisite to pay, in some part of the Kingdom, 
a direct tax, at least equal to the value of three days labor, 
and that no one can be an elector unless he unites with the 
necessary conditions for being an effective citizen, that of pay 
ing a direct tax of days labor. In reconciling 
these various clauses, it may be doubted whether the first is 
to be regarded as an inalienable right, or if, on this hypothesis, 
the second is a just modification of it. 

You have also declared, that for the maintenance of the 
public forces, and for the expenses of the government, a general 
tax is indispensable, and that it ought to be equally distributed 
among all the citizens, according to their ability ; and yet by 
your constitution you delegate exclusively to the legislative 
body the right of imposing public taxes, of determining the 
nature and quality thereof, and the mode of collecting them. 
Now, as many taxes, and particularly those which are called 
indirect, are distributed among the citizens, not according to 
VOL. ii. 42 



494 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 

their ability, but according to what they consume, and even to 
their most urgent necessities, it may happen, that your decla 
ration may become, in regard to imposts for a part of the citi 
zens, the ground of a serious complaint. 

Without farther considering the collateral circumstances, it 
is proper now to examine the organization and the distribution 
of the legislative, executive, and judiciary powers. According 
to the declaration of rights every society wherein the sep 
aration ofpoivers is not determined has no constitution. 1 That 
the separation of powers is of great importance cannot, indeed; 
be denied. It is necessary then to examine, whether you 
have provided for it in such a manner, that no one of them 
can encroach in the others. Commencing with the LEG 
ISLATIVE POWER, you have decreed as follows; 

4 ART. I. The National Assembly, forming the Legislative 
body, is permanent, and is composed of only one chamber. In 
case of the King s refusing his assent to the decrees of the Leg 
islative body, this refusal is only suspensive, and when the two 
legislatures, succeeding that which shall have presented the de 
cree, shall have successively presented the same decree in the 
same terms, the King shall be considered to have given it his 
sanction. 

ART. II. The Legislative body cannot be dissolved by the 
King. The representatives of the nation are inviolable. They 
can for a criminal deed be arrested in the act, or by virtue of 
an order of arrest, but notice shall be given thereof without de 
lay to the Legislative body, and the prosecution cannot be 
continued until after the Legislative body shall have decided, 
that there is ground for accusation. 

ART. III. The Legislative body has the right of police in 
the place of its sessions, and in the compass around, which it 
shall have determined upon. It has the right of disposing of 
the forces, which by its own consent are quartered in the ci 
ty, when it shall hold its sessions ; and the Executive power 
cannot introduce, or quarter, any body of troops of the line 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 495 

within the distance of thirty thousand toises from the Legisla 
tive body, except by its requisition or authority. 

&lt; ART. IV. The Constitution delegates exclusively to the 
Legislative body the power of prosecuting before the High 
National Court, the responsibility of the Ministers, and prin 
cipal agents of the Executive power. No Minister in place, or 
out of place, can suffer a criminal prosecution for an act of 
his administration, without a decree of the Legislative body. 

ART. V. Whenever the King shall have pronounced or 
confirmed the suspension of Administrators or Sub-administra 
tors, he shall inform the Legislative body thereof. That body 
can either remove the suspension, or confirm it, or even dis 
solve the culpable administration, and if there be cause send 
all the members of it, or a part of them, to the criminal tribu 
nals, or issue a decree of accusation against them. The tri 
bunals cannot summon the members of an administration be 
fore them for official acts. 

ART. VI. When, after two appeals, the judgment of the 
third tribunal shall be questioned, upon the same grounds as 
the two first, the case cannot be farther acted upon in the tri 
bunal of appeal, (Tribunal de Cassation) without having been 
submitted to the Legislative body, which shall issue a decree 
explanatory of the law, to which the tribunal shall be 
bound to conform. The Minister of Justice shall state to the 
tribunal of appeal, through the medium of the King s Com 
missioner, the acts by which the judges may have exceeded 
the bounds of their power. The tribunal shall annul them, 
and if there is ground for impeachment, notice shall be given 
to the Legislative body, who shall grant the decree of accusa 
tion, and send the accused before the High National Court. 

1 ART. VII. War cannot be decided upon without a decree 
of the Legislative body. It belongs to the Legislative body 
to ratify treaties of peace, of alliance, and of commerce, and 
no treaty can take effect without such ratification. 

By the first article, the whole legislative authority is vested 
in a single chamber of representatives, and consequently the 



496 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

leaders of a majority in that Assembly may dictate such laws 
as they think proper. The King may indeed suspend the de 
crees for a given period, but history furnishes instances of na 
tions, which have for a longer period been under the influence 
of faction, and if France should ever be in that situation, the 
King, by suspending the decrees, would only prolong the dis 
order without avoiding the mischief. A dangerous law may 
be adroitly framed, so as to suit the popular taste, and the re 
jection of it might be represented as a ministerial despotism. 
It is, therefore, to be feared, that if the Assembly should wish 
to encroach on the executive authority, a suspensive veto would 
make but a feeble resistance. The time, for instance, may 
arrive in which a law obliging Ministers to obey such Commit 
tees, as shall be appointed to superintend their respective de 
partments, will be represented as essential to the public safety. 
Rumors of disaffection may be spread abroad, and the people 
be led to suspect the intentions of their King, even though his 
whole life should have been a constant endeavor to procure 
their happiness. It will then give them pleasure to see the 
power taken from him, who is essentially their friend, and be 
stowed on those who have no other object but their private in 
terest. 

On the other hand, what are the evils to be apprehended 
from giving to the first executive magistrate an absolute veto ? 
He cannot, without the consent of the Assembly, extend his 
own authority ; and if that consent be supposed, it is a matter 
of indifference whether his veto be suspensive or absolute. In 
a well ordered society, new laws are seldom necessary, either 
for the purposes of police, or of distributive justice ; and if they 
were, how can we doubt of the King s consent ? The laws 
for imposing taxes, and for the public defence, will naturally 
also receive his assent. It is only, therefore, in the case of an 
attack upon his constitutional authority, that a right of rejec 
tion would be exercised. The knowledge that such right ex- 
is4s would frequently prevent the attempt, in like manner as 
the hope of eventual success, where the rejection is only for a 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 497 

limited time, would frequently invite it. In the one case, peace 
and order may be expected ; in the other, turbulence and tu 
mult. 

By the second article it is provided, that the Assembly shall 
exist, and the persons of the members be held sacred, so long 
as a majority may think proper. If, therefore, such majority 
should harbor dangerous designs, there seems to be no means 
of terminating their session, nor of punishing the guilty, but by 
general insurrection, or civil war. It is of the nature of ab 
solute power to corrupt the heart, and if there be temptation 
and indemnity, guilt may ensue. Should a faction be hired 
by our enemies to sacrifice the national interest and honor, to 
withhold the needful means of defending the State, or of sup 
porting its credit, the King has no constitutional method of 
appealing to the people, neither can any tribunal punish the 
traitors, without the consent of their accomplices. History in 
forms us, that, both in ancient and modern times, the leaders 
of popular Assemblies have been bought by foreign powers, 
and that thus nations unconquerable by arms, have become 
the victims of seduction. 

By the third article it is provided, that the Assembly shall 
command such number of troops at the place of their sessions, 
as they think proper ; consequently, they may possess them 
selves of the means at once to awe the people, and imprison 
the King. His person will be in their hands ; his life at their 
disposal ; and though he may have the courage to disregard 
his own life, yet his wife, his children, the dearest objects of 
his heart, remain also in their power. If, then, some future 
Assembly should be desirous of changing the form of govern 
ment, and of assuming greater powers than those, which you 
have thought proper to delegate, it seems that neither of the 
other departments, nor even the people themselves, have any 
means of resistance. 

By the fourth article, the Ministers and other agents of the 
executive authority are exposed to criminal prosecution by 
the Assembly, and secured against such prosecution from eve- 
42* 



498 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

ry other quarter. Therefore, should the Assembly incline to 
make encroachments, the Ministers in opposing them would 
have much to fear, but by submission would be sure of in 
demnity. 

By the fifth article, the authority of the King over those 
charged with the administration is rendered subordinate to that 
of the -Assembly. He is, as it were, the public accuser. The 
Legislative hodyis authorised to judge their conduct, and con 
sequently to judge his. Administrators protected by the leadersof 
the Assembly, if such should ever exist, may not only disregard 
his orders, but even dictate to him the conduct he shall pursue. 
If the taxes should be either burthensorne or disagreeable to 
several departments, and the administration prove remiss in 
collecting them, the executive power is in the sad necessity of 
seeing the public interest sacrificed by their neglect, or of ren 
dering itself odious by more vigorous measures. In both cases 
the Ministers will be at the mercy of the Assembly, who may 
accuse them for not having suspended the administration, or, 
by taking off the suspension, degrade the executive authority. 
Under such circumstances of absolute dependence, the Minister, 
although appointed by the King, must obey the orders of those, 
who can influence a majority of the Assembly, and consequent 
ly that part of the executive authority now in question, though 
vested nominally in him, resides really in them. And the ad 
ministrators, certain that they cannot be cited before the tribu 
nals, unless previously accused by the Assembly, will frequent 
ly consider rather how to please those whom they have cause 
to fear, than how to perform their duty to the State. 

By the sixth article, the judiciary power, in the last resort, 
is given to the Assembly ; for a decree declaring what the 
law is in a given case, is only another name for a judgment in 
such case. The Tribunal de Cassation being obliged to con 
form, its subsequent proceedings are merely ministerial, to clothe 
the decree in the form of a sentence, and to cause the execu 
tion. From hence it results, that the people will no longer 
enjoy that security in their property and possessions, to which 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 499 

they are entitled ; for it may happen, that many judgments of the 
Tribunal de Cassation will have been submitted to, before the 
case supposed in the article occurs, and that afterwards the 
Assembly may decree contradictorily to the tribunal, in which 
case the preceding judgments will doubtless be questioned. 
Moreover, as it is not to be supposed that a numerous Assembly 
will consist of persons skilled in legal discussions, it may hap 
pen that their explanatory decrees will effect the whole system 
of jurisprudence. There is reason to fear also, that their de 
cisions may be influenced by the acts of intrigue, or other mo 
tives. The Assembly having reserved to itself the sole right 
of accusing the judges for misconduct, timid or corrupt judges 
will decide in favor of those, who have influence with the 
Assembly, and against the poor and unprotected. 

By the seventh article, the Assembly has reserved to itself 
the rights of war, peace, treaties, so that the King is mere 
ly their agent, with this difference, that (not being previous 
ly instructed) he must act under the uncertainty of being ap 
proved or disavowed. From the changeableness of the rep 
resentatives, the opinion of the Assembly must be unstable. 
Moreover, it is hardly to be expected, that persons taken from 
the ordinary occupations of life, will possess the information 
needful to judge of foreign politics, and its various combina 
tions. The opinions of men, also, depend much on their res 
pective habits and professions. Some, therefore, would sacri 
fice everything to the honor of the nation, some its commerce, 
and some its tranquillity, 

By collecting together in one point of view the various 
powers given to the legislative body, it appears that they have 
the right to make laws and decide in the last resort, both on 
the application and execution of them ; that they have the 
supreme right of war, peace, and treaties ; that they have an 
existence dependent only on their own will, power to protect 
themselves from the pursuit of justice, and the command of 
such force as they may think proper ; of course all power not 
already vested in them is exposed to their assumption. It may 



500 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

indeed be said, that there is no just reason to suppose the rep 
resentatives of a free people will prolong their political exis 
tence, assume extraordinary powers, or become instruments 
of foreign ambition ; but history informs us, that such repre 
sentatives have existed, and therefore they may again exist. 
And since the formation of a constitution and laws presupposes 
human depravity, we must calculate on the effects of those 
passions, which have ever influenced the conduct of man 
kind. 

The next in order is the EXECUTIVE POWER, about which 
you have decreed ; 

ART. I. To the King is delegated the care of watching the 
external safety of the kingdom, to maintain its rights and pos 
sessions. It belongs to the King to conclude and sign with all 
foreign powers, all treaties of peace, of alliance, of commerce, 
and other conventions, which he shall judge necessary to the 
welfare of the State, under the ratification of the Legislative 
body. 

ART. II. The King appoints two thirds of the Rear Ad 
mirals, half of the Lieutenants General, Field Marshalls, Cap 
tains of vessels, and Colonels of household troops ; the third 
of Colonels and Lieutenant Colonels, and the sixth of Lieu 
tenants of vessels. 

1 ART. III. Administrators are agents elected for a period by 
the people, to exercise under the superintendence and author 
ity of the King the administrative duties. The King has the 
right of annulling acts of Administrators of departments, con 
trary to the laws, or to orders issued to them, and can in case 
of obstinate disobedience, or if they compromise by their acts 
the public safety, or tranquillity, suspend them from their 
offices. He shall inform the Legislative body thereof, and 
that body may remove or confirm the suspension. The exe 
cutive power directs and superintends the collection and the 
disposition of the taxes, and gives all necessary orders to that 
effect. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 501 

4 ART. IV. The officers of the National Guards are elected 
for a period, and cannot be re-elected, except after an interval 
of service as soldiers. 

In considering the executive power of a State, it is proper 
to examine the object for which such power is instituted, 
because the means should always be proportioned to the end. 
Now the object is to defend the State, and enforce obedience 
to the laws. To accomplish this, the members of every 
department must be perfectly obedient to the chief, who then, 
and then only, can be responsible for the conduct of affairs. 
It results also from the nature of this authority, and from that 
accountability, which the nation has a right to require, that it 
should be derived from one head, and that in every instance, 
there should be one principal, or superior. For if a Council, 
or Committee, be charged with the whole, or any part of the 
executive department, it may happen, first, that so much time 
will be consumed in deliberations, jhat the business will be 
neglected. Secondly, that their conduct will vacillate accord 
ing to the attendance of the different members. Thirdly, that 
the needful secrecy cannot be preserved, since not only each 
member, but the Secretariec and Clerks also must be privy to 
their decisions, because the will of a Board is expressed only 
by the record of its deliberations. Fourthly, that it will be 
difficult, if not impossible, to render them accountable, since 
each will give plausible reasons for his vote, so that though the 
general conduct be manifestly wrong, no one in particular can 
be convicted. Whereas it is, as has been already noticed, 
essential to the public safety, that Ministers should be punished 
as well for incapacity as for misconduct. 

It has already been noted, also, that perfect obedience is 
necessary from every inferior, but to obtain it, the chief should 
have power to appoint and to remove the subordinate officers. 
In common life this is necessary to every man, who employs 
others either in his own affairs, or in those committed to his 
management. And if this be needful in those small concerns, 



502 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 



where the principal can daily superintend his agents, how- 
much more so for him, who must employ many for various 
purposes, and at considerable distances; for a King, in short, 
whose duty it is to protect the French against foreign invasion, 
arid to maintain their internal tranquillity ; a King, who, in the 
pursuit of their interest, which is one and the same with his 
own, must at every step encounter the opposition of private 
views. 

By applying these evident principles of common sense to 
the four articles just cited, it will appear how far your consti 
tution is calculated to confer on the people of France those 
benefits, of which a hereditary monarchy is susceptible. By 
the first, the right of war, peace, and treaties, is granted to the 
Assembly, and the King must act not only in subordination 
to their will, but also in uncertainty as to what that will may 
be. From hence results the difficulty, if not impracticability, 
of making any treaty at all. Who will enter into stipula 
tions with a Prince, who cannot bind those whom he 
represents ? The communication of powers is a usual pre 
liminary, even to the conversations which precede a treaty. 
Suppose, for instance, that the King, apprehending the aggres 
sion of. several powers allied against France, should endeavor 
to form with other powers a defensive alliance, each of these 
might be obliged to reject his overtures from regard to its own 
safety, because the treaty being made and submitted to, the 
Assembly would, if not approved of, expose it singly to the 
vengeance of the enemies. Similar observations apply to 
treaties of commerce. 

That the nation may be effectually guarded, it may some 
times be necessary to attack, in order to disconcert measures 
otherwise injurious, if not fatal. Without looking abroad, the 
history of France furnishes numerous examples in support of 
this truth. But it is now impracticable, for an application to 
the legislature must disclose the design, and would be consid 
ered also as an aggression, consequently it would have the 
evils of such a measure without the advantages. Besides, al- 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 503 

though a majority of the Assembly might judge the war to be 
necessary, many of that majority might wish to delay it, that 
their particular speculations of commerce or finance might be 
previously arranged ; not to mention the advantages, which a 
foreign Prince might derive from intrigue and corruption. 

Lastly, in the course of a war many leading members of 
the Assembly may have such an interest in the continuation 
of hostilities, as to prevent the restoration of peace, though 
necessary to the kingdom. Thus the King, whose position 
enables him to discover, and whose interest obliges him to 
promote the national advantage, is rendered incapable of act 
ing, or at best subservient to others, some of whom must be 
incapable of judging, and even have an interest opposite to 
that of their country. 

The second article relates to the organization of the mili 
tary force, which, in all governments, is an object of most se 
rious attention. The idea of a society, each member of which 
is a soldier, cannot be applied to modern States ; especially to 
those, whose power is dependent on commerce and the arts. 
If our fields and shops be abandoned by the manufactures and 
husbandmen, famine and poverty must inevitably ensue. A 
part of the society must, therefore, be selected to guard the 
whole. The experience of all ages has proved, that if this 
part which forms the army, be not well disciplined, it will op 
press the kingdom, but cannot defend it. Vain is the attempt 
to supply by numbers the want of order and subordination, 
without which, licentious bands must be alike detested by the 
people, and despised by their foes. The expense of such an 
army will increase in proportion to its inutility, and thus the 
public taxes become a public fraud, seeing that those who con 
tribute have a right to expect from the appropriation of their 
money the greatest benefit which it can produce. 

If. however, with the organization which you have devised, 
it be practicable to establish a strict discipline, it will remain 
for you to consider whether your army may not become a 
dangerous instrument in the hands of its chiefs. If only the 



504 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

superior grades feel a dependence on the King, they may be 
induced to second the views of an ambitious General, and it 
will be easier for them to lead the troops they command 
against their country, if the officers are named by election, or 
seniority, than if they are dependent on the King ; for it is not 
even to be hoped, that an army, which has lost respect for its 
Prince, will long retain it for a popular Assembly. It has 
been complained of as one of the ancient abuses, that the 
command of the troops was given almost exclusively to a 
privileged order. 

It resulted from hence, that, actuated like all others by their 
own interest, they opposed every attempt to change the exist 
ent establishments, so that France preserved a greater decree 
of freedom, than other monarchies ; and if the ancient regime 
had been unexceptionable in other respects, this part would 
have been eminently useful, for it is certainly wise to interest 
the army in supporting the constitution. And it is among the 
advantages of a hereditary monarchy well organized, that 
numerous and disciplined armies may be maintained without 
danger to liberty ; a thing which in Republics has seldom hap 
pened. If ever a design should be formed to subdue France 
by the arms of Frenchmen, the conspirators must wish for of 
ficers without property or connexions, because such men when 
inured to war will readily follow the standard of him, who can 
hold out great hopes and expectations ; whereas, those who 
have property of their own, and whose relatives and connex 
ions share in the administration, will not risk the advantages 
they possess in the great game of revolutions. A resistance, 
similar to that, which has often irritated you, may on other 
occasions, and opposed to other efforts, become an impene 
trable shield to the liberty of France. 

The third article relates to that branch of executive author 
ity, which respects internal affairs. Here it is proper to dis 
tinguish between the different duties of administrative bodies. 
So far as relates to the concerns of a particular department, or 
district, they are certainly useful, and most certainly they 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 505 

should be chosen by the people for short periods. A great 
mass of local knowledge and minute attention will thus be use 
fully employed, and an honest and industrious administration 
be probably obtained. But when the execution of the laws 
the collection of taxes, and the preservation of order, are com 
mitted to such bodies, disappointment may be expected. The 
people in their choice will naturally prefer men of easy tem 
per, and such as are disposed to gratify their wishes. If, 
therefore, riots or insurrections should happen, the administra 
tors will not always act with requisite vigor ; and as they are 
not personally affected, by the penury of the public treasury, 
they will sometimes give way to the solicitations of those, who 
wish to delay their contributions. Being independent of the 
Kins, his Ministers will have but little influence on their con 
duct ; and, of course, cannot be accountable for the conse 
quences. But yet on that conduct everything depends. It 
is not necessary to mention, what all the world knows, that 
unless order can be restored the Constitution must perish ; 
but it is proper to give a glance at the finances. 

The sum of Assignats, which you have decreed, will ere 
long be expended, and if the mass be increased, the credit 
will be diminished, and consequently the value. This re 
source, then, is almost exhausted in every respect. If the 
taxes you have laid be not sufficient, or not seasonably col 
lected, a considerable deficit must ensue, and it must fall eith 
er upon the interior administration, or the public force, or the 
creditors of the State. The interior administration must in all 
cases be supported, since anarchy is the worst of all political 
evils. It will only, therefore, remain to decide between your 
creditors, and your troops. If the payments be again sus 
pended, that last stab to public credit will perhaps prove fatal, 
and a bankruptcy ensue, after the immense sacrifices of every 
kind to avoid it. If, on the contrary, the army be not paid, 
it is easy to see the consequences. 

The public resentment will in either case, perhaps, be di 
rected against the Ministers, and perhaps against the King. 
VOL. ii. 43 



506 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

Such injustice is not uncommon, and might cheerfully be sub 
mitted to could it remove the cause of complaint ; but, on the 
contrary, by increasing the disorder, it will increase the mis 
chief. Let then these important truths be duly considered. 
Where there is no authority, there can be no accountability. 
Where the executive power is feeble, anarchy must ensue, 
and where anarchy long prevails, despotism must succeed ; 
not indeed in the descendants of your ancient Kings, for they 
will probably be the earliest victims. 

On the fourth article no particular observation will be ne 
cessary, but only a general application of those, which have 
been already made. You will on the whole decide for the 
French nation, whether the authority given to the King be 
sufficient to produce that peace and safety to the people, for 
which alone that, or any other power, ought to be instituted. 

Thirdly, of the JUDICIARY. The judiciary power is delega 
ted to judges, elected by the people for a period. 

It is proper to distinguish between inferior and superior judges. 
The former may be appointed for a time, because it will be 
difficult to find proper persons to fill those numerous places; 
but it is to be desired, that the superior judges should hold 
their offices during good behavior, and their salaries also. 
Those, who are charged with the important duties of ad 
ministering justice, should, if possible, depend only on God. 
Their impartiality is of the last importance to every member 
of society, but principally to the most numerous class, who by 
that alone can be shielded from oppression. It seems impor 
tant, also, in every point of view, that they should not be 
named by popular election. 

To make a proper choice of judges, as of other officers, 
those who choose should have not only a competent idea of the 
duty to be performed, and of the talents required, but an in 
terest also in making a good choice. Will this he the case in 
a popular election ? Will not those, who have suits depending, 
endeavor to get such men named, as will best answer their 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 507 

purpose ? Will not the elections be governed in a great de 
gree by intrigue? Must not the opinion of the voters be in 
general formed from the information of others ? Will not the 
rich exert themselves to have such judges chosen, as will be 
instruments of their despotism ? And what instrument so dan 
gerous as an iniquitous judge ! It is yours to decide, wheth 
er this mode gives reasonable ground to hope for proper ap 
pointments ; and you will consider that to the great mass of 
French population, the making of the laws will ever be of 
minor importance, since the needful security of property 
must confine their wealth within the narrow circle of their wants. 
But if, in this confined state, their little all be at the mercy of 
a partial judge, that tranquillity of the soul, which liberty 
should confer, exists not for them, and that which is to others 
a blessing, becomes to them a curse. And when their una 
voidable dependence on the rich, increased by the influence 
of such judges, compels them under the pressure of that 
double weight to re-elect their oppressors, then, humiliated and 
degraded even in their own eyes by the possession of privi 
leges they cannot exercise, they will find themselves en 
slaved by the excess of liberty. 

Such are the observations, which present themselves on the 
partition of powers, which you have adopted. Many less 
matters are not noticed, because it is not intended to criticise 
your work, but to make a last effort for the happiness of the 
French. There is one, however, which compels to a painful 
expression the heart of a father. 

You have decreed, ( that females are excluded from the re 
gency. Alas, in entrusting the charge of the Constitution to 
wives and mothers, was it possible to forget that maternal love 
is the only sentiment, which resists all trials, which occupies 
the heart of a mother until death, and expires only with her 
latest breath. Can a mother betray the interests of her child, 
and are not the interests of this child your own ? 

It remains only to make some remarks, as to the kind of 
government, which our situation and our manners would seem 



508 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

to require. This beautiful country, profusely blest by the mu 
nificence of nature, bears on its bosom the means of exhaust- 
less wealth, and presents in the genius of its people a source 
of infinitely varied enjoyment. Hence she will ever be viewed 
with cupidity by her neighbors, and be exposed to those inte 
rior ills, which wealth cannot fail to produce in the advanced 
stages of society. France has also been the protector of infe 
rior powers, from the epoch of the revolution in Switzerland and 
the Netherlands, to that in which she secured the liberty of 
the new world. She must then have a vigorous internal ad 
ministration to control the vices inseparably attached to pros 
perity ; and, at the same time, she must possess such naval 
and military force, and such constiutional activity and decis 
ion, that she may protect her possessions, succor her allies, 
and repress the audacity of her foes. 

A high toned monarchy seems, therefore, to be designated 
as the only government, which may consist with her physical 
and moral state. And, accordingly, her history, from Charle 
magne to the present hour, proves, that her happiness has al 
ways been proportioned to the vigor of her administration. 
Nature, stronger than man, has preserved the monarchy amid 
the shocks of various revolutions, so that the royalty has re 
mained, though the race of Kings has been changed. 

Admitting, then, the necessity whose existence is proved 
both by reason and experience, it remains to consider by what 
means freedom can be secured against the power, which time 
and circumstances will confer on the King, if that office be not 
abolished in the attempt to establish a government, which 
consists neither with our manners nor with our situation. And 
on this occasion, it is proper to rise above the prejudices of the 
moment, and speak the language of truth to a bewildered 
nation. They will discover in it the paternal love of a King, 
which, founded on principles of religion, is beyond the reach 
of human power, and has resisted the flatteries of a court, and 
the indignities of a gaol. 

Will numerous representatives, chosen for a short period. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 509 

prove a sufficient barrier against royal authority ? Where the 
members are few, the election is more nice, and the competi 
tion of candidates presents a greater choice. Hence the 
individuals, of which such body is composed, will be less liable 
to deception and seduction. The post being more rare, is 
thereby more esteemed and sought after, and at the same time 
more difficult to be obtained or preserved, and hence a greater 
dependence of the representatives upon the people. A body 
not numerous is also more under the dominion of reason, and 
less exposed to the powers of eloquence, and the wanderings 
of enthusiasm. Persons chosen for a short period, may feel 
themselves little interested in supporting the privileges, which 
they must speedily cease to enjoy, and may therefore betray 
their trust for the attainment of more permanent or more lu 
crative situations. That ambition, which prompts a factious 
leader to wrest authority from a weak prince, might render 
him the slave to one of stronger mind, and accordingly we 
learn from history, that the same men have been alternate 
ly the leaders of a faction and the flatterers of a court. 

It seems, therefore, wise to provide for the stability of the 
Constitution, by the unchanging principles of private interest, 
and therefore to oppose against the efforts of a hereditary 
monarch, the resistance of a hereditary Senate, whose mem 
bers should possess great landed property. Let it not be 
imagined, that this would restore abuses justly complained 
of. A patriot King cannot wish to be surrounded by needy 
dependents, who first deceive and then betray him; who 
obtain from his bounty the wealth, which they abuse, and by 
their pernicious art, render even his virtues the scourge of his 
people. But he may, in a just abhorrence of despotism, 
desire an institution, which has ever been considered as its 
most dangerous enemy. 

Such a body, if unchecked by a King on the one hand, and 

by representatives of the people on the other, would doubtless 

be oppressive. It has already been so in France. The 

excess of royal authority has in its turn been also injurious; but 

43* 



510 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

the levity, the injustice, and the disorder of a government, 
merely popular, must be equally subversive of public and 
private happiness. It is by a just combination of the three, 
where each having an absolute veto on the others the particu 
lar interest of neither can prevail, that the general interest of 
the whole society will best be known and pursued, and this 
great nation raised to that station of happiness and glory, which 
nature seems to have intended. 

This form of government has undoubtedly its objections, in 
common with every other; and since human institutions cannot 
but partake of the weakness of man, it is in vain that we 
seek perfection among imperfect beings. In the immense 
range of affairs, the extremes unite in evil. Reason and hap 
piness are found in a just medium. The wise man stops there, 
and he who passes farther is lost. 

You have heard, gentlemen, the observations which it has 
always been my design to offer you, when an occasion should 
present. I have constantly acted with reference to your will, 
because I have made it my duty to consider you the organs 
of the will of the nation, and I have ever recognised in the 
people the right of being governed according to their wishes. 

You require of me, gentlemen, and of every public func 
tionary, an oath never to make any change in your constitu 
tion. I will take this oath ; but I pray you to consider with 
me for a moment the consequences it involves. My obser 
vation is perhaps superficial, and my fears vain ; and the 
hopes of others may be as well founded as they are brilliant. 
But no one of us is infallible ; there is no one but God, who, 
having foreseen all, can have preordained all. It is at least 
possible, that the seeds of evil may be concealed in the con 
stitution, and that nothing but time and circumstances may 
be wanting to cause their development. 

If this happens, as there will ba no means of changing it, 
those to whom the people will have confided their interest 
will have only the sad alternative of violating their oaths on the 
one hand, or their duty on the other. It is also possible, that a 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION 511 

great majority of the nation may one day be opposed to this 
form of judgment, Should we not preserve the right of 
change to this majority? Can we with justice oppose its 
will ? Reflect, gentlemen, on this alternative, and let me 
urge you to continue your session for a time. Let us togeth 
er make trial of your work ; do not bind yourselves not to 
change your decrees ; for no one is too wise to improve him 
self in the school of experience. If, after this trial, the Con 
stitution answers your expectations, you will place it with the 
more confidence in the hands of your successors. If, on the 
contrary, you find parts of it to be feeble, or ill-adjusted, you 
will have it in your power to amend them. 

But if you still persist in your determination to conclude 
your task without delay, at least grant the prayer which I 
make you in behalf of twenty-four millions of Frenchmen, of 
future generations, nay, of the human race. Deign in mercy 
to point out the means, by which the people can express their 
will, without being exposed to the perilous convulsions, which 
we have so lately experienced. 

Whatever may be the result of your deliberations, I repeat 
to yon, gentlemen, that I submit to them unreservedly. Let 
us then banish all suspicion ; it cannot but be injurious to the 
interests of the empire. I give you my confidence, and I de 
mand yours. Let us then labor in concert for the liberty and 
prosperity of the French nation. 

But that this labor may not be suspected, and may meet 
with no opposition, I require of you, gentlemen, that you re 
peal the decree, which prevents me from choosing in the 
National Assembly the agents of the executive power. I 
would have it permitted me to nominate, as Ministers of the 
Constitution, those among you who have shown themselves its 
most zealous partizans. I would have the choice I shall make 
obtain your approbation, so that invested with the full force 
of public opinion, the Ministers may meet no obstacles in the 
execution of your plan. This appears to me the more pro 
per, inasmuch as to the Ministers will appertain the exercise 



512 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

of royal power, and as you may naturally wish, that, in giv 
ing success to your work, they may show in the most striking 
manner how much I have been deceived in my opinion. 1 
hope you will perceive, gentlemen, in the request I make to 
you, an unequivocal proof of the sincerity of my conduct; of 
that sincerity, which the French have a right to expect from 
their King, and which for his own honor a King ought ever to 
exhibit. 



MEMOIR 

WRITTEN FOR THE KING OF FRANCE, RESPECTING THE 
NEW CONSTITUTION. 



On the original manuscript is the following endorsement, in 
the handwriting of Mr Morris; Memoir given to M. de 
Montmorin on the 31st of August, 1791. He gave it to the 
King after the step was taken, which this Memoir was to in 
fluence. The King returned it with a request to have a 
translation. The King took the oath to accept and maintain 
the constitution on the 14th of September. 



In the present posture of affairs what is the King to do ? 

This question is important, and, to decide it properly, three 
things are necessary. First, a retrospect of the past ; secondly, 
an examination of the present ; and thirdly, a rational investi- 
tion of the future. 

It may be said, in general, that few Kings have shown a 
more tender regard for their subjects ; and an eloquent dis 
course might be made, in which some striking incidents of the 
present reign might be placed in a strong light, but this would 
be attended with inconveniences. There is little dignity in 
praising one s self, and still less in begging future favor on the 
score of past kindness. Men in general are not very grateful 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 513 

for benefits bestowed on themselves, and no one thinks himself 
bound, in his own particular, to return good offices performed 
for a whole nation. All agree in considering the good done as 
so much gained, and in looking forward for as much more as 
they can contrive to obtain. A discourse of this sort, there 
fore, would be attended with no profound effect. The fine 
phrases in it would be applauded, and at the next moment the 
speaker might be insulted. Such things have already hap 
pened. 

In reviewing tho past, therefore, we must not seek for occa 
sions or means to make his Majesty applaud himself. Still less 
should he beg the poor pittance of gratitude at the hands of the 
ungrateful. But it is important for him to show that he has 
acted consistently. And yet this should be accomplished in 
such manner, as to produce the effect without appearing to in 
tend it ; because such appearance would place him in the sit 
uation of one, who defends himself before his judges, and a 
King should never forget that he is accountable only to God. 
It is a general fault in his discourses, since the States-General 
were first convened, that too great court is paid to popularity. 
The consequence of such proceeding is, that the monarch pur 
chases momentary favor for his Ministers, at the expense of 
royal authority. The people revere only those who show 
superiority without contempt, and that calm wisdom which 
their breath can neither reach nor ruffle. 

To render a short view of the past in some degree useful, 
it may be proper to show what the King might have done at 
particular periods. For instance, when he determined to con 
voke the States-General, he might have given to the kingdom 
such a Constitution as he pleased ; and if he had chosen a tol 
erable form of government, those who now exclaim against all 
monarchic power, would have raised statues to Louis the Six 
teenth. But, by the manner of convoking the States, some 
questions were left undecided, which necessarily tended to 
create dissension ; and from thence must have resulted, as a 
necessary consequence, one of two things ; either that royal 



514 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 

authority would preserve sufficient force to decide the ques 
tion during the contest, in which case (if that authority was 
exercised) one of the parties would be thrown into opposition, 
so as to obstruct the good intentions of the King ; or else, that 
the royal authority not having sufficient force, one of the par 
ties would overpower the other, in which case a future scene 
of violence must succeed, and suspicions arise tending to mul 
tiply those acts of injustice, which ever attend the steps of a 
predominant faction. These things ought to have been fore 
seen, because in such circumstances they are inevitable, and 
nothing is so vain as the expectation to allay the heats of par 
ty, by sprinkling on them a few soft sentences or pretty 
phrases. 

When the States-General were assembled, the King might 
still, by his speech at the opening, have given them whatever 
form he pleased; and it is the more surprising, that this op 
portunity was neglected, as the many discussions of every kind, 
which had taken place on that subject, ought to have pointed 
out the evil, and led to the best remedy which remained. 
This measure would have been attended, however, with the 
first inconvenience above mentioned. Possibly it was with a 
view to avoid such inconvenience, that it was thought prudent 
to wait until the strength of the parties should be fairly tried, 
and then to join the strongest. But the mischiefs resulting 
from such a line of conduct were self-evident. First, it con 
tains an acknowledgment of weakness, and that, in matters 
dependent on public opinion, always creates the thing which 
it confesses. Secondly, it contains a proof of bad faith, and of 
course precludes the hope of zealous assistance from anybody. 
And thirdly, it must prevent the royal authority from being 
brought into action, until that action should be evidently use 
less ; and consequently the King could not command the par 
ty which he might join, under such auspices, but they would 
command him. Whatever might have been the reason for 
neglecting to organize the States-General on that day, this at 
least is certain, that such neglect showed timidity, and of 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 515 

course invited the danger which it feared, for this also is inev 
itable in matters dependent on opinion. 

The Seance Royale of June 1789 was held too late. The 
force, which might have been crushed before it appeared dan 
gerous, was then too great for the power which attempted to 
oppose it. The subsequent measures showed an ignorance of 
the actual state of things, which, though great, is more pardona 
ble than is now imagined, because an intimate knowledge of 
man. and of the nature of his existence, in the approach towards 
freedom, are necessary to decide on all the energies of human 
character, and on the effects which result from a sudden dis 
play of its powers. But, although the cause of those counsels 
by which his majesty was swayed at that time, may be over 
looked, the consequences can never be forgotten. The As 
sembly acquired thereby the reputation of courage, consisten 
cy, and power, and of course became master of the empire. 

Here commenced a new epoch. Men acquainted with the 
violence of popular assemblies) could not doubt that they 
would arrogate to themselves all power. Resistance was evi 
dently ineffectual, and of course must have the consequence 
of increasing their power, and inflaming their wrath. And 
since an attempt to reject their decrees must, in the nature of 
things, be unsuccessful, it only remained to choose one, of two 
things, either to accept the decrees in silence, or to make suit 
able remarks. Had a clear view been obtained, of those 
events which were unavoidable, the choice would perhaps 
have been different from what it was. These events are, first, 
the assumption of all power by the Assembly, and conse 
quent abuse of it. Secondly, corrupt and unjust conduct on 
their part. Thirdly, the relaxation of order, and of course 
the introduction of anarchy. Lastly, as the necessary result 
of these, a thorough contempt of the Assembly among all 
ranks and degrees of men. 

To provide beforehand the means of profiting by these 
events, such observations should have been delivered on each 
decree, such explanations given of its tendency, and such pre- 



516 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

diction made of its consequences, that when the Assembly 
should have reached that point of disrespect, at which they 
could not but arrive, the simple repetition, in a methodical 
manner, of what had been already said, would convince the 
nation that their King was both wiser and better than their 
representatives. This conviction would naturally lead them to 
restore his authority. A different determination, however, was 
adopted, which had always this inconvenience in it, that when 
his Majesty should find it necessary to reject the whole work 
he had previously adopted in detail, he would not be able to 
preserve that frankness and nobleness of character, which he 
might have done, had he given the reasons for his dissent to 
each part of that work. Still, however, he had it in his power 
to show, when a proper occasion might offer, that he had act 
ed only under the influence of a controlling necessity, and 
been in fact a passive instrument in the hands of the Assembly. 
But his speech to that body in February, 1790, deprived him 
of this last advantage, at least in a considerable degree, and it 
forms at this moment the most disagreeable circumstance in 
the whole of his conduct. 

In the month of June last, the Assembly had approached 
very near to that period which they must reach, and as far as 
it is possible to decide where there is no absolute evidence, the 
chance is, that, by the present day, the royal authority would 
have been considerably exalted on their ruins, if the King had 
not taken the ill-advised step which he did. This step could 
not eventuate well ; for in the supposition that he had reached 
Montmedy, or any other place in the kingdom, he would still 
have been brought back, unless he had sufficient force to pro 
tect himself, and the question as to that point must hav ? e de 
pended upon the event of a civil war. If he had gone out of 
the kingdom, the same situation would have occurred. 

Not .ing, therefore, but the favorable event of a bloody con 
test could reinstate him, and there is every reason to believe 
that the event would have been unfavorable. First, the king 
dom would have been united in opposition, and the conquest 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 517 

of France is, perhaps, beyond the strength of all Europe com 
bined. Secondly, the feebleness of the constitution would 
have been instantly remedied, by general consent, from a gen 
eral conviction of the necessity. Thirdly, the bankruptcy, 
which is now perhaps unavoidable, would have been charged 
to the King, as arising from his flight, and subsequent hostility. 
Fourthly, by confiscations a considerable addition would have 
been obtained to the stock of public lands, so as to alleviate 
the taxes, which by means of the bankruptcy would be less 
heavy than before. And, fifthly, since in the course of the 
contest, discipline must have been established in the army, it 
is more than probable, that foreign powers would have been 
obliged to acknowledge such form of government as the Na 
tional Assembly might have adopted. The best thing, there 
fore, which could have happened, is that which actually did 
happen ; and the proof of what is said above, respecting the 
events which would have taken place if his Majesty had re 
mained quietly at home, exists in the present state of things, 
after he had, by his departure, done so much to increase the 
power of his enemies. 

Being now at the second subject of contemplation, viz. the 
present state of things, it is proper, if possible, to look at 
them with the same calmness, that posterity will enjoy in mak 
ing the same examination. This is one requisite quality in 
the character of a statesman. 

The members of the Assembly begin to feel the inevitable 
consequences, which follow from the want of wisdom and vir 
tue. To gratify the little interest, or pitiful vanity, or base 
fear of the moment, the leaders have urged forward measures 
which they could not but know were pernicious. As to the 
great herd, they must, in every such Assembly, be profound 
ly ignorant of the business they are engaged in; and although 
there is not a petit maitre among them, who would empldy a 
shoemaker that had not long worked at his trade, each has the 
unaccountable pretension to be, without any sort of experi- 
VOL, ii. 44 



518 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

ence, an able legislator and profound politician ; as if it were 
an easier thing to make a constitution than a pair of shoes. 

The great bulk of the people have already signified their 
impatience, that the session of the Assembly has continued so 
long ; and although very few of their acts failed to produce 
applause at the moment, from some quarter or other, there is 
in regard to the whole constitution a solemn silence. The 
parts were fitted to the fashion of the day, and that fashion has 
changed. No man approves. And no man of understanding 
can approve. The rich tremble, and there is throughout all 
ranks a vast anxiety. How will this end, is the general ques 
tion ; and it proves a general conviction that the constitution 
is not the end. 

The paper money, whose depreciation has long been sensi 
ble in the greater circle of commerce, begins now to be felt 
in those smaller concerns which interest the poor. The price 
of bread rises, because the produce of the earth cannot re 
main cheap, while all other articles grow dear. Every day 
the number of those who feel the necessity of providing 
against this evil increases ; and their efforts, by showing more 
clearly its nature and extent, accelerate its progress. Hence 
the inquiry grows general, Where are the blessings promised 
by the revolution ? Why are we not in the enjoyment of 
them ? With whom lies the fault ? Is it with the King ? Is 
it with the Assembly ? Is it with the emigrants ? The nation 
begins to cry out like a sick savage, c I suffer ; what ails me ? 
Who has put the pain in me which I feel ? The next question 
will be, How am I to get it out ? 

The situation of the colonies affects deeply the commercial 
interests of the kingdom, while at the same moment commer 
cial property melts away from the powerful operation of paper 
money. These things give awful notice to the mercantile cit 
ies, that all is not well. The licentious conduct of the army, 
notwithstanding the attempts to conceal it, excites alarm rather 
than indignation ; which is worthy of remark, because it proves 
a general sense of weakness and general apprehension of dan- 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 519 

ger. The situation of the Finances is deplorable, and produces 
also its effect, though not yet in full force. The flattering 
prospect of restoring an equality between the receipts and ex 
penditures vanishes. The absurdity of establishing order in 
this department, by introducing disorder into every other, be 
comes evident ; and it is possible, by tearing away the thin 
veil with which it is at present covered, to make a very deep 
impression. By striking forcibly at the centre, a shock may 
be given at the remotest extremities of the empire ; and as 
the evil is inevitable, the stroke is sure. 

These circumstances mark a moment, in which the public 
mind is open to new impressions ; and it is of vast consequence 
to make such impressions as will tend to produce good, and 
avoid a part of the impending evil. But this leads to the third 
point of consideration. 

A full and complete view of the future course of things 
would generally lead to a wise conduct. But such knowledge 
cannot be obtained by man. All that he can do is to form 
rational conjecture. And for this purpose he must divest him 
self, as much as possible, both of hope and fear. 

It seems to be evident, that the measures taken for securing 
a peaceable and orderly administration of justice and police 
are greatly inadequate. Hence violence and injustice must 
continue to prevail. And as the administration is both expen 
sive and ineffectual, there is in that alone sufficient cause to 
ruin the finances, were they otherwise in good condition. But 
if the administration were most vigorous, still a circulation of 
the immense sum of twelve hundred millions in paper money, 
would inevitably produce disorder. The effects of such mon 
ey are, firsJ, a loss of value as to exterior commerce and 
connexion. Secondly, a similar loss in respect to all manufac 
tures depending in any degree on raw materials of foreign 
growth. Thirdly, from the combined effect of these two losses 
results a loss of value, in regard to other manufactures. 
Fourthly, a rise in the price of the necessaries of life becomes 
at last inevitable, because the husbandman, in exchanging the 



520 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

things he has for those he wants, by the intervention of money, 
must of course raise the price of the one, in proportion to the 
price of the other. 

Besides, it must be remarked, that as the value of paper 
money is dependent on opinion, every event, which affects 
public opinion, must accelerate the progress of depreciation. 
Moreover, the expenses of government arise in a great measure 
from the purchase of different commodities. It follows, therefore, 
that such expense must be increased as the value of the money 
diminishes. And since the same diminution forms a reason 
with every citizen not to sell an object of intrinsic value, until 
the moment when he wants the money, it becomes his interest 
to delay the payment of his taxes to the last moment, so as to 
obtain the highest price for his commodities. Consequently, 
in proportion as the wants of government increase, its means 
must diminish. The increase of the price of every article 
will give to each citizen, who is held to the payment of a fixed 
sum, and whose means of payment are derived from the 
produce of the earth, a balance in money which he will 
perceive to be of little use ; and as he will regret the sale of 
his goods for such money, which grows worse every day, he 
will of course hold back from the market his remaining mer 
chandize. 

On the other hand, all those who are in the receipt of fixed 
sums, being obliged to economize, by reason of the decreased 
value of their income, a great number of persons, whom they 
formerly employed, must remain idle. The heads of manufac 
tories also, who are in the habit of selling on long credit, will at 
each payment suffer considerable loss, and that must incapaci 
tate them from continuing their operations, whereby a number 
of workmen will be thrown out of employ. The cities and 
towns will, from the operation of these causes, be burdened 
with a great number of people, and at the same time strait 
ened in subsistence. Then will arise a cry against those, who 
monopolize grain ; attempts will be made to regulate the price 
of bread, and a train of popular excesses will succeed, all tend 
ing to increase the evil from which they arise. 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 521 

This is the probable state resulting merely from a paper 
currency, but there are other, and abundant sources of evil. 
While the government possesses a sufficiency of this paper, it 
is easy to preserve an appearance of paying the public credit 
ors, although in fact they receive but three quarters of their 
due, but as soon as the paper is all gone abroad, and can be 
brought back only by the effect of taxation, and when that 
effect, dependent at best on a feeble and disjointed administra 
tion, is weakened by the causes already pointed out, it will 
become indispensably necessary to suspend again the pay 
ments, and this will be the more pernicious, as the abundance 
of paper money, and its consequent loss of value, destroy all 
private credit, and thus increase in every way the suffering of 
those who are deprived of their due. This will also affect the 
mercantile credit of the whole kingdom, and thus it is proba 
ble, that about the time when the revolt of the colonies begins 
to be severely felt on the seacoast, the capital will be con 
vulsed by a general bankruptcy. 

Such a state of things would naturally excite commotion in 
the army, whatever might be the state of its discipline ; but 
an army already familiarized to revolt, dissolute, debauched, 
and rapacious, will probably make the people feel, long before 
that period, the direful effects of military oppression. Whe 
ther these various miseries will all arrive, and whether they 
will take place at the same moment, or only in succession, 
cannot be decided with precision, but it seems to be inevita 
ble that, from some or all of these causes, an opportunity will 
present itself, in which the King will be able to act as he plea 
ses, if he shall be possessed of the public confidence. But if 
he does not possess it, he may be the victim of follies, which 
others have committed. 

Here then recurs again the question ; What is the King to 
do? And with it, a partial answer offers. Let him take such 
steps now, as will obtain and secure the public confidence 
hereafter. But how ? Shall he reject the constitution ? No ; 
for then he would be charged with all the future evils, as 
44* 



522 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

resulting from that rejection. Shall he then accept it in the 
same silence, with which he has received the different parts ? 
No ; for then it will be impossible to convince the world, that 
he acts with good faith, because he has already declared his 
conviction, though in general terms, that the constitution is 
bad. Shall -he then acknowledge that he has been deceived, 
and finds it now to be a good constitution ? No ; for this 
would be false, and, therefore, in all cases unjustifiable. Be 
sides, it would make him in some sort responsible for events, 
which he ought in all cases to avoid. Shall he then repeat, in 
general terms, that he finds the constitution bad, but yet ac 
cepts and swears to maintain it ? No ; for this will involve an 
appearance of falsehood, meanness, and contradiction. What 
then shall he do ? 

Circumstances seem to point out his conduct with a deci 
sive force. He ought to accept, assigning as a reason there 
for, the mischiefs which would inevitably follow from his re 
fusal ; and he should remark at the same time, that the omnip 
otence of the Assembly, and the deserted state to which he 
is reduced, leave him no alternative. He may even infer, 
from a modest doubt of his own judgment, and the decided ad 
herence of the nation to the Assembly, that it is his duty to 
submit to the public will so strongly pronounced. This idea, 
contrasted with their self-sufficiency, will, at a future period, 
when his opinions are justified by events, work strongly in his 
favor. 

On the constitution itself he is bound, by the strongest ties 
of duty and interest, to make clear and pointed observations. 
It is a duty to himself, because he will thereby justify his de 
parture in June last, though he had in February, 1790, de 
clared his antecedent adherence ; for he will be able to show, 
that the constitution is so bad, that he ought not to adopt it, 
unless in the last necessity. It is a duty to his subjects, be 
cause it must occasion their misery, and therefore he ought to 
show, that such is the unavoidable consequence of a form of 
civil polity so crude and monstrous \ and, indeed, all his obser- 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 523 

vations should be raised on that single basis, for which 
purpose he should introduce them, by declaring that the gov 
ernment ought to be calculated merely for the benefit of the 
people. Lastly, it is a duty to God. It is to his high Tribu 
nal, that the monarchs of the earth must render a solemn 
account of their conduct ; and he requires of them, that it be 
regulated by the principles of truth and justice, which alone 
endure forever, and which forever establish the peace and 
prosperity of empires. 

His Majesty s observations should be powerful, clear, and 
convincing. A weak blow recoils, but a strong one penetrates. 
The present is a decisive moment in his fate. He must con 
quer or perish. If he does not mark his disapprobation, he is 
disgraced; and if he shows it faintly and weakly, he is ruined. 
Every kind of intrigue will doubtless be set on foot to induce 
him to be sparing in his censure. The reason is clear. The 
friends of the several members of the Assembly fear their dis 
grace ; and they know, that, if they can avoid the stroke of 
the moment, time and circumstances will enable them to re 
cover their influence. Already they agree in blaming the con 
stitution in general terms, but if you descend to particulars, each 
will defend the most blameable parts, and censure only some 
light and trivial things, which he happened to oppose. Each 
one, therefore, labors to obtain the royal sanction to his par 
ticular opinions, and the only reward which the King and his 
counsellors will obtain from their generosity, will, as hereto 
fore, be a momentary applause bestowed on the composition 
of his speech, and in the next half hour, pointed ridicule for 
being the dupes to superior address. 

It must be remembered, that the Assembly will soon be dis 
solved, and nobody will then be accountable for their miscon 
duct, even at the bar of public opinion. But the King re 
mains ; and unless human nature is greatly changed, he has no 
method of acquiring the favor of the next Assembly so certain, 
as that of blaming the present, because by this means he pro 
vides for them an excuse beforehand, for the evils which 



524 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

must arise under their administration. And he ought also to 
provide beforehand against the attempts, which they may make 
to destroy his authority. Above all things, it is important for 
him, that when any misfortune arises, the people may say, this 
is what our King has warned us of, not in vague and indefi 
nite terms, but clearly and pointedly. Happy would it have 
been for us, had we put our trust in him, instead of an Assem 
bly, which has plundered him and ruined us. It is proper also 
for his Majesty, after pointing out, in the most forcible manner 
which the needful brevity will admit of, the manifold vices of 
the constitution, to state the general outlines of a better, and 
that in such way as to secure the support of men of wealth and 
influence. By this means he will obtain the suffrage of the 
enlightened part of Europe, and that will have great weight 
with the vanity of this nation. 

In the course of the events which follow, should he pursue 
the steps now pointed out, a favorable opportunity will offer 
to effect the great good of the nation, although it is impossible 
exactly to show that opportunity now, with all its incidental 
circumstances, each of which will not fail to influence the con 
duct of the moment. But if he shall have conciliated the 
good opinion of the nation, which can alone be secured by the 
general persuasion of his wisdom and virtue, many things now 
deemed impossible will then appear easy, 

A number of little accessory measures are purposely omitted 
in this place, but one great means is to require the abolition of 
the decree, prohibiting a choice of Ministers among the mem 
bers of the Assembly; and in all cases to choose Ministers re 
markable for their attachment to the constitution. And should 
the next Assembly find it necessary, as they certainly will, to 
invade that constitution, he ought to exercise his veto, assigning 
as a reason that he will not violate his oath. At length, when 
the various evils shall be so accumulated, that the business can 
no longer go on, it is not impossible that the Assembly, ac 
knowledging their own incapacity as arising from the state in 
which they are now placed, may themselves confer a dicta 
torial power on the King. 



THE TRENCH REVOLUTION. 

If nothing of this sort should happen, a moment may arrive, 
in which the King may proclaim a new constitution, and call on 
the people to proceed to the elections under it, if they approve ; 
and should the day of election be near at hand, and the time for 
deliberation short, (a thing which necessity would justify,) the 
example of Paris in electing would be followed throughout the 
kingdom, and a change be thereby effected. The conduct of 
Paris might be influenced by a single circumstance, viz. a sus 
pension of the payments, and a view of restoring the public 
credit by a more vigorous government. Various other modes 
of changing the constitution might be mentioned, but as has 
already been observed, the proper measures to be pursued 
must be pointed out by the circumstances of the moment. All, 
which man can properly do, is to fix his object, and then stead 
ily pursue it, in consistence with the everlasting rules of justice, 
and according to the situation in which he is placed. 



LETTER 

TO COUNT DE MONTMOR1N, ON PROVIDING SUBSISTENCE FOR 

PARIS. 

Translation. 



September 21st, 1791. 

It appears to me very evident, M. le Comte, that next 
spring there will be a want of bread in Paris, if, indeed, famine 
should not be experienced before that time, either by the 
scarcity of grain, or the abundance of Assignats. Would it 
not then be well to take the proper measures now to secure a 
supply of flour? For the sum of three millions you might im 
port from America to Paris, all charges included, about twelve 
million pounds of flour, which would enable you to make a dai- 



526 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

ly distribution of two hundred thousand pounds of bread, during 
the space of two months. 

You should not conceal from yourself, that when famine 
makes its appearance, it will no longer be possible to control 
the people, and you have already seen to what excesses they 
may be carried. It is, therefore; of the utmost importance, 
that the King should procure the means of taking advantage 
of a circumstance, which might be dangerous to him, if not 
prepared for beforehand. I think it would be well to give the 
bread to the poor, and let the price advance to others, as far 
as it will. 

Here, in a few words, is the mode of operation. Let the 
King fix upon any sum whatever, which shall be deposited at 
London, in the hands of persons whom I will point out. Then 
I will give orders to have the amount invested in flour, to have 
it shipped to Falmouth, and there wait ulterior orders. This 
flour will begin to arrive four or five months hence, and, if then 
wanted at Paris, it can be shipped to Havre; but if, on the oth 
er hand, and contrary to all expectation, there should be an 
abundance in Paris, then it shall be sent to the markets, which 
offer the best opening in Europe, and in that case it is to be 
believed that it will sell without loss. 

It may happen, that the next legislature may decide on 
making retrenchments, and, among other things, may wish to 
do so in the civil list ; but they will not dare to touch it, when 
they know that the King has made such use of it as is propos 
ed. In fine, the object which I suggest to you is a great af 
fair of state, and not of money or of commerce. I do not wish 
to gain anything by it, nor shall I gain anything. I have no 
other desire, than that of being useful to persons whose mis 
fortunes I respect.

LETTER 

TO THE KING OF FRANCE. 

Translation. 



Paris, September 24th, 1791. 



Sire, 

I had the honor to present to your Majesty yesterday, 
through Monsieur de Montmorin, a translation of the memoir, 
which I had sent to him the last of August. This memoir 
was made before your Majesty had decided what part to take. 
It contains, therefore, some rather strong expressions. I have 
thought it my duty, however, not to change anything in it, 
for if I sometimes appear harsh, 1 am always sincere. 

You will find annexed hereto, Sire, a note entrusted, on the 
twenty-sixth of January, 1790, to a person, who was to deliv 
er it into the hands of the Queen. * I know not whether her 
Majesty received it, but I submit it to you now, to show that 
I have always been desirous of being useful to you, and also 
that my predictions were rot made after the results. 

I have this day written a letter to Monsieur de Montmorin, 
upon the supplying of Paris with provisions, to which I beg 
your Majesty s attention. It is by the people of this city, 
that both the revolution and the constitution have been made. 
They will always control everything, while the National As 
semblies hold their sessions here, at least until your Majesty 
can resume your authority. It costs too much to buy the dep 
uties, and serves no purpose, since they are only instruments 
in the hands of the people. Besides, they have too little sta 
bility, and even fidelity, to be worth the trouble of buying 
them. If your Majesty should succeed in getting even three 
quarters of them, they would not dare to do anything against 



* See this note above, p. 472. 



528 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 

the will of the populace, and it is much easier to secure the 
populace. 

On another occasion, I had the honor of remarking to your 
Majesty, that Men are governed only by force or by opinion, 
and even that force depends only upon opinion. Thus the 
only difference between absolute and moderate governments, 
is an opinion more or less general. In an absolute govern 
ment, everything depends upon the army, and in the other, 
on the mass of good citizens, who are called the people. 
When there is no longer a government, there is no longer a 
people. It is then the populace that governs, because it is 
that, which, having nothing to lose, hopes to gain everything, 
and which, thus becoming the only active force, alone inspires 
terror. Many modes present themselves of securing not on 
ly the populace, but the people also. I confine myself at this 
moment to that of giving them bread, and that in a manner 
to show not only the goodness, but also the wisdom and fore 
sight of your Majesty. Then your favors will convey to 
them the idea both of munificence and of grandeur, and this 
last has a powerful effect upon the French nation. It rarely 
thinks of the good, but is always in extacies with the beau 
tiful. 

At all events, Sire, I must insist, for your Majesty s interest, 
upon the most profound secrecy, because if it were known, that 
your Majesty had this object in view, it would be declared, 
that it was to corrupt the people ; but when want shall ap 
pear, every one will be persuaded that it was to help them. 
Then the wickedness of your enemies, instead of being dan 
gerous, will be only contemptible. On the other hand, if 
your Majesty does not see fit to countenance the affair, it will 
be expedient to appear to know nothing about it, because 
the people always suppose, that, if the evil is foreseen, it may 
be avoided.

DRAFT 

OF A MANIFESTO TO BE MADE BY THE KING OF IRANCE, 
LATE MONSIEUR. 

Translation. 



This Paper was written in July, 1795, and consequently a 
few weeks after the death of the young Dauphin, called Louis 
the Seventeeth. On this event, Monsieur, eldest brother of 
Louis the Sixteenth, assumed the title of King, under the name 
of Louis the Eighteenth. At whose request this MANIFESTO 
was drawn up, or with what particular design, there is no means 
of determining by any written explanation discovered among 
Mr Morris s papers. He was at this time in England. 



A melancholy event calls us to the throne of our ancestors, 
and the unhappy state of the kingdom appears to us to demand 
the public declaration of our sentiments. 

Throughout the long struggle of the factions, which have 
distracted France, we have everywhere seen errors and faults. 
We have already forgotten them, and we invite all our sub 
jects to the same forgetfulness, that they may mutually forgive 
their mutual injuries. 

We invite you, Frenchmen, to co-operate with us for the 
safety of our country. Let us congratulate ourselves upon the 
splendid courage, which has caused France to be respected, 
notwithstanding the crimes of those, who had usurped the 
control ; and that the union of all Frenchmen gives us at 
length the happy assurance, that this courage will no longer be 
displayed under the standard of despotism. Behold the space, 
which you have traversed in passing from misfortune to mis 
fortune, and contrast your former condition with your present 
state. For the last six years nothing has been done, but to 
propose new systems of government, in the vain hope of 
obtaining that happiness, which has been left far behind. Its 
VOL. ii. 45

semblance has been pursued, only to embrace its shadow. An 
attempt to re-establish credit has ended in bankruptcy. Pur 
suing liberty, we have found slavery. We flattered ourselves 
with the expectation of abundance, and are plunged into want. 
We sought to correct abuses, and, alas, nothing but abuses 
remain. 

Ts there in fact a single man, who can show a legitimate com 
mission from the French people to exercise any authority 
whatever ? And yet it is in the name of the people, that 
France is oppressed. Let. us unite, then, to put an end to this 
long and ruinous abuse. The King acknowledges for good 
and loyal Frenchmen, only those, who are willing to co-operate 
for the happiness of the kingdom, and knows no enemies 
except those who oppose it, except those who seek to prolong 
anarchy under whatsoever name, those, finally, who seek to 
overreach their fellow citizen. 

The wishes of the nation are known to us, notwithstanding 
the endeavors which have been made to stifle its voice, and 
already have Frenchmen from all parts expressed to us their 
wishes for the re-establishment of Monarchy, the only means 
of restoring order and plenty. We accomplish their desires 
by investing ourself with the authority, which belongs to our 
birth, and we display the standard of France, under which may 
rally all those who wish to enjoy peace, tranquillity, and 
liberty ; that true and real liberty, which consists in protection 
extended to citizens by wise laws, vigorously executed, not 
that ideal, metaphysical liberty, which has caused the blood of 
Frenchmen to flow under the axe of tyrants, which has filled 
the prisons with innocent victims, which, under the sanction of 
law, has massacred whole families, which has carried fire and 
sword into its peaceable provinces, and whose savage fury 
spared not even new born infants. Such is the result of opin 
ions, whose supporters even are now compelled to proclaim 
their absurdity ; such are the consequences of an imaginary 
equality, which has covered with mourning countries formerly 
(he most happy. Return then, Frenchmen, to true principles ; 



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 531 

return to your former character, to your former enjoyments. 
Let your King at length console himself for all his troubles, by 
the happiness of his people, and by concerting with them 
measures to make it permanent. 

There are criminals, whose crimes are so enormous, that 
the interest of nations requires their punishment, but the heart 
of the King recoils from vengeance, and he desires conciliation 
rather than punishment. . * 

In accordance with his paternal feelings, and in order to 
prevent premature commotions, the King forbids each and all 
to declare themselves openly in his favor, until the moment 
shall arrive when this declaration can be made without too 
great hazard. He also forbids this to those, who are in the 
army, and who, if their sentiments were suspected, would in 
fallibly be removed from the places -where there zeal will be 
most useful. 

It is possible that those, who have gained possession of the 
superior power, may still wish to control the national will ; 
that they may oppose us with troops ; and that, like our ances 
tor, Henry the Fourth, of glorious memory, we may be obliged 
to fight, to break the yoke under which France has so long 
groaned. Perhaps these sanguinary chiefs may wish to deliv 
er to severe punishments those Frenchmen, who shall take 
up arms to defend the people and the King. It will be one 
of the greatest misfortunes, should retaliation he necessary to 
repress such barbarity, but we will perform all our duty. This 
is our solemn pledge, and whatever be the lot, which attends 
us, never, either in misfortune or prosperity, will we depart 
from the engagements, which we have thus assumed.
