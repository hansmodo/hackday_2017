Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The last letter which I had the pleasure of receiving from 
you was of the tenth of August ; it was only the beginning of a 
letter, which some company coming in obliged you to cut short. 
I was in hopes you would have sent me the continuation of it ; 
for I have great pleasure in receiving your sentiments on the 
persons and things which are here before me. Although my 
opinion of them is not always the same with yours, still you 
have great authorities and much experience in your favor, and 
besides support what you say with so much ingenuity and eloquence, as must always instruct and please, and often convince ; 
and this you know is of all things the most difficult, as every 
one seems to consider his opinion as a property which is the 
last he will relinquish. 
</p><p>
The present feature of affairs here is such, as confirms your 
friends in the opinion they had conceived of your judgment in 
such matters. I see often some of them, who say you not only 
predicted what was to happen, but how ; they wish to consult 
you now, that you might tell them when the bankruptcy will 
arrive, and whether there will be a civil war, and what will be 
the event of it. There is no danger in talking of you in this 
manner as you are not here, but if you were within the jurisdiction of the Comite des Recherches, I should be afraid of 
their making you a nocturnal visit. These visits have lately 
become fashionable ; one of the most remarkable is one which 
has just taken place. A washerman found a letter in the dirty 
pockets of one of his fair customers, which had the appearance to 
him, as he did not know how to read, of a counter-revolution ; 
by means of the district this came to the knowledge of the 
Comite des Recherches. The lady in question was called be 
fore them late at night, and underwent an interrogatory of some 
hours. Her papers were examined, but nothing found. The 
Comite des Recherches made their report to the Assembly, in 
formed them, as a proof of their vigilance and zeal, that 
they had passed the whole night without sleeping, were applauded by the Assembly, and the female was ordered not to 
leave Paris. And all this is considered as the sure and certain road to the establishment of a free government, and 
particularly to the securing of personal liberty. 
</p><p>
There is a plan for paper money now before the Assembly. 
The Assembly is divided in their opinion, and so are the commercial towns ; but the people who fill the galleries, and who surround 
the Assembly-house often in crowds, seem to be unanimous in 
favor of it. Mirabeau undertakes to prove that it is not paper 
money. It is true that it is a paper, which you may force your 
creditor to receive, and which is to have all the legal proper 
ties of money, but still he swears and so do many others, that it 
is not paper money, because it has land for its pledge. Some 
insist on calling it papier-terre, and the idea was near passing. 
It has been lately decided, that the final vote shall not be taken 
on it before the 17th. My opinion is, that should the two mill 
ions which they talk of be issued, for the purpose of immediately paying off the dette exigible, a great part of it, instead of 
being thus applied, will be diverted to the daily exigencies of 
government, and for which it seems evident a sufficient quantity of taxes will not be collected. You will readily believe, that 
a government like this will not adopt the harsh business of forcing taxes, so long as they can make use of that gentle means 
of striking paper to satisfy their demands. This argument, 
however, has no force with the members of the Assembly ; they 
all advocate or oppose the system on other principles ; the 
objection of so great an emission, changing the proportion 
of prices of all articles of commerce, seems not lo have its full 
weight, though it is used by some. So much is written 
and said for and against this system, that it is impossible to 
discover what will be the decision. I think, however, that if 
the vote of the Assembly should be taken independent of any 
external influence, it would be rejected. 
</p><p>
An opinion begins now to prevail here, that the Assembly 
are not very desirous of putting an end to their session. You 
know they have determined that their powers continue until 
the constitution is finished. You know also, that they are 
inviolable for criminal matters, though not for debts (by their 
decrees.) You know that they concentre in their hands 
all the powers of government and exercise them daily. To 
an impartial person this certainly presents the idea of a very 
aristocratical and tyrannical body. It is observable that public 
inquiry begins to examine more attentively the nature of their 
powers; so that if they make no further progress in the constitution, than they have done for some time, it would not be at 
all surprising if public opinion should soon be as much against, 
as it has been for them. 
</p><p>
You will have heard of M. Necker's retreat from the helm. 
It produced no effect either on the public mind or public 
funds. The Assembly received intelligence yesterday of his 
being stopped on his way to Switzerland by a municipality, 
although he had a passport from the King and from the mayor of 
Paris. He and the municipality both wrote to the Assembly ; 
he, to inform them of his being stopped and to desire a per 
mission to continue his route ; the municipality, to inform 
them that as they had determined that ministers should be responsible, and as M. Necker's passport authorised his quitting 
the kingdom, which would destroy the responsibility, they had 
thought proper to stop him. The Assembly have directed 
their President to write to the municipality to give him his 
liberty. Some members were for voting their thanks to the municipality. 
</p><p>
We have intelligence here from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> as late as the 
20th of July. You have probably later. You will have been 
informed of the removal of Congress. Would it not have 
been as well to have remained the ten years at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, 
where they were well settled ? I have seen the bill passed 
by the Senate for a foreign loan, and for assuming a certain 
sum of state debt. I am not acquainted with the resources 
which Congress have in view, but I should fear those of which 
we know as yet would not be sufficient to fulfil the engagements taken, and I fear still more that a failure of an engagement taken by Congress at present will have a bad effect on 
future engagements. Still I have much confidence in their 
wisdom, and suppose they have a certainty of calling to their 
aid new resources. Their designs as to foreign appointments 
are enveloped in as much secrecy, as those of Mr Pitt's 
armaments. I suppose a very short time will give us some certain information on this subject, or at least some data to rea 
son on. They talk of two ministers and two Charges des Affaires. The salary of the former remains the same ; the 
latter they have augmented fifty per cent. The proportion is 
certainly not well preserved, agreeably to the ideas of the 
courts of Europe. I will thank you, if you have any farther 
or later information of the proceedings of Congress, to inform 
me of them. Be assured of the sentiments of attachment 
with which I am yours, &c.
