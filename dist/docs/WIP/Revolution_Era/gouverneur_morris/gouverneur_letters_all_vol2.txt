Sir, 
</p><p>
I received from Major Hosgiil, who arrived here on the twenty first instant, the two letters which you did me the honor to 
write upon the thirteenth of October. I shall, in consequence, 
set off for London as soon as I possibly can. When last in 
thai city, I saw the Duke of Leeds twice at the French Ambassador s, and from some slight circumstances was induced to 
believe, that the British court are better disposed towards a connexion with the United States, than they were some eighteen 
months ago. The principal difficulty will, I imagine, arise from 
the personal character of the King, which is that of perseverance, and from the personal dislike, which he bears to his for 
mer subjects. I have the honor to be, &tc.

Mr Morris had the honor to wait upon his Grace, the Duke 
of Leeds, this morning, but had not that of seeing him. He 
presents his most respectful compliments, and will be happy to 
know the time when it will be most convenient for his Grace to 
receive certain communications, which Mr Morris is directed 
to make to his Majesty's ministers, by the President of the United States of America.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I arrived in this city on Saturday evening, the twenty-seventh of March, and called the next morning on the Duke of Leeds, minister of foreign affairs. He was not at home ; 
I therefore wrote to him a note, a copy whereof is enclosed, as 
also his answer received that evening. On Monday, the 
twenty-ninth, I waited upon him at Whitehall, and after the 
usual compliments presented your letter, telling him that it 
would explain the nature of my business. Having read it, he 
said with much warmth and gladness in his appearance, I am 
very happy, Mr Morris, to see this letter, and under the President's own hand. I assure you it is very much my wish to 
cultivate a friendly and commercial intercourse between the 
two countries ; and more, I can answer for that of his Majesty's 
servants, that they are of the same opinion. I am happy, my 
Lord, to find that such sentiments prevail, for we are too near 
neighbors not to be either good friends or dangerous enemies. 
You are perfectly right, sir ; and certainly it is to be desired 
as well for our mutual interests, as for the peace and happiness 
of mankind, that we should be upon the best footing. 
</p><p>
I assured him of our sincere disposition to be upon good 
terms, and then proceeded to mention those points in the 
treaty of peace, which remained to be performed ; and first, I 
observed that, by the Constitution of the United States, which 
he had certainly read, all obstacles to the recovery of British 
debts are removed, and that if any doubts could have remained, 
they are now done away by the organization of a federal court, 
which has cognizance of causes arising under the treaty. 
He said he was happy to receive this information ; that he had 
been of opinion, and had written to Mr Adams, that the articles 
ought to be performed in the order in which they stood in the 
treaty. Not choosing to enter into any discussion of his 
conduct in relation to Mr Adams, I told his Grace that I had 
one rule or principle for public and private life, in conformity 
to which I had always entertained the idea, that it would consist most with the dignity of the United States, first, to perform 
all their stipulations, and then to require such performance 
from others ; and that in effect, if each party were on mutual 
covenants to suspend its compliance, expecting that of the 
other, all treaties would be illusory. He agreed in this sentiment. Upon which I added, that the United States had now 
placed themselves in the situation just mentioned. 
</p><p>
And here I took occasion to observe that the Southern States, which had been much blamed in this country for obstructing 
the recovery of British debts, were not liable to all the severity of censure, which had been thrown upon them. That their 
negroes having been taken or seduced away, and the payment for those negroes having been stipulated by treaty, they had 
formed a reliance on such payment for the discharge of debts contracted with British merchants, both previously and subsequently to the war. That the suspension of this resource had 
occasioned a deficiency of means, so that their conduct had been dictated by an overruling necessity. 
</p><p>
Returning then to the main business, I observed that as we 
had now fully performed our part, it was proper to mention that 
two articles remained to be fulfilled by them, viz. that which 
related to the posts, and that regarding a compensation for the 
negroes ; unless indeed they had sent out orders respecting 
the former, subsequent to the writing of your letter ; and I took 
the liberty to consider that as a very probable circumstance, 
He now became a little embarrassed, and told me that he 
could not exactly say how that matter stood. That as to the 
affair of the negroes, he had long wished to have it brought up, 
and to have something done, but something or other had always 
interfered. He then changed the conversation ; but I brought 
it back, and he changed it again. Hence it was apparent that 
he could go no farther than general professions and assurances. 
</p><p>
I then told him that there was a little circumstance, which 
had operated very disagreeably upon the feelings of America. 
Here he interrupted me.  I know what you are going to say 
our not sending a minister I wished to send you one, but 
then I wished to have a man every way equal to the task, a 
man of abilities, and one agreeable to the people of America ; 
but it was difficult. It is a great way off, and many object on 
that score. I expressed my persuasion, that this country 
could not want men well qualified for every office .5 and he 
</p><p>
again changed the conversation. Wherefore, as it was not 
worth while to discuss the winds and the weather, I observed 
that lie might probably choose to consider the matter a little, 
and to read again the treaty, and compare it with the Ameri 
can Constitution. He said that he should, and wished me to 
leave your letter, which he would have copied, and return it to 
me. I did so, telling him that I should be very glad to have 
a speedy answer, and he promised that I should. 
</p><p>
Thus, sir, this matter was begun ; but nine days have since 
elapsed, and I have heard nothing farther from the Duke of 
Leeds. It is true that Easter holidays have intervened, and 
that public business is in general suspended during that period. 
I shall give them sufficient time to show whether they are as 
well disposed as he has declared, and then give him a hint. 
Before I saw him I communicated to the French Ambassador, 
in confidence, that you had directed me to call for a performance of the treaty. He told me at once that they would not 
give up the posts. Perhaps he may be right. I thought it 
best to make such communication, because the thing itself 
cannot remain a secret ; and by mentioning it to him we are 
enabled to say with truth, that in every step relating to the 
treaty of peace we have acted confidentially in regard to our 
ally. I have the honor to be, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My letter of the seventh will have communicated what 
passed with the Duke of Leeds respecting the business you 
committed to rne. I take the liberty to mention here, that from 
his countenance and manner on the perusal of your letter, he 
seemed to derive from it that sort of pleasure, which a man 
feels at the removal of something, which every now and then 
brings to his mind disagreeable ideas. I do not exactly see 
from what cause this emotion was produced. By the eagerness 
of his subsequent expressions, I conjectured that the critical 
situation of Europe had excited some disquietude respecting 
the part, which the United States might take in case of a general war. What strengthened that idea, and perhaps led me to 
form it, was that in a chamber to which I was introduced previous 
to the audience, there was a large book of maps open at that 
part of Poland. But the silence since observed leads to a sus 
picion, that his satisfaction was derived from another source. I 
am told that in a late debate the ministers committed them 
selves by throwing out in pretty clear terms the idea, that some 
sort of treaty was on the carpet with America. And if so, the 
opening now given must have relieved them from the fear of 
future contradiction. 
</p><p>
I trouble you, my dear sir, with all this conjecture, because it 
is not impossible that circumstances may turn up on your side 
of the water, with which it may be useful to compare minutely 
what passes here. I am, &c.

Sir, 
</p><p>
This will accompany the duplicate of what I had the honor 
to write on the seventh by the packet. I am still waiting for 
intelligence from the Ministers, who (to judge by appearances) 
slumber profoundly upon the application made to them. Yesterday the two houses of Parliament again entered on business, 
after their recess for the Easter holidays ; and Mr Pitt has 
announced the budget for next Monday. Some rational con 
jectures, as to their dispositions and intentions, may perhaps be 
formed from the business of that day. I have the honor to 
be, &c.

</p><p>
My Lord, 
</p><p>
When I had the honor of an interview with your Grace at 
Whitehall, on Monday, the twenty-ninth of last month, I left, at 
your request, a letter from the President of the United States 
to me, which you promised to return after you should have had 
it copied. As your Grace seemed to be particularly pleased 
with the contents of that letter, I took the liberty to request 
that I might be speedily honored with the communication of 
your sentiments on the subjects of it. This you were so kind 
as to promise. Your subsequent silence led me to apprehend, 
that this affair might have been overlooked in the attention to 
matters of more apparent moment. I took the liberty there 
fore to recall it to your Grace's recollection by a note of the 
nineteenth instant, which was delivered at Whitehall, and to 
which no reply has been received. 
</p><p>
Permit me now, my Lord, to request that the President's 
letter may be returned, and excuse me for expressing at the 
same time a wish, that you would enable me to transmit the 
evidence of those friendly dispositions towards America, which 
you were pleased to express. It flows from the sincere desire 
that more perfect harmony may be established between the 
two countries, and a solicitude to obviate unpleasant circumstances. I have the honor to be, &c.

</p><p>
My Lord, 
</p><p>
I was honored by your Grace's letter of the twenty-eighth 
late last evening, and take the earliest opportunity to acknowledge it. Be assured, my Lord, that I regret much the indisposition which suspended your answer, and sincerely wish that 
it may be speedily removed. 
</p><p>
I am happy to be assured by such respectable authority, that 
it has ever been the sincere and earnest wish of this country 
to fulfil her engagements with the United States in a manner 
consistent with the most scrupulous fidelity. This indeed 
has never admitted of a question in my mind, because I would 
not harbor a doubt of the national faith of Great Britain ; and 
I have the pleasure to observe to you, my Lord, that sentiments 
of this kind induced the Congress at their last session to 
reject, by a considerable majority, some regulations which 
might have appeared hostile, and proved injurious to your 
commercial interests. I am perfectly convinced from this, and 
from many other circumstances, that the United States have a 
constant determination to perform in the fullest manner every 
stipulation which they have made ; for this is not only in itself 
a moral duty peculiarly binding upon every sovereign power, 
but it is specially secured by that constitutional compact, which 
the people of America have made with each other. Since 
both parties therefore have the best dispositions, and are influ 
enced, by the purest motives, I indulge, my Lord, the hope, 
that every obstacle to a complete performance will be speedily 
removed. And in this hope, without going into an inquiry 
as to the causes of former delay, which might not perhaps 
tend towards conciliation, I must entreat of your Grace's 
goodness to be informed in what respect, and to what degree, 
you consider the final completion of those engagements, to 
which the United States were bound, as having been rendered 
impracticable ; for I must own that the idea is new to my 
conception. 
</p><p>
The candor, with which your Grace avows the intention to 
retard a fulfilment of such parts of the treaty as depend upon 
Great Britain, meets, as it merits, my utmost acknowledgment. 
I am very far from questioning the policy, nor will I presume 
to doubt the propriety, of a caution which is, I trust, unnecessary, and which might indeed be unpleasant to the feelings of 
Americans, if they could be affected with punctilious sentiments in the discussion of national interests. But it becomes 
my duty to ask of you, my Lord, the nature and extent of the 
redress expected for the subjects of his Britannic Majesty, 
upon the specific points of the treaty ; and, in the supposed 
case that this should have become impracticable, the kind and 
the measure of compensation to be required from us, as preliminary to the fulfilment of those stipulations which remain to 
be performed by you. 
</p><p>
I trust that I am mistaken in that part of your Grace's letter, which relates to a commercial treaty, because it really 
appears to me as expressive only of the wish to cultivate 
merely an amicable intercourse, founded on commercial good 
faith, and as implying some disinclination to the securing of 
that intercourse by the force of treaty. I should be very 
unhappy to convey a false interpretation of the sentiments of 
this government upon an object of such importance. This 
might be prejudicial to both countries, and therefore T shall 
indulge the expectation that, if I am wrong, your Grace will 
have the goodness to set me right. I have the honor to be, &c.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
Herewith I have the honor to transmit a duplicate of my last 
letter of the thirteenth of April. Not having heard from the 
Duke of Leeds I wrote him a note on the nineteenth. To 
this I received no reply ; wherefore, on the twenty-ninth, I ad 
dressed him again by a letter of which a copy is enclosed. 
This was delivered at his office, Whitehall, between eleven and 
twelve in the morning of the twenty -ninth, and at half past ten 
in the evening the letters were sent to me. You will observe, 
that his letter is dated the 28th, and of course takes no notice 
of that to which it is in fact the answer ; but the style and general complexion, as well as the circumstances attending the de 
livery of it, clearly show that it was not written until the evening of the twenty-ninth. 
</p><p>
I might in reply have made some strictures upon the information that I was in Holland, &c. &c. I might also have contrasted the expressions of good faith with the conduct of the 
administration, and have observed upon the idea that the United States were bound in the most solemn manner, while from 
the subsequent parts of his letter it would seem that Great 
Britain is not bound at all, or at most but loosely. There is 
also a confusion of language, which resembles the stammering 
of one, who endeavors to excuse a misdeed, which he resolves 
to commit. Thus on the supposition that completion of the 
treaty by us is impossible, he insists that we shall complete it, 
or make compensation. The expressions in the last clause are, 
if possible, more vague than all the rest, and the reply might 
have been proportionately more pointed. 
</p><p>
My letter of yesterday contains nothing of what is just stated, although perhaps it ought to have noticed some parts. I 
must rely on your kindness, sir, both to interpret favorably 
what I have done, and to excuse my omissions. I thought it 
best to heap coals of fire on their heads, and thereby either bring 
them into our views, or put them most eminently in the wrong. 
It was moreover my wish to draw forth specific propositions, 
because these will admit of discussion, or else, if manifestly unjust, they may not only be repelled, but they will serve to show 
a predetermined breach of faith by them, which will justify 
whatever conduct we may afterwards find it proper to adopt. 
If, as is not improbable, they should give us no answer, or one 
so vague as to mean nothing, I shall pursue, according to circumstances, my object of compelling them to speak plainly, or 
refuse absolutely. 
</p><p>
It seems pretty clear, that they wish to evade a commercial 
treaty, but not peremptorily to reject it ; and, therefore, I have 
construed into rejection his Grace's abstruse language, leaving 
him the option to give it a different interpretation. I do not 
expect that he will, though he may perhaps write an explanatory comment, more unintelligible than the text. 
</p><p>
I have some reason to believe, that the present administration 
intend to keep the posts and withhold payment for the negroes. 
If so, they will color their breach of faith by the best pretexts 
in their power. I incline to think also, that they consider a 
treaty of commerce with America as being absolutely unnecessary, and that they are persuaded they shall derive all the benefit 
from our trade without treaty. It is true that we might lay them 
under restrictions in our ports, but they believe that an attempt 
of that sort would be considered by one part of America as 
calculated by the other for private emolument, and not for the 
general good. The merchants here look on it as almost impossible for us to do without them ; and it must be acknowledged that past experience, and the present situation of neighboring 
countries, go far to justify that opinion. Whether the ministers 
shall act according to their own ideas, or consult mercantile 
people,, they will equally, I think, repel advances from us ; and, 
therefore&gt; it seems more prudent to lay the foundations of future advantage, than attempt to grasp at present benefit. I will 
not pretend to suggest any measures for the adoption of congress, whose wisdom and whose sense of national honor will 
certainly lead them to act properly, when the proper moment 
shall present itself. It will naturally strike every mind, that 
while the legislature of this country continues to invest the executive authority with great power respecting the American commerce, the administration here will have advantages 
in treaty, which can only be balanced by similar confidence on the part of congress, in the executive of America. 
</p><p>
But very much will, I think, depend upon the situation of 
France. If appearances there should change, and so much 
vigor be infused into the government as would enable it to call 
forth the national efforts in support of their interest and honor, 
a great revolution would be produced in the opinions here. 
From the conduct of the aristocratic hierarchy in the low countries, who are instigated and supported by Prussia, I have long 
</p><p>
been thoroughly convinced that the alternative of war, or the 
most ignominious terms of peace, would be proposed to the 
imperial courts. Counting upon the absolute nullity of France, 
and supposing that this country can at any moment intimidate 
that into abject submission, Prussia and Poland will, I think, join 
themselves to Turkey and Sweden against Russia and Austria, 
which are both exhausted, and one of them dismembered. 
Probably the war will be commenced before this letter reaches 
your hands, and then Britain and Holland are to be the umpires, or rather dictators, of peace. 
</p><p>
I have taken the liberty to touch thus far upon the general 
system of European politics, as it may tend to show that for the 
present, Great Britain will rather keep things in suspense with 
us, being herself in a state of suspense as to others. I will not 
go into conjectures about the events, which will take place upon 
the continent. They will, I believe, as is usual, disappoint 
the projectors ; but be that as it may, our affairs can derive no 
advantages now from what shall happen hereafter. I presume 
that a dissolution of parliament will take place shortly, although 
many of the best informed people think, or at least say they 
think, otherwise. But it is clear to my mind, that the administration will wish to have before them a prospect of seven years 
stability to their system, be that what it may, and they will not 
at the moment of a general election expose themselves to criticism by any act of doubtful construction. This forms with them 
an additional reason for being evasive in regard to us. Perhaps 
there never was a moment in which this country felt herself 
greater, and consequently it is the most unfavorable moment to 
obtain advantageous terms from her in any bargain. But this 
appearance is extremely fallacious. Their revenue is not yet 
equal to their expenditure ; money is indeed poured in upon them 
from all quarters, because of the distracted situation of affairs 
among their neighbors, and hence their stocks have risen greatly since the peace, so that they can borrow at an interest of 
four per cent ; but supposing they should not be obliged to en 
gage in the war, still there are two events, either of which would overturn the fabric of their prosperity. If France establishes 
a solid system of finance, then capitalists will prefer five per cent 
with her, ^p four per cent from Britain ; for, all other things being equal, there is no shadow of comparison between the re 
sources of the two countries. If France commits a bankruptcy, the disorders consequent thereon will doubtless be violent, 
but the storm once passed, she would be able to make greater 
exertions by her annual resources, than Britain could compass 
by every possible anticipation of credit. There is a middle 
situation between sinking and swimming, in which the French 
finances may flounder on for some time to come, but even this 
state of wretchedness will produce rather evil than good to 
Great Britain ; for she has already reaped all the harvest, which 
could be gathered from the distress of her neighbors, and must 
necessarily lose the benefits of the famous commercial treaty, 
in proportion as the resources of her customer are cut off. 
</p><p>
Under the various contingencies, which present themselves 
to my contemplation, and there are many which I will not trouble you with the perusal of, it appears clearly, that the favorable 
moment for us to treat is not yet come. It is indeed the moment for this country, and they seem determined to let it pass 
away. I must again entreat your indulgence, sir, for this long 
and desultory letter. Accept, [ pray you, the assurances of 
that respect with which I have the honor to be, &ic.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
You will find enclosed the copy of what I took the liberty 
to trouble you with on the thirteenth of last month. On Satur 
day, the seventeenth, I dined in company with Mr Fox. The 
state of French politics formed, of course, a large part of the 
conversation. The situation of other countries was then passed in review, and it became a question how far Britain might 
be engaged in the affairs of the continent. At length I took 
an opportunity to ask what system the administration had 
adopted respecting America. He told me that he could not 
tell, but he believed they had none, and would in all probability be governed by events. That he did not believe Mr Pitt 
would trouble his head about the matter, but would probably 
leave it to Lord Hawkesbury and Mr Grenville, who are both 
of them indisposed to us ; whereas Pitt himself is, he supposes, 
rather friendly than otherwise. Mr Fox said further, that he 
and Burke are now almost alone in their opinion, that we 
should be permitted to trade in our own bottoms to their 
islands, and that this opinion loses ground daily ; though for 
his own part he persists in it. 
</p><p>
I find that the ministers apply for information respecting 
America, and particularly American commerce, to a Mr Irvin, 
who long resided in America, and is now in the customs ; a 
mighty sour sort of creature, and one who seems to have a 
mortal aversion for us. I met him at dinner one day, and he 
took pains to let me know, that he was doing all he could to 
prevent any encouragement from being given to our exports, 
by the corn bill, which is now on the carpet. He declared 
that he would, by the force of starvation, oblige the people of 
Britain to raise corn enough for their own consumption, and 
that even the supply of the West India Islands ought to be 
provided in this country. 
</p><p>
You will readily perceive, sir, from this rude sketch of influential characters, that there is but little disposition for treating 
with us at present. I am, &c.

Sir, 
</p><p>
I do myself the honor to inclose a copy of my letter of the 
first instant. On the night of the fourth there was a hot press 
here, which has continued ever since, and the declared object 
is to compel Spain to atone for an insult offered to Great 
Britain, by capturing two vessels in Nootka Sound. Permit 
me to mention, incidentally, that it would not be amiss for the 
American captain, who was a witness of the whole transaction, to publish a faithful narrative. 
</p><p>
The general opinion here is, that Spain will submit, and that 
Spain only is the object of this armament. But I hold a very 
different faith. If Spain submits, she may as well give up her 
American dominions ; for the position advanced here is, that 
nations have a right to take possession of any territory unoccupied. Now, without noticing the inconsistency between this 
assertion, and those which preceded the war of <a href='/results.php?year=1755'>1755</a>, when 
France built Fort du Quesne upon ground unoccupied by 
British subjects, it cannot escape the most cursory observation, 
that the British, sitting down in the vicinity of Spanish settlements, will establish such a system of contraband traffic as 
must ruin the commerce of Cadiz, and the revenue now 
derived from it by the Spanish monarch. 
</p><p>
In former letters I have communicated in some measure my 
ideas upon the second opinion. I shall not therefore recapitulate them, but only in general notice, that the armament against 
Spain, should Spain shrink from the contest, will undoubtedly 
be sent to the Baltic, with decisive effect. You will observe 
also that the ministers count upon the nullity of France, of 
which I shall say a word presently. 
</p><p>
In consequence of the orders for impressing seamen, a number of Americans were taken, and the applications made for 
their relief were in some instances ineffectual. On the morning of the twelfth, Mr Cutting called to inform me, that he was appointed agent to several of the American masters of ships. 
I gave him my advice as to the best mode of proceeding, and 
particularly urged him to authenticate all the facts by affidavits, assuring him that if he was unsuccessful, I would endeavor to obtain the assistance of such persons as I might be 
acquainted with. On the seventeenth, Mr Paine called to tell 
me, that he had conversed on the same subject with Mr Burke, 
who had asked him if there was any minister, consul, or other 
agent of the United States, who could properly make application to the government, to which he had replied in the negative ; but said, that I was here, who had been a member of 
Congress, and was therefore the fittest person to step forward. 
In consequence of what passed thereupon between them, he 
urged me to take the matter up, which I promised to do. On 
the eighteenth I wrote to the Duke of Leeds, requesting an 
interview. He desired me to come at three o clock the next 
day ; but his note was delivered after the hour was passed, 
and very shortly after it, came another note, giving me an 
appointment for the twentieth. 
</p><p>
Upon entering his closet he apologized for not answering 
my letters. I told him that I had in my turn an apology to 
make for troubling him with an affair^ on which I was not authorized to speak. He said I had misunderstood one part of 
his letter to me, for that he certainly meant to express a 
willingness to enter into a treaty of commerce. I replied, that 
as to my letter I supposed he would answer it at his leisure, 
and therefore we would wave the discussion. That my 
present object was to mention the conduct of their pressgangs, who had taken many American seamen, and had entered American vessels with as little ceremony as those 
belonging to Britain. I believe, my Lord, this is the only 
instance in which we are not treated as aliens. He acknowledged that it was wrong, and would speak to Lord Chatham 
on the subject. I told him that many disagreeable circumstances had already happened, and that there was reason to expect many more, in a general impress through the British 
dominions. That masters of vessels, on their return to America, would excite much heat ; c and that, my Lord, combined 
with other circumstances, may perhaps occasion very disagreeable events. 
</p><p>
He then repeated his assurances of good will, and expressed an anxious wish to prevent all disagreement ; observing at 
the same time, that there was much difficulty in distinguishing seamen of the two countries. I acknowledged the 
inconveniences to which they might be subjected by the pretence of British seamen to be Americans, and wished there 
fore that some plan might be adopted, which, founded on good 
faith, might at the same time prevent the concealment of 
British sailors, and protect the Americans from insult. As a 
means of accomplishing that end, I suggested the idea of certificates of citizenship to be given by the admiralty courts 
in America to our seamen. He seemed much pleased, and 
willing at once to adopt it ; but I desired him to consult first 
the King's servants in that particular department ; and having 
again reminded him that I spoke without authority, took my 
leave ; but at his request, promised to visit him again the next day. 
</p><p>
The morning of the twenty-first I found him sitting with Mr Pitt, to whom he presented me. The first point we took up 
was that of the impress. Mr Pitt expressed his approbation 
of the plan I had proposed to the Duke, but observed that it 
was liable to abuse, notwithstanding every precaution which 
the admiralty offices in America could take. I acknowledged 
that it was, but observed, that even setting aside the great political interests of both countries, it was for the commercial interest of Britain rather to wink at such abuse ; for that if they 
should be involved in a war with the House, of Bourbon, our 
commerce with Britain must be in American bottoms ; be 
cause a war premium of insurance would give a decided 
preference to the manufacturers of other countries in our 
markets ; but that no wages would induce American seamen 
to come within the British dominions, if they were thereby liable to be impressed. Mr Pitt replied to this, that the 
degree of risk, and consequently the rate of insurance, must 
depend upon the kind of war. Not taking any direct notice 
of this expression, I observed, that notwithstanding the wretched state of the French Government, there still existed much 
force in that country, and that the power of commanding 
human labor must also exist somewhere ; so that if the government would not arm their fleets, there would still be many 
privateers, and that in effect, the slenderest naval efforts must 
involve merchant vessels in considerable danger. 
</p><p>
Returning then to the consideration of the principal point, 
we discussed the means of carrying the plan with effect, and 
for that purpose I recommended that his majesty's servants 
should order all their marine officers to admit as evidence 
of being American seamen, the certificate to that effect of the 
admiralty in America, containing in it a proper description of 
the person, &c. ; but without excluding, however, other evidence ; and observed, that, in consequence of the communication, if such orders were given, the executive authority in 
America, without the aid of the legislature, by directions to 
the several admiralties, might carry the plan into effect, so 
far as relates to those seamen who should apply for certificates. I am induced to believe that this measure, if adopted, 
will not only answer the desired end, but be productive of 
other good consequences in America, which I will not now 
trouble you with the detail of. 
</p><p>
This affair being so far adjusted, we proceeded to new matters, 
and they both assured me that I had misapprehended the Duke's 
letter in regard to a treaty of commerce. I answered cooly, that 
it was very easy to rectify the mistake, but it appeared idle to 
form a new treaty until the parties should be thoroughly satisfied 
with that already existing. Mr Pitt then took up the conversation and said, that the delay of compliance on our part had 
rendered that compliance less effectual, and that cases must 
certainly exist where great injury had been sustained by the 
delay. To this I replied that delay is always a kind of breach, 
since as long as it lasts it is the non-performance of stipulations. 
I proceeded then to a more exact investigation of the question. 
And first, as I knew them to be annoyed with many applications 
for redress by those who had, and those who pretended to have suffered, I attempted to show what I really believe to be the fact, 
viz. that the injury was much smaller than was imagined, be 
cause among the various classes of American debtors, those 
only should be considered who had the ability, and not the will, 
to pay at the peace, and were now deprived of the ability. 
These I supposed to be not numerous ; and as to others, I stated interest as the natural compensation for delay of payment, 
observing that it was impossible to go into an examination of all 
the incidental evils. 
</p><p>
In the second place, I desired him to consider, that we in 
turn complained, that the British government had not, as they 
ought, paid for the slaves who were taken away. That we 
felt for the situation they were in, of being obliged either to break 
faith with the slaves whom they had seduced by the offer of 
freedom, or to violate the stipulations they had made with us 
upon that subject. That we were willing, therefore, to wave 
our literal claims ; but had every right to insist on compensation ; and that it would not be difficult for the planters to show, 
that they had sustained an annual loss from the want of men to 
cultivate their lands, and thereby produce the means of paying 
their debts. Mr Pitt exclaimed at this, as if it were an exaggerated statement. I at once acknowledged my belief that 
in this, as in all similar cases, there might be some exaggeration 
on both sides ; but, sir, what T have said tends to show that these 
complaints and inquiries are excellent, if the parties mean to 
keep asunder ; if they wish to come together, all such matter 
should be kept out of sight, and each side perform now, as 
well as the actual situation of things will permit. Mr Pitt then 
made many professions of an earnest desire to cultivate the 
best understanding, Stc. &tc. On the whole, he thought it 
might be best to consider the subject generally, and to see if, 
on general ground, some compensation would not be mutually made. I immediately replied, ( If I understand you, Mr Pitt, 
you wish to make a new treaty, instead of complying with the 
old one. He admitted this to be in some sort his idea, I said, 
that even on that ground I did not see what better could be 
done, than to perform the old one. As to the compensation for 
negroes taken away, it is too trifling an object for you to dispute, so that nothing remains but the posts ; I suppose, there 
fore, that you wish to retain those posts. Why, perhaps we 
may. ( They are not worth the keeping, for it must cost you 
a great deal of money, and produce no benefit. The only reason you can have to desire them, is to secure the fur trade, and 
that will centre in this country, let who will carry it on in America. I gave him the reasons for this opinion, which I am sure 
is well founded, but I will not trouble you with them. His answer was well turned. If you consider these posts as a trivial 
object, there is the less reason for requiring them. Pardon 
me, sir, I only state the retaining of them as useless to you, but 
this matter is to be considered in a different point of light. 
Those who made the peace acted wisely in separating the possessions of the two countries by so wide a water. It is essential to preserve this boundary, if you wish to live in amity with 
us. Near neighbors are seldom good ones, for the quarrels among 
borderers frequently bring on wars. If is, therefore, essential 
for both parties that you should give them up ; but as to us it 
is of particular importance, because our national honor is interested. You hold them with the avowed intention of forcing us 
to comply with such conditions as you may impose. Why, 
sir, as to the consideration of national honor, we can retort the 
observation, and say our honor is concerned in your delay 01 
performance of the treaty. No, sir, your natural and proper 
course was to comply fully on your part, and if then we had re 
fused a compliance, you might rightfully have issued letters of 
marque and reprisal to such of your subjects as were injured 
by our refusal. But the conduct you have pursued naturally 
excites resentment in every American bosom. We do not think 
it worth while to go to war with you for these posts ; but wt know our rights, and will avail ourselves oj them, when time 
and circumstances may suit. I 
</p><p>
Mr Pitt asked me if I had powers to treat. I told him I 
had not, and that we could not appoint any person as minister, 
they had so much neglected the former appointment. He asked me whether we would appoint a minister if they did. I told 
him that I could almost promise that we should, but was not 
authorized to give any positive assurance. The question then 
was, how to communicate on this subject. I suggested, that 
since much time might be unnecessarily consumed by reason 
of the distance and uncertainty of communication, it would per 
haps be expedient for them to appoint a minister, and delay 
his departure until we should have made a similar appointment. Mr Pitt said they might communicate to you their intention to appoint, &c. I told him, that his communication 
might encounter some little difficulty, because you could not 
properly hear anything from the British Consuls, these being 
characters unacknowledged in America. His pride was a little touched at this. I should suppose, Mr Morris, that attention might as well be paid to what they say, as that the Duke of 
Leeds and I should hold the present conversation with you. 
By no means, sir, I never should have thought of asking a conference with his Grace, if I had not possessed a letter from the 
President of the United States, which you know, my Lord, I 
left with you, and which I dare say you have communicated to 
Mr Pitt. He had. Mr Pitt said they could in like manner 
write a letter to one of their consuls. Yes, sir, and the letter 
will be attended to, but not the consul, who is in no respect different from any other British subject ; and this is the circumstance 
which I wished you to regard. He said in reply to this, that 
etiquette ought not to be pushed so far as to injure business, 
and keep the countries asunder. I assured him that the rulers 
of America had too much understanding to care for etiquette ; 
but prayed him at the same time to recollect, that they (the 
British,) had hitherto kept us at a distance, instead of making 
advances. That you had gone quite as far as they had any 
</p><p>
reason to expect, in writing the letter just mentioned, but that 
from what had passed in consequence of it, and which, as he 
might naturally suppose, I had transmitted, we could not but 
consider them as wishing to avoid an intercourse. He took up 
this point, and expressed again his hope that I would remove 
such an idea, assuring me that they were disposed to cultivate 
a connexion, &c. &c. To this I replied, that any written communications which his Grace of Leeds might make should be 
duly transmitted ; but I did not like to write mere conversation, 
because it might be misconceived ; and disagreeable questions 
afterwards arise, whereas written things remain and speak for 
themselves. They agreed to the propriety of this sentiment. 
</p><p>
I observed further, that our disposition towards a good understanding was evidenced, not only by your letter, but also by 
the decision of a majority of the House of Representatives, 
against laying extraordinary restrictions on British vessels in 
our ports. Mr Pitt said, that instead of restrictions, we ought 
to give them particular privileges, in return for those which we 
enjoy here. I assured him that I knew of none, except that of 
being impressed, a privilege which of all others we least wished 
to partake of. The Duke of Leeds observed, in the same 
style of jocularity, that we were at least treated in that respect 
as the most favored nation, seeing that we were treated like 
themselves. But Mr Pitt said seriously, that they had certainly evidenced good will towards us, by what they had done 
respecting our commerce. I replied, therefore, with like seriousness, that their regulations had been dictated by a view to 
their own interest ; and therefore, as we felt no favor, we owned no obligation. The subject being now pretty well exhausted, they promised to consult together, and give me the result 
of their deliberations. This I am yet to receive ; but I learn 
that Mr Greenville has this day consulted some persons skilled 
in the fur trade, and that from his conversation it seemed 
probable that they would give up the posts. My information 
is good. 
</p><p>
I have already said that the Ministers here count upon the 
nullity of France. They do not however expect that she will 
violate her treaty with Spain, and therefore they are rather. 
I believe, in hopes that Spain will submit to such terms as 
they may impose. How far they may be bound to aid Prussia seems as yet to be doubtful ;. but for my own part I believe, 
that a war is inevitable, and I act on that ground. If it does 
not take place, they will, I think, desire such things of us, in a 
treaty of commerce, as we shall not be disposed to grant ; but 
if it does happen, then they will give us a good price for our 
neutrality ; and Spain, I think, will do so too ; wherefore this 
appears to be a favorable moment for treating with that court 
about the Mississippi. 
</p><p>
Before I close this letter, already too long, I must entreat 
permission to make one or two explanatory observations/. It 
is evident that the conduct of this government towards us, from 
the time of my first interview with the Duke of Leeds, has de 
pended on the contingencies of war or peace with the neigh 
boring powers ; and they have kept things in suspense accordingly. When, therefore, they came a little forward, it proved 
to me their apprehension of a rupture I have some reason 
to think, that they are in greater danger than they are them 
selves aware of, and I have much cause to suspect that they 
meditate a blow in Flanders, in which it is not improbable that 
they will be foiled and disappointed. Believing, therefore, 
that I knew their motives, it only remained to square my con 
duct and conversation accordingly. And here you will con 
sider, that the characteristic of this nation is pride ; whence it 
follows, that if they are brought to sacrifice a little of this self-importance, they will readily add some other sacrifices. I 
kept therefore a little aloof, and did not, as I might have done 
obtain an assurance that they would appoint a minister if you 
would. On the contrary, it now stands on such ground that 
they must write a letter, making the first advance, which you 
of course will be in possession of. And to that effect I warned them against sending a message by one of their consuls. I 
am, &c.

Sir, 
</p><p>
This letter will accompany copies of those, which I had the 
honor to write on the first, and twenty-ninth of May. I have 
heard nothing since from the Duke of Leeds. On the tenth 
of June the King prorogued the parliament, which was dissolved on the eleventh. The election will be completed in 
about ten days, and then the ministers will feel themselves 
more at liberty to avow their intentions, than they are at present. They will have a great majority, though perhaps weaker 
by half a dozen, than in the last house ; but the immense patronage, which must result from a war, will soon overbalance that difference. 
</p><p>
I was told on the tenth, that the Duke of Leeds is to leave 
the office of secretary of foreign affairs, and is to be succeeded by Lord Hawkesbury, formerly Charles Jenkinson. He is 
an able man, strongly opposed to America, and it is said from 
inclination ; but perhaps it is from the desire to please his roy 
al master. Such an appointment would look like a bar to 
any friendly communication with us ; but I incline to think 
otherwise. He will at least be an efficient minister, and what 
ever he agrees to will go smoothly through the cabinet ; 
whereas the present man is evidently afraid of committing him 
self, by saying or doing anything positive. 
</p><p>
On the seventeenth of June I learnt a conversation, which 
had recently passed with Mr Greenville about the posts, from 
the complexion of which I conclude that they are nearly determined to give them up. In the course of that conversation, 
(in which the minister was collecting information from a gentleman acquainted with the country and its trade,) he said that 
the Americans had m-ade some overtures for a commercial 
treaty, which might, perhaps, take place ; and that he wished 
to be prepared, in case that matter should be brought forward, 
which appeared however to be uncertain. 
</p><p>
He mentioned at the same time, but merely as matter of 
common report, that the Spaniards had agreed to give us the 
navigation of the Mississippi. I am therefore confirmed in my 
opinion, that, if they get engaged in a war, they will be glad to 
form a friendly connexion with us. And as to the contingency of war, I was informed on the twenty-first of June, that 
about three weeks before that period, they had sent an express 
over land to India, probably with instructions to prepare for, if 
not to commence hostilities. This, added to many other circumstances, leaves but little room to doubt of their intentions. 
Prussia has been arming and negotiating, and seems as if desirous to gain time, till this country can act. 
</p><p>
The fleet which lay at Spithead had sailed some days 
since for Torbay, and is to be joined, it is said, by a Dutch 
squadron, which came forward in the quality of an ally to 
Great Britain. The idea of calling upon an ally to assist 
a British against a Spanish fleet seems to be a little extraordinary. But it would not be extraordinary, that a Dutch squadron should go into the Baltic, and assist the Swedes against Russia. 
</p><p>
We are now so near the moment when the curtain is to be 
drawn up, that I will not trouble you with my conjectures 
about the scenes which are to be displayed. France, I 
am persuaded, will not remain an idle spectator. I am, &c,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor to write to you on the third of July, of 
which letter I now enclose a copy. I have patiently waited 
since that period for the answer, which had been promised on 
the twenty-first of May, to my letter of the thirtieth of April. 
Had any circumstance turned up, which would in my opinion 
have justified a new application, it should have been made ; 
but this has not been the case. 
</p><p>
You will have seen the declaration, and counter declaration, 
of the Spanish and British courts, exchanged at Madrid the 
twenty-fourth of last month. These leave the material ground 
of controversy in its original state, and the armaments go on 
with unremitting diligence. The event seems to turn upon 
the ability and inclination of France, whose condition is far 
from desirable ; but I shall not attempt to describe it, because 
I have no doubt that Mr Short, being on the spot, will transmit 
much better information than I can pretend to. The poor 
king of Hungary, pressed by Prussia, and distracted by the 
interior commotions of his various dominions, and unsupported 
by France, has been obliged to accede to terms of pacification, 
by no means desirable. This leaves Britain and her friends 
more at liberty to press the other powers. The proceedings 
of the congress have of course been very secret, and if they 
had not, a mere private individual in this country could not 
acquire an early knowledge of them. There is, however, one 
circumstance which, let things terminate as they may, will, I 
conceive, have considerable consequences. The king of Prussia has endeavored to obtain from Poland the cession of Thorn 
and Dantzic. These countries are, you know., already surrounded by his dominions, except towards the sea ; and if he 
had succeeded, or should succeed, he will not only become at 
once a naval power, but will hold in his hand the key to the 
great granary of Europe. This, at a period when from the 
extension of commerce and manufactures in other countries, 
the want of bread is often feared, and sometimes felt, will give 
him immense advantages both in peace and war, besides those 
of rendering his dominions more compact, and of increasing 
his revenue. It is, I think, hardly possible that Britain and 
Holland should have wished for his success, and if his failure 
should be owing to their resistance, it may at no distant period 
give rise to new connexions and alliances in the north. la 
the Baltic they have been very busy. The seasons give but 
little time there for any other naval war. than that which man 
must wage with the elements. They make therefore the best or, if you please, the worst use of their time. Little, however^ 
has been effected, except the havoc of the human race, which 
is not over numerous in that quarter. The king of Sweden, 
with infinite gallantry, places himself in situations where he 
can gain little, and may lose all. Hitherto he has extricated 
himself by downright fighting, and as it is too late for effectual 
interference from England or Holland, probably both sides, 
having sung Te Deum, will take breath, and may, perhaps, be 
content to try what negotiation can do next winter. 
</p><p>
I have little doubt but that the ministry here would have 
agreed to comply with the treaty of peace, had they found 
themselves engaged in a war, which they have been upon the 
brink of for some months ; and I presume, that in proportion 
as the clouds shall disperse, they will be less tractable. I have 
taken patience, and remained here, though I had many private 
reasons for going to the continent; but as I believed that by 
being on the spot, I might be useful, especially if a favorable 
occasion should offer, I thought it my duty to stay. 
</p><p>
From some circumstances, too slight to be worth mention 
ing, I incline to think that such occasion is not far distant ; but 
never, perhaps, were the affairs of Europe in a situation which 
admitted so little of forming any solid opinion ; and this from 
the spreading of what is called the French disease, in other 
words, revolt. Hungary, part of Germany, Italy, and Savoy, 
with France and Flanders, are already in different stages of 
that disease. Poland is constitutionally afflicted with it. In 
Sweden and Holland slight circumstances would bring for 
ward seeds, which have long been sown, and no man can tell 
or even guess how far it may extend, or what may be the 
consequences. This country is free from the contagion, and 
likely to continue so. Indeed the English seem in some respects to have changed sentiments and manners with the French. 
They are as far gone in loyalty as their neighbors in republicanism. Happy America, where alone, I verily believe, both 
freedom and virtue have their real and substantial existence
</p><p>
I wait with anxious expectation to hear what congress may 
have done in relation to this country, as well as upon the important subject of finance ; for that also would have no small 
influence on the British cabinet. Having long been in the habit 
of contemplating public credit as the most certain and abundant 
national resource, they will naturally, and indeed necessarily, 
take up their opinion of us on that ground. And if at the same 
time their mercantile interest should fed that we have a government, it might produce a general conviction that we are not to be 
trifled with. Incidental circumstances among foreign nations 
may give us momentary advantages, and doubtless it is the duty of all public servants to watch those moments, and turn them 
to the best account. But it is by the solidity of our domestic 
system alone, that we can become permanently and intrinsically respectable. Consequently, it is by that alone, that we can 
hope for permanent and useful connexions. And although we 
ought not from such considerations to become supine or inattentive to the measures of the greater maritime powers, which 
would indeed be very imprudent, yet we may certainly repose 
with greater confidence on the good faith of others, when they 
see, and above all when they feel the value of our friendship. 
</p><p>
I pray your kind excuse, sir, for giving vent to these ideas, 
which are as much the sentiments of my heart as the dictates 
of my understanding. As conclusions of reason, they have naturally been adopted by every thinking man in America ; but 
he must come out of it, perhaps, if he would have their importance deeply impressed by the impulsion of daily experience. 
I am, &tc.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
It may perhaps be proper to mention one or two things, 
in relation to the objects treated of in my letters of last 
January. And first, of a commerce with the French Islands. 
Nothing has, I believe, been done in France, which may be 
favorable to our views ; but the commotions in the Islands 
themselves will, I presume, operate like liberal regulations of 
police, and probably the colonists will eventually demand as a 
right, what some time since they would have accepted as a favor. 
I am led to believe that we should not be over anxious on this 
subject just now, because circumstances will perhaps serve us 
better than we can serve ourselves. 
</p><p>
My predictions respecting the Turk have been so far veri 
fied, as that he has got rid of one of his enemies upon tolerable 
terms, for he loses no dominion worth a contest. How far 
the intercessions now making to the Empress of Russia will 
produce the desired effect, seems not to be clearly ascertained. 
If a squadron of Dutch or English ships had arrived in the 
Baltic last May, it is more than probable that the peace of the 
north would have been restored ; but there are many events 
which would enable the Empress of Russia to carry on suc 
cessful operations against both the Turk and the Swede. 
The armies of the former, which opposed those of the Empe 
ror, cannot suddenly be transported to the quarter where they 
are now wanted ; neither will the expense of them cease during the campaign. It appears to me that the season is too 
far advanced for anything Prussia can do, let the inclination of 
the king be what it may ; and Sweden, unprotected by naval 
superiority, is exposed to the land force of its enemy, 
without much chance either of aid or diversion. Finland, 
which will probably be the object of the Czarina, cannot maintain forces needful to defend it, if the sea communication be 
cut off. Therefore the whole Prussian army, could it be 
transported thither, would be worse than useless. And thus 
the withdrawing of Austria from the war will have less influence than might have been expected. 
</p><p>
The people of Flanders seem to be given up, after having 
been used to distress the House of Austria. Heaven knows 
what desperation may prompt them to ; but it appears to me 
</p><p>
that a wise conduct on the part of France would have acquired for her the dominion of that country ; and if ever that 
should happen, France having at the same time a good constitution, the consequence of this island is gone. Antwerp 
seems intended by nature for the emporium of European 
commerce, and the navigation of the Scheldt would undoubtedly be opened if it belonged to a great naval power. That 
river and the Thames being nearly opposite to each other, 
mutual visits might be expected, and in these the superiority 
at land must at length prove decisive. 
</p><p>
The situation of France, however, seems at first sight to 
preclude all effort. The national bank, which was in contemplation, has never taken effect. After deliberating about it and 
about it, the thing dropped, and they expected to have made 
out with their new paper currency (the assignats) but my 
predictions on that subject seem to be verified. Still, how 
ever, the situation of their finances is not desperate. But 
their Assembly is losing ground daily in the public opinion. 
The army, long encouraged in licentious conduct, is now in 
revolt. All the bands of society are loosened, and authority 
is gone. Unless they are soon involved in a foreign war, it is 
impossible to conjecture what events will take place. For 
sometime past the ministers have been threatened with the Lanterne, and they would gladly get out of office. The 
great difficulty is, to find successors, or rather substitutes. 
Lafayette has been contriving an intermediate ministry to last 
for a few months, till, by the dissolution of the assembly, who, 
you know, passed a self-denying ordinance, a set could be taken 
from among the present members of that body. But this will 
prove a bad business ; for if the intermediaries are not able, 
then they will make things worse ; and if they are, they will 
not give up their places. 
</p><p>
We are in hourly expectation of hearing the decision of the 
Assembly upon the family compact. The Spanish Ambassa 
dor has required, in pointed terms, a compliance on the part 
of France. This, I have good reason to believe, was in concert with the French administration. If it were possible to answer for such a body as the Assemblee^ and so placed as they 
are, I would pronounce in favor of their adherence to the terms 
of that compact. If so, the tone o f the British ministy may 
be a little lowered. In the meantime, both the Spanish and 
English fleets are out, and were approaching towards each other. 
Probably each side means only to terrify at present; but Spain 
will not recede any farther, except in the last necessity. 
</p><p>
In a day or two I expect to learn something of their intentions here respecting us ; and if I do not hear from them, I shall 
make a final address to his Grace of Leeds. 
</p><p>
It is very flattering to me, Sir, that you are so kind as to ap 
prove of my communications with the ministers of this country, 
so far as they had gone in the beginning of May. I earnestly 
hope that my subsequent conduct may meet the same favorable interpretation. This you may rely on, that if in any case 
I go wrong, it will be from an error of judgment. I am, &c.

My Lord, 
</p><p>
At the close of a conversation with your Grace, and the Right 
Honorable Mr Pitt, on the twenty-first of May last, I was told 
that you would confer together, and transmit a reply to the letter, which I had the honor of addressing to your Grace on the 
thirtieth of April. In expectation of that reply, I have patiently waited in this city to the present hour, though called by 
many affairs to the continent. But my departure cannot be 
much longer delayed, and therefore it becomes necessary to 
intrude once more on your Grace's attention. 
</p><p>
I was led to believe, my Lord, that a friendly connexion 
might have taken place between this country and that of which 
I have the honor to be a citizen. How far it might be useful to Great Britain, I presume not to conjecture ; being perfectly convinced, from the wisdom and extensive information of 
his Majesty's ministers, that the best rule for private judgment 
must be derived from their conduct. But, my Lord, I candidly 
own, that such connexion appears to be of great consequence 
to America ; and therefore the hope of becoming instrumental 
in the accomplishment of it was most pleasing ; nor am I ashamed to avow my concern at the disappointment. 
</p><p>
Your Grace will readily recollect the purport of the letter, which 
you did me the honor to write on the twenty-eighth of April, 
and that mine of the thirtieth entreated a communication of the 
nature and extent of that redress, which his Majesty's ministers 
expected upon the specific points of the treaty of peace, and the 
kind and measure of compensation they would require in case, as 
had been supposed, the specific performance on our part were 
now impracticable. Months having elapsed in silence, your Grace 
will, I hope, pardon me for observing that the pointed avowal of 
a determination to withhold performance, unless upon certain 
conditions, the communication of which is withheld, might be 
construed into unconditional refusal. Your personal integrity 
and honor, my Lord, the acknowledged justice of his Majesty, 
and the pride of British faith, prohibit me from harboring that 
idea. But it may perhaps be entertained by my countrymen, 
and if it should, it may lead to measures, which in their consequences may eventually induce the two nations to seek rather 
the means of reciprocal injury, than of mutual advantage. I 
humbly hope that this may never happen. The sentiment of 
America has long been conciliatory, and I should feel inexpressible satisfaction if your Grace would supply me with the means 
of restoring activity to her friendly dispositions. 
I have the honor to be, &c.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor to address you on the sixteenth of August, 
and stated as nearly as I could the situation of Russia and Sweden. This situation has produced a very natural effect. Sweden being unsupported by her allies, and Russia having nothing 
to gain by farther fighting, but a part of the Finland deserts, 
not worth fighting for, they have struck a bargain of peace 
immediately, without the interference of any one else. This 
leaves the Russian and Turk to pursue their game single hand 
ed. The ministers of Britain are by no means well pleased, 
that they were not consulted by the Swedes; and I think it 
probable, that if Russia makes peace with the Turks, it will be 
</p><p>
without the mediation of Prussia or England. For, as things 
are situated, it seems impossible for those powers to do the 
Empress any mischief before next spring. 
</p><p>
The National Assembly of France have also adopted, as a national compact, the old family compact with Spain, and they 
are arming as fast as their disjointed condition will admit. At 
the same time, the general opinion of this country seemed to be, 
that the ministry would obtain very honorable terms from Spain, 
whereas the ministers themselves were, asl believe, much embarrassed as to the line of conduct which they should pursue. 
To support the high tone in which they first opened, would 
probably bring on a bloody war for an empty sound. To re 
cede, would expose them to severe animadversion at home, 
and a loss of reputation abroad. These circumstances appearing to me favorable, I wrote the letter of the tenth instant, of 
which a copy is enclosed. It is calculated first, to operate up 
on an administration, which I believed to be divided in regard 
to America, and a sovereign who hates the very name, while 
he prides himself upon his piety and moral fame. Secondly, 
it was intended as a ground of future justification for any measures, which congress might think proper to adopt ; and thirdly, 
it had, I own, a special view to the nature of this government 
and people ; for if they do eventually get engaged in war, and 
feel a little from our coldness, and if, in addition thereto, the 
commercial men find any ground of complaint, it will make 
them so eager to rectify their mistake, as to give us considerable advantages. 
</p><p>
In answer to this letter I received his of the same date, a copy of which is likewise enclosed, This was written in his 
own hand writing, and as it is said therein to be not ministerial, but confidential, we must so consider it. Consequently it 
is not a public paper. The inference to be drawn from it is, that the council could not agree as yet upon the answer to be 
given. Hence I concluded, that those who, pursuing the interests of Great Britain, wish to be on the best terms with 
America, are outnumbered by those, whose sour prejudices and hot resentment render them averse to every intercourse, except 
that which may immediately subserve a selfish policy. These men do not yet know America. Perhaps America does not 
yet know herself. They believe that British credit is essential to our commerce. Useful, it certainly is, at present ; but let 
our public credit be well established and supported, and in a very few years our commercial resources will astonish the 
world. We are yet but in the seeding time of national prosperity, and it will be well not to mortgage the crop before it is 
gathered. Excuse, I pray Sir, this digression. The matter of it is not wholly inapplicable. 
</p><p>
I waited upon the Duke of Leeds by appointment on the 
fifteenth instant, and I saw at once by his countenance, that he 
felt obliged to act an awkward part. I waited, therefore, for 
him to begin the conversation, which he did by saying he understood I was going to America. I told him he had mistaken 
my letter, for that by the continent I meant the continent of 
Europe. After some pause he said, that he hoped soon to fix 
upon a minister to America. That they had a person in contemplation, who was not however absolutely agreed on. I did not 
ask who it was. After a farther pause he said, that in order to 
save time, and obviate difficulties, the intention was to send 
over a gentleman with a common letter of recommendation, but 
having letters of credence in his pocket. I expressed my perfect approbation of this expedient. He told me that he was 
earnestly desirous of a real bond fide connexion, not merely by 
the words of a treaty, but in reality. I met these by similar 
professions, but took care to confine them to a commercial intercourse for mutual benefit on liberal terms. 
</p><p>
He told me, that as to the two points of the treaty, there 
were still difficulties. He wished they could be got out of the 
way. He then hesitated a little, and dropped the conversation. 
Having waited sometime for him to resume it, and being convinced by his silence that it was intended to hold a conference 
and say nothing, I determined to try for information in a different way, I began, therefore, by expressing with an air of serious concern my conviction, that their detention of the western 
posts would form an insurmountable barrier against a treaty with 
us. Knowing so well as he did the nature of popular governments, he would not be surprised, that some in America should 
oppose a treaty with Britain from serious doubt as to the policy 
of the measure, and others from private reasons ; and he must 
see that holding those posts would form an argument for one, 
and a pretext for the other. Finding that he felt this, I added, 
that their conduct in this respect gave serious alarm to reasonable well meaning men. Some believed their design was to deprive us of our share in the fur trade, which they considered as 
a serious injury, but others were convinced that holding those 
posts was attended with great and useless expense to Britain, 
which the benefits of the fur trade by no means compensated, 
and even that she would derive those benefits whether that trade 
were carried on through the medium of Canada, or of the United States. Hence they inferred some other, and consequently some hostile views. So that every murder committed by the 
Indians was attributed to British intrigue ; and although some 
men of liberal minds might judge differently, their arguments would have little weight with the many, who felt them 
selves aggrieved. He owned that there was force in these reflections. I told him further, that I did not presume to judge of 
the great circle of European politics ; but according to my limited comprehension, I was led to suppose, that they could not 
act with the same decisive energy towards their neighbors, 
while they doubted of our conduct. 
</p><p>
He said I was perfectly right; and he said so in a manner 
which showed, that this had been urged and felt during the late 
negotiations. I proceeded, therefore, a little farther, premising 
that this conversation was merely from one gentleman to 
another, and prayed him to consider, that in a war between 
Britain and the House of Bourbon, (a thing that must happen 
at some time or other,) we can give the West India Islands to 
whom we please, without engaging in the war ourselves, and our 
conduct must be governed by our interest. He acknowledged that this was naturally to be expected, and it seemed from his 
manner, that the same thing had been represented before, but 
not in such strong colors. I observed, that those preferences 
which we had a right to impose would have a most extensive 
operation ; assured him of my sincere belief, that their exclusive system, as far as it related to the commerce of their islands, 
had a tendency to injure that navigation, which it was their object to increase, because if we met them on equal ground of 
restriction, they would lose more in one way than they gained 
in another ; that they had many large ships employed in carrying the single article of tobacco ; and if we should pass a navigation act to meet theirs, they could not bring us a yard of 
cloth which contained Spanish wool, and so of other things. I 
thought I could perceive, that considerations like these had al 
ready given them some alarm. I therefore said, that I supposed his people had transmitted information of the attempts 
made in congress to adopt such regulations. He said they had. 
I observed that not having yet received the laws passed by 
congress I should not say exactly what had been done. That 
I hoped things were yet open for treaty. That doubtless there 
were many persons in this country, who, to gratify the resentment occasioned by losses or disappointments in the American 
war, would be glad to urge on a state of commercial hostilities ; 
but this would prove, perhaps, a losing game to both. He 
really thought it would. 
</p><p>
Having gone as far in that line as was useful, I took a short 
turn in my subject, and said I had waited with great patience 
during the negotiations they were carrying on, because I sup 
posed they would naturally square their conduct towards us by 
their position in respect to other nations. I made this observation in a careless manner, as a thing of course ; but immediately fixing my eye upon him, he showed that it was exactly 
the circumstance they had wished to conceal. I added, that 
finding the northern courts were at peace, and supposing they 
had come to their final decisions with respect to the House of 
Bourbon, I thought it probable that they were prepared to 
speak definitely to us also. Here I waited for his answer, which, indeed, I did not expect to receive. He was sufficiently embarrassed, and from his look and manner I collected quite as much as he was willing to communicate. 
</p><p>
After some little sayings of no consequence, he asked me 
what the United States would think of the undefined claim of 
Spain to America. Having no objection to take that information from his questions, which could not be drawn forth in his 
answers, I told him that it would make no impression on our 
minds. That the Spaniards, being in fact apprehensive of danger from us, were disposed to make sacrifices for our friend 
ship. That the navigation of the Mississippi, hitherto the bone 
of contention, was, I believed, given up by them already, or 
soon would be so ; and as for their claims, they never could 
affect us, and therefore we did not care anything about them. 
That the reason for withholding that navigation, hitherto, was 
the fear of contraband trade, and for the same reason they 
must, in my opinion, sacrifice the last man, and last shilling, 
upon the question about Nootka Sound. He said he had al 
ways thought the danger of contraband ought to be considered 
in dealing on this subject, for that nations, like individuals, 
ought to treat with candor and honesty. We had a good deal 
of conversation on that, and other topics, in which America 
was not directly concerned ; and then I told him, that if they 
came to any determination in regard to us speedily, I should 
wish to be apprized of it. He assured me that I should, and 
offered to make his communications to you through me, and 
for that purpose to address his letters to me in Paris ; but for 
reasons communicated in a former letter, I thought it best to 
decline this offer, and therefore observed, that his own packets 
would give him a speedier and more certain means of conveyance. I then took my leave. 
</p><p>
I have troubled you, Sir, with the leading features of this 
conversation, that you might the better judge of the conclusions 
I draw from it. I think the cabinet is divided on the question 
of war or peace. If France appeared strong enough to excuse 
a retrograde manoeuvre, I believe they would discover all at 
once that Spain has better reasons to urge, than they had been 
before apprized of, and therefore, on principles of justice, and 
having received the strongest assurances of brotherly love from 
the Catholic King, the Defender of the Faith would disarm. 
His ministers will not treat with us at present, unless they can 
see their way to an offensive and defensive alliance, which we 
shall be in no hurry to contract. Should war break out, the 
anti- American party will, I believe, agree to any terms ; for 
it is more the taste of the medicine which they nauseate, than 
the quantity of the dose. Mr Pitt, T believe, wishes a continuance of peace. Observe that he is rather the Queen's 
man than the King s, and that since his Majesty's illness, she 
has been of great consequence. This depends in part on a 
medical reason. To prevent the relapse of persons who have 
been mad, they must be kept in constant awe of somebody ; 
and it is said that the physician of the king gave the matter in 
charge to his royal consort, who performs that, like every other part of her conjugal duty, with singular zeal and perseverance. He, and all those who are in possession of his entire 
confidence, wish, it is said, for war ; which gives, you know, 
great patronage, and, by the increase of taxes and offices, in 
creases the influence and power of the crown. The king, and 
his friends, are also violently indisposed to America. 
</p><p>
Things being so situated, and having business on the continent, I shall leave this city in a few days, and shall perhaps 
write a further letter of lamentations to the Duke of Leeds before I go. I intend to write such a letter to you on the whole 
business, as may, in case of need, be laid before the legislature, and consequently before the public. 
</p><p>
I long since expressed my opinion to you, Sir, that the appearances of prosperity here were fallacious. In nothing are 
they more so, than in the affairs of the India Company, which are deplorably bad ; and they are now engaged in a war with Tippoo Saib, which, terminate how it may, must make them worse. 
</p><p>
It is time to close this long epistle. Let me therefore entreat you to receive the assurances of that sincere respect and esteem, with which I have the honor to be, &c.

</p><p>
My Lord, 
</p><p>
An application which has been made to me by a Mr Samuel Makins, master of an American ship, and which I have 
formerly transmitted to Mr Burgess, brings forward some points 
on which I find myself, most reluctantly, obliged to trouble 
your Grace. 
</p><p>
It appears, first, that the American ship was stopped on the 
high seas, and detained by a British vessel of war, which took 
away several of the crew, and kept one, who was a British subject. Secondly, it appears that seamen taken in this port from 
an American ship, who have sworn before a magistrate in America that they are American citizens, are nevertheless detained, 
unless the master of the ship will swear that they were born 
in America. And thirdly, it appears that American seamen, 
who have entered on board of a British ship of war, are detained, notwithstanding the claims made by the master to whom 
they are bound by the usual articles. 
</p><p>
On the first point, I am obliged to mention, my Lord, that 
interrupting vessels in their voyages, and taking away those 
who navigate them, may have disagreeable consequences ; and 
by reminding your Grace of that sentiment, which was excited 
by the conduct of a Spanish frigate in Nootka Sound, I render, 
I am sure, all comments unnecessary. 
</p><p>
On the second point, I must take the liberty to observe, that 
the very circumstance of being on board an American ship 
ought to raise a presumption of citizenship ; but when that is 
Strengthened by the oaths of the men taken in America, proof 
should be required to overturn, not to corroborate it. But, my 
Lord, it must be impossible to obtain the evidence required, in 
many cases, unless the master will hazard a deposition to facts 
not in his knowledge. Another circumstance of a most delicate nature is, the insisting that none but persons born in 
America shall be privileged from the impress. I humbly 
conceive, my Lord, that previous to the year <a href='/results.php?year=1775'>1775</a>, those born 
in America were equally subjects of his Majesty, with those 
born in England, and many of them, I believe, still continue 
so. By the treaty of peace, the sovereign of this country relinquished all rights over those then in America, who chose to 
take the benefit of it ; and if the compact can be set aside in 
the case of a mariner, I fear that many others will no longer 
rely upon it. This idea, my Lord, presses much upon my 
mind. 
</p><p>
On the third point, I pray leave to submit to your Grace, 
whether it is consistent to claim British seamen, who have contracted to serve in American vessels, and yet withhold Ameri 
can seamen, who have contracted to serve in British vessels. 
Pardon me for adding, that this would justify a practice, which 
I hope may never take place, of manning the privateers of 
your enemies with the seamen of America. 
</p><p>
In my regard for the peace and happiness of the two countries, your Grace will find, I trust, the proper apology for bringing these things before you. I the less regret having been detained in town for that purpose, as it gives me an occasion to 
reiterate the assurances of that respect, with which I have the 
honor to be, &tc.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
Just about to leave this city, I have been detained for some 
hours by an object, which appears to me important. I have 
already had occasion to mention the impress of American seamen, to serve on board of British ships of war. The ministers 
seemed desirous of doing what was right, and of avoiding just 
ground of complaint) but the orders for an impress being of 
necessity entrusted to agents, neither scrupulous nor delicate, it 
becomes as barbarous in the execution, as in the principle it is 
violent and despotic. Allowances are to be made in judging 
such cases, but I had been given to understand &gt; that the principles adopted by the administration were such as ought not 
by us to be admitted. 
</p><p>
I must own to you, Sir, that my position was, in this respect, 
disagreeable. I did not wish to assume the management of af 
fairs not committed to me, nor put on the appearance of a 
character, to which I had no pretension ; and yet, I could not 
be an indifferent witness to the injuries sustained by my fellow 
citizens. Liable to censure for neglect, and to the imputation 
of hunting employment, but feeling alike guiltless of the one, 
and incapable of the other, I determined neither to seek for 
causes of complaint, nor yet to avoid them, but submit my con 
duct to the dictate of occasion. Pardon me, Sir, for making 
myself my subject. To you an explanation of actions and mo 
tives is due. And as for the world, T shall never take pains to 
conceal the one, nor communicate the other. 
</p><p>
On the seventeenth instant, Mr Cutting called to mention the 
case of an American, who had been impressed, and, after an 
order obtained for his release, had been ill used, confined, and 
was then in fetters, expecting severe and ignominious punishment. I immediately went to Whitehall, and waited some time 
for the Duke of Leeds, or Mr Burgess, to arrive. Mr Burgess 
at length came ; and upon my showing him the papers, and ex 
plaining the business, he immediately took measures to procure 
the needful redress. He expressed, at the same time, in very 
proper terms, the regret he felt for such abuses of authority, 
Next morning, Captain Makins applied to me, (as being acquainted with the owners of his ship,) to assist in procuring the 
release of his mate and seamen. He told me, that previous 
to his leaving New York, a part of his crew had made oath that they were citizens of America. Arrived at the mouth of 
the channel, he was stopped by a British frigate, which took 
away some of them, but at length returned all except one, who 
was an Irishman. After this, he passed several vessels of war, 
without receiving either insult or molestation ; but in the river, 
so many of his men were taken out, that he was obliged to hire 
others, for the security of his ship. Some of the men so taken were induced to enter into the British service, as he 
informed me, by ill usage, threats, and particularly by the assurance, that having nobody here to speak for them, their case 
was desperate, and therefore they might as well take the bounty as let it alone, for go they must. 
</p><p>
Many aggravating circumstances were related ; but as these 
are generally foreign to the merits of a question, I desired him 
to write me a letter, simply stating the facts. Among these, 
were a refusal to deliver the men who had entered, a rejection 
of all evidence other than his oath, and .the insisting that this 
evidence should prove the men to have been born in America. 
I immediately transmitted that letter, with the papers accompanying it, to Mr Burgess, who sent them to Mr Stephens, the 
Secretary of the Admiralty. Yesterday, Captain Makins called 
again, complaining that he could get no satisfaction from the 
admiralty board, nor from the regulating captain ; but on the 
contrary was treated by the latter with insult. I immediately 
wrote a note to Mr Burgess, who assigned the death of Mr Stephens son in a duel, as the cause why the affair had been 
neglected ; and gave me the assurance, that he would pay every 
attention to it. An event so distressing would certainly call 
from all other cares the mind of a father. I could not, there 
fore, insist on the decisive answer which I wished. But having been repeatedly told, that the practice was such as is above 
mentioned, I wrote to the Duke of Leeds the letter, of which 
the enclosed is a copy. You will perceive, Sir, that I have 
sought rather to bring forward the particular objects for consideration, than to dilate those observations to which they give 
rise. I will not trouble you with any comment on this transaction, but only entreat that you will excuse my interference. 
Having acted without authority, there is at least this advantage 
to the public, that my conduct may be avowed or disavowed, 
as circumstances shall render most proper. I am, &c.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My last letter was of the twenty-fourth of September. Since 
that period, I have passed through Flanders and a part of Germany, and having coasted the Rhine to Strasburg, came thence 
to this city. 
</p><p>
As I conjectured, so it has happened, that my longer continuance in London would have been useless. Spain finding from 
the revolt of the marine, and other circumstances, that whatever might be the intention, or rather wish, of France, no real 
aid could be hoped for from a country, where even the semblance of authority is gone, has submitted to the imperious demands of Britain. This is a great point in the general system. 
From henceforth, the benefits derived by Spain from her colonies must wither away, and if she should hereafter wage war 
to cancel an onerous compact, it is highly probable, that one or 
more independent monarchies maybe established in that large 
portion of the new world, which she now occupies. Nothing 
of this sort can be indifferent to us. In the great course 
of events, which divine Providence may have marked out, 
human wisdom can do but little, and to effect that little, we 
must approach as nearly as possible to our comprehension 
the view of futurity, and bestow on the present that cool 
consideration, with which every one can examine the deeds 
that were done in the old time before us. The independence of all America will place us forward as the bulwark of 
our neighbors ; and at the same time, it must loosen our hold 
upon Europe. I consider the several colonies to the south of 
us, as a pledge in our hands for the good conduct of those powers to which they belong. We now derive an influence from 
their reciprocal jealousies,, which we shall soon, I trust, secure 
by our own internal force. This subject opens a field too vast 
for present discussion, but it leads to another of narrower com 
pass, which we at present tread. 
</p><p>
England will not, I am persuaded, enter into a treaty with 
us, unless we give for it more than it is worth now, and infinitely more than it can be worth hereafter. Had they got engaged in a war, and could they in such war have obtained our aid. 
they would have paid high. But no price could, in my poor 
opinion, have compensated to us the ill consequences which 
must have followed. In proportion as her commerce with our 
neighbors becomes more extensive, and our naval force more 
evident, in that same proportion shall we find the advantage of 
being freed from any stipulations with her. A present bargain 
would be that of a young heir with an old usurer. Believing 
in our wants, she will impose terms which we ought not, cannot consent to. This, at least,, is my serious belief, A different idea may be entertained by others, who have better information, more experience, or clearer judgment; and the propriety of each opinion must be decided by the arbitrament of 
time. At present we may consider the western posts, which 
belong to us, as a part of what Britain means to give for privileges of trade,, which in her hands turn always to gold. This, 
which is very like buying us with our own. money, would enable the minister to go down to the House of Commons with 
perfect ease and self complacency. I am, &c.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I did not receive your letter of the twelfth of August, until 
yesterday afternoon, or I should have made an earlier reply. 
</p><p>
I am very happy to find that you approve of the ground on 
which the interchange of ministers with this country was placed, 
and the judgment formed respecting the posts. I am led to 
fear, that my conduct in regard to our impressed seamen has 
not been equally fortunate ; but I hope the interference will 
be excused. Having no other guide, than my own sense of 
our interest and honor, it is not improbable that I may have 
missed my way. It was with much anxiety that I took any 
one of those steps, to which I found myself impelled. 
</p><p>
My letters to the President, subsequent to the month of May, 
will have communicated my conduct, and the opinion by which 
it was directed. I flatter myself, that on the subject of an alliance with this country, they will be found conformable to the 
sentiments which you express, and which will ever I hope govern the councils of our country. 
</p><p>
It was my good fortune also to anticipate your ideas respecting the designs of Britain upon the Spanish possessions, and 
therefore, whenever they mentioned to me the claims of Spain 
as highly interesting to us, I declared, (but as my private opinion only,) that we should view those claims of exclusive right 
with perfect indifference, from a conviction that it never would 
be exercised to our prejudice. This was with the double view 
of keeping up their disquietude about connexions, which we 
might form with Spain, and of preventing them from having 
any shadow of pretext to embroil us with that court hereafter, 
should the existing dispute be amicably adjusted. 
</p><p>
Before I dismiss this subject, indulge me with your pardon 
for hinting an idea, on which I have formed no decisive opinion, but which may perhaps merit some consideration. Spain, 
from the situation of France, the sense of her own weakness, 
and the effects of her late treaty with Britain, may, perhaps, 
wish for an effectual guarantee of her transatlantic dominions ; 
and perhaps she may deem that which we can give more important, than what Britain holds out. Perhaps she might incline 
to give something valuable for our friendship and protection. 
</p><p>
The convention between Britain and Spain having been completed, and a bill for the government of Quebec being in 
agitation, I thought it might be well to pass a few days here, 
and therefore, having private business sufficient to prevent the 
drawing of any direct conclusions of a public nature, I came 
hither on Sunday, the twelfth instant. I made the needful 
inquiries respecting the Quebec system, and on the fourteenth 
called at Whitehall. The Duke of Leeds being absent, I left 
a card, and on the eighteenth paid his Grace another visit. 
The council was then breaking up, and as he had much to do, 
he sent Mr Burgess to me with an apology. This gentleman 
gave me a deal of civil nothingness 5 was glad that our difficulties about the impress were at an end ; had during my absence 
received frequent applications from Mr Cutting, and, in consequence of what passed between us, had paid every attention to 
them. Administration had every desire I could wish for treaty. 
Many cabinet councils had been held upon it. A great many 
difficulties had arisen in fixing on- the persons to whom the 
management should be committed. This matter, however, was 
adjusted. A reference had been made above three months 
since to Lord Hawkesbury. His Lordship very diligent, but 
his report not yet made. When received, no time would be 
lost in setting all the different engines at work. Hoped we 
should soon have residents with each other, &ic. &tc. &c. I 
heard him quietly out, and then replied, that I was sorry to 
have interrupted his attention to other affairs. Having been 
called by private business to London, I thought it my duty to 
let them know I was alive. If his Grace wished to see me, I 
would wait on him at such time as he might indicate ; that my 
stay here would be short ; that I should write to America before 
my departure, and if I learnt nothing more than that things remained in the same state of uncertainty in which I had left them 
I should say so. It was for them and not for me to consider 
what consequences delay might produce to the British commerce. 
</p><p>
The reputation of the United States rises fast ; and although 
our enemies make objections to the funding system^ yet that 
</p><p>
step towards the establishment of public credit has produced a 
sensible effect on those opinions, which no administration will 
wholly disregard. I am, &c.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
This will accompany what I had the honor to write on 
the twenty-fourth. In the afternoon of that day I received a note from Mr Burgess, appointing an hour on the twenty-fifth for an interview with the Duke of Leeds. I attended, 
but something or other kept his Grace away. The twenty-sixth I received a note apologizing for the disappointment, and 
requesting my attendance the twenty-seventh. I waited on 
him again. A note had been sent, informing me that a severe 
indisposition kept the Duke at home ; but this I did not receive 
in season to prevent the visit. Mr Burgess therefore mentioned to me the contents of it. The Duke, it seems, wished, if 
I had any communications to make before I went to Paris, that 
they should come through Mr Burgess. I told him, that as he 
well knew, I had to make none, and only put myself in the 
way of receiving them. He said that the business remained 
as it was when he last spoke to me ; that he could now say, 
however, the Duke had a person in his eye to be sent to 
America. I told him carelessly, that I had heard Mr Elliott 
was appointed. He said no appointment had been made ; it 
would be improper, until they should have determined what 
such person was to do. I smiled at this, and he was a little 
confused. He said he wished to make their communications 
through me, and hoped I should be again in London next spring. I told him, that perhaps I might, but that was of no 
consequence ; they could easily find a channel of their own. 
</p><p>
There was nothing in this which at all surprised me. It needs no comment,- and is, indeed, exactly what I expected. 
Next spring they will know better what to look for from their 
present negotiations. This intended appointment of Mr Elliott was during the height of the armament. He, on being 
spoken to, thought the affair was concluded, and mentioned it 
to his friends. One of them told me of it. At that time he 
was to have gone out immediately ; but the whole affair is now 
suspended. 
</p><p>
I am, &c.

</p><p>
IF I should attempt, my dear Sir, to thank you for the kind 
introductions you have given me to your friends, I could not 
succeed in giving expression to my feelings. You, who know 
how much they are attached to you, will better conceive, than 
I can describe, the cordial reception which these letters procured me. The more I see of Paris, the more sensible I am of 
your sacrifices in leaving it, to traverse a great ocean, and establish yourself with a people, as yet too new to relish that society, which forms here the delight of life. For devoting thus 
to the public service both your time and enjoyments, you have 
as yet been but poorly recompensed. The rich reward re 
mains behind, in that success, which I hope and believe will 
at length crown your efforts to unite the two countries in bonds 
of interest and affection indissoluble. 
</p><p>
Your nation is now in a most important crisis, and the great 
question, shall we hereafter have a constitution, or shall will 
continue to be law, employs every mind, and agitates every 
heart in France. Even voluptuousness itself rises from its 
couch of roses, and looks anxiously abroad at the busy scene to 
which nothing can now be indifferent. 
</p><p>
Your nobles, your clergy, your people, are all in motion for 
the elections. A spirit, which has been dormant for generations, starts up and stares about, ignorant of the means of obtaining, but ardently desirous to possess its object, consequently, active, energetic, easily led, but also easily, too easily 
misled. Such is the instinctive love of freedom, which now 
grows warm in the bosom of your country. That respect for 
his sovereign, which forms the distinctive mark of a French 
man, stimulates and fortifies on the present occasion those sentiments, which have hitherto been deemed most hostile to monarchy ; for Louis the Sixteenth has himself proclaimed from 
the throne a wish, that every barrier should be thrown down, 
which time or accident may have opposed to the general felicity of his people. 
</p><p>
It would be presumptuous in me even to guess at the effects 
of such causes, operating on materials and in situations, of which 
I confess to you the most profound ignorance. I feel that I 
have already gone too far, in attempting to describe what I 
think I have perceived. But before I quit the subject, I must 
express the wish, the ardent wish, that this great ferment may 
terminate, not only to the good, but to the glory of France. 
On the scenes which her great theatre now displays, the eyes 
of the Universe are fixed, even with anxiety, and the national 
honor is deeply interested in a successful issue. Indulge me 
also, I pray, in conveying the opinion, that until that issue be 
known, every arrangement both foreign and domestic must 
feel a pause. 
</p><p>
Horace tells us, that in crossing the sea we change our climate, not our souls. I can say,, what he could not, that I find 
on this side of the Atlantic a resemblance to what I left on the other ; a nation which exist in hopes, prospects, and expectations. The reverence for ancient establishments gone, existing 
forms shaken to the very foundation, and a new order of things 
about to take place, in which, perhaps, even the very names of 
all former institutions will be disregarded. 
</p><p>
To judge of the present turmoil, I can give you no better 
standard, than by telling you what is seriously true, that when I 
took up the pen, it was to give you news of your friends, and 
to describe the impression made on my mind by the objects, 
which incessantly present themselves in this great capital, I will 
not say of France, but of Europe. And have I done it ? Yes ; 
for the one great object in which all are engaged has swallowed 
up, like the rod of Aaron in Egypt, every other enchantment 
by which France was fascinated. I am determined, however, 
after having pestered you so much with a recital of what will be 
told you from other quarters much more intelligibly, and with a 
knowledge of all the secret springs which produce those movements, I am determined, I say, that this letter shall give you 
some entertainment; and for this purpose, I shall enclose in it 
several letters from your friends, who have charged me with 
the very agreeable commission of transmitting them to you. 
</p><p>
I will trespass no farther on your patience ; but still I must 
impose the task on your good nature, of presenting my affection 
ate remembrances to my friends, who are about you. I will 
write to them if J have time, but the hours fly so quickly in Pa 
ris ! I will not let them escape me, without assuring you of the 
esteem and respect, with which 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
As soon as I can place objects here in due arrangement, I 
shall proceed to Holland. Before I take there my last engagements, I wish most earnestly to be, through you, in such treaty 
as to leave room, for I expect that those engagements will bind 
me as to all future operations. From Holland I shall perhaps 
be obliged to go to England. But I contemplate, in all cases, 
a return to this capital, as speedily as possible ; and from hence 
I wish to go to Madrid. You will calculate, however, that as 
the most important scene acted for many years on the Euro 
pean theatre will, in the next spring, be displayed at this place. 
I, in common with all others, have a curiosity to see it. You 
must also consider, that I have motives stronger than curiosity; 
for until the States-General shall have decided on the important 
objects for which they are convened, their government can 
make no solid arrangements for anything. Of this be assured, 
that if nothing happens very unexpected, I will see you in 
Spain before I return to America. 
</p><p>
Lafayette is out of town. He is gone to Auvergne to get 
himself elected, either for the Noblesse or the Tiers Etats. I 
hope the former, for he would otherwise, in my opinion, be too 
desperately estranged from those of his own class. As he did 
not communicate to me his hesitation, I presume that he had 
determined, for he made some important communications just 
before his departure. Apropos a term which my Lord Chesterfield well observes we generally use to bring in what is not 
at all to the purpose apropos then, I have here the strangest employment imaginable. A republican, and just as it were 
emerged from that assembly, which has formed one of the most 
republican of all republican constitutions, I preach incessantly 
respect for the prince, attention to the rights of the nobility, and moderation, not only in the object, but also in the pursuit 
of it. All this, you will say, is none of my business ; but I 
consider France as the natural ally of my country, and of 
course, that we are interested in her prosperity ; besides, to 
say the truth, I love France, and, as I believe the king to be 
an honest and good man, I sincerely wish him well, and the 
more so, as I am persuaded that he earnestly desires the felicity of his people. I am, &ic.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Herewith you have a copy of what I had the honor to write on the twenty-third of last month. Since that period, there 
are advices here, which announce the re-establishment of the King of Great Britain's health ; but from a letter I have just 
now received from the Marquis de la Luzerne, I am disposed to doubt the fact. 
</p><p>
The other day I saw the Due de Castries, who served in 
America under the title of the Comte de Charlu. He desired 
to be remembered to you, and so did General Duplessis,j &gt; who 
has been promoted lately. Our friend, the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>, is now in Auvergne attending his election. This coun 
try presents an astonishing spectacle to one, who has collected 
his ideas from books and information half a dozen years old. 
Everything is a P Anglais, and a desire to imitate the English 
prevails alike in the cut of a coat, and the form of a constitution. Like the English, too, all are engaged in parliamenteering ; and when we consider how novel this last business must 
be, I assure you their progress is far from contemptible. 
</p><p>
Poor General Chastellux is no more. I have seen his widow, an amiable woman, who is not the less lovely for the tears she sheds to his memory. A fine boy remains as the 
pledge of connubial tenderness. I think it would give her great pleasure, if you took the trouble to mingle in a short letter condolence for one event, and congratulations for the other. You 
would in that case oblige me by confiding the letter to my care. Excuse me, I pray, for dropping this hint, and do me the justice to believe, that with sincere esteem and respect I am yours,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Although I am much pressed for time, and consequently 
cannot indulge myself in the pleasure of a long conversation, I 
must pay you a visit, and say how do you do, while I deliver 
the packages, which Mr Jefferson is so kind as to entrust to 
my care. I will not have the assurance, with his dispatches in 
my hand, to say a word about politics. And more especially, 
as he has not only the advantage, by frequent access to the 
ministers, of seeing more distinctly those movements, which 
others contemplate at a distance ; but also because he is very 
much in the confidence of the patriotic party here, and consequently well informed of their views and intentions. 
</p><p>
If, in the course of my observations, anything should turn 
up worthy of notice, I will seize an early opportunity to make 
the communication. But my present opinion is, that until 
some time after the States- General shall have assembled, this 
government will offer little or nothing for the contemplation of 
your department. If any new lesson were wanting to impress 
on our hearts a deep sense of the mutability of human affairs, the double contrast between France and America two years 
ago, and at the present moment, will surely furnish that important lesson. 
</p><p>
I trust that my country, in proportion as she acquires dignity by wise and honest measures, will show to others the respect and attention, which, while they flatter and conciliate the 
weak on whom they are bestowed, shed lustre on the greatness from which they emanate. I wish but why attempt to 
express those hopes and wishes, which constantly swell my 
heart for her prosperity ? To read or write them all would 
tire both you and me ; besides, it is a useless task, for I am persuaded you will find them all in your own bosom. I am, etc.

My Dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
I am pretty well convinced that I am not fit for a traveller  
and yet I thought otherwise when I left America. But what will 
you say to a man, who has passed through Rouen without 
looking at the great bell, and who has been above two months 
in Paris without ascending to the top of Notre Dame ; who 
has not been inside of any church whatever, except one which 
is building ; who has not been but three times at Versailles, 
and on neither of those times has seen the King or Queen, or 
had the wish to see them ; and who, if he should continue here 
twenty years, would continue in ignorance of the length of the 
Louvre, the breadth of the Pont Neuf, the depth of the Seine, 
and a thousand other lengths, breadths, and dimensions, which 
are of the last importance, as everybody knows ? 
</p><p>
Should you ask me what I have seen, I might reply in the 
words of Nat Hyde, of stammering memory, It is hard to say. 
A man in Paris lives in a sort of whirlwind, which turns him 
round so fast that he can see nothing. And as all men and 
things are in the same vertiginous condition, you can neither 
fix yourself nor your object for regular examination. Hence 
the people of this metropolis are under the necessity of pronouncing their definitive judgment from the first glance ; and 
being thus habituated to shoot flying, they have what the sports 
men call a quick sight. Ex pede Herculem. They know a 
wit by his snuff-box, a man of taste by his bow, and a states 
man by the cut of his coat. It is true, that, like other sports 
men, they sometimes miss ; but, then, like other sportsmen, 
too, they have a thousand excuses, besides the want of 
skill. The fault you know may be in the dog, or the bird, or 
the powder, or the flint, or even the gun, without mentioning 
the gunner. 
</p><p>
We are at present in a fine situation for what the bucks and 
bloods would term a frolic, or high fun. The ministers have 
disgusted this city by the manner of convoking them to elect 
their representatives for the States-General, and at the same time 
bread is getting dearer, so that when the people assemble on 
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday next, what with hunger and 
discontent, the least spark would set everything in a flame. 
The state physicians have, by way of antidote, brought between 
fifteen and twenty thousand regular troops within and about 
the city, so that at any rate the bons Bourgeois may not have 
all the fun to themselves. This measure will rather tend to produce than to prevent a riot. For some of the young nobility have 
brought themselves to an active faith in the natural equality of 
mankind, and spurn at everything which looks like restraint. 
There are some anecdotes of this sort, the most whimsical and 
ridiculous imaginable, but I have neither time nor inclination 
to communicate them.

I am, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the pleasure to write to you a short letter on the third 
of last month. <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Monsieur De Lafayette</a> is since returned from 
his political campaign in Auvergne, crowned with success. 
He had to contend with prejudices, and the interests of his 
order, and with the influence of the Queen and Princes, 
(except the Duke of Orleans ;) but he was too able for his 
opponents. He played the orator with as much eclat as ever 
he acted the soldier, and is at this moment as much envied 
and hated as his heart could wish. He is also much beloved 
by the nation, for he stands forward as one of the principal 
champions for her rights. 
</p><p>
The elections are finished throughout this kingdom, except 
in the capital, and it appears from the instructions given to the 
representatives, (called here les Cahiers,) that certain points 
are. universally demanded, which when granted and secured 
will render France perfectly free, as to the principles of the 
constitution. I say the principles, for one generation at least 
will be required to render the practice familiar. We have, I 
think, every reason to wish that the patriots may be successful. 
The generous wish that a free people must have to disseminate freedom, the grateful emotion which rejoices in the happiness of a benefactor, and a strong personal interest as well in 
the liberty as in the power of this country, all conspire to make 
us far from indifferent spectators. 
</p><p>
I say, that we have an interest in the liberty of France. 
The leaders here are our friends. Many of them have imbibed their principles in America, and all have been fired by 
our example. Their opponents are by no means rejoiced at 
the success of our revolution, and many of them are disposed 
to form connexions of the strictest kind, with Great Britain. 
The commercial treaty emanated from such dispositions ; and 
according to the usual course of those events, which are shaped by human wisdom, it will probably produce the exact 
reverse of what was intended by the projectors. The spirit of 
this nation is at present high, and M. Necker is very popular ; 
but if he continues long in the administration, it will be some 
what wonderful. His enemies are. numerous, able, and 
inveterate. His supporters are indifferent as to his fate, and 
will protect him no longer than while he can aid in establishing 
a constitution. But when once that great business is accomplished, he will be left to stand on his own ground. The 
court wish to get rid of him, and unless he shows himself 
very strong in the States-General, they will gratify their wishes. 
His ability as a minister will be much contested in that assembly, but with what success time only can determine. 
</p><p>
The materials for a revolution in this country are very indifferent. Everybody agrees that there is an utter prostration of 
morals; but this general position can never convey to an 
American mind the degree of depravity. It is not by any 
figure of rhetoric, or force of language, that the idea can be 
communicated. A hundred anecdotes, and a hundred thou 
sand examples, are required to show the extreme rottenness 
of every member. There are men and women who are 
greatly and eminently virtuous. I have the pleasure to number many in my own acquaintance ; but they stand forward 
from a back ground deeply and darkly shaded. It is how 
ever from such crumbling matter, that the great edifice of 
freedom is to be erected here. Perhaps, like the stratum of 
rock, which is spread under the whole surface of their country, it may harden when exposed to the air ; but it seems 
quite as likely that it will fall and crush the builders. 
</p><p>
I own to you that I am not without such apprehensions, for 
there is one fatal principle which pervades all ranks. It is a 
perfect indifference to the violation of engagements. Inconstancy is so miogled in the blood, marrow, and very essence of 
this people, that when a man of high rank and importance laughs 
to day at what he seriously asserted yesterday, it is considered 
as in the natural order of things. Consistency is a phenomenon. Judge, then, what would be the value of an association, should such a thing be proposed, and even adopted. The 
great mass of the common people have no religion but their 
priests, no law but their superiors, no morals but their interest. 
These are the creatures who, led by drunken curates, are now 
in the high road a la liberte, and the first use they make of it 
is to form insurrections everywhere for the want of bread. We 
have had a little riot here yesterday, and the day before, and I 
am told that some men have been killed ; but the affair was so 
distant from the quarter in which I reside, that I know nothing of the particulars. 
</p><p>
I am almost at the bottom of my paper, without mentioning 
what I at first intended. Six days ago I got from the maker 
your watch, with two copper keys, and one golden one, and a 
box containing a spare spring and glasses, all which I have de 
livered to Mr Jefferson, who takes charge of them for you. 
I am, &ic.

My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I am too much occupied to find time for the use of a cypher, and in effect the government here is so much occupied 
with its own affairs, that in transmitting to you a letter under 
an envelope there is no risk. This, however, I am pretty 
certain will go safe. The States-General have now been a 
long time in session, and have done nothing. Hitherto they 
have been engaged in a dispute, whether they shall form one 
body or three. The commons, who are represented by a 
number equal to both the others, and who, besides, have at 
least one half the representatives of the clergy, insist on forming a single house. They have succeeded ; but the nobles 
deeply feel their situation. The king, after siding with them, 
was frightened into an abandonment of them. He acts from 
error only. 
</p><p>
The soldiery in this city, particularly the French guards, 
declare they will not act against the people. They are now 
treated by the nobility, and parade about the streets drunk, huzzaing for the Tiers. Some of them have in consequence 
been confined, not by the force but by the adroitness of authority. Last night this circumstance became known, and immediately a mob repaired to the prison. The soldiers on 
guard unfixed their bayonets and joined the assailants. A 
party of dragoons ordered on duty to disperse the rioters, 
thought it better to drink with them, and return back to their 
quarters. The soldiers, with others confined in the same prison, were then paraded in triumph to the Palais Royal, which 
is now the liberty pole of this city, and there they celebrated, 
as usual, their joy. Probably this evening some other prisons will be opened ; for liberte is now the general cry, and 
authority is a name&gt; not a real existence. The court are 
about to form a camp in the neighborhood of Paris, of 25,000 
men, under the command of the Marechal de Broglio. I do 
not know him personally, therefore cannot judge what may be 
expected from his talents ; but all my information goes to the 
point, that he will never bring his army to act against the people. The Gardes du Corps are as warm adherents in general to the Tiers, as anybody else, strange as that may seem ; 
so that, in effect, the sword has slipped out of the Monarch's 
hands, without his perceiving a tittle of the matter. 
</p><p>
All these things in a nation, not yet fitted by education and 
habit for the enjoyment of freedom, give me frequently suspicions, that they will greatly overshoot their mark, if indeed 
they have not already done it. Already some people talk of 
limiting the king's negative upon the laws. And as they have 
hitherto felt severely the authority exercised in the name of 
their princes, every limitation of that authority seems to them 
desirable. Never having felt the evils of too weak an executive, the disorders to be apprehended from anarchy make as 
yet no impression. The provincial assemblies, or administrations, in other words the popular executive of the provinces, 
which Turgot had imagined as a means of moderating the royal 
legislative of the court, is now insisted on as a counter security against the monarch, when they shall have established a 
democratical legislative ; for you will observe, that the noble 
and clerical orders are henceforth to be Vox et preterea nihil. The king is to be limited to the exact sum needful for 
his personal expenses. r \ he management of the public debt 
and revenues to provide for it will be taken entirely out of his 
hands, and the subsistence of the army is to depend on temporary grants. Hence it must follow, that his negative, in what 
ever form reserved, will be of little avail. 
</p><p>
These are the outlines of the proposed constitution, by which 
at the same time Lettres de Cachet are to be abrogated, and 
the liberty of the press established. My opinion is that the 
King, 10 get fairly out of the scrape in which he finds himself, 
would subscribe to anything. And truly, from him, little is to 
be expected in any way. The Queen hated, humbled, mortified feels, and feigns, and intrigues, to save some shattered 
remnants of the royal authority ; but to know that she favors a 
measure is the certain means to frustrate its success. 
</p><p>
The Count d Artois 3 alike hated, is equally busy, but has neither sense to counsel himself, nor to choose counsellors for 
himself, much less to counsel others. The nobles look up to him for support, and lean on what they know to be a broken reed, 
for want of some more solid dependence. In their anguish they curse Necker, who is in fact less the cause than the instrument of their sufferings. His popularity depends now 
more on the opposition he meets with from one party, than any serious regard of the other. It is the attempt to throw him down, which saves him from falling. He has no longer the 
preponderating weight in counsel, which a fortnight ago decided everything. If they were not afraid of consequences, he would be dismissed ; and on the same principle the King has 
refused to accept his resignation. If his abilities were equal to his genius, and he were as much supported by firmness as he 
is swayed by ambition, he would have had the exalted honor of giving a free constitution to above twenty millions of his fellow creatures ; and would have reigned long in their hearts, 
and received the unanimous applause of posterity. But as it is, he must soon fall ; whether his exit will be physical or moral, must depend on events which I cannot foresee. The best 
chance, which royalty has, is, that popular excesses may alarm, At the rate at which things are now going, the King of France must soon be one of the most limited monarchs in Europe. I 
am, &c.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I am to reply to three of your letters. Probably I shall 
make my answer as long as all three of them, and thus in 
quantity at least be even with you. For the rest, we must 
take our chance, because when I take up my pen, I know no 
more what I am going to write, than you will in breaking the 
seal what your are going to read. 
</p><p>
Before all things I am reminded as I go along, that this 
day, the birthday of our republic, demands our filial acknowledgments. A day now at length auspicious, since by the 
establishment of our new constitution we have the fair prospect of enjoying those good things, for which we have had so 
hard a contest. Indulge, I pray you, the effusion of my heart, 
which gratulates itself on this occasion. Feel, with me, the 
transports which I cannot but feel, when every letter from 
America brings confirmation of the public happiness, and 
announces some additional cement to our national union, or 
some useful exhibition of national authority. The opposition sickens with mortal symptoms, and I hope and trust, that 
our countrymen will have the wisdom to wait, before they 
attempt amendments, for those lights of experience, which are 
the only guides that can pretend to infallibility. 
</p><p>
You will find herein a letter from our friend Robert Morris 
to you, which he left open by way of saving himself the trouble of writing to me the public occurrences. In that letter he 
announces a fact, which we have received from other quarters 
with some details, that the House of Representatives have 
resolved to submit the principal direction of the finances to a 
single man. Through this measure I can feel the pulse of 
our government. It is vigorous beyond my hopes, far beyond 
my expectations, and comes up to my wishes. It is the vigor 
of administration, which can alone consolidate recent establjshments. The mass of a nation will always judge rightly of 
their rulers, by the effects of their measures, although they can 
never, penetrate into the nature of the measures themselves. 
From the fruit we know the tree, without pretending to investigate the botanical mysteries of vegetation. The extent of 
our country, and the deliberative freedom of its legislative authority, require an active and vigorous executive. Every 
subordinate power should be tied to the chief, by those inter 
mediate links of will and pleasure, which, like the elasticity of 
the arterial system, render sensible the pulsations of the heart 
at the remotest extremities. For how can the executive be 
accountable, when its members are not subordinate and obedient to the general volition ? But where am I going ? I 
shall, ere I am aware of it, convert a letter of friendship into 
a political essay. But so it is, that if once the ideas get into 
that beaten track, where they have been used to travel, they 
go on, like old cart-horses, with the most determined obstinacy imaginable. 
</p><p>
July 10th. 
</p><p>
You ask me if Mr Jefferson is gone to America. He is 
not, but is ready to depart at a moment's warning, having 
staid here some time expecting to receive his conge by every 
opportunity, but is still in the same expectation. I conclude, that ft will not be expedited, until the arrangement of the 
ministerial departments shall have been completed. It occurs 
to me, while I write, that probably the secretary of foreign 
affairs will decline acting, until appointed under the new 
government, for which I can perceive many reasons. It 
might, for instance, be construed into presumption. It is 
probable, also, that the question of the conge will not be 
agitated, till another question is determined, viz. who shall act 
here in the interim ; and although I doubt not but the secretary, Mr Short, will be empowered, yet until he is, the other 
matter will be delayed. 
</p><p>
You seem surprised, that our minister here does not mention 
me. in his letters ; but cui bono ? He knows that we correspond together. You suppose that he has introduced me to the 
Corps Diplomatique. In this you are mistaken. I hinted that 
matter to him shortly after my arrival. He told me they were 
not worth my acquaintance. I did not press the matter, and I 
am persuaded he assigned his real reason. I have since thought 
that it might have been as well otherwise. But on this chapter of acquaintance I have experienced, I believe, the usual 
fate. I have a set which I have made myself, and these are 
not, you will easily conceive, among the worst company of 
Paris, As to the ministerial dinners, I have not been at them. 
It has never been proposed to me. The ministers, you know ? 
give no invitations themselves, and we are bashful. By the 
bye, I some time since went and asked a dinner of the Count 
de Montmorin, who very kindly assured me at parting, that I 
must in his house consider myself at home ; and this, you know, 
from him is not an unmeaning compliment. I find that you are 
a favorite of the whole family. I am tant de bete that I have not 
since profited by these kind assurances. But what can one do ? 
Versailles is the most triste sejour on earth. And though I am 
tempted by the strong passion of curiosity to go thither, and 
attend the debates of the Etats-Generaux, I have not yet prevailed on myself to do it. I believe no man ever made less use 
of strong recommendations to ministerial people. Probably I 
am wrong, but I cannot help it. I go soon to England, and on 
my return I will endeavor to profit more of circumstances. 
</p><p>
I have attentively noticed what you say respecting the per 
sons, who have been arrested with you for their libels. Had 
any conversation arisen on the subject in my presence, I should 
have given the due explanation ; but people here are too much 
occupied with their own affairs to think of anything else. I 
am happy to find, that the attempts to overturn the existing ad 
ministration chez vous have proved abortive ; because there 
are many chances against your meeting with such good friends 
in a new set, as you have in the old. There are great intrigues 
against the administration here, but hitherto without effect. Be 
fore I enter, however, into the detail of occurrences here, I will, 
in reply to one of your questions, inform you, that I have steadily combatted the violence and excess of those persons, who, 
either inspired with an enthusiastic love of freedom, or prompted by sinister designs, are disposed to drive everything to extremity. Our American example has done them good ; but 
like all novelties, liberty runs away with their discretion, if they 
have any. They want an American Constitution, with the exception of a King instead of a President, without reflecting, 
that they have not American citizens to support that constitution. 
Mankind see distant things in a false point of light, and judge 
more or less favorably than they ought ; this is an old observation ; another, perhaps as old, but which all are not in the position to feel, is^ that we try everything by the standard of pre 
conceived notions ; so that there is an impossibility almost of 
knowing by description a distant people or country. Whoever, therefore, desires to apply, in the practical science of government, those rules and forms which prevail and succeed in a 
foreign country, must fall into the same pedantry with our young 
scholars, just fresh from the university, who would fain bring 
everything to the Roman standard. 
</p><p>
Different constitutions of government are necessary to the 
different societies on the face of this planet. Their difference 
of position is, in itself, a powerful cause, as also their manners 
their habits. The scientific tailor, who should cut after Grecian 
or Chinese models, would not have many customers, either in 
London or Paris ; and those who look to America for their 
political forms are not unlike those tailors in the island of Laputa, who, as Gulliver tells us, always take measure with a 
quadrant. He tells us, indeed, what we should naturally 
expect from such a process, that the people are seldom 
fitted. 
</p><p>
And now for occurrences here, after a digression which is 
not of the shortest. The King, who long ago declared for the 
people, has since been wavering. He is an honest man, and 
wishes really to do good; but he has neither genius nor education to show the way toward that good which he desires. In 
the contest between the representatives of the people, and of 
the nobles, he has, by those about him, been induced to give 
support to the latter ; but he came forward too late, and not in 
the proper manner. The result is, that he has retreated, and 
the nobles have been obliged to give way. In fact, this country has undergone a great change unobservedly. The Noblesse, 
who at this day possess neither the force, the wealth, nor the 
talents of the nation, have rather opposed pride than argument 
to their assailants. Hugging the dear privileges of centuries 
long elapsed, they have clamored about the court, while their 
adversaries have possessed themselves fully of the public confidence everywhere. Knowing and feeling the force of that 
situation, they have advanced with a boldness, which to those 
unacquainted with all the facts, has looked like temerity. But 
this hardihood has been imposing. 
</p><p>
Those who are at the head of the opposition to them are not 
possessed of talents or of virtue. The chief has not even 
courage, without which, you know, that in revolutions, there is 
nothing. The French troops, as far as it can be ascertained, 
would not serve against their countrymen; and the foreign 
troops are not sufficiently numerous to make any serious impression. The people of this city are going, (by that invisible instinct which produces in every animal the conduct peculiar to his situation,) in the same road, which marked the au 
rora of American opposition Three months ago the sight of 
a soldier excited awe. Now they speak of attacking whole 
regiments, and in effect there are not unfrequently some scuffles with the foreign troops. This opinion, which is everything becomes daily fortified. 
</p><p>
While I write, I consider the sovereignty of this country as being effectually lodged in the hands of theJlssemblee Nationale, for you will observe, that this name is assumed instead of 
Etats-Generaux, which is tantamount to an American legislature resolving itself into a convention. They mean immediately to form a constitution, and I have no doubt that they 
will obtain the King's consent. The partisans of the ancient 
establishments have contrived to have a very large body of 
troops assembled in this neighborhood, but if I conjecture 
rightly those troops will soon be dispersed. The National 
Assembly have already marked their disapprobation ; but the 
matter will not stop here, and sooner or later the King must 
send them away. Indeed, I am induced to believe that this 
measure will cause the kingdom to be cleared of foreign troops, 
for not being able to rely on the French regiments, they have 
selected principally the foreigners. The probable object of 
those who are at the bottom of the business, is, to surprise some 
order from his Majesty's fears, which are now continually excited, so that he is constantly the sport of apprehensions. 
</p><p>
But they have a more difficult and dangerous business, than 
they are at all aware of. The Assembly have determined) 
that all taxes shall cease when they separate, except such as 
they may continue or impose. This provides for as long a 
term of existence as they may choose to take, and if dispersed, France will certainly refuse to pay. An army will never 
break a general combination to that effect, so that, either sooner or later, they must submit, and every -show of authority 
now will weaken it without producing any other effect. 
</p><p>
Such, then, is the state of this country, in which I think 
the crisis is past without having been perceived ; and now a free constitution will be the certain result. If they have the 
good sense to give the nobles, as such, some share in the national authority, that constitution will probably endure; bat 
otherwise, it will degenerate into a pure monarchy, or become 
a vast republic, a democracy. Can that last? I think not. 
I am sure not; unless the whole people are changed. In any 
event, however, of the business, it bids fair to change the political face of Europe. But whither am I going ? I am, &c.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor to write to you on the twenty-ninth of April 
last. I shall not trouble you with a recital of events, which Mr Jefferson has, I know, communicated to the office of foreign 
affairs. But being now here on my way to London, and finding a vessel bound directly to New York, I take the opportunity 
to send some tables, which contain the political, military, pecuniary, and commercial state of this country. I believe them 
to be tolerably authentic as far as they go. 
</p><p>
I will also communicate a matter, which Mr Jefferson was 
not yet informed of, and which I could not tell him, because 
I was forbidden to mention it to any person here. You know, 
I dare say, that the Count de Moustiers has his conge. His 
successor will be Colonel Ternant. At first, in the character 
of Charge des Affaires, and when M. de Moustiers is otherwise 
placed, it is highly probable that Ternant may be made Minister ; but that will depend on the situation of the court at the 
time, so that there I only state probability. As to the other, 
you may rely on it, because my intelligence I know to be good. 
The important trait in this appointment is, that he is named as 
a person who will be agreeable to us. 
</p><p>
You may rely, also, on what I am about to mention, but 
which I pray you not to disclose. It is known to very few in 
this country, and may, perhaps, as it ought, be buried in oblivion. The King has actually formed the design of going off 
to Spain. Whether the measures set on foot to dissuade him 
will have, as I hope, the desired effect, time only can discover. His fears govern him absolutely, and they have of late 
been most strongly excited. He is a well meaning man, but extremely weak, and probably these circumstances will in every 
event secure him from personal injury. An able man would 
not have fallen into his situation, but I think that no ability 
can now extricate him. He must float along the current of 
events, being absolutely and entirely a cypher. If, however, 
he should fly, it would not be easy to predict the consequences, 
for this country is at present as near to anarchy as society can 
approach without dissolution. There are some able men in 
the National Assembly, yet the best heads among them would 
not be injured by experience, and unfortunately there are great 
numbers who, with much imagination, have little knowledge, 
judgment, or reflection. You may consider the revolution as 
complete, that is to say, the authority of the King and of the 
nobility is completely subdued ; yet I tremble for the constitution. They have all that romantic spirit, and all those 
romantic ideas of government, which happily for America we 
were cured of before it was too late. They are advancing 
rapidly. But I must check myself, or my reflections will occupy too much space both for you and for me. 
</p><p>
One of the last persons I saw in Paris was M. de Lafayette. 
He had promised to trust me with a letter for you, but he must 
be excused, for he is as busy as a man can be. Not long 
since, speaking to him on his own subject, I told him some 
hints I had given, tending to make him governor of the Isle of 
France, which you know includes Paris. He declared that 
the command of the military in that city only was the utmost of 
his wishes. That he was satiated with power. He had his sovereign, during the late procession to Paris, completely within his 
authority. He had marched him where he pleased, measured 
out the degree of applause he should receive as he pleased, 
and if he pleased could have detained him prisoner. All this is 
strictly true. He commanded on that day at least eighty thou 
sand men, who, during the King's progress through them to the 
Hotel de Ville, shouted Vive la Nation, and only on his return cried Vive la Roi. 
</p><p>
I do not know whether you will be informed of the critical 
situation in which things were placed, just before the last ministry were turned out and the old one restored. My authority 
is very good, but yet I will not vouch for the truth. It was re 
solved to reduce Paris by famine, to take two hundred of the 
States-General prisoners, to dissolve that assembly, and to govern in the old-fashioned way. All this you will say was madness, and therefore improbable. But was it not equally mad 
to drive away Necker, and change the ministry at the time and 
in the manner, which were chosen for that purpose ? The men, 
weak enough for the one, were certainly mad enough for the 
other. Two German regiments, which were to be employed, 
were regaled by the Queen in the Orangerie at Versailles. 
They received promises and largesses, and were prevailed on to 
shout Vive la Reine, Vive le Comte d Jlrtois, Vive la Duchesse 
de Polignac. Afterwards their music played for hours under 
her Majesty's window. The Mareschal de Broglio endeavored, 
at the same time, to conciliate the artillery. But it was at 
length discovered, that, though the troops would shout and sing, 
yet they would not fight against their countrymen. All which 
might have been known long ago. At the moment when their 
intrigue was carrying on by the court, the Gardes du Corps 
and Gardes Fran^aises combined to defend the members of the 
National Assembly. I pass over those facts, which you cannot 
but know, to mention in one word, that the whole army of 
France have declared for liberty ; and that one reason why his 
Majesty has not taken the steps above mentioned, is, that he 
does not know a single regiment that would obey him. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear Sir. I write this letter in much hurry, and 
after much fatigue. Excuse in it everything inaccurate or 
inelegant, and pardon it, on the score of that sincere and affectionate respect, with which I am, &tc.

My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I received a few days past your kind letter from Warsaw, 
without date. The enclosures shall be applied as you desire, 
both in this city and in London, to which latter place I expect 
soon to repair. I have delivered your message to the Countess 
de Segur, and desired Mr Short to send the bust, which he has 
promised, and presents his compliments to you. 
</p><p>
Mr Jefferson is, you know, departed, with intention to return 
next spring. All the accounts received from our country are 
flattering. Freedom, order, and justice are established. Abundance reigns, and there is every just hope of future prosperity. 
As yet, the government have not turned their attention to naval affairs, which, though perhaps more necessary, are less ur 
gent than many others. I do not think that establishments of 
that kind will take place for two or three years to come. Con 
sequently, any views which you may have directed towards 
that object can be for some time suspended. 
</p><p>
You ask me, my dear friend, to give you my advice. This 
is a task both difficult and delicate. A journey to this city can, 
I think, produce nothing but the expense attending it ; for neither pleasure nor advantage can be expected here, by one of 
your profession in particular ; and, except that it is a more dangerous residence than many others, I know of nothing which 
may serve to you as an inducement. 
</p><p>
Whether the Turk will be able to make battle for another 
campaign seems to be considered as uncertain. But from the 
troubles in Brabant, and from the necessity of supporting Sweden through the contest she has been led to engage in, I conclude that peace will not take place this winter ; and if not, the 
Baltic will witness some warm work next year. The cabinet 
of St Petersburg must know what can be depended on before 
the first day of January next, and as it is possible that Sweden 
will get help, (perhaps from Holland,) everything must depend 
on striking early. Hence t conclude, that the ball will be opened in April next, and if you can devise any good plan, it will be 
well to communicate it to the Empress early. I am not sufficiently master of facts to give hints, but I should suppose that 
a manoeuvre towards the mouth of the Baltic, so as to cover 
any assistance that Denmark may feel inclined to give, and pre 
vent the junction of any aid sent from the southward, might be 
no unwise procedure.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Yesterday I went to dine with the Count de Montmorin,  
and expressed to him my wish that France might seize the 
present moment to establish a liberal system of commercial 
policy for her colonies. I observed, that her interest was 
deeply at stake, because America could always dispose of the 
Islands, and would naturally wish to see them in possession 
of that power, under whose government they would be most 
advantageous to her. That nothing could tend so much to 
make the United States desirous of an alliance with Britain, 
as to exclude them from a free trade with the French colonies. 
That, if the metropolis wishes to preserve the affection of her 
distant subjects, and to derive from them the greatest commercial benefit, she ought to suffer them to draw their subsistence from that quarter, where they can obtain it most cheaply. He assured me, that he was fully of my opinion ; said 
that our position rendered it proper to make in our favor an 
exception from their general system respecting other nations, 
and that he hoped, within a fortnight, something might be done. 
But he lamented, as he had done before, that they have no 
chief minister, and consequently no fixed plan nor principles. 
I shall see him again before I depart, and also <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='colleague met'>Monsieur De La Luzerne</a>, within whose department this matter regularly lies. 
He is an adherent to the exclusive system, which is unfortunate. 
</p><p>
In the National Assembly, also, there is a considerable difficulty. Among the most violent of the violent party, are some 
representatives of cities on the western coasts of this kingdom, 
where the chief commerce is with the Islands; and those 
who wish for the closest union with America, do not wish to 
offend these gentlemen; and therefore are desirous of waving 
the matter at present. For my own, I am very desirous that 
the business should be put in train, at least. If successful, so 
much the better  7 but at any rate, it will give an alarm on the 
other side of the channel. If either of these rival nations sets 
the example, the other will soon follow ; and although it is not 
very clear, that the actings and doings of the Assembles Nationale in general will long endure, yet whatever they 
grant to us in this particular business, those who come after 
them will be fearful of retracting. Under these impressions, 
for a long time past, I have been endeavoring to smooth the 
way towards our object, and I believe in the success. 
I am, &tc.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
In another letter of this date, I have mentioned a part of 
yesterday's conversation with the Count de Montmorin. That 
part of it, which I am now to communicate, is for yourself alone. 
As <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Monsieur De Lafayette</a> had asked me some days ago, who 
should be I seat to replace the Comte de JMoustiers, and upon 
my answering with great indifference, that it might be whom he 
pleased, had asked my opinion of Colonel Ternant, I told the 
Count de Montmorin this circumstance ; to which he replied, that 
he had communicated his intention to <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Monsieur De Lafayette</a> 
some time since, in consequence of the intimacy which has long 
subsisted between them. I asked him if he would permit me 
to mention it to you. The idea gave him pleasure, and he 
told me that he should consider it as a very great kindness, and 
particularly if through the same channel he could learn 
whether that appointment would be agreeable to you. This is you know a compliment, which the most respectable courts 
on this side of the Atlantic usually pay to each other. It is 
not without use, and on the present occasion is not a mere 
compliment, because Monsieur de Montmorin is sincerely desirous of cultivating a good understanding with the United 
States. 
</p><p>
It is not impossible that he may retreat from his present 
office ; but he will I think in that case be appointed Governor to the children of France, and his opinions, while about 
the court, will have weight, for many reasons ; amongst others, 
because they deserve it. In talking over the deplorable situation to which this kingdom is reduced, I told him that I saw 
no means of establishing peace at home, but by making war 
abroad. He replied that he thought with me in part, viz. that 
an offensive war might be useful, but that he thought a defensive war must prove ruinous. That this last seemed the 
more likely to happen, and that in either case the state of the 
finances was alarming. [ observed, that ability in that department might restore it, even during a war ; that nothing could 
revive credit without the re-establishment of executive authority, and that nothing could effect that re-establishment but a 
general sense of the necessity. Upon this, he lamented the 
want of a chief minister, who might embrace the great whole 
of public business. He owns himself unequal to the task, and 
too indolent into the bargain. 
</p><p>
Our friend Lafayette burns with desire to be at the head of 
an army in Flanders, and drive the Stadtholder into a ditch. 
He acts now a splendid, but dangerous part. Unluckily } he 
has given in to measures, as to the constitution, which he does 
not heartily approve, and he heartily approves many things 
which experience will demonstrate to be injurious. While all 
is in confusion here, the revolt of Austrian Flanders, and the 
troubles excited in Poland by the agency of Prussia, give 
every reason to suppose that the King of Sweden will be vigorously supported ; so that provided the Turk has but a sufficient share of obstinacy to bear a little more beating, the scale, 
according to human probabilities, must turn against Austria 
and Prussia, who are the allies of France. Great Britain is, 
as yet, no otherwise engaged than as an eventual party; and, 
according to the best opinion which my judgment can form, 
upon the information I have been able to obtain, the Premier 
of that country can, to use the words of Mr Addison,  rise in 
the whirlwind and direct the storm. A person, however, on 
whose knowledge I have some reliance, assures me that Mr Pitt, engrossed by borough politics and ignorant of continent 
al affairs, takes no part in them, but what he is absolutely 
forced into, and I am inclined to believe that there is some 
truth in that assertion. Accept I pray the assurances of that 
sincere esteem with which I am yours, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
It gave me very sincere pleasure to learn from you the 
good tidings, which you communicate respecting our new form 
of government. I know that you are not liable to the dupery 
of false hopes and groundless expectations ; and therefore I 
am confirmed in the opinion I have invariably entertained, that 
the new constitution is such a plain, calm, sensible appeal to 
the interest, feelings, and common sense of our countrymen, 
that it must, by its own intrinsic weight, bear down all opposition. I have from time to time received very great pleasure, 
at the developement of its principles by the legislature, which 
in my opinion does them the greatest honor. They have 
far, very far outgone my expectations, and even come up, not 
only to my hopes, but to my very wishes. 
</p><p>
I have not unfrequently brought myself to share in the plea 
sure you must feel, in the consciousness of your own useful 
agency. Certainly it is the sublimest sentiment of the human 
heart, to know that we make others happy ; and more especially those whom we love. You have too much good sense 
not to know, that no person but yourself could have obtained 
that full confidence needful to the due establishment of the executive authority, which certainly is the key-stone in the great 
arch of empire. I doubt, also, whether any other could so 
universally have called forth into action the talents and virtues 
of America. Let me add, what I have mentioned to you on 
other occasions, and which I would not have mentioned, 
did I not know it to be true, your knowledge of human 
character is a gift inestimable to our country on the present 
occasion. I hope in God, my dear Sir, that you may long 
continue to preside, and that not only you, but all who succeed you, may be assisted by counsellors as able and as honest, as those who now fill the different seats in Congress. 
The prospect of public felicity, which must be the result, 
swells my bosom with delight. Oh my country, how happy r 
didst thou but know thine own blessedness. 
</p><p>
Your sentiments on the revolution effecting here, T believe 
to be perfectly just, because they perfectly accord with my 
own, and that is, you know, the only standard which Heaven 
has given us by which to judge. The king is in effect a pris 
oner at Paris, and obeys entirely the National Assembly. This 
assembly may be divided into three parts; one, called the 
Aristocrats, consists of the high clergy, the members of the 
law, (note, these are not the lawyers,) and such of the nobility as think they ought to form a separate order. Another, 
which has no name, but which consists of all sorts of people, 
really friends to a good free government. The third is com 
posed of what is called here the Enrages, that is, the mad 
men. These are the most numerous, and are of that class 
which in America is known by the name of pettifogging lawyers; together with a host of curates, and many of those per 
sons who, in all revolutions, throng to the standard of change, 
because they are not well. 
This last party is in close alliance with the populace here, 
and derives from that circumstance very great authority. 
They have already unhinged everything, and according to custom on such occasions the torrent rushes on irresistible, until 
it shall have wasted itself. The Aristocrats are without a leader, and without any plan or councils as yet, but ready to throw 
themselves into the arms of any one who shall offer. The 
middle party, who mean well, have unfortunately acquired 
their ideas of government from books, and are admirable fellows upon paper ; but as it happens, somewhat unfortunately, 
that the men who live in the world are very different from those 
who dwell in the heads of philosophers, it is not to be wondered at, if the systems taken out of books are fit for nothing but 
to be put into books again. 
</p><p>
Marmontel is the only man I have met with, among their 
Literati, who seems truly to understand the subject. For the 
rest, they discuss nothing in their Assembly. One large half 
of the time is spent in hallooing and bawling. The manner 
of speaking to a question is as follows. Such as intend to 
hold forth write their names on a tablet kept for that purpose, 
and are heard in the order that their names are written down, 
if the others will hear them, which very often they refuse to 
do, but keep up a continual uproar till the orator leaves the 
pulpit. Each man permitted to speak delivers the result of 
his lucubrations, so that the opposing parties fire off their cartridges, and it is a million to one if their missile arguments 
happen to meet. As to the arguments themselves, you will 
observe that it is a usual compliment of the Assembly to order 
them printed ; therefore, there is as much attention paid, at 
least, to make them sound well and look well, as to convey 
instruction or produce conviction, 
</p><p>
But there is another ceremony which the arguments go 
through, and which does not fail to affect the form, at least, 
and perhaps the substance. They are read beforehand in a 
small society of young men and women, and generally the fair 
friend of the speaker is one, or else the fair whom he means to 
make his friend, and the society very politely give their approbation, unless the lady who gives the tone to that circle chances to reprehend something, which is of course altered if not 
amended. Do not suppose that I am playing the traveller. I 
have assisted at some of these readings, and will now give you 
an anecdote from one of them. It was at Madame de Stael s, 
the daughter of M. Necker. She is a woman of wonderful 
wit, and above vulgar prejudices of every kind. Her house is 
a kind of temple of Apollo, where the men of wit and fashion 
are collected twice a week at supper, and once at dinner, and 
sometimes more frequently. The Count de Clermont-Tonnerre, one of their greatest orators, read to us a very pathetic 
oration, and the object was to show that no penalties are the 
legal compensations for injuries and crimes ; the man who is 
hanged, having by that event paid his debt to the society, ought 
not to be held in dishonor ; and in like manner, he who has 
been condemned for seven years to be flogged in the gallies 
should, when he had served out his apprenticeship, be received again into good company as if nothing had happened. You 
smile ; but observe the extreme to which the matter was carried the other way. Dishonoring thousands for the guilt of 
one has so shocked the public sentiment, as to render this extreme fashionable. The oration was very fine, very sentimental, very pathetic, and the style harmonious. Shouts of applause and full approbation. 
</p><p>
When this was pretty well over, I told him that his speech 
was extremely eloquent, but that his principles were not very 
solid. Universal surprise ! A very few remarks changed the 
face of things. The position was universally condemned, and 
he left the room. I need not add, that as yet it has never been 
delivered in the assembly. And yet it was of the kind, which 
produces a decree by acclamation ; for sometimes an orator 
gets up in the midst of another deliberation, makes a fine dis 
course, and closes with a good snug resolution which is carried 
with a huzza. Thus, in considering a plan for a national bank 
proposed by M. Necker, one of them took it into his head to 
move, that every member should give his silver buckles, which 
was agreed to at once, and the honorable mover laid his upon 
the table, after which the business went on again. 
</p><p>
It is very difficult to guess whereabouts the flock will settle, 
when it flies so wild ; but as far as it is possible to guess, at 
present, this (late) kingdom will be cast into a congeries of 
little democracies, laid out, not according to the rivers, mountains, &c. but with the square and compass, according to latitude and longitude ; and as the provinces had anciently different laws called coutumes, and as the clippings and parings of 
several different provinces must fall together within some of 
the new divisions, I think such fermenting matter must give 
them a kind of political cholic. Their ,/lssembUe Nationale 
will be something like the Old Congress, and the King will be 
catted executive magistrate. As yet they have been busily en 
gaged in pillaging the present occupant of his authority ; how 
much they will leave him, will depend upon the chapter of accidents. I believe it will be very little ; but little or much, the 
perspective of such a King, and such an Assembly, brings to 
my mind a saying which Shakspeare has put into the mouth of 
an old soldier, upon hearing that Lepidus, one of the famous 
Triumvirate, was dead. c So, the poor third is up. World, 
thou hast but a pair of chops, and throw between them all the 
food thou may st, they needs must grind each other. 
</p><p>
At present the people are fully determined to support the 
Assembly ; and although there are some discontents, I do not 
believe that anything very serious, as yet, exists in the style of 
opposition. Indeed, it would be wonderful if there should ; 
for hitherto an extension of privileges, and a remission of taxes 
to the lower class, have marked every stage of their progress. 
Besides, the love of novelty is a great sweetener in revolutions. 
But the time will come when this novelty will be over and all 
its charms gone. In lieu of the taxes remitted, other taxes 
must be laid, for the public burthen must be borne. The 
elected administrators must, then, either indulge their electors, 
which will be ruinous to the Fisc, or in urging the collection of taxes, displace their constituents. In all probability, there will 
be a little of both. Hence must arise bickerings and heart 
burnings among the different districts, and a great languor 
throughout the kingdom. As the revenue must fall short of calculation in point of time, if not in amount, (and that is the 
same thing where revenue is concerned,) it will follow, that 
either the interest of the public debt will not be regularly paid, 
or that the various departments will be starved ; probably a 
little of both. Hence will result a loss of public credit, and 
therewith much injury to commerce and manufactures, operating a farther decrease of the means of revenue, and much debility as to the exterior operations of the kingdom. 
</p><p>
At this moment the discontented spirits will find congenial 
matter in abundance to work upon ; and from that period, 
all the future is involved in the mist of conjecture. If the 
reigning prince were not the small beer character that he is, 
there can be but little doubt, that watching events, and making 
a tolerable use of them, he would regain his authority ; but 
what will you have from a creature who, situated as he is, eats, 
and drinks, and sleeps well, and laughs, and is as merry a 
grig as lives ? The idea that they will give him some money, 
which he, can economize, and that he will have no trouble in 
governing, contents him entirely. Poor man ! he little thinks 
how unstable is his situation. He is beloved, but it is not with 
the sort of love which a monarch should inspire. It is that 
kind of good natured pity, which one feels for a led captive. 
There is, besides, no possibility of serving him ; for at the 
slightest show of opposition, he gives up everything and every 
person. 
</p><p>
As to his ministers, the Count de Montmorin has more 
understanding than people in general imagine, and he means 
well, very well. But he means it feebly. He is a good 
easy kind of man, one who would make an excellent peace 
minister in quiet times ; but he wants the vigor of mind needful for great occasions. The Count de la Luzerne is an 
indolent, pleasant companion, a man of honor, and as obstinate as you please ; but he has somewhat of the creed of 
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel=''>General Gates</a>, that the world does a great part of its own 
business, without the aid of those who are at the head of 
affairs. The success of such men depends very much upon 
the run of the dice. The Count de St Priest is the only man 
among them, who has what they call caractere, which answers 
to our idea of firmness, joined to some activity. But a person 
who knows him pretty well, (which I do not,) assures me, that 
he is mercenary and false hearted. If so, he cannot possess 
much good sense, whatever may be his share of genius or 
talents. Monsieur de Latour-Dupin, the minister at war, 
whom I am also unacquainted with, is said to be no great 
things in any respect. M. Necker was frightened by the 
Enrages into the acceptance of him, instead of the Marquis de Montesquiou, who has a considerable share of talents, and 
a great deal of method. Montesquiou is of course at present the enemy of M. Necker, having been his friend. 
</p><p>
As to M. Necker, he is one of those people, who has obtained a much greater reputation than he had any right to. 
His enemies say, that as a banker, he acquired his fortune by 
means, which to say the least were indelicate, and they 
mention instances. But in this country, everything is so 
much exaggerated, that nothing is more useful than a little 
skepticism. M. Necker, in his public administration, has 
always been honest and disinterested ; which proves well, I 
think, for his former private conduct ; or else it proves that 
he has more vanity than cupidity. Be that as it may, an 
unspotted integrity as minister, and serving at his own expense, 
in an office which others seek for the purpose of enriching 
themselves, have acquired for him very deservedly much confi 
dence. Add to this, that his writings on finance teem with 
that sort of sensibility, whiah make? the fortune of modern 
romances, and which is exactly suited to this lively nation, 
who love to read but hate to think. Hence his reputation. 
He is a man of genius, and his wife is a woman of sense ; but 
neither of them have talents, or rather the talents of a great 
minister. His education as a banker has taught him to make 
tight bargains, and put him upon his guard against projects. 
But though he understands man, as a covetous creature, he 
does not understand mankind ; a defect which is remediless. 
He is utterly ignorant of politics, by which I mean politics in 
the great sense, or that sublime science, which embraces for 
its object the happiness of mankind. Consequently, he neither knows what constitution to form, nor how to obtain the 
consent of others to such as he wishes. From the moment 
of convening the States-General, he has been afloat upon the 
wide ocean of incidents. 
</p><p>
But what is most extraordinary is, that M. Necker is a very 
poor financier. This, I know, will sound like heresy in the 
ears of most people, but it is true. The plans he has pro 
posed are feeble and inept. Hitherto he has been supported 
by borrowing from the Caisse d Escompte, which, (being by 
means of what they call here an arret de surseance secured 
from all prosecutions,) has lent him a sum in their paper 
exceeding the totality of their capital, by about four millions 
sterling. Last autumn he came forward to the Assembles with 
a dreadful tale of woe, at the fag end of which was a tax 
upon every member of the community of a fourth of his revenue, and this he declared to be needful for saving the state. 
His enemies adopted it, (declaring what is very true, that it is 
a wretched, impracticable expedient,) in the hope that he 
and his scheme would fall together. This Assemblee, this 
patriotic band, took in the lump the minister's proposition, 
because of their confidence and the confidence of the people 
in him as they said ; but in fact, because they would not risk 
the unpopularity of a tax. 
</p><p>
The plan thus adopted, M. Necker, to escape the snare 
which he had nearly got taken in, altered his tax into what 
they call the patriotic contribution. By this, every man is to 
declare, if he pleases, at what he pleases to estimate his annual 
income, and to pay one fourth of it in three years. You will 
easily suppose that this fund was unproductive, and notwithstanding the imminent danger of the state, we are as yet without 
any aid from the contribution patriotique. 
</p><p>
His next scheme was that of a National Bank, or at least 
an extension of the Caisse d Escompte. It has been variously 
modelled since, and many capital objections removed ; but at 
last it is good for nothing, and so it will turn out. At present 
it is just beginning. By way of giving some base to the pre 
sent operation, it is proposed and determined to sell about ten 
or twelve millions sterling of the crown and church lands, both 
of which are, by resolution of the Assemblee, declared to belong 
to the nation ; but as it is clear that these lands will not sell 
well just now, they have appointed a treasurer to receive what 
they will sell for hereafter, and they issue a kind of order upon 
this treasurer, which is to be called an Assignat, and is to be 
paid, (out of these sales) one, two, and three years hence. 
They expect that on these Jlssignais they can borrow money 
to free the engagements of the Caisse d Escompte, and they are 
at the same time to pay some of the more pressing debts, with 
the same Assignats. 
</p><p>
Now this plan must fail, as follows. First, there will be some 
doubt about the title to these lands, at least till the revolution 
is completed. Secondly, the representative of the land must 
always (for a reason which will presently appear) sell for less 
than a representative of money, and therefore, until public 
confidence is so far restored as that the five per cents are 
above par, these Assignats bearing five per cent must be be 
low par. Money, therefore, cannot be raised upon them but 
at a considerable discount. Thirdly, the lands to be disposed 
of must sell a great deal below their value, for there is not 
money to buy them in this country; and the proof is, that they 
never obtained money on loan at the legal interest but always 
upon a premium sufficient to draw it from the employments of 
commerce and manufactures, and as the revolution has greatly 
lessened the mass of money, the effect of the scarcity must be 
greater. 
</p><p>
But farther, there is a solecism in the plan which escapes 
most of them, and which is, nevertheless, very palpable. The 
value of lands in Europe is, you know, estimated by the in 
come. To dispose of public lands is to sell public revenue ; 
and therefore taking the legal interest at five per cent, lands 
renting for 100 livres ought to sell for <a href='/results.php?year=2000'>2000</a>, but they expect 
that these lands will sell for <a href='/results.php?year=3000'>3000</a>, and that thereby, not only 
public credit will be restored, but a great saving will be made, 
as the <a href='/results.php?year=3000'>3000</a> will redeem an interest of 150. It is, however, 
an indisputable fact, that public credit being established, the 
stocks are worth more than land of equal income, and for three 
reasons ; first, that there is no trouble whatever in the management ; secondly, there is no danger of bad crops and taxes ; 
and thirdly, they can be disposed of at a moment's warning, 
if the owner wants money, and be as readily repurchased when 
it suits his convenience. If, therefore, the public credit be re 
stored, and there be a surplus sum of ten to twelve millions to 
be invested, and if such large sales (contrary to custom) should 
not from the amount affect the price, still the lands must go 
cheaper than the stocks, and consequently the interest bought 
will be smaller than the revenue sold. 
</p><p>
Having thus given you a very rude sketch of the men and 
the measures of this country, I see and feel that it is time to 
conclude. I sincerely wish I could say that there are able 
men at hand to take the helm, should the present pilots aban 
don the ship. But I have great apprehensions as to those who 
may succeed. The present set must wear out in the course of 
the year, and most of them would be glad to get fairly out of 
the scrape at present ; but it is alike dangerous to stay or to 
go, and they must patiently wait the breath of the Assembles and 
follow as it blows. The new order of things cannot endure. 
I hope it may be mended, but fear it may be changed. All 
Europe, just now, is like a mine ready to explode ; and if 
this winter does not produce peace, next summer will behold 
a wider extension of the war. I am, &c.

Dear Hamilton, 
</p><p>
I did expect that in congratulating you, which I do most 
sincerely, upon your appointment, I should have communicated a matter which would have administered much ease and 
convenience to the affairs of your department. I learn this 
morning that these expectations are frustrated from a quarter, 
and in a manner, which would excite my surprise, had I not 
long since acquired the habit of wondering at nothing. I will 
tell you a plain story. 
</p><p>
M. Necker, pressed for money, had listened to overtures 
for selling the debt of the United States, and mentioned the 
matter to some members of the National Assembly, by which 
means it became known to the principal Americans, and 
friends of America here. I own that upon the first mention 
of the matter, it appeared to me a thing of indifference, and 
so I expressed myself. Our duty is to pay to such creditors 
as may possess the demand. But further information placed 
the affair in a different point of light. It appeared that the 
offer was for a small part, at a great discount ; and that the 
terms of the bargain were to be debated in the National 
Assembly, and consequently our reputation sported with. 
Mr Short did everything in his power, but having no pointed 
instructions, could only express the result of his own judgment and feelings. But the minister was pressed for money, 
and he had the offer of money. Under these circumstances, 
in connexion with a society of friends to America, I made M. Necker an offer, such as in my conception was honorable to 
France, to America, and to the parties. This proposition, 
(after stating the amount of the principal and interest which 
would be due on the first of January <a href='/results.php?year=1790'>1790</a>, and considering 
that as a new capital on which the interest was to run,) contains the following terms. On propose de P acquerir du gouvernementj et a cet effet de I 9 - acquitter en entier par des rents perpetuelles de la France moniantes a la meme somme. This 
payment was to be made in the year <a href='/results.php?year=1790'>1790</a> and <a href='/results.php?year=1791'>1791</a> ; consequently, so far as France is concerned, the offer went to a 
full, complete, and entire payment, and that at a much earlier 
period than is stipulated by the terms of the loans themselves. 
To this was added a further offer, in case the situation of 
affairs in this kingdom should require it, in the following terms ; 
On se chargera de solder en argent la moitie de la dite rente 
au prix courant des effets royaux. This part of the offer 
has no other merit than to secure to the minister the sale of 
the French effects, if he thought proper, and is therefore a 
matter rather of convenience than advantage. I communicated this plan, beforehand, to Mr Short, and to the Marquis de 
Lafayette, who both considered it as an excellent means of 
saving at the same time the honor and interest of America, 
while it furnished a useful resource to France. I showed it 
also to Monsieur de Montmorin, who, having well weighed 
and considered it, assured me that he most heartily approved 
it, and would do everything in his power to secure the success. 
In the supposition that this plan were adopted here, application was to be made through you to the United States to pay 
the amount of this debt in obligations for current guilders, calculating the exchange at par ; those obligations to bear five per 
cent interest, and to be paid in instalments, the first of which 
to commence five years hence. Consequently, as the society 
was to bear all the charges of negotiation, &c. &c. it follows 
clearly, that the United States would have obtained the needful 
time required for their accommodation without a farthing of expense, and without the pain of soliciting it from this Court. It 
was therefore equally honorable and useful for them. It was 
honorable also to the parties. First, because they became eminently useful to the societies of which they are respectively 
members; and secondly, because the advantage, if any, which 
they were to derive would result merely from a careful and 
industrious attention to the variations of the exchange and fluctuations in the effects, and from the use of their funds and 
credit to make investments at the proper times and seasons, 
which, as far as the sum of forty millions of livres and up 
wards can go, must necessarily have sustained the value of the 
stocks here. And you will observe that this was clearly stated 
and understood. 
</p><p>
The proposition was delivered to M. Necker on the fifth of 
December. You will observe, that in framing it we counted 
upon the aid of money-lenders in Holland ; and, in preference 
to others, upon the commissioners of the United States. We 
learned, however, that these gentlemen had, notwithstanding 
the remonstrances of Mr Jacob Van Staphorst, who has a real 
and warm regard for America, joined with those who made the 
offer to M. Necker. Through the channel that brought us this 
information, an interview was brought about between Monsieur 
de la Chaise and Mr Van Staphorst, charged with the final pro 
position to M. Necker and me. I told those gentlemen, that I 
was convinced their offer could not be accepted, (by the bye, 
M. Necker had told me that the sum offered was not sufficient,) 
and that, if accepted by the minister, it could not be adopted 
by the Assembly, and that they risked doing great injury to 
America, without any advantage to themselves ; that I would 
communicate to them an offer I had made } and which I had 
great reason to believe would be adopted ; that I would offer 
them an interest in it, or a commission, at their option ; that if 
they should not approve of holding a concern, I would then lie 
still, and let them make the most of their plans without opposi 
tion, but asked the assurance on the part of themselves and of 
their principals, (those whom they represented) that if they 
found their own Scheme impracticable, and did not choose to 
adventure with me, they should only not oppose. This 
being solemnly promised, I stated the matter to them at large, 
and they came so fully into my views, as to withhold the pro 
position they were directed to make, and send an express on 
the subject to Amsterdam. 
</p><p>
The interview was on the eleventh of December, in the evening. Some further discussions were needful, which we had the 
next day. I avoided going to M. Necker s, because I was to do 
nothing which would defeat their plan. On the twenty-sixth, 
Mr Hubbard, partner of the house of Staphorst, arrived charged to make their offer, with a budget of reasons in support of 
it. This offer was to purchase the 6,000,000 at a discount of 
about eleven per cent. It was made immediately ; and on 
the morning of the 28th he called on me, in company with 
Mr Van Staphorst. I had heen repeatedly assured from 
different quarters that M. Necker was ready to treat with me, 
but I had not put myself in his way. The conversation with Mr Hubbard was not very long. I heard what he had to say, and 
replied with great precision, but so as to change entirely his 
opinion. You will not wonder at this, when I tell you the 
purport of the objections he had brought forward ; first, that it 
was too profitable to the parties ; secondly, too burdensome to 
France ; and thirdly, might injure the credit of America by 
selling the obligations too low. To the first, I replied by a 
smile, and the assurance, that I never expected such an objection from Holland. This disconcerted him. To the second 
I answered, that M. Necker understood his own business, and 
might safely be trusted in making a bargain ; but I showed 
him further that the bargain was a good one. To the last I 
made the answer, which I am sure you have already made in 
your own mind, viz. that if the commissioners of the United 
States could safely be trusted in making negotiations, where 
the loss was to be borne by their employers, a fortiori might 
they be trusted where the loss was to be borne by them 
selves. 
</p><p>
As all this was merely ostensible, I pressed him hard for the 
real reasons, but could get nothing more than assurances that 
there were no other than those above mentioned. As these 
were clearly refuted, of course he acknowledged himself 
converted ; but Hudibras has very well observed that, 
</p><p>
Who's convinced against his will, 
Is of the same opinion still. 
A more effectual change was wrought by M. Necker, who, 
on the second of this month, refused their offer. On the morning 
of the third, Mr Hubbard called and informed me of this, and 
in the afternoon of the fifth he set off for Amsterdam, apparently 
desirous of bringing all his friends into my views. The business went on but slowly in Amsterdam ; and Mr Jacob Van 
Staphorst was amused from time to time, and amused me with 
the expectation that each succeeding post would bring their 
definitive answer ; but this morning he tells me, with very sincere regret, what has been done. The letter to you on this 
subject I have read, and will make a few remarks upon it, but 
shall not be very precise, perhaps, as it is only from memory 
of what it contained that I write. 
</p><p>
The idea of an enormous profit, admitting for a moment 
that such were to accrue, would hardly have been with them 
what Candid calls the sufficient reason for refusal, although per 
haps it might have been for acceptance. But you can judge 
of the extent of that profit, and you will with me smile at the 
absurdity of connecting with such profit a sacrifice in the price 
of American obligations, on the vending of which at or near 
par, the profit must certainly depend. There is something 
else which perhaps is more ridiculous still, viz. that the United 
States, whose obligations belonging to numerous individuals 
are daily sold on the change of Amsterdam, should apprehend 
an injury to their credit from trusting a farther negotiation to 
persons, whose immediate interest in supporting that credit 
would be so great. They state as a great difficulty the borrowing of twelve millions within the term, when on the same 
pledge they can borrow twenty. Their statement of sums is 
not, I believe, very accurate, or perhaps my memory is not 
accurate. However, I am sure the idea is, that the greater 
sum can be borrowed more easily than the less. There is also 
the farther very extraordinary idea, that it is for the interest 
of the United States to pay between four and five per cent 
upon a negotiation, rather than get it done for nothing. I shall 
not notice many expressions which are injurious, but make to 
their affectation of disinterestedness, the answer which Jacob 
Van Staphorst made to me. It is very strange that they should 
say all this, when they must remember that in M. Calonne's 
time, they offered him only fourteen millions of livers for one 
half of the thirty-two, and arrearages of interest, but would not 
take the whole, even at that rate, which is the reason why the 
bargain was broken off. I should make but a poor excuse for 
so long a story, if I stopped here ; but I will now proceed to 
give you what T conceive to be the key of the riddle. 
</p><p>
These gentlemen are engaged, as I suppose you know, in 
very extensive speculations upon the funded debt of America. 
They have lately worked this matter to a most astonishing benefit. Above three millions of that debt, which cost them five 
shillings in the pound, has been made the basis of a loan on 
which they receive sixty per cent, and are bound to repay it 
by instalments from the interest receivable in America. The 
Dutch, however, prefer lending at five per cent to the Congress direct. It is, therefore, essential to the success of their 
schemes, that they should be able to suspend the one loan al 
ways till they have completed the other ; and thus our nation 
al interests are rendered subservient to their particular negotiations. You will easily see that one such operation, in which there 
is no risk, is better worth pursuing than the very great profit 
they complain of. With this hint you will understand the matter thoroughly. I must come to a conclusion. 
</p><p>
I did not see M. Necker as I expected this afternoon, be 
cause he was gone to council ; however I must suspend, at 
least, the matter with him ; but you may rely on it that if the 
Minister at this court, or any other agent, be authorised fully 
to deal in the business, and, if the court will not readily agree 
to a new arrangement respecting the debt, to contract with individuals, that the matter can be yet managed in the manner 
above mentioned, provided it be not too long delayed. As to 
the loan which the commissioners have undertaken of their own 
heads, you may, I think, derive great advantage from it ; for, 
in the first place, your Minister or Agent can make terms with 
them to that amount at pleasure, for the benefit of the United 
States ; and you may, in the next place, convert the money to 
very useful purpose by sinking three or four times as much of 
the domestic debt, and raising the price at the same time to 
wards par, which will prevent the success of speculations by 
foreigners, which are a loss to America. I am very truly, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
You have seen the decree which has been made respecting 
tobacco, and which gives to French shipping a preference of 
above one hundred livres per ton over American. Previous to 
the decision on this business, T was desired by a note to dine 
with <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Monsieur De Lafayette</a>, in order to confer on American 
business. And note, that I had attended once before, when 
he wished me to go with him to the Committee of Commerce, 
but I declined until the Committee should ask my attendance, 
which they have not done. At the conference to which I 
was invited, were present Mr Swan, and Colonel Walker, and a 
little man whom Chastellux formerly recommended to me as 
being a disciple of Doctor Pangloss. In his way to America 
he was shipwrecked, had his toes frozen off, and was after 
wards, I believe, appointed to some subordinate place in the 
consular office. During the conference, another little man 
came in, whom I do not know, but have been told that his 
name is Raymond, and that he is from Alsace. 
</p><p>
After Lafayette had proposed the question, I asked the opinion of Walker and Swan, which they gave, and the latter in 
particular observed that the southern provinces would soon 
supply the kingdom, if the culture was allowed. I delivered 
my sentiments to the following effect. A sacrifice of the interest of France to that of America could not reasonably be 
expected. The first question was, or ought to be, whether 
they could dispense with the revenue. If they could, then 
they should give it up entirely, and consult the commercial interest of the country. That to this effect they should make 
the article free to be imported and exported everywhere. 
That if on the contrary they should deem the revenue necessary, then the following modes of obtaining it occurred. 1. a 
Duty ; 2. an Excise ; 3. a Farm ; 4. a Regie. That the first, 
if great, would be eluded ; that the second, incompatible with 
their new principles, was not worth establishing as a single article, because of the expense attending it; that the third was 
out of fashion ; and by the fourth they would be cheated. 
</p><p>
Respecting the free culture, I gave it as my decided opinion, that in a short time it would totally destroy the tobacco 
trade, and to this effect I stated the charges attending the 
transportation of that article, which amount to about three guineas on the medium produce of an acre. And I have no doubt 
that the south of France will produce as good tobacco as Virginia. About this time the Alsacian came in, and said a great 
deal to prove what, if I can read the countenance, he did not 
believe a word of, viz. that no tobacco would be planted even if 
the permission were granted, excepting in Flanders and Alsace. I did not think it worth while to attempt a useless confutation, but told Lafayette that as they had already set Alsace 
on fire, I could not advise them to add more fuel. That I had 
given him facts from which he might draw his own conclusions. 
That I would not pretend to advise, but would venture to predict. That the free culture would be permitted, and thereby 
the revenue be lost ; but that afterwards the culture would be 
prohibited through all France, and the revenue be established. 
I could not but smile inwardly at the conduct of the business. 
The national interests are every way injured, those of America by no means served, and Alsace is the dupe. All this, time 
I think will show. 
</p><p>
Finding that the decrees bore so hard upon us, both in our agriculture and navigation, I have, notwithstanding my previous determination, spoken to <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Monsieur De Lafayette</a>, who, ac 
cording to custom, asked for a little note about it. I spoke also to Monsieur de Montmorin, at whose request I have really written a pretty large note, which he will get translated and 
deliver to the Diplomatic Committee. It purports to be observations of sundry American citizens. I mean to keep out of 
sight as much as possible, and do all the good I can ; and for the rest I repeat again, let the world wag as it may. I have 
the honor to be, &ic.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received yours of the eleventh instant. I have no 
doubt but that the advocates of the Assignats forces will triumph in the success of their favorite plan. A momentary advantage was of course to be expected, and in all matters de 
pending on opinion the effect becomes a cause ; hence you 
will find for some time a regular increase of the happy consequences. But this measure has in it the certain cause of evil, 
and that cause will in due time produce its effect, which will 
also be increased by opinion. The bounds of a letter would 
not permit of the full developement of such principles as apply 
to the subject; but a word to the wise is sufficient. 
</p><p>
I would send you Hamilton's plan, (just now received,) but 
Mr Parker has already sent it, and you will find one postage 
sufficient. It was not from what I found in Amsterdam, that I 
was deterred from pursuing the propositions to M. Necker, but 
the conviction that his expectations have been so raised, as to 
shut his ears to anything which could with safety be proposed ; 
and I have not enough of the knight errant in my composition 
to go beyond that line. 
</p><p>
I think <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague'>Colonel Hamilton</a>'s idea of obtaining money at four 
per cent is premature. Doubtless it will be practicable at a 
future day, when we do not want money, and our loans should 
be so managed now, as to leave room for taking advantage of 
that circumstance hereafter; but such an attempt would not 
succeed at present. Had my proposals been accepted. I think 
I should have so managed as to bring that matter about in a 
very short time ; but everything must be now suspended, for 
a few weeks at least. I am, &c.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 12th did not arrive until this morning. It 
is perfectly natural that your opinions should differ from mine. There will ever be a difference of opinions on subjects, which 
do not admit of demonstration. It will be very long before po 
litical subjects will be reduced to geometric certitude. At pre 
sent the reasoning on them is a kind of arithmetic of infinities, 
where the best information, the wisest head, and clearest mind, 
can only approach the truth. A cautious man should, there 
fore, give only Sybilline predictions, if indeed he should haz 
ard any. But I am not a cautious man. I therefore give it 
as my opinion, that they will issue the paper currency, and sub 
stitute thereby depreciation in the place of bankruptcy, or rather suspension. 
</p><p>
Apropos of this currency, this papier-terre, I could tell them 
of a country where there is a papier- terre now mort et enterre. 
The Assembly havec ommitted many blunders, which is not to 
be wondered at. They have taken genius instead of reason 
for their guide, adopted experiment instead of experience, and 
wander in the dark because they prefer lightning to light. I 
think you are mistaken in supposing, that the emission of paper 
will destroy the proportion of prices. This proportion is in 
dependent of the medium of trade. The one results from a 
relation of things, the other is only an ideal standard by which 
to measure those things. Your height and mine would be the 
same, and consequently the proportion of one to the other the 
same, although a measure of six inches should be called a 
foot. 
</p><p>
You are very merry on the subject of personal liberty, but 
the District has more to say than many are aware of. Is it not 
written in the Droit tfHomme, that liberty is an inalienable property of man inseparable from the human character ? And if 
this be so, pray what better mode of securing personal liberty 
than to secure the person ? Your wits may sneer, but you 
must learn to respect the decrees of the municipalities, which 
like, those of Heaven are inscrutable, but not on that account 
the less entitled to obedience and respect. The lady, I am 
told, is so far from complaining of the restraint she was laid 
under, that although an aristocrat, she tells the Assembly with all becoming humility that she finds their yoke is easy and 
their burden light, while the young gentleman ordered on duty 
in her chamber acknowledges that service to be perfect free 
dom. Shortsighted man that you are ! Is it not a general com 
plaint, that France is torn by a division of political sentiment 
and opinion? And what mode so effectual to produce a union 
of both, as to give the women of one party in charge to men of 
the other ? By way of addition and amendment, I would 
humbly propose that the male aristocrats should be put into the 
custody of the female whigs, and I dare say they would come 
out much less fierce than they were. 
</p><p>
That the Assembly should continue its session too long is 
both natural and necessary. Mankind in general reason only 
from their feelings, and therefore to discern the wrong, which 
that body has committed, the people must first be heartily displeased with them. And then they will go too far the other 
way. It is a pendulum, and the farther you draw it on one side 
the farther will it go towards the other. 
</p><p>
I have very late news from America, viz. the 14th of August, 
but my correspondents do not give themselves the trouble to 
communicate any political intelligence. The funding bill is, I 
understand, in this city, but I have not yet seen it. They have 
not provided for the full interest of the public debt. As to 
the ability of the country, you need not entertain the slightest 
apprehension. The domestic debt is always a mere nominal 
thing. It neither adds to, nor takes away from the mass of national property, but furnishes a species of private property, 
which from its convertible nature, and by holding a kind of 
middle rank between real value and the mere sign of value, 
may be rendered of admirable use to increase commercial circulation, invigorate the manufactures, and consequently to benefit the agricultural interests, which receive thereby under the 
name of price more than they pay under the name of tax. 
</p><p>
The situation of France is by no means desperate. A torrent of depreciation may inundate the land, and storms and 
tempests arise, but the one you know fertilizes the soil, and the 
other purifies the atmosphere. Ultimately health and abundance succeed the wintry appearance, which seemed fatal to 
both. Adieu. I shall leave this in a day or two.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 22d of last month reached me too late 
to reply by the last post. If your friends speculate in the Assignates I wish them much success, but I incline to think that 
there will be more loss then gain in such speculations. You 
and I know a little about paper money. There is somewhere 
on the way towards me a long letter and other documents respecting some lands in America, about which we have had a 
conversation together. I will write to you about that affair 
when I receive it. You mistake me if you suppose that I 
meant to stimulate your endeavors. I was prompted merely 
by a common sense of justice. Why should your time and attention be consumed by the business of other people ? But I 
quit this subject. 
</p><p>
Pray let me know how affairs go on. I think the public 
opinion is now inflated by the Assignats, which will prove at 
last to be but a frail reliance. There seems to be a kind of 
petite guerre between the Assemblee and M. Necker. This 
will do no good to either ; but in such contests the one gene 
rally sinks under the efforts of the many. How stands our 
friend Lafayette. Very much depends on him. I see no 
means of extricating you from your troubles, but that which 
most men would consider as the means of plunging you into 
greater I mean a war. And you should make it to yourselves a war of men, to your neighbors a war of money. I do not 
explain, because a word to the wise is sufficient. You want 
just now great men to pursue great measures. As to the idea 
that you can keep out of the fire, which consumes your neighbors and your allies, it is ridiculous. You must suffer either 
for or with them ; and the latter is at once the nobler and the 
safer position. But I correct and check myself with a due 
respect for the gentlemen in the several post offices, who will, 
I hope, permit my letter to go forward and convey to you 
the assurance of my regard.

My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
When this letter reaches your hands it will probably find you 
meditating on the situation of France, which is not perhaps en 
viable, but it is by no means so dreadful as would at first sight 
appear. This country is arming, and I am convinced with a 
determination to compel not only Spain, but every other power, 
to subscribe such terms as she may choose to dictate. You 
will strive in vain to deprecate the blow, therefore you must 
prepare to meet it, to return it, or rather so to strike as may 
prevent it. 
</p><p>
The enclosed letter is left open for your perusal ; pray for 
ward it. I do not think that France can be prepared before 
September ; but it is not improbable that under existing circumstances the King of Hungary would cede, as a don de famille, 
his rights to the low countries upon assurances of effectual aid 
to support his claims to Silesia, and elsewhere in that quarter. 
Certainly a good understanding might be obtained with the party of General Vandermersch, and measures might be taken to 
secure the surrender of the few garrison towns, which are in 
that country. These things being ripened, two armies, composed in a great measure of militia, might march, the one from 
Luxembourg and take post in Liege, so as to oppose there effectually with any army of good troops the efforts of Prussia ; 
the other might go along the sea coast. But a detachment of 
each army might move so as to form a junction at Brussels, 
and go thence down the Scheldt to Antwerp. The mode of co 
operating against Holland seems to me to be from Dunkirk, 
with vessels which Jones will describe to you, so as to fall in up 
on Amsterdam ; which being effected would, with the aid of 
the popular party, give possession of the whole country. Or, 
allowing a great part, or even the whole of this plan to fail at 
first, it would eventually succeed in uniting all Flanders to the 
Kingdom of France, and, by obliging this country to fight at 
land, would greatly exhaust her. 
</p><p>
Previous to striking a blow, preparations should be made in 
your islands, by laying an embargo on all ships there on the 
same day that an embargo is laid on ships in your own ports ; 
and if the nation should not be able to fit out all your ships of 
war, the smaller ones might be disposed of to great advantage 
to merchants, who would fit them out as privateers. Such 
ships of war as you can fit out might be selected from the fastest sailers, and cruise upon the commerce, with orders to destroy whatever they can, and to secure the seamen. The Dutch 
commerce should be respected, let them do what they will ; by 
which means you will secure friends in that country and excite 
contention between the allies. 
</p><p>
The difference between France and Britain is, that the former can exist without commerce, but the latter cannot. Secure 
their seamen, and never exchange them ; you will by that 
means ruin both their Marine and Finance ; and, if you send 
those seamen into the interior parts of the kingdom, and em 
ploy them in public works upon the highways, &ic. &tc. they 
will cost you nothing, and by degrees lose their habits of seamanship. 
</p><p>
I hear you cry out that the Finances are in a deplorable situation. This should be no obstacle. I think that they may 
be restored during war better than in peace. You want also 
something to turn men's attention from their present discontents. Admitting, however, everything that can be said on the 
chapter of Finance, surely it is better to strike than to be 
struck; and you will strive in vain to parry the blow. Adieu,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The country T now inhabit, on which so many other countries 
depend, having sunk to absolute nothingness, has deranged the 
general state of things in every quarter ; and what complicates 
the scene in no small degree is the incertitude which prevails, as 
to her future fate, because a new system, calculated on the palsied state of France, would be as effectually deranged by her 
recovery, as that was which leaned upon her greatness heretofore 
and fell in her fall. The northern courts, removed at a greater distance from her influence, had provided for themselves by 
an alliance, which took place immediately after the peace between Sweden and Russia. I think I hinted in a former letter 
my expectation, that a new system would arise there. In effect 
a treaty concluded between what may be called the Baltic powers will have considerable influence hereafter upon the general system. When you recollect that they are exclusively the 
magazine of naval stores in this hemisphere, your comprehensive mind will seize at once the consequences, which may follow 
to America from combinations where such articles are indispensable. This same Baltic is also a granary for southern Europe. 
Hence a new source of important reflection. I think that occasions will ere long present themselves, in which America may 
be essentially concerned. But to come nearer to my present 
position, the Emperor disengaged from the Turk and likely to 
be soon repossessed of Flanders, will be there in the command 
of fifty thousand men, besides the resource which every sovereign derives from an unsuccessful revolt. The King of Prussia 
is no longer at the head of an effective Germanic league. The 
fear of Austria and her connexions has, for evident reasons, 
subsided, and the Baron Hertzberg, rather a pedant than politician, but illy fills that great void which was left by the death of 
Frederick. In fact, Prussia seems to be just that country in shape, 
extent, fertility, population, connexion, and relation, which 
one would have chosen to show what great genius can do with 
incompetent materials, and what a dream is human greatness. 
</p><p>
The Emperor is in possession of proofs, that the spirit of re 
volt through all his dominions was fostered by that court, and 
would have broken out in every quarter at the instant of a war. 
Hence the sudden pacification at Reichenback, of which the 
Prussian was the dupe, though he dictated terms. You will readily suppose that Leopold, neither as a man nor a statesman, can 
look on such conduct in the calm sight of mild philosophy. 
Hereditary claims to dominion, which his rival is possessed of, 
a long opposition of jarring interests, and the bitterness of that 
cup he has just been forced to drink, must lead him to seek and 
to seize the moment of vengeance. Forgiveness is not a family feature in the House of Lorraine, neither is Italy the school 
of Christian meekness. On the other hand, the alliance between him and the late sovereign of this country is rent to tatters. Not formally cancelled, it is effectually annulled. The 
French nation hate the Emperor, and detest a connexion, which 
seems nevertheless to be the wisest that could have been formed. 
</p><p>
The great power of this monarchy has been for centuries an insurmountable barrier to imperial ambition. Leopold must 
therefore wish to see it injured, and even dismembered. Many of the German princes, who have rights within the boundaries of France, secured to them by numerous treaties, and 
guarantied by the Germanic corps, but lately violated by the 
National Assembly, wish the whole empire to insist on restitution, and in case of refusal to engage in a war, whose object 
would be the recovery of Alsace and Lorraine. Many of the 
discontented nobles and clergy of France are urgent with the 
chief of the empire to avenge the insults offered to his unfortunate sister. So fair a pretext, such plausible reasons, both 
public and private, joined to a great political interest and personal territorial claims, might determine an enterprising prince. 
But he is cautious ; trusting more to art than force. He sits on a throne which lately tottered, and is hardly yet confirmed. 
He has before him the example of a predecessor, whose incessant toils brought only an increase of laborious care ; whose 
anxieties wore away the web of his existence ; and whose 
mighty projects were but the  baseless fabric of a vision. The Germanic body itself is distracted between the duty of 
supporting its members, and a dread of destroying the check upon its chief. 
</p><p>
This unhappy country, bewildered in the pursuit of meta 
physical whimsies, presents to our moral view a mighty ruin. 
Like the remnants of ancient magnificence, we admire the architecture of the temple, while we detest the false god to whom 
it was dedicated. Daws and ravens, and the birds of night, 
now build their nests in its nitches. The sovereign, humbled to 
the level of a beggar's pity, without resources, without authority, 
without a friend. The Assembly at once a master and a slave, 
new in power, wild in theory, raw in practice. It engrosses 
all functions though incapable of exercising any, and has taken 
from this fierce ferocious people every restraint of religion and 
of respect. Sole executors of the law, and therefore suprerne 
judges of its propriety, each district measures out its obedience by its wishes, and the great interests of the whole, split 
up into fractional morsels, depend on momentary impulse and 
ignorant caprice. Such a state of things cannot last. 
</p><p>
But how will it end ? Here conjecture may wander through 
unbounded space. What sum of misery may be requisite to 
change popular will, calculation cannot determine. What circumstances may arise in the order of Divine Providence to give 
direction to that will, our sharpest vision cannot discover. 
What talents may be found to seize those circumstances, to 
influence that will, and above all to moderate the power which 
it must confer, we are equally ignorant of. One thing only 
seems to be tolerably ascertained, that the glorious opportunity 
is lost, and (for this time at least) the revolution has failed. In 
the consequences of it we may however find some foundation 
of future prosperity. Such are, 1. The abolition of those different rights and privileges, which kept the provinces asunder, occasioning thereby a variety of taxation, increasing the expenses 
of collection, impeding the useful communication of commerce, 
and destroying that unity in the system of distributive justice, 
which is one requisite to social happiness. 2. The abolition of 
feudal tyranny, by which the tenure of real property is simplified, the value reduced to money, rent is more clearly ascertained, and the estimation which depended upon idle vanity, or 
capricious taste, or sullen pride, is destroyed. 3. The extension of the circle of commerce to those vast possessions held by 
the clergy in mortmain, which conferring great wealth as the 
wages of idleness, damped the ardor of enterprise, and impaired that ready industry, which, increases the stock of national 
riches. 4. The destruction of a system of venal jurisprudence, 
which, arrogating a kind of legislative veto, had established the 
pride and privileges of the few, on the misery and degradation 
of the general mass, 5. Above all, the promulgation and ex 
tension of those principles of liberty, which will, I hope, remain 
to cheer the heart and cherish a nobleness of soul, when the 
metaphysical froth and vapor shall have been blown away. 
The awe of that spirit which has been thus raised, will, I trust, 
excite in those who may hereafter possess authority a proper 
moderation in its exercise, and induce them to give to this 
people a real constitution of government, fitted to the natural, 
moral, social, and political state of their country. 
</p><p>
How and when these events may be brought about I know 
not. But I think from the chaos of opinion, and the conflict 
of its jarring elements, a new order will at length arise, which 
though in some degree the child of chance, may not be less 
productive of human happiness, than the forethought provisions of human speculation. 
</p><p>
In the beginning of this year I mentioned the conviction that, 
during the course of it, the then ministry would wear out. 
This has been literally verified, and M. de Montmorin is the 
only remaining shred of the old garment. As to the present 
temporary set, I shall say nothing just now, reserving to a better opportunity some sentiments on particular men. The object of this letter is, as you will observe, to communicate as 
nearly as I can that state of things, which may in a greater or 
smaller degree be forced upon your attention. I must add the 
conviction, that my letters present very different prospects from 
those, which may reach you through other channels. You, who 
know mankind thoroughly, will be able to form a solid opinion ; 
and however that may vary from mine, I shall still rejoice if 
even by the display of false ideas, I shall have cast any additional light upon those which are true. I am always, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor to address you a letter on the twenty-second 
of last month, in the close of which I mentioned the intention 
of saying at a future period some few words of the people, who 
are now on the stage. To begin then with our friend Lafayette, 
who has hitherto acted a splendid part. The King obeys but 
detests him. He obeys because he fears. Whoever possesses 
the royal person, may do what he pleases with the royal character and authority. Hence it happens that the ministers are 
of Lafayette's appointment. A short description of their use 
was given the other day by Mirabeau. We make ministers, 
said he, as we used formerly to send servants to keep our boxes 
at the playhouse. I gave you the explanation of this jest while I was in London. Lafayette thinks that these his creatures 
will worship their creator, but he is mightily mistaken. 
</p><p>
You know Duportail, the Minister of War. He is said to be 
violent in favor of the revolution. It is more than a year since I 
have seen him, excepting a short visit of congratulation the other day. My judgment, therefore, should have little weight ; 
but I believe he is too much the friend of liberty to approve of 
the constitution. For the rest ; he has as you know that command of himself, and that simplicity of exterior deportment
which carry a man as far as his abilities will reach. He may 
perhaps remember his creator in his ministerial youth, in order that his days may be long in the land of office ; but I venture to predict, that his duteous observance will not endure one 
half second beyond the moment of necessity. I believe I did not 
mention to you, about a year ago, the intention to appoint him ; 
but at that time I endeavored to take his measure. The minister of the Marine I know nothing about. They say he is a 
good kind of man, which is saying very little. The Keeper of 
the Seals, Monsieur Duport-Dutertre, was a lawyer of eminence thrown up into notice by the circumstances of the moment. He is said to possess both abilities and firmness. Monsieur Delessart, the Minister of the Finances, is rather above 
than below mediocrity, and possesses that kind of civil assent 
which never compromises the possessor, though it seldom travels in company with greatness. 
</p><p>
There is not a man among them fitted for the great tasks in 
which they are engaged, and greater tasks are perhaps impend 
ing. I have no proofs, but I have a well founded opinion, that 
the leaders of one party wish, what those of the other fear, 
and both expect, viz. the interference of foreign powers. One 
previous step would be to carry off, if possible, the King and 
Queen. The latter at least, for there is every reason to apprehend for their safety, should violent measures be adopted while they are here. 
</p><p>
For my own part I do not believe in any such interference, 
neither do I think that the opposers of the Assembly have sufficient energy of character to make a civil war. Their attempts 
if any, will, I imagine, be feeble and consequently ruinous to 
themselves. If indeed they had a considerable part of the 
army, commanded by the Prince of Conde, and the person of 
the King in his possession ; and if they came forward to establish a proper constitution, adopting such good things as the Assembly have done, and rejecting the evil ; then indeed there 
would be different grounds of expectation. But I consider this 
rather as the visionary hope of a few, than as the fixed plan of 
persons who can carry it into execution. I am, &c.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I am to acknowledge your favors of the twenty-sixth of November, and seventeenth of December, which reached me two 
days ago. The system of finance did not indeed fully meet 
my opinions, but I know it is necessary to conform even to the 
prejudices of mankind. I fully believe with you, that any re 
sources dependent on consumption will greatly increase. I believe this increase will not be merely in proportion to that of 
population, but in the compound ratio of numbers and wealth. 
This last will be abundantly produced by an industrious people 
from a luxuriant soil. Taxation moreover excites industry and 
necessitates economy. It increases also the commercial medium, inasmuch as it creates a domestic object for the application of money, and forces an interior circulation. 
</p><p>
Pardon me while on this chapter, for expressing my apprehension that the sale of western lands will not produce the present relief expected, and it will consume a valuable future resource. 
America has not the needful money capital. I put aside taxation, and consider only the three great objects of agriculture, 
manufactures, and commerce. These in populous and polished 
societies present themselves in the order I have just placed 
them ; but this order is inverted with us. Commerce, by more 
potent means, commands a preference. To supply its wants 
a bank is useful, but its operations will not produce all that is 
expected. Among many other reasons, because we have not 
yet a great centre of commerce, finance, and money dealing. 
The payment of interest in the States has a tendency also to 
obviate and impede bank circulation. The channels of commerce are not yet duly filled. Those of manufactures are 
scarcely moistened ; those of agriculture are absolutely dry. 
Whenever therefore the government puts up lands for sale, it calls 
money from those objects to which I verily believe it might be 
more advantageously applied. The purchaser calculates, and 
will not part with his cash, till he sees greater benefit than in 
any other appropriation, Under present circumstances the 
hesitation will be whether to purchase stocks or lands. If by 
lowering the price of land you make that the greater temptation, stocks must fall, and then foreigners will buy them cheap. 
The land if sold cannot be cultivated, but if not sold it cannot 
run away as the stocks do. Besides, by throwing more land 
on the market you ruin those, who have no means to pay debts 
but by sale of real estate, &c. &ic. I quit the discussion and 
indeed beg your pardon for entering into it. 
</p><p>
My letters from London of the 24th and 28th of December 
will have communicated what passed with the British administration. I am sorry now that I spoke to them, because from 
yours of the 17th of that month I find it was the President's 
pleasure, that no other application should be made, but I flatter 
myself that the manner was such, as by no means to compromise the dignity of our country.
</p><p>
You very kindly, my dear Sir, in that letter communicate the 
President's approbation of my conduct. I cannot tell you the 
pleasure which this occasions, but you will estimate it by your 
own feelings under similar circumstances. Pardon me for 
adding that I feel highly gratified in receiving the communication from you. 
</p><p>
In this letter you enclose an order for <a href='/results.php?year=2475'>2475</a> florins, on the 
bankers in Holland. Make for me I pray you the proper acknowledgements. Pecuniary considerations never yet weighed with me, where the public service was in question ; and 
therefore immediately on receipt of the President's orders, I 
proceeded, without regarding other objects, as speedily as I 
could to London. Previous engagements had indeed rendered it my duty to go to Amsterdam, and on that route I made 
those inquiries which you once desired I would. The result 
has since been occasionally communicated to Mr Short. I 
embarked at Helvoetsluys the twenty-fourth of March, and 
continued in London til) the twenty-fourth of September, al 
though I had no business of my own there, but such as I could 
have transacted by letters. I would have staid still longer had 
I imagined it could have been of any use. My expenses dur- 
</p><p>
the 16th, and September the 18th, have come to hand. They suffice 
to remove all doubts, which might have been entertained as to the real 
intentions of the British cabinet, on the several matters confided to you. 
The view of government in troubling you with this business was, either to remove from between the two nations all causes of difference, 
by a fair and friendly adjustment, if such was the intention of the other 
party, or to place it beyond a doubt that such was not their intention. In 
result it is clear enough, that further applications would tend to delay 
rather than advance our object. It is therefore the pleasure of the 
President, that no others be made ; and that in whatever state this letter 
may find the business, in that state it be left. I have it in charge at 
the same time to assure you, that your conduct in these communications 
with the British Ministers has met the President's entire approbation, 
and to convey to you his acknowledgements for your services. 
</p><p>
As an attendance on this business must, at times, have interfered with 
your private pursuits, and subjected you also to additional expenses, 
I have the honor to enclose you a draft on our bankers in Holland for 
a thousand dollars, as an indemnification for those sacrifices,ing that period were 489 : 6 : 6 ; but I did not intend to 
ask compensation, nor do I mention them now in that view. 
</p><p>
Since I have been in this city a matter has turned up, which 
is very interesting to America, and the result of which is by no 
means pleasing. I mean the decrees respecting tobacco. 
The second day of this month I was requested to go to <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Monsieur De Lafayette</a>, and thence with him to speak on that subject to the Committee of Commerce. I went to his house, but 
declined waiting on the Committee, unless they should previously desire it. This was fortunate, for the arrangements had 
been so illy made that the Committee did not meet, and for 
little reasons not worth mentioning, some of the members were 
predisposed not to receive information. On the 9th I dined 
with him, in consequence of a note desiring me to confer on 
American business. After dinner Mr Swan, Colonel Walker, 
and I were introduced into his closet with a M. Raymond, and 
another man whose name I forget ; but he was I believe some 
thing in the consulate at New York. <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Monsieur De Lafayette</a> 
asked our opinion on the question then agitated, respecting a 
free culture of tobacco in France. Mirabeau had moved to 
prohibit it, after a certain time, even in the privileged provinces, 
but <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Monsieur De Lafayette</a> considered it as standing closely 
connected with the disaffection then prevalent in Alsace. Mr Swan gave it as his opinion, that if the free culture was allowed, the introduction of that article from America must speedily cease. M. Raymond insisted that the culture, if permitted, 
would not be pursued ; but it seemed to me that he did not, 
and indeed could not, think so. The other gentleman was silent. Colonel Walker observed, that he supposed France would 
consult her own interest, and therefore it was not worth while 
to inquire what was the interest of America ; and in this I think 
he judged perfectly well. I refused to give an opinion, but 
stated facts to show that Mr Swan was right in his judgment, 
and then observed that the question seemed to turn on the sin 
gle point, whether they could dispense with the revenue ; for 
if they could not, they must consider the means of obtaining it, 
which were either Duty, Excise, Farm, or Regie. That the 
first would, if great, be eluded. The second was not now 
practicable ; the third was unfashionable ; and by the last they 
would be cheated. If, however, they would dispense with the 
revenue, then not only they might allow the free culture, but 
they ought to allow the free commerce. I stated the advantages which would result from the latter. He seemed surprised 
at some things as not having presented themselves, and pressed for an opinion, to which I replied, that I would not advise, 
but predict. That they would begin by allowing the free culture, which would annihilate the revenue ; and in less than two 
years they would prohibit the culture to recover the revenue. 
The thing has turned out as I expected as far as it went. 
Colonel Ternant has endeavored to prevent the culture, and to 
render the commerce as free as possible, but in vain. We 
have held sundry conferences on the subject together. He 
communicated to me what was doing, and I gave him all the 
information I could. The Assembly have allowed the culture, 
and laid a duty of twenty-five livres per quintal upon the import, one fourth of which is taken off from such as may be 
brought from America in French bottoms. This, in addition 
to the heavy duty on our oil, bears hard. To the arguments 
of such as blame these decrees it is answered, that it will be 
necessary to form a commercial treaty with America, and then 
everything can be regulated. 
</p><p>
I had hitherto, you will observe, kept as clear as I could from 
interfering ; but the matter had now put on an appearance, 
which demanded the exertions of every American citizen. On 
the seventeenth, therefore, I called on <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Monsieur De Lafayette</a>. 
He desired me to give him a note on the subject, siid that 
Mirabeau had promised to speak about it ; and that he expected the Diplomatic Committee would take the matter up. I had 
been told long before what part Mirabeau would take, and how 
much he would receive for his agency. I asked, therefore, 
whether it would not answer for the king to object, because the 
Assembly being much divided, a trifle would turn the balance, 
and it had been said, that if he would himself have taken a part in the debate the question would have been otherwise decided, 
He told me he would rather the United States should be indebted to the nation than to the king. But if things go on at 
the present rate we shall be indebted to neither. 
</p><p>
The next day I called on the Count de Montmorin, who as 
sured me he would do all in his power. By way of a spur I 
told him, that it was currently reported in London, that the 
British were going to send out a Minister to America, that I 
had good reason to believe it was their wish to form an offensive 
and defensive alliance with us, and presumed that he was acquainted with their intentions. He replied, as I supposed he 
would, in the affirmative. Upon this I asked him whether it 
would answer any good purpose for me to write him a letter on 
the subject. He pressed me earnestly to do so the next day, 
as he was in the evening of it to meet the Diplomatic Committee. 
In consequence I wrote on the nineteenth that of which a 
copy is enclosed. 
</p><p>
You will observe that I hint at the views of Great Britain in 
such manner, that he must take on himself any communication 
of that sort to the Committee. As to the observations, I stated 
them as being made by American citzens in order to supply the 
defect of ministerial character, and also to keep myself out of 
sight, not choosing to be quoted in any of their deliberations. 
I have communicated these steps to Mr Short, and am now endeavoring to obtain, if possible, a duty per arpent on the culture 
equivalent to the import duty, supposing each arpent to produce 
eight quintals. This, which would, I sincerely believe, be use 
less to France, would also prevent the sudden decrease in the 
consumption of our tobacco. And although I am convinced 
that planting it is bad husbandry, yet I wish my countrymen 
rather to correct themselves by their own experience, than receive such a shock from abroad. 
</p><p>
As yet there is little hope of success to any proposition for alleviating, much less removing, the burthens they have laid 
upon us. The greater part have adopted systematic reasonings in matters of commerce as in those of government, so 
that, disdaining attention to facts and deaf to the voice of 
experience, while others deliberate they decide, and are the 
more constant in their opinions in proportion as they are less 
acquainted with the subject, which is natural enough. Stat pro 
rations voluntas has, you know, been the adage with those, who 
have much of one and little of the other, from time immemorial, and the Assembly will not, I think, lose by non-user that 
valuable franchise. 
</p><p>
I will do myself the honor to communicate such farther 
matter as may occur in this regard, and beg leave in the mean 
time to assure you of the sincerity with which I am, &c.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I am to acknowledge the receipt of yours of the seventeenth of December, which reached me several days ago, but no good opportunity then presented itself to convey a reply. The 
idea you formed of the British cabinet was, I am persuaded, perfectly just. This government has lately taken some steps, 
which cannot but be advantageous to their rivals, for T am persuaded that the late duress laying a heavy duty on oil, giving 
a great preference of duty on tobacco imported in French 
ships, and declaring that none but those built in France shall 
be reputed French bottoms, will excite much ill humor in 
America. Those who rule here seem to think, that because 
the old government was sometimes wrong, everything contrary 
to what they did must be right ; like Jack in the Tale of the 
Tub, who tore his coat to pieces in pulling off the fringe, points, 
and trimmings that Peter had put on. Or like the Old Congress in its young days, which rejected the offer of valuable 
contracts, and employed a host of commissaries and quarter 
masters, because Great Britain dealt with contractors. 
</p><p>
In the debate on this subject one of the Lameths gave it as 
his opinion, that America was not in a situation to be either 
sought or feared for some time to come. This, which is not 
however the sentiment of the party, occasioned some hints in 
the close of the observations I sent to M. de Montmorin, and 
of which a copy has been transmitted to Mr Jefferson. I 
hope that the Congress will not act precipitately in consequence 
of these decrees, for I believe that proper representations in a 
proper moment will produce a change, and really, in the pre 
sent effervescence, very few acts of the Assembly can be considered as deliberate movements of national will. 
</p><p>
Congress has commenced its third session. Our affairs assume 
a good aspect. Public credit is high, and stocks have arisen amazingly. Except the disturbances occasioned by a few hostile Indians on 
our western frontier (instigated thereto, I am persuaded, by the British 
traders,) and some remains of the old leven, the wheels of government 
move without interruption, and gather strength as they move. The 
numbers of our people, so far as they can be ascertained by the present 
state of the census, will not fall short, it is said, of five millions ; some 
think more. Whilst this will on the one hand astonish Europe, it 
may on the other add consequence to the union of these Stales. 
There still continue to be three parties here. The Enrages, 
long since known by the name of Jacobins, have lost much in 
the public opinion, so that they are less powerful in the Assembly than they were ; but their Committees of Correspondence, 
(called Societes Patriotiques) spread all over the kingdom, have 
given them a deep, strong hold of the people. On the other 
hand, the numerous reforms, some of them unnecessary and all 
either harsh, precipitate, or extreme, have thrown into the aristocratic party a great number of discontented. The military, who 
as such look up to the sovereign, are somewhat less factious than 
they were, but they are rather a mob than an army, and must, I 
think, fall either to the Aristocratic or Jacobin side of the question. 
</p><p>
The middle men are in a whimsical situation. In the Sen 
ate they follow the Jacobin counsels, rather than appear connected with the other party. The same principle of shame-faced-ness operates on great occasions out of doors ; but as the Aristocrats have been forced down by a torrent of opinion from the 
heights of their absurd pretensions, and as the middle men begin 
to be alarmed at the extremities to which they have been hurried, these two parties might come together, if it were not for 
personal animosities among the leaders. This middle party 
would be the strongest, if the nation were virtuous ; but, alas, 
this is not the case, and therefore I think it will only serve as a 
stepping stone for those, who may find it convenient to change 
sides. 
</p><p>
In the midst however of all these confusions, what with confiscating the church property, selling the domains, curtailing 
pensions, and destroying offices, but especially by that great liquidater of public debts, a paper currency, this nation is working its way to a new state of active energy, which will I think 
be displayed as soon as a vigorous government shall establish 
itself. The intervening confusions will probably call forth men 
of talents to form such government and to exert its powers. 
</p><p>
In a letter I had the honor to write on the twenty-second of 
November, I mentioned a treaty made between the Baltic powers. I do not know whether I drew this idea from information 
or conjecture, but it was in my mind and still continues there. 
While in England waiting at Whitehall for the Duke of Leeds, 
who was accidentally prevented from keeping his appointment, 
I had a long conversation with Mr Burgess, who seemed desirous of convincing me, that he was an efficient man in the office of Foreign Affairs. I asked him whether such treaty existed, insinuating that he must certainly be informed of every 
movement in that, as in every other quarter. He assured me 
positively that it did not ; but that assurance did not alter my 
opinion. Indeed the object of my question was to discover, 
whether they were at all upon terms with Sweden, and from 
what afterwards passed, I am persuaded that they are not. I 
must add that my inquiries here have been answered in the 
same way, but yet I believe that such a treaty exists. He 
spoke a good deal of the convention with Spain, and I declared 
freely my opinion, which being favorable to the administration, 
drew from him in support of it a history of the negotiation. It 
ended (as he said) in this remarkable manner. The Count de 
Florida Blanca, upon hearing of the revolt of the French Marine, 
told the British Ambassador ; You insist on the terms to which 
I am now about to agree, not because they are just, but be 
cause I am compelled to it. If France would assist us I would 
never submit ; but we are not able singly to cope with you, and 
therefore you must do as you please. You will judge, my 
dear Sir, how long such a treaty is likely to last. 
</p><p>
I am delighted with the account you give me of our public 
affairs. There can be no doubt that a publication of the census, and a clear state of our finances, will impress a sense of 
our importance on the statesmen of Europe. We are now get 
ting forward in the right way, not by little skirmishing advantages 
of political manoeuvres, but in a solid column of well formed national strength. Like Father Mason's aristocratic screw, which 
you doubtless remember, at every turn we shall now gain and 
hold what we get. It is no evil that you should have a little of 
the old leven. I have always considered an opposition in free 
governments as a kind of outward conscience, which prevents 
the administration from doing many things through inadvertence, 
which they might repent of. By these means both men and 
measures are sifted, and the necessity of appearing as well as of 
being right confirms and consolidates the good opinion of society. I expect and am indeed certain, that this good opinion 
will live with you during life, and follow weeping to your grave. 
I know you will continue to deserve it, and I hope you may long

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor to write to you on the twenty-sixth of last 
month, to which I now refer. Since that period the Assembly 
have taken another step in the same disagreeable road. They 
have deprived all ships other than those built in France of the 
privilege of French bottoms. This, added to the other .duress 
already noticed, produces, I am told, much sensation among 
the few Americans who are settled in the ports of this king 
dom. 
</p><p>
You will find enclosed herein a copy of the note, which I gave 
to the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>. He told me in conversation 
when I urged his interference, that by so doing he should injure us, because his enemies had already voted against us, 
contrary to their general opinion, merely to vex and injure 
him. This is very unfortunate. I am, &c,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to enclose a letter and sundry papers relating to it, from Messieurs Shweizer, Jeannerst & Co. I have 
referred these gentlemen to Mr Short, telling them that it is 
most fitting in many respects that they should apply to him. 
</p><p>
As it is possible, however, that this business may come before 
you, I think it a duty to convey some observations which occur 
to me, and which may not perhaps strike you, because matters 
of that sort have not, I believe, much occupied your attention. 
Previous thereto I beg leave, however, to give you a history of 
my acquaintance with it. In a letter to <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague'>Colonel Hamilton</a>, of the 
31st of January, <a href='/results.php?year=1790'>1790</a>, I mentioned what had passed between M. 
Necker and me respecting the debt due by the United States to 
France, and I hinted the means of turning to useful account a 
very precipitate step of the public agents in Holland. About 
this time I received your orders to communicate with the British 
ministers, and although I did by no means consider that in the of duty on American ships, without any particular object except to 
punish Lafayette. This may seem a strange reason, but it is a true 
one. The Aristocrats, as such, are his enemies, and those who wished 
to preserve the valuable revenue upon tobacco were mortified, at seeing it thrown away in the manner I have related. Some of my particular acquaintances in the Assembly, to whom I mentioned the ill 
policy of these decrees, assured me that they would not have been 
passed had <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Monsieur De Lafayette</a>, who was present, opposed them ; 
but he being there, they left him to step forward, it being as it were his 
particular business ; and he being silent, they were taken by surprise , 
whereas had he been absent they would certainly have made head, and 
obtained an adjournment at least. The exclusion of our ships, also, 
from being admitted as French bottoms, arises from the same desire to 
show that his support of America is useless, and at the same time they 
have circulated that he prefers America to France, in consequence of 
which he is afraid to do anything pointed, lest he should lose his 
popularity. 
light of an appointment to office, yet from motives of delicacy I 
determined to extricate myself from the affairs of the debt, as 
speedily as I could with propriety. Various applications were 
made to me from different quarters, to which I replied evasively ; but in my arrival in this city last November, I informed the parties that I had reasons of a private nature, which deter 
red me from holding any share in their speculation. I con 
versed with Mr Short on the same subject, and communicated 
to him confidentially my reasons for declining an interest, as 
well as my opinion respecting the use which might be derived 
from such negotiation. 
</p><p>
A few days after the President of the Committee of Finance, 
happening to meet me at the Count de Montmorin s, mentioned some proposals then before them, which to the best of my 
remembrance were extravagant I declined giving an opinion 
without previously seeing and considering the terms, upon 
which he and M. de Montmorin agreed together, that before 
anything was concluded the various propositions which might 
be made should be submitted to my examination. Here the 
thing dropped, and the enclosed papers show the reason why, 
for it appears from them that a bargain was made shortly after 
by the Controleur General with a different company. Mr Short mentioned this to me on his return hither in the end of 
March, telling me that the parties concerned were, as he was 
informed in Amsterdam, men of no credit nor capital. I of 
course agreed with him in opinion, that if so, it was not worth 
while to listen to them. 
</p><p>
A few days after one of them called on me, and after giving a history of the affair, begged me to make use of my good 
offices. I told him at once that it was ridiculous to ask a com 
mission of five per cent on changing the nature of our debt. 
That it was quite as convenient to owe France as to owe the 
subjects of France ; and further, that before any treaty was offered, persons of credit and capital should appear. As soon 
as I made this last observation, he drew out the letter of the 
Comptroller General, and showing me the second clause of it, replied; that after what was there contained no man had a right 
to question the solidity of the society. He then added, that 
for my private satisfaction he would prove that people of the 
first fortune were connected therein, and indeed he gave me 
such proof. I told him upon this, that they must apply to 
Mr Short, or to their own ministry, whose support would be 
much more efficacious than the sentiments of any private individual. I mentioned nevertheless to Mr Short, the substance 
of this conversation. While he was in the country the enclosed letter was received. He returned to town yesterday, and 
called on me in the evening, when I communicated to him the 
purport of it. 
</p><p>
I have ever been of opinion, that as we are not in condition 
to pay our debt to France, a bargain by which the period can 
be prolonged, without loss to either party, is desirable. I say 
without loss, because the conduct of this nation has been so 
generous to us, that it would be very ungrateful indeed to take 
advantage of those necessities, which the succor afforded to 
America has occasioned. Such bargain must be either with 
the government or with individuals. But after the repeated 
delays on our part, to ask longer time would not look well. 
Indeed no such treaty could be made without the consent of 
the Assembly, and their observations would not be pleasant. 
A bargain with individuals has the advantage of bringing in 
the aid of private interest to the support of our credit, and 
what is of very great consequence, it would leave us at liberty 
to make use of that credit for the arrangement of our domestic 
affairs. And on this head I must mention to you, my dear 
Sir, that it has been my good fortune to prevent some publications, which would have been particularly injurious to us. 
Their object was to complain of the United States for speculating in their own effects with the funds of France ; urging that 
while we owed heavy instalments already due here, all the 
loans we obtain in Holland ought to be applied to the discharge of them, and therefore that the speculations in our domestic debt were a double violation of good faith, &ic. &c. 
The present state of things here has occasioned so great a 
fall in the exchange, that money borrowed in Holland is remitted with great gain, consequently loans made there just 
now answer well, and it is evident that the parties, who are 
endeavoring to contract, count on a considerable profit from 
that circumstance. Much however is to be said on this part 
of the subject. 
</p><p>
First, it is questionable whether our reputation may not be 
a little affected, for you will recollect that about one third of 
our debt to France arose from a loan made on our account in 
Holland of five millions of florins, for which the King paid us here 
ten millions of livres, without any deduction for charges of any 
sort. The nation is now obliged to pay this five millions in 
Holland, and for us to borrow that amount there, and then 
squeeze them in an exchange, which distresses both their commerce and finances, looks hard. There was a good deal of 
murmuring about it when the last operation of 1,500,000 guilders took place, and I should not be at all surprised if some 
patriot, by way of showing his zeal, should make a violent at 
tack in the Assembly when the next payment is made. There 
are many of these patriots, who if they can inculpate ministers 
and distress those of different sentiments, do not care a jot for 
consequences. 
</p><p>
But supposing this not to happen, it is not possible for a 
nation to make the advantage, which individuals do in such 
things, because they must employ individuals, each of whom 
will be too apt to look a little to his own advantage. There is 
a difference also between the gain made upon parts, and that 
which would arise on the whole, for even if we could borrow all 
at once so large a sum, there can be no doubt that the remittance of it hither would greatly alter the exchange. But it is 
not possible to borrow it speedily, and the present unnatural 
state of things will, in all probability, be changed. In fact the 
leading characters are very seriously alarmed at it. If their 
paper currency should be either redeemed, or annihilated, 
or abolished tomorrow, the exchange would immediately turn 
in favor of France, and then we should lose on remittances. 
</p><p>
So much for this affair in its little details ; but there is a 
great view of it, which forcibly strikes my mind. If we were at 
liberty to turn all our efforts towards our domestic debt, we 
should by raising its value prevent speculations, which are very 
injurious to the country, if not to the government. Millions 
have already been bought at a low price, and afterwards negotia 
ted in Europe. Neither is that all, for if we can borrow at 
five per cent and buy up our six per cent debt at par, we gain 
at once by that operation one fifth of the interest, or twenty per 
cent, which, besides all the other good consequences, is much 
more than ever we shall get by any management of our debts 
on this side of the water. 
</p><p>
I have given you, my dear Sir, these hints in abridgement, 
because my time will not admit of dilating them ; attribute them, 
I pray you, to the true cause, and believe me always very sincerely yours,

My Dear Friend, 
</p><p>
My last was from London of the twenty- eighth of June. The 
latest I have received from you is of the third of May. You 
will have heard, through various channels, of the King's escape 
from the Tuileries. By the bye, he was said to be in perfect 
liberty there ; but yet our good friend Lafayette was very near 
being hanged because he got away, and his justification tends 
to show, that his Majesty, besides his parole given, was so closely watched that he had but little chance of getting off unobserved. 
</p><p>
This step was a very foolish one. Public affairs were in 
such a situation, that, if he had been quiet, he would have soon 
been master, because the anarchy, which prevails, would have 
shown the necessity of conferring more authority, and because 
it is not possible so to balance a single Assembly against a Prince, 
but that one must prove too heavy for the other, or too light for 
the business. 
</p><p>
The Assembly also, very strongly suspected of corrupt practices, was falling fast in the public estimation. His departure 
changed everything ; and now the general wish seems to be for 
a republic, which is quite in the natural order of things. Yesterday the Assembly decreed, that the King, being inviolable, 
could not be involved in the accusations to be made against 
those concerned in his evasion. This has excited much heat 
against them. The people are now assembling on the occasion, 
and the militia (many of them opposed to the King) are out. 
As I lodge near the Tuileries, it is far from improbable, that 
I shall have a battle under my windows. The vanguard of the 
populace is to be formed by two or three thousand women. 
A good smart action would, I think, be useful rather than pernicious. 
</p><p>
But the great evil arises from a cause not easily re 
moved. It will, I think, be scarcely possible to confer authority on, or in other words to obtain obedience for, a man, who 
has entirely forfeited the public opinion ; and, if they lay him 
aside, I do not see how they are to manage a regency. His 
brothers are abroad, and so is the Prince of Conde. The 
Duke of Orleans is loaded with universal contempt ; and if they 
should name a council of regency, they would be obliged to 
take either feeble or suspected characters. Add to this the 
struggle, which must arise in a state where there is a King de 
throned, and that for trivial causes. At the same time, the state 
of their finances is detestable, and growing worse everyday. 
They have passed a law against emigrations, although by their 
bill of rights, every man has a right to go where he pleases. 
But this, you know, is the usual fate of bills of rights. How 
long the restrictions may continue is uncertain. I am, &c.

My Dear Friend, 
</p><p>
My last was of the sixteenth. The riot of that day went off 
pretty easily, but the next morning two men were lanterned 
and mangled in the Parisian taste. This occasioned some 
little stir. There had been a pretty general summons to the 
friends of liberty, requesting them to meet in the Champ de 
Mars. The object of this meeting was to persuade the Assembly, by the gentle influence of the cord, to undo what they 
had done respecting the imprisoned monarch. As the different ministers and municipal officers had received it in charge 
from the Assembly, to maintain peace and see to the execution of the laws, they made proclamation and displayed the 
red flag. 
</p><p>
In coming from the British Ambassador s, about seven in the 
evening, I met a detachment of the militia with the red flag 
flying, and some of the civil officers. I went shortly after 
wards to a height to see the battle ; but it was over before I 
got to the ground ; for as the militia would not, as usual? 
ground their arms on receiving the word of command from the 
mob, this last began, according to custom, to pelt them with 
stones. It was hot weather, arid Sunday afternoon, for which 
time, according to usage immemorial, the inhabitants of this 
capital have generally some pleasurable engagement. To be 
disappointed in their amusement, to be paraded through the 
streets under a scorching sun, and then stand like holiday 
turkeys to be knocked down by brickbats, was a little more 
than they had patience to bear ; so that, without waiting for 
orders, they fired and killed a dozen or two of the ragged 
regiment. The rest ran off like lusty fellows.
</p><p>
If the militia had waited for orders, they might,. I fancy, 
have been all knocked down, before they received any. As 
it is, the business went off pretty easily. Some of them have 
since been assassinated, but not above five or six, as far as I 
can learn. Lafayette was very near being killed in the morning ; but the pistol snapped at his breast. The assassin was 
immediately secured, but he ordered him to be discharged. 
These are things on which no comment is necessary. I think 
we shall be quiet here a little while ; but it is possible enough, 
that seizing some plausible occasion, a violent effort will be 
made, and then, if the militia succeed, order will be estabed. Adieu. I am very truly and affectionately yours, 
</p><p>

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Mr Short has delivered to me within these few days your 
favor of the twenty-eighth of July. I cannot express to you 
what I felt on reading it. The view which it gives of our prosperity as a nation swelled my bosom with emotions, which none 
can know but those who have experienced them. The wonderful change, which has been effected in our affairs by the 
operation of the general government, has exceeded the pre 
dictions of its warmest friends. How great a source of joy is 
this to those, who have been at all instrumental in its formation and establishment ; those especially to whom Providence 
in its bounty has imparted a sincere affection for their fellow 
men. Yes, my dear Sir, man is not merely a selfish, nor a 
material being, and I attest your heart to witness the truth 
from the conviction of its own feelings. 
</p><p>
The King has at length, as you will have seen, accepted the 
new constitution, and been in consequence liberated from his arrest. It is a general and almost universal conviction that this constitution is inexecutable. The makers to a man condemn it. Judge 
what must be the opinion of others. Mr Short will doubtless 
forward all the public documents respecting it, and therefore 
1 shall not trouble you with any of them. His majesty is to 
go in about an hour hence to close the session of the National 
Assembly, and then they leave the field to their successors. 
His present business is to make himself popular ; indeed his life 
and crown depend upon it ; for the constitution is such, that he 
must soon be more or less than he is at present, and fortunately he begins to think so, but unfortunately his advisers have 
neither the sense nor the spirit, which the occasion calls for. 
</p><p>
The new Assembly, as far as can at present be determined, 
is deeply imbued with republican or rather democratical principles. The southern part of this kingdom is in the same disposition. The northern is ecclesiastical in its temper. The 
eastern is attached to Germany, and would gladly be reunited 
to the empire. Normandy is aristocratical. and so is part of Britany. The interior part of the kingdom is monarchical. 
This map is (you may rely on it) just, for it is the result of great 
and expensive investigations made by government, and I think 
you will be able by the help of it, and of the few observations 
which precede it, fully to understand many things, which would 
not otherwise perhaps be so easily unriddled. You doubtless 
recollect that the now expiring Assembly was convened to ar 
range the finances, and you will perhaps be surprised to learn, 
that after consuming church property to the amount of one 
hundred millions sterling, they leave this department much 
worse than they found it. Such however is the fact, and the 
chance now is, in my opinion, rather for than against a bankruptcy. 
</p><p>
The aristocrats, who are gone and going in great numbers to 
join the refugee princes, believe sincerely in a coalition- of the 
powers of Europe to reinstate their sovereign in his ancient 
authorities ; but I believe they are very much mistaken. Nothing of consequence can be attempted this year, and many things 
may happen before the month of June next, were the several 
potentates in earnest. I am led to imagine, that their views are 
very different from those which are now assigned to them, and 
it is very far from impossible that the attempt, if any, will, so 
far as France is concerned, be confined to a dismemberment. 
The weak side of this kingdom, as matters now stand, is Flanders ; but were the provinces of Alsace, Lorraine, French Flanders, and Artois rent away, the capital would be constantly ex 
posed to the visits from an enemy. These provinces were, you 
know, acquired at an immense expense of blood and treasure, 
and if Louis the Fourteenth could have succeeded in making 
the Rhine his boundary, from Switzerland to the ocean, he 
would have obtained the advantages almost of an insular position. 
Indeed it is difficult to abstain from the wish, that the countries 
included within that boundary were united under a free efficient 
government, since it would, in all human probability, be the 
means of dispensing the blessings of freedom in no distant period to all Europe. But on this subject it is now permitted to 
a rational being to form rather wishes than hopes, much less 
expectations. 
</p><p>
I will enclose herein a note just now received of the latest 
intelligence from Coblentz. It is written by the Prince de Conde to his confidential friend here, and is accompanied by 
the request that all French gentlemen, capable of actual service, 
will immediately repair to the standard of royalty beyond the 
Rhine, or rather on the banks of that river. To the troops 
mentioned in this note are added by the counter revolutionists 
here 15,000 Hessians and 16,000 French refugees, so that 
exclusively of what the Emperor may bring forward, they muster an army, on paper, of 100,000 men. The Emperor has 
about 5,000 men in the low countries. But all these appearances, and the proposed Congress of Ambassadors at Aix la Chapelle, do not in the least change my opinion, that nothing 
serious will be attempted this year. 
</p><p>
M. de Montmorin has resigned, and the Count de Moustier 
is named as his successor, but whether he will accept seems to 
be very doubtful. He is now at Berlin, and as he is an intimate of M. de Calonne, who is one mainspring of the counter revolution, he is, I presume, in the secret of what may be 
really in agitation. This on one side ; and on the other an 
office, the power and authority of which are just nothing at all; 
for you will observe, that by the new constitution every treaty 
and convention whatever must be submitted to the investigation of the Assembly to be by them accepted or rejected. 
</p><p>
You will have seen I suppose, ere this arrives, what has been 
done here respecting the colonies. It is supposed that, they 
will be perfectly satisfied, because their internal legislation is 
left to themselves ; but I much doubt this, for their commerce, which involves their existence, is left entirely at the 
mercy of the Assembly, which will not be over attentive to their 
interests, when they fall into competition with those of the 
mother country. 
</p><p>
I send out to Mr Morris a bundle of pamphlets written 
here by a M. de Cormere, according to hints and observations 
which I furnished to him. Mr Morris will give you one, and 
you will see that it was calculated to produce a liberal system of 
colonial government, beneficial to them and to us. In order 
to bring it about, it was proposed that commissioners should be 
sent out with full powers to treat with the colonial Assemblies, 
and could that have been carried, this pamphlet would have 
been the groundwork of the instructions. The proposition was 
rejected, but as it is more than probable, that the colonies will 
have had a full taste of the sweets of free trade before the 
troubles are composed, and as they will have learnt that fear 
can produce what reason could not, I do expect that at length 
this government must come into some such measure, and there 
by not only the stumbling block will be taken out of the way 
to a useful treaty between France and the United States, but 
at the same time, and by the same means, the road will be laid 
open for solid connexion with Great Britain. 
</p><p>
In all cases we have the consolation, that if the powers of 
Europe by their excluding principles deprive us of the needful vent for our produce, which becomes daily more and more 
abundant, we shall, from the cheapness of living and of raw 
materials, which results from that circumstance, make great and rapid progress in useful manufactures. This alone is wanting 
to complete our independence. We shall then be, as it were, 
a world by ourselves, and far from the jars and wars of Europe, 
their various revolutions will serve merely to instruct and 
amuse ; like the roaring of a tempestuous sea, which at a certain distance becomes a pleasing sound. 
</p><p>
Farewell, my dear Sir ; that you may be well and happy is 
the sincere wish of yours, &tc.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I am favored with yours of the twenty-sixth of July,  for 
which I pray you to accept my thanks. I mentioned to you 
from London, that Mr Walpole had been offered the place of 
Envoy Extraordinary to the United States, which he had refused. I took care to avoid any sort of intercourse with the 
government while I was there, and of course could not possess 
any minute information worthy of your notice. I avoided also 
seeing any of the chiefs of opposition, lest some conclusions of 
a disagreeable nature should be drawn from that circumstance. 
Of course it was not until my arrival in this city, that I learnt 
(from the British Ambassador here) what had been done. 
Mr Hammond was sent for from Spain, and passed through 
this city while I was in London. I do not know whether he is gone out ; if not, you have long since I suppose received the 
communication of his appointment. The plan seems to have been that which I long since mentioned, viz. the sending out a 
minister with letters of credence in his pocket, to be delivered when you shall appoint one to their court. 
</p><p>
From a variety of small circumstances I am convinced, that the British cabinet begins very seriously to consider its situation in respect to us. The rapid rise of our credit, the wise 
decisions of our courts, the general peace and order which 
prevail, and the gradual display of our population, wealth, and 
industry, produce very great effect upon their minds. Let 
me add that the calm dignity of those, who are at the head of 
our affairs, has a considerable influence. Events confirm me 
in the opinion, which I formed from an attentive consideration of the subject, and I think we may calculate almost with 
certainty on forming a good treaty with that country, as soon as 
they shall determine to form any treaty ; and until that time, 
I agree fully with you, that attempts on our part should be such 
only, as to justify to the world that conduct which it becomes 
us to pursue. I know that among the many, whose duty or 
occupation it may be to consider this subject, there must be a 
variety of opinions, because dispositions differ, because prejudices exist, because interests sway, in a word, because men are 
men ; but Time will set his seal of truth on that which is right. 
I am, &tc.

My Dear Friend. 
</p><p>
The people of this city are become wonderfully fond of the 
King, and have a thorough contempt for the Assembly, who 
are, in general, what used to be called in Philadelphia, the blue 
stockings. There is, however, this difference between the 
two capitals, that with you virtuous poverty is respected, but 
here splendor is indispensable. Judge the consequence, and 
to enlighten that judgment, know that at this moment they 
stand on the brink of bankruptcy, which can only be avoided 
by increasing the vigor of the executive magistrate. This 
becomes daily more and more apparent ; and Paris exists, as 
it were, on the interest of the national debt. 
These facts will enable you to understand, why the other 
evening at the Italian comedy, as it is called, the parterre, or 
people, cried out continually Vive le Roy; Vive la Heine; 
Vive, la famille royale. Sire, vive votre Majeste. These 
words, Sire and JWajeste, were, you know, proscribed by the 
Assembly, which was obliged, by a strong expression of the 
popular sentiment, to retract that decree the very next day. 
A patriot, in the midst of this acclamation, took it into his 
head to cry Vive la Nation, but the rest silenced him immediately. 
</p><p>
Now, my dear friend, this is the very same people who, 
when the King was brought back from his excursion, whipped 
a democratical Dutchess of my acquaintance, because they 
heard only the last part of what she said, which was, 11 nefaut 
pas dire, vive le Roi. She had the good sense to desire the 
gentleman, who was with her, to leave her. Whipping is, you 
know, an operation which a lady would rather undergo among 
strangers, than before her acquaintance. 
</p><p>
The provinces are not as yet in the same disposition with 
the capital, and I think they will not be so for a long time to 
come. But accidents may happen to change either the one 
or the other, and it is difficult to decide with precision on a 
people and situation so fluctuating and inconstant. I am, &ic.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 12th of September reached me a few days 
ago. In the proposition of S. J. and Co. I saw the means of 
saving somewhat to the United States, without incurring the 
odium of a payment in depreciated paper ; but since a de-^ 
termination to pay in value is adopted, I heartily and entirely approve of the rejection of their offer. 
Before the receipt of your letter Mr Short communicated to 
me, in general terms, the intention to make good the depreciation on the money paid here before, and told me at the same 
time that it seemed to be in contemplation to pay in specie, 
about which he felt himself much embarrassed ; for in that 
case there would be a loss of about five per cent, which, with 
the commissions on loans, &tc. &tc. would increase the debt 
about one tenth, instead of paying it with advantage. And 
this arises from a circumstance which is, I believe, the common attendant of paper money, viz. that specie is higher in 
proportion than foreign exchanges. 
</p><p>
This will be best understood by assigning what I conceive 
to be the cause of that difference. I begin by rejecting the 
theories of speculative men, who suppose that bills of exchange 
are drawn and purchased for payment of -reciprocal debts, and 
the like. I reject equally the stock-jobbing operations of 
bankers, and confining my view to the ordinary course of 
things, I observe, that when a man purchases in France goods 
which are to be sold in England, he pays for those goods by 
the proceeds of bills drawn on England, and as he makes the 
acquisition of the goods with a view to the future sales, he 
governs himself by the usual price of such goods in the country to which they are to be sent. 
</p><p>
The rate of exchange, therefore, enters into his consideration 
only so far as by means thereof the price he is to pay for his 
goods may be affected. On the other hand, he who has 
bought goods on credit in England, which he vends in France, 
regards the exchange only in so far as it governs the price at 
which he must sell his goods. Thus the pound sterling being 
worth about twenty-five livres, if the exchange is at thirty livres 
for the pound sterling, he must advance one fifth, or twenty 
per cent on the price of English goods ; and for the same 
reason, the English agent can afford to give an advance of 
twenty per cent on French wines. Now in proportion as the 
price of English goods advances, the consumption of them 
lessens, and consequently the purchase of bills on London to pay for them diminishes ; and in proportion as the exchange 
advances, which is of course a decrease in the the real price of 
French goods, the purchase of them increases, and of course 
the sale of bills on London to pay for them, and thus the depreciation of the paper currency checks, by eventual operation, 
its immediate effect on foreign exchange. 
</p><p>
But the price of specie depends on a different cause. 
Specie, in a time of peace and good government, is but the 
sign of vveahh, and not the substance ; so that no more of it is 
found in a country, than is necessary for the interchange of 
those commodities, which form the real wealth of such country. 
And by the bye it follows, that in proportion to the degree of 
credit resulting from a vigorous execution of good laws, the 
necessity of money decreases, and it becomes plentiful by the 
prevalence of confusion, without any actual increase or decrease 
of the mass. But when a paper circulation is forced forward, 
prudent men first, and all men afterwards, desire to realize 
this property. Land is not always a convenient object for 
this purpose, because the subsequent sale is difficult, and 
merchandises are objectionable from their bulk and decay. 
The precious metals, therefore, naturally obtain a preference, 
and as their quantity is by no means proportionate to the real 
wealth of the country, their price is increased more rapidly 
than that of other things. But the foreign merchant, observing 
this advance, declines drawing bills unless he can get some 
thing near the price which his coin, if brought into the country, would produce, and thus the exchange follows the price 
of coin in the course of depreciation instead of preceding it. 
If I were to hazard a conjecture, as to the corollary of this 
reasoning, it would be that the quantity of the precious metals 
rather increases than diminishes in a country where paper 
money circulates. 
</p><p>
I make no apology for this digression, because if it conveys 
no information, it tends at least to explain one fact, and to 
place some others in a different light from that in which they 
are usually viewed. To return then to the subject of your letter, I must tell you, that about the same time that Mr Short's 
despatches arrived, a plan was imagined by the colonists of St 
Domingo and proposed to the administration, for repairing the 
ravages committed by their slaves in the late insurrection, by 
appropriating to that purpose the debt of the United States to 
France. One of them came to converse with me on the subject ; but supposing it to be some new scheme of speculation, 
I refused to listen to him. A few days after, however, the 
Minister of the Marine told me that he had sent him, and de 
sired me to consider the matter and see if something could not 
be done. In consequence of this I mentioned to Mr Short, 
who is now in Holland, a plan which appeared to me useful to 
the two countries ; and before his departure we agreed on certain principles to govern in that business, conformably to which 
the minister is now acting. I shall send you his address to 
the Assembly on the subject, and if the thing he has in view is 
effected, I will detail it to you ; if not, I will spare you the perusal of so much useless writing. 
</p><p>
As to the state of things here, I would convey it to you as 
fully as propriety will admit ; but I know not yet by what opportunity this letter will go, and the Post Office was never 
more abused under the most despotic ministers than it is at present, notwithstanding the decrees to the contrary. Every 
letter I receive bears evident marks of patriotic curiosity. This anxious spirit of pettifogging villany proves the fear of 
those who make use of it ; and truly they have reason to fear, 
for every day proves more clearly that their new constitution is good for nothing. 
</p><p>
Those, whom I had warned in season of the mischiefs they 
were preparing, endeavor, now that it is too late, to lay the 
blame on others by way of excusing themselves, but the truth 
is that instead of seeking the public good by doing what was 
right, each sought his own advantage by flattering the public 
opinion. They dare not now propose the amendments, which 
they perceive and acknowledge to be indispensable. They 
have besides no confidence in each other, for every one feels 
a reason against it, and meets moreover with daily proofs that 
his copatriots are no better than himself. 
</p><p>
The Assembly (as you who know such bodies will naturally 
suppose) commits every day new follies, and if this unhappy 
country be not plunged anew into the horrors of despotism, it 
is not their fault. They have lately made a master stroke to 
that effect. They have resolved to attack their neighbors, unless they dissipate the assemblies of French emigrants, who 
have taken refuge in their dominions. These neighbors are 
members of the German Empire, and France threatens to carry into their country, not fire and sword, but la liberte. Now 
as this last word does not, in the acceptation of German courts, mean so much liberty as insurrection, you will see that the pre 
text is given for hostilities without violating the law of nations. 
</p><p>
Add to this, that three French armies of fifty thousand men 
each are ordered to assemble on the frontiers. One under 
your old acquaintance Rochambeau, in Flanders ; one under our 
friend Lafayette in Lorraine, so as to penetrate by the Moselle 
river into the electorate of Treves; and one under a Monsieur Luckner in Alsace. This last T am told has but slender abili 
ties; the other two you are acquainted with. Putting all 
other things out of the question it is self-evident, that the Empire 
must bring force to oppose force thus ordered, and in consequence it is not to be doubted, that fifty thousand Prussian and 
fifty thousand Austrian troops will make their appearance as 
speedily as circumstances can permit. 
</p><p>
Now I am thoroughly convinced, that if this country were 
united under a good government, and in peace with England, 
they could set the rest of Europe at defiance ; but you have no 
idea, my dear Sir, of a society so loosely organized. America 
in the worst of times was much better, because at least the 
criminal law was executed, not to mention the mildness % of our 
manners. My letters predicting their present situation may 
perhaps have appeared like the wanderings of exaggerated fancy, but believe me, they are within the coldest limits of truth. 
Their army is undisciplined to a degree you can hardly conceive. Already great numbers desert to what they expect will 
become the enemy. Their Gardes Nationales, who have turned 
out as volunteers, are in many instances that corrupted scum of 
overgrown population, of which large cities purge themselves, 
and which, without constitution to support the fatigues, or courage to encounter the perils of war, have every vice and every 
disease, which can render them the scourge of their friends and 
the scoff of their foes. 
</p><p>
The finances are so deplorably bad, that the bankruptcy, 
which actually exist by the depreciation of the paper money, 
must soon be declared by stopping payment in some quarter or 
other, unless those effectual remedies be applied, which seem to 
be beyond the power of the government, and beyond the talents 
of those who administer it. The discontent is general, but it 
does not break out, partly because the antipathy to the Aristocrats, and the fear of their tyranny still operates, and partly 
because no safe opportunity offers. Every one is bewildered 
in his meditations as to the event, and like a fleet at anchor in 
a fog, no one will set sail for fear of running foul. 
</p><p>
If they come to blows on the borders a curious scene will, I 
think, present itself. The first success on either side will decide 
the opinions of a vast number, who have in fact no opinion, but 
only the virtuous determination to adhere to the strongest party ; 
and you may rely on it, that if the enemy be tolerably successful, a person who shall visit this country two years hence will 
inquire with astonishment by what means a nation, which in 
the year <a href='/results.php?year=1788'>1788</a> was devoted to its King, became in <a href='/results.php?year=1790'>1790</a> unanimous in throwing off authority, and in <a href='/results.php?year=1792'>1792</a> as unanimous in submitting to it. The reasons are given to you in my 
letter of the 29th April, <a href='/results.php?year=1789'>1789</a>, and my fears expressed in that 
letter seem now to be on the eve of reality. The King means 
well, and may perhaps by his moderation finally succeed in 
saving his country. I hope much from this circumstance ; but, 
alas, the moderation of one who has been so wounded, so insulted, seems to be but a slender dependence, and yet I verily 
believe it to be the best, and I had almost said the only dependence. 
</p><p>
December 31st. 
</p><p>
A courier arrived last night with despatches, which are to be 
communicated to the Assembly this morning. The Emperor 
informs the King, that he has given orders to General Bender, 
who commands in the Low Countries, to protect the electorate 
of Treves with all his forces. I did not mention, as I ought to 
have done, that the courts of Berlin and Vienna have concluded a treaty for the protection of the German Empire and 
maintenance of its rights. You will have seen that the Emperor, having adopted the determination of the Diet respecting 
the claims of those princes, who have certain feudal rights 
preserved to them by the treaty of Westphalia in Alsace and 
Lorraine, reminded the King, that the dominion of France over 
those provinces is conceded by that treaty. 
</p><p>
The Dutch government has proposed a treaty with the Emperor, as sovereign of the Low Countries, for mutual aid and 
protection, in case of insurrections, which offer is accepted. 
</p><p>
All this is explained by the intrigues of France to excite 
revolt in Holland and Flanders, and the completion of such a 
treaty will place the Emperor at ease, should he operate against 
this country next spring. I am, &c.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I wrote to you on the twenty-seventh of December, but there 
were many things which I did not write, and some of them I 
will now communicate. At the close of the session of the first 
National Assembly, a coalition was brought about between the 
Jacobins and the Quatre-vingt-neufs. It is proper to explain 
these terms. The Jacobins, so called from their meeting at a 
convent or church of that name, were then the violent party. 
The others, who took their name from a club instituted in the 
year <a href='/results.php?year=1789'>1789</a>, were those who termed themselves moderate men, 
friends to order, &c. &c. The death of Mirabeau, (who was 
beyond all controversy one of the most unprincipled scoundrels 
that ever lived,) left a great chasm in the latter party. He 
was then sold to the court, and meant to bring back absolute 
authority. 
</p><p>
The chiefs of the Jacobins were violent, for two reasons. 
First, that the Quatre-vingt-neufs would not join with them 
seriously and heartily, wherefore not being able to make head 
alone, they were obliged to use the populace, and therefore to 
sacrifice to the populace. Secondly, that the objects of their 
desire were much greater, though more remote, than those of the 
other party ; for these last had never sought in the revolution 
anything else, than to place themselves comfortably, whereas 
the Jacobins did really at first desire to establish a free constitution, in the expectation that sooner or later they should be 
at the head of it. 
</p><p>
The Aristocrats, you will observe, were reduced to insignificancy before the others divided. That, you know, is a 
thing of course. You will remember, that the first Assembly 
had decreed that their members could neither hold any office 
under the crown, nor yet be chosen to represent the people. 
These decrees were partly the fruit of opposition between the 
two parties, and partly the result of suspicions, which they had 
both excited amongst the well meaning members of the Assembly. The first decree was of Jacobin parentage, to disappoint 
their enemies, who were upon the point of succeeding to office. 
The second decree was carried against the secret inclinations 
of both. But the consequence was, that each was seriously 
disappointed ; and as the constitution was clearly unable to 
support itself, they began to perceive that its ruin might involve 
their own, and therefore they formed a coalition, in which 
each determined to make use of the other for its own purposes. 
</p><p>
But you will say perhaps, that both together would be of little use ; and this is true in a degree ; for if the constitution 
had been a practicable thing, those alone who were in power 
under it could have any real authority. But that was not the 
case, and therefore the plan of the Allies was to induce a be 
lief in the court, that they alone had sufficient popularity in the 
nation to preserve the monarchical authority against the republican party, and on the other hand to convince the Assembly, 
that (having in their hands the royal authority) all favor, offices, 
and grants must come through them. Thus they constituted 
themselves, if I may be allowed the expression, the government brokers of the nation. 
</p><p>
I have mentioned the republican party. This naturally 
grew up out of the old Jacobin sect ; for when the chiefs, finding that all was nearly ruined by the want of authority, had 
set themselves seriously at work to correct their own errors, 
many of their disciples, who believed what their apostles had 
preached, and many who saw in the establishment of order the 
loss of their consequence, determined to throw off all submission to crowned heads, as being unworthy of a free people. 
Add to this the number of { moody beggars starving for a 
time of pell-mell havock and confusion. 
</p><p>
It was this coalition, which prevented the King from accepting the constitution in a manly manner, pointing out its capital 
faults, marking the probable consequences, calling on them to 
reconsider it, and declaring that his submission to their decisions arose from his belief, that it was the only means to avoid 
the horrors of civil war. They saw that this conduct would 
render them responsible, and although it was the most likely 
means of obtaining a good constitution at a future day, and would 
have bound the King down to the principles he should then ad 
vance, yet they opposed, because such good constitution would 
be established, not only without, but even against them, and 
would of course deprive them of those objects which they were 
in pursuit of. The King contended strongly for that kind of 
acceptance, which I have just mentioned, but he was borne 
down, being threatened with popular commotions fatal to him self and his family, and with that civil war which he most wished to avoid, as the necessary result of such fatal commotions. 
</p><p>
Shortly after his acceptance it became necessary to appoint 
another minister of Foreign Affairs, Monsieur de Montmorin 
having insisted so strongly on retiring that the King could not 
longer, with any propriety, ask him to stay. The state of the 
ministry was then as follows. Monsieur Duport, the Keeper of 
the Seals, a creature of and sworn adherent to the Triumvirate ; 
which Triumvirate is another Duport, Barnave, and Alexander 
Lameth, being the chiefs of the old Jacobins. I say the old 
Jacobins, for the present Jacobins are the republican party. 
This Keeper of the Seals constantly communicated every 
thing that passed in council to his coadjutors. The Minister of 
the Interior, Monsieur Delessart, was a wavering creature, one 
of those of whom Shakspeare says that they renege, affirm, and 
turn their halcyon beaks with every gale and vary of their 
masters. He had been one of M. Necker's underlings, was 
brought forward by him, and had connected himself with the 
Triumvirate, M. Necker's enemies, as being the strongest party, 
but still kept up a good understanding with the others. 
</p><p>
Duportail, the Minister at War, of whom I formerly spoke to 
you when he was appointed, and foretold the conduct he would 
pursue towards his creator, <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Monsieur De Lafayette</a>, was also 
completely subservient to the Triumvirate. But at that time he 
was so much embroiled with the Assembly, that his speedy resignation seemed unavoidable. Monsieur Bertrand de Molleville 
had just been appointed to the Marine, an office which Monsieur 
de Bougainville had refused to accept. He was pushed to it by 
the Quatre-vingt-neufs, whom he despised, and told the King 
that he would not be member of a ministry, many of whom he 
knew to be unfaithful to him. Monsieur Bertrand was brought 
forward by the same influence, but he is really attached to the 
crown, wishes ardently to obtain a good constitution for his 
country, is an intelligent, sensible, and laborious man, formerly 
of the robe, and the particular friend of Monsieur de Montmorin. 
</p><p>
I mentioned to you formerly that Monsieur de Choiseul had 
refused the office of Foreign Affairs. While it was in question who should be appointed to succeed Monsieur de Montmorin, 
the King of his own head named the Count de Moustier, and 
wrote him a letter on the subject, which de Moustier has since 
shown to me. He had the prudence to write from Berlin to 
decline accepting, until after he should be in Paris. When he 
arrived in that city the King told him that he could not give 
him the office, because he was considered as an Aristocrat. 
You will observe that the coalition had been at work to get rid 
of him, and here I must make a digression. The plan was 
that as soon as circumstances would permit, a Minister at War 
should be appointed, faithful to the King, and then Bougainville take the Marine, Bertrand be appointed Keeper of the 
Seals, and Delessart either kept in or turned out, as he should 
behave. This plan was not known to the coalition at all, but 
they well knew that if de Moustier got into place, it would be 
a step towards the destruction of their influence and authority. They therefore assured the King, that they could not answer for consequences, threatened him with popular commotions, with opposition in the Assembly, and the like, so that at 
last he gave up his nomination and explained the matter to de Moustier. A long interregnum ensued in that office, and as 
Monsieur de Montmorin absolutely refused to continue any longer, the Portefeuille was given to Monsieur Delessart, and 
after some time the Count de Segur was appointed. 
</p><p>
He accepted in the belief of two things, in both of which he 
was mistaken. One, that he had the confidence of the King 
and Queen ; but he had never taken the right way to obtain 
either their confidence, or that of others. The second article 
of his creed was, that the Triumvirate (his patrons) commanded a majority in the Assembly. He was undeceived as to the 
latter point immediately, and therefore threw up the office and 
went out of town. Under these circumstances Monsieur de 
Narbonne tried hard to obtain that place, and, as I have mentioned his name, and that of Monsieur de Choiseul, I will in 
this place mention that of the Abbe de Perigord, afterwards 
Bishop of Autun. These three are young men of high family, men of wit and men of pleasure ; the two former were 
men of fortune, but had spent it. They were intimates ; all 
three had run the career of ambition together to retrieve 
their affairs. On the score of morals neither of them is 
exemplary. The Bishop is particularly blamed on that head, 
for the variety and publicity of his amours, for gambling, and 
above all for stock-jobbing during the ministry of Monsieur de Calonne, with whom he was on the best terms, and therefore 
had opportunities which his enemies say he made no small use 
of. However I do not believe in this, and I think that except 
his gallantries, and a mode of thinking rather too liberal for a 
churchman, the charges are unduly aggravated. 
</p><p>
It was by the Bishop's intrigues principally, that Monsieur 
de Choiseul was formerly nominated to the office of Foreign 
Affairs, but he preferred staying at Constantinople till he 
could see which way things would settle, and to that effect he 
prevailed on the Vizier, or rather the Rei-s Effendi, to write that 
he thought it much for the interest of France, that he should 
stay for three years longer in that city. In the beginning of 
the revolution, Narbonne, a great Jlnti-neckerist, was not a 
little opposed to it, and there was afterwards some coldness 
between him and the Bishop, partly on political accounts, and 
partly because he (in common with the rest of the world) 
believed the Bishop to be too well with his mistress. This 
coldness was however at length removed by the interference 
of their common friend, and the Bishop labored hard to get 
his friend de Narbonne appointed to the office of Foreign 
Affairs, but the King would not agree to it. M. Delessart 
was therefore appointed, he being very glad to get rid of the 
department of the Interior, where he had everything to apprehend from want of power, want of order, and want of 
bread. The next step was to bring Monsieur de Narbonne 
forward to fill the place of Monsieur Duportail, and to this 
M. Delessart gave his hearty assistance by way of compensating for the disappointment in the other department. Finally the Interior, or Home Department, was filled by a Monsieur 
Cahier de Gerville, of whom I know very little ; nor is it 
necessary that I should. 
This ministry stands then divided as follows. The Keeper 
of Seals and M. Delessart are attached, or supposed to be so, 
to the Lameth faction, Monsieur de Narbonne and Monsieur 
Bertrand are supposed to be attached to the Quatre-vingtneufs, and M. de Gerville rather leaning to the latter. This 
ministry, extremely disjointed in itself, and strongly opposed 
by the Assembly, possesses on the whole but a moderate share 
of talents, for though Count de Narbonne is a man of wit, and a 
very pleasant lively fellow, he is by no means a man of 
business ; and though M. Bertrand has talents, yet according 
to the old proverb, one swallow never makes a summer. 
</p><p>
Such as it is, every one of them is convinced that the constitution is good for nothing ; and unfortunately they are. many 
of them so indiscreet as to disclose that opinion,. when at the 
same time they declare their determination to support and execute it, which is in fact the only rational mode, which now 
remains, of pointing out its defects. It is unnecessary to tell 
you, that some members of the National Assembly are in the 
pay of England, for that you will easily suppose. Brissotde Warville is said to be one of them, and indeed, (whether from 
corrupt or other motives I know not,) his conduct tends to injure his own country, and benefit that of their ancient foes in a 
very eminent degree. 
</p><p>
The situation of their finances is such, that every considerate 
person sees the impossibility of going on in the present way ; 
and as a change of system, after so many pompous declamations, is not a little dangerous among a people so wild and ungoverned, it has appeared to them that a war would furnish 
some plausible pretext for measures of a very decisive nature, 
in which state necessity will be urged in the teeth of policy, 
humanity, and justice. Others consider war as the means of 
obtaining for the government the eventual command of disciplined military force, which may be used to restore order, in 
other words to bring back despotism ; and then they expect 
that the King will give the nation a constitution, which they 
have neither the wisdom to form nor the virtue to adopt for 
themselves. Others again suppose that in case of a war there 
will be such a leaning from the King towards his brothers, from 
the Queen towards the Emperor, from the nobility (the very 
few) who remain towards the mass of their brethren, who have 
left the kingdom, that the bad success natural to arise from 
the opposition of undisciplined mobs to regular armies, may be 
easily imputed to treasonable counsels, and the people be prevailed on to banish them altogether, and set up a federal re 
public. Lastly, the Aristocrats burning with the lust of vengeance, most of them poor, and all of them proud, hope that, 
supported by foreign armies, they shall be able to return 
victorious and re-establish that species of despotism most suited 
to their own cupidity.
</p><p>
It happens, therefore, that the whole nation, though with different views, are desirous of war, for it is proper in such general statement to take in the spirit of the country, which has ever 
been warlike. I have told you long ago, that the Emperor is 
by no means an enterprising or warlike prince. I must now, 
in confirmation of that, inform you that in the famous conference at Pilnitz he was taken in by the King of Prussia, for he 
came prepared to higgle about the nature and extent of the 
succor to be given and forces to be employed ; but the King 
cut the matter short by telling him, that the difference in the 
extent of their respective dominions, and a variety of other 
circumstances, would justify him in demanding greater efforts 
on the part of the Emperor, but that he would meet him on 
ground of perfect equality. In consequence of this the Emperor was obliged to accede, but he did so in the view and the 
wish to do nothing. 
</p><p>
When therefore the King accepted the constitution, he chose 
to consider that as a reason why foreign Princes should not 
interfere. The King cf Prussia, however, gave to the King personal assurances of his good will, and brotherly attachment, and 
of this offered substantial proofs. The King's true interest 
(and he thinks so) seems to consist in preserving the peace, 
and leaving the Assembly to act as they may think proper, which will demonstrate the necessity of restoring in a great degree the 
royal authority. The faction opposed to him are very sensible 
of this, which forms an additional reason for driving everything 
to extremity ; and therefore with a view to destroy every root 
and fibre of ancient systems, they have imagined to court the 
alliance of Great Britain and of Prussia. In consequence, the 
Bishop d Autun has been sent to England, and if my information be good, is authorised to propose the cession of the Islands 
of France and Bourbon and the island of Tobago, as the price 
of an alliance against the Emperor. 
</p><p>
This has a direct tendency to break the family compact with 
Spain, which has long been courted by Britain ; for it is evi 
dent, that this country will not embark in a contest which is to 
do France any good, and therefore the game of Mr Pitt is as 
clear as the sun, and suits exactly his temper and disposition. 
He has only to receive the offers made, and send copies to 
Vienna and Madrid, by way of supporting his negotiations, particularly with the latter. He can offer them also the guarantee 
of their dominions and rights against us, and by this means we 
should find ourselves all at once surrounded by hostile nations. 
The minister of the Marine opposed violently in council this 
mission, stated the consequences, and obtained some useful restrictions. M. de Warville proposed in the Diplomatic Commit 
tee the cession of Dunkirk and Calais to England, as pledges 
of the fidelity of France to the engagements she might take. 
You will judge from this specimen of the wisdom and virtue 
of the faction to which he belongs, and I am sure the integrity of your heart will frown with indignant contempt when 
I tell you, that among the chiefs of that faction are men, who 
owe their all to the personal bounty of the King. 
</p><p>
This mission of the Bishop d Autun has produced something 
like a schism in the coalition. The party of Lameth and Barnave are strongly opposed to it. Monsieur Delessart, who 
had adopted the scheme on the representation of the Bishop 
(with whom it originated) and his friends, abandoned it on the 
representation of the others, and two days before I left Paris 
an express was sent to assure the Emperor, that notwithstanding appearances they meant him no harm. In effect they 
were again going to endeavor at an alliance of the nation with 
him, upon a plan which was set on foot about three months 
ago by those, who afterwards fell into the plan of an alliance 
with Britain. You may judge from hence how much dependence is to be placed on these new fangled statesmen. The 
King and Queen are wounded to the soul by these rash measures. They have, I believe, given all needful assurances to 
the Emperor and King of Spain. A confidential person has 
desired me to assure you on their behalf, that they are very 
far from wishing to change the system of French politics and 
abandon their old allies, and therefore if any advantage is taken of the present advances to Britain, that you will consider 
them as originating merely in the madness of the moment ; and 
not as proceeding from them, or as meeting with their approbation, but the contrary. I shall send this letter in such a way, as 
promises the greatest safety, and I must entreat you, my dear 
Sir, to destroy it for fear of accidents ; you will feel how important it is to them, that this communication be not disclosed. It 
is merely personal from them to you, and expressive of sentiments which can have no action until they have some authority. 
</p><p>
It is time to close this too long letter, whose object is to possess you of that interior machinery by which outward movements are directed. Believe always, I pray, in the sincerity of 
those sentiments with which I am yours,

My Dear Friend, 
</p><p>
This letter will be in reply to what you have been so kind 
as to write respecting my nomination as minister to the court 
of France. I feel as I ought the honor conferred by the 
President in making it, and whatever may be its fate in the 
Senate, I shall always count his suffrage among the most flattering events of my life. I find that no decision was made 
down to the evening of the ninth of January, though the first 
consideration was in the morning of the twenty-third of December, being in the whole eighteen days that it had hung by 
the eyelids. J\ mischievous consequence of the delay is, that 
foreign powers will suppose there is a great division of sentiment, and of course the Minister will have less weight, at 
least for some time, and if a bare majority should eventually 
approve, that circumstance also will operate in the same way. 
To obviate evil, so far as the other gentlemen may be concerned, I have declared here to those who have wondered at 
the delay, that I believe the exceptions, if any, are against 
me. It has been reported, that the exception was to making 
any appointment whatever ; but I have declared my belief 
that this was not the case, for you will observe that such opinion presupposes that the President was precipitate, whereas 
the law passed on the subject is of long standing. On the 
whole, I have thought it best to make myself the scape goat 
of the flock, because if disapproved of, it will then appear all 
natural enough, and if appointed, I must work through the difficulties as well as I can ; they will be less important to my 
country, on the other side of the channel, and my great object is her interest. 
</p><p>
The mission to France must be a stormy one, let it fall on 
whom it may. You will have seen that every character, both 
in and out of that country, is very rudely handled by their 
journalists. These gentlemen stick not to declare that <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Monsieur De Lafayette</a> is a mercenary traitor, sold to the Aristocratic faction. When such things are said, read, and believed by 
the vulgar, you will judge what likelihood there is that reason 
should be heard, or truth prevail. However, as mankind must 
in all countries come to their senses either sooner or later, there 
is no reason to doubt that a proper conduct will at length succeed. 
You will observe, that it was not in the nature of things possible 
to make an appointment from America, which would have been 
unexceptionable, and to have made none would have been offensive, for the conclusion would have been that America looked with contempt at their present situation. 
</p><p>
That kingdom is split up into parties, whose inveteracy of hatred is hardly conceivable, and the Royalists and Aristocrats 
consider America, and the Americans, as having occasioned 
their misfortunes. The former charge it upon us as ingratitude, 
seeing that it was the King who stepped forward to our relief. 
Should this party get the better in the struggle, there are very 
few Americans who would, for the present, be well received. 
On the other hand, the republicans consider everything short 
of downright democracy, as an abandonment of political principle, in an American. I could dwell minutely on both sides 
of this question ; but a word to the wise is sufficient. To 
stand well with all parties is impossible, but it is possible, and 
merely so, to stand well with the best people in all parties, 
without greatly offending the others ; and in order to do this, 
a man must make up his mind to hear the virtuous traduced by 
the wicked, and to listen unruffled to calumny, folly, and even 
to insanity. I am in hopes, however, that things will ere long 
come to some more steady bearing, though the present prospect is by no means flattering or fair. The Bishop d Autun 
tells me that the ministry are all disjointed, each undermining 
the other, and the Assembly at war with them all. I am, &c.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
1 had the honor to write to you on the fourth of last month. 
Two days after, I was informed that you had nominated me as 
minister to the court of France, but the latest advices from 
America, which come down to the tenth of January, show that 
the Senate had not then made their decision. Be that decision what it may, I shall ever gratefully esteem and acknowledge 
this mark of confidence from the person in the world, whose 
good opinion I consider most estimable. 
</p><p>
In my letter of the fourth, I gave you a picture of the French 
ministry, and a view of the measures pursued by different par 
ties, including the mission of the Bishop d Autun. As he has 
now got back to Paris, it may be well to communicate the result. His reception was bad, for three reasons. First, that 
the court looks with horror and apprehension at the scenes acting in France, of which they consider him as a prime mover. 
Secondly, that his reputation is offensive to persons, who pique 
themselves on decency of manners and deportment. And lastly, because he was so imprudent, when he first arrived, as to 
propagate the idea that he should corrupt the members of ad 
ministration, and afterwards by keeping company with leading 
characters among the dissenters, and other similar circumstances, he renewed the impression made before his departure 
from Paris, that he meant to intrigue with the discontented. 
His public reception, however, furnishes no clue to decide on 
the success of his mission; because the former might have been 
very bad, and the latter very good. 
</p><p>
The fact however is, that he could offer nothing worthy of 
their acceptance, and that what he asked was of a nature not 
to be granted. His offer was confined to the cession of Tobago, a demolition of the works of Cherburg, and an extension of 
the commercial treaty. He asked a strict neutrality in case of 
war with the Emperor. Now you will observe, that no court 
could prudently treat with France in her present situation, seeing that nobody can promise in her name otherwise than as god 
fathers and godmothers do at a christening ; and how such 
promises are kept everybody knows. Convinced of this, the 
Bishop never told his errand to Lord Gower, the British Ambassador at Paris, who mentioned that circumstance to me as 
extraordinary, but yet so far agreeable, as that he was glad 
not to have been called on for letters of introduction. 
</p><p>
Respecting Tobago I must make a digression. It is now a 
long time since it was mentioned to me in Paris, that some of 
the colonists of St Domingo had come hither to make overtures 
to Mr Pitt. Since that period, I learnt that the French minis 
try were in possession of documents to prove, not only that he 
fomented the disturbances in France, but that he was in deep 
intrigues with regard to that colony. The particular proofs 
were not shown to me, so that I cannot speak positively. 
Neither can I vouch for what T have learnt further on that subject within this month ; but I am assured, that it is Mr Pitt's 
intention to bring about, if he can, the independence of St Domingo. Mr Clarkson, the great negro advocate, is mentioned 
to me as his agent for this business at Paris, and the conduct 
of a part of the Assembly, in opposing succor to that island, 
seems corroborative of such an idea. This then being the case, 
or supposing it to be so, the offer of Tobago was too trifling to 
attract Mr Pitt's notice, even if unconnected with other circumstances. By the bye, my informant tells me also, that Mr Pitt 
means to coax us into the adoption of his plan respecting St 
Domingo. And I learn from another quarter, that he means 
to offer us his mediation for a peace with the Indians. If all 
this be true, his game is evident. The mediation is to be with iis a price for adopting his plans, and with the Indian tribes a 
means of constituting himself their patron and protector. It 
may be proper to combine all this with the late division of Can 
ada, and the present measures for military colonization of the 
upper country, and above all with what may come from Mr Hammond. 
</p><p>
I return to St Domingo. If such be Mr Pitt's scheme, 
although we shall not, I presume, engage in, or countenance 
it, yet the success will be entirely for our advantage, and a 
mere preliminary to something of the same sort, which must 
happen to Jamaica on the first change of wind in the political 
world. The destruction of the port of Cherburg is no present object with the British ministry, because they suppose it 
will be ruined by the elements before it can be completed ; 
and because the French Marine is, from the want of discipline, 
an object more of contempt than apprehension. The proffered extension of the commercial treaty amounts to nothing, be 
cause at present every part of France is open to contraband 
commerce, and because there is little reason to believe, that 
the stipulations in a treaty now made would be of any long 
duration. 
</p><p>
Thus it happens that neither of the objects offered were 
worthy of notice. But the neutrality required was of a most 
important nature. By leaving the Austrian Low Countries 
exposed to French invasion, it would have been a violation 
both of ancient and of recent treaties. Nor is this all, for (as 
I have already had occasion to remark) the annexation of those 
provinces to the French monarchy would prove almost, if not 
altogether, fatal to Great Britain. And when we consider 
that they are almost in revolt already, and that it is in fact their 
interest to become one with France, there is reason to 
suppose that a union might have been effected, in case of a 
war with the Emperor. 
</p><p>
So much then on the ground of good faith, and good policy. 
But there is still a farther cause, which, as the world goes, 
may be equal in its operation to all others. It seems to be a 
moot point whether it is the British or the Prussian cabinet 
which directs the other. Perhaps there may be a little of 
both ; but be all that as it may, it is certain that neither feels 
disposed to counteract the views of its ally, in any open 
manner. Now putting aside the personal feelings, which naturally agitate the sovereign of this, as well as of other kingdoms, in 
regard to the French revolution ; it is notorious that from the 
very dawn of it, agents were employed to foment a spirit of re 
volt in other States, particularly in Prussia. The king of Prussia therefore feels for the French revolutionists all the enmity 
of a proud, passionate, and offended German Prince. Add to 
this, that the Elector of Hanover, as such, cannot wish for a 
change in the government of Germany. If therefore it had 
been the interest of Great Britain to establish a free constitutlon in France, (which it certainly is not,) I am perfectly convinced that this court would never have made a single effort 
for the purpose. 
</p><p>
I stated to you, in my last, that the French ministry are 
extremely disjointed. It was too much so for any durable 
existence, besides which, the members took effectual means 
to precipitate each other's ruin. M. de Narbonne wished to 
get into the office of Foreign Affairs. This was desirable to 
him, it is said, on many accounts, but particularly so because 
it gives the command of large sums without account. What 
ever may have been his motives, the following seems to have 
been his conduct. He stood forth the advocate of all violent 
measures. This would naturally have excited suspicions with 
thinking men, but not so with the Assembly. He associated 
himself to the partizans of democracy, and while by these means 
he secured himself against their clamors, he took great care 
of his pecuniary affairs. This at least is affirmed to me, and 
with the addition that he had the imprudence to pay off his 
debts, although it is notorious that his estate, (which is in St 
Domingo,) is among those which are laid waste. It is further 
asserted, that in order to quiet the clamors of contractors who 
had given him money, and found themselves in the road to 
ruin, he agreed to compensate the depreciation of the Assignats. In order to remove a great obstacle to his proceedings, 
he joined in the intrigues against M. Bertrand, and at the 
same time fostered other intrigues against M. Delessart, with 
a view of getting his place. The proofs of all these things 
are said to be in the King's hands. 
</p><p>
M. Delessart's conduct I have already in part communicated. I must add that, afterwards, imagining that Brissot de Warville and Condorcet were omnipotent in the Assembly, he 
violated his engagements made with the Triumvirate, and wrote some despatches conformably to the views of those two gentle 
men. In consequence of this, it was resolved to displace him, and they were looking out for a successor. The person 
applied to was actually deliberating whether he should or should not accept, at the moment when Brissot brought about his impeachment and arrest. Tn this same moment M. de Narbonne 
was dismissed, and with him was to go M. de Gerville. The 
Chevalier de Graave succeeds M. de Narbonne. When I 
left Paris he was attached to the Triumvirate. He does not 
want understanding, but I think it almost impossible that he 
should succeed. Monsieur Bertrand, against whom an address 
from the Assembly was at length carried, has, I find, resigned. 
There is something at the bottom, which I cannot discover, 
without being on the spot, but you may rely on it he goes out 
with the full confidence of the King and Queen. 
</p><p>
My informations from Paris are previous to the news of the 
Emperor's death, which has probably occasioned the violent 
proceedings against poor DelesSart, by removing the fears of 
those who, in the midst of all their big words, were confoundedly frightened. What may be the consequences of this event 
it is impossible to determine, or even to conjecture. Much, 
very much, depends on the personal character of his successor, 
which I am not yet acquainted with. 
</p><p>
It is supposed by some here, that Mr Pitt is not strong in 
the cabinet at present, although the majority in Parliament was 
never more decisive, and this is said to arise from his refusing 
to ask money for the payment of the Prince of Wales's debts, 
which the King, it is said, was desirous of, and which his minister declined, with some offensive expressions. Mr Pitt's 
friends insist, on the other hand, that the whole story is false, 
from beginning to end. For my own part, I do not think he 
will be turned out, because I believe him to be very cunning, 
and although he has conducted Foreign Affairs but poorly, he 
manages all the little court and parliamentary intrigues with 
consummate address.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Yesterday I was informed that the Senate had agreed to your 
nomination of diplomatic servants. If I know my own heart, 
this intelligence is far less agreeable to me on my own account 
than on that of the public. I am sure that a rejection, from 
whatever cause it may have arisen, would have been attributed 
to disunion in our counsels. 
</p><p>
I find that the King of France has appointed to the office 
of Foreign Affairs a Monsieur Dumouriez, and that it is considered as a sacrifice to the Jacobins. He is a bold, determined 
man. I am not acquainted with him personally, but I know 
that he has long been seeking a place in the administration, 
and was, about six months ago, determined, if appointed one 
of the ministers, to destroy at the peril of his life the Jacobin 
and all other clubs, and to effect a change in the government. 
How far he may have changed his opinions since I really can 
not tell, but I mention this to you now, because when I know 
more I can refer to this letter and say, that by coming into office he has not changed his sentiments, if he persists in those 
his ancient determinations. If not, I will tell you, that he is 
more prudent than was supposed. And these words will in 
either case mean nothing more than is here set down for them. 
The King consulted him (as I was told by his confidential friend 
in the middle of last October) on the state of affairs, when 
M. de Montmorin when out ; but the high toned measures he 
proposed were not adopted.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor to receive this morning your favor of the 
twenty-third of January,  with its enclosures, excepting the 
cypher which seems accidentally to have been omitted in making up your despatches, or perhaps it has been put by mistake 
in the letters directed to Mr Short, which at Mr Johnson's re 
quest I have taken charge of. I shall deliver it as speedily as 
may be, intending to make my arrangements for leaving this 
city as soon as the present holidays -are over. 
</p><p>
Nothing can be more just, than your observations respecting 
the propriety of preserving silence as to the government of 
France ; and they are peculiarly applicable to the present state 
of things in that country. Changes are now so frequent, and 
events seem fast ripening to such awful catastrophes, that no 
expressions on the subject, however moderate, would be received with indifference. 
</p><p>
Feeling with you the importance of our commercial connexions, I shall of course lend all my attention to establish and 
extend them. Permit me to entreat, my dear Sir, that you 
will send me all the information, which can be collected on the 
subject. If, at the same time, you could favor me with the particular points which it is desired to carry, I shall feel myself 
more at ease than in a general pursuit, which may perhaps be 
directed to objects less important than I may suppose them. 
</p><p>
I thank you for the accurate statement you have been so 
kind as to make, respecting my salary, &c. and you may rely 
that I shall exactly conform to your wishes on that head. And 
I take this opportunity to say, that you will never receive from me any observations respecting the amount. If it proves in 
sufficient, I will supply the want from my own funds, as far 
as they will permit, and the balance must be made up by retrenchment. 
</p><p>
As you have yourself run through the career, which I am 
now about to commence, you know much better than I do the 
importance of early information, and therefore I feel more 
confidence in acting under you, than I should in any other situation. If you would kindly afford me your good counsel, it 
would confer a great obligation. Pardon me, I pray you, one 
observation. The distance of America is such, that probable 
events are almost of equal importance with those which have 
actually happened, because measures must be squared in some 
degree to the one as much as to the other. You will from 
hence infer my desire to know on some subjects the best opinion which can be formed ; and I am sure I cannot better ad 
dress myself for that purpose than to you. I am, &c.

Dear Carmichael, 
</p><p>
I received your letter of the fifth of April in London, 
but I did not choose to reply from thence, because I did not 
wish my letter to be inspected. It is true that I am appointed 
Minister Plenipotentiary here. I did not and could not announce it, because it was in the Gazettes a long time before it 
was officially known to me, and as our Senate can prevent an 
appointment, I was long in doubt whether this had really taken 
effect. It was unexpected, and must for some time to come be 
unpleasant. 
</p><p>
You know that I do, from the bottom of my heart, wish well 
to this country, and will therefore easily judge what I have felt 
in seeing them long since in the high road to despotism. They 
have made the common mistake, that, to enjoy liberty, it is necessary only to demolish authority, and the common consequence 
results, viz. that the most ardent advocates for the revolution 
begin now to wish and pray, and even cry out for the establishment of despotic power, as the only means of securing the lives 
and properties of the people. This is terrible. The war in 
which they are engaged furnishes a dreary prospect ; there 
seems to be but one ground to hope for success, which is, that 
improbable things are those which usually happen. I will not 
dwell on these topics. 
</p><p>
From what you tell me I have concluded, that the British 
ministry sent forward to Madrid my communications, to defeat 
your views. This procedure was adroit enough, but what will 
you think of the measure, when I tell you that they assigned in 
America as a reason for not treating with me, my attachment to 
France. In effect I would not listen to any overture tending 
to violate our treaties and connexion with the House of Bourbon. If the Spanish Ambassador in London had made true re 
port, my conduct in London would have served, and not injured you. I even went so far as to put my letters to you under 
cover to him ; he knowing my sentiments, first from the French 
Ambassador, and afterwards from me, in a conversation of some 
length ; but I am afraid that he thought of other things besides 
the interest of his sovereign. 
</p><p>
My letters to the British ministry were calculated to draw 
from them a pointed answer, or put them in the wrong if they 
preserved an obstinate silence. I did not believe that we should 
make a treaty with them at that time, but I thought the occasion 
suitable for taking such ground as might be useful to us hereafter. If you can again see my letters, read them, I pray you, in 
that idea, and then you can explain them so as to remove any 
evil impressions. If you have received what I wrote you at the 
same period, expressly to be communicated to the Spanish court, 
you will have seen that this was the true idea. I am, &;c.

My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Although I have been above a month in this city, I have not 
been able until within a day or two to make up my mind, as to 
the sentiments of the person mentioned to you in mine of the 
twenty-first of March, or rather I could not obtain that certainty which was needful, before I could properly mention them 
to you. I can now venture to assure you, that by coming into 
office he has not changed his sentiments. 
</p><p>
My former letters have mentioned to you the indiscipline of 
the French armies, and the public prints will give you such 
facts on that head, as may tend to making up in your mind 
a solid judgment as to future events. The first step towards 
bankruptcy has already been made, by extending to seventeen 
hundred millions the sum of Assignats, which may be in circulation. A further extension must take place in a few days. 
The powers combined against France have it therefore in their 
choice, to wear her out by a war of resources, or dash into the 
heart of the country. This last will best suit with their own 
situation, but I do not think they will advance before the be 
ginning of August. 
</p><p>
Your letter to the King has produced a very good effect. 
It is not relished by the Democrats, who particularly dislike 
the term your people, but it suits well the prevailing temper, 
which is monarchical. The Jacobin faction approaches to its 
dissolution, as you may perceive by its agonies. In fact, the 
deliberations are so absurd and so extravagantly wild, that they 
daily furnish new arms to their enemies. You will perceive at 
a glance, that this is not a moment for making commercial treaties. I shall however do all that I can, without seriously com 
promising our future interests. I am, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to acknowledge your favors of the tenth 
of March, and twenty-eighth of April. My last was of the 
twenty-fifth of April. As Mr Short remained here until the 
second instant, and was better acquainted with the current 
transactions, I relied on him for the communication of them. 
He informed you, that we obtained an interview with M. Dumouriez on the fifteenth of May. In this interview he told 
me, that he thought it was best I should be presented to 
the King immediately, but yet my first audience did not take 
place until the third of this month. He apologised for this de 
lay, as proceeding from the state of public affairs, which kept 
him continually occupied and agitated. I shall have occasion 
presently to say something about them. 
</p><p>
In our first conversation, as a fair, opportunity presented it 
self, I made use of it to tell him that, during my residence here 
in a private character, I had, as well from my attachment to 
the cause of liberty in general, as to the interests of France in 
particular, endeavored to effectuate some changes in the Constitution, which appeared to me essential to its existence. 
That, being now in a public character, I thought it my duty to 
avoid all interference in their affairs, of which, from henceforth, 
I should be a mere spectator. I will not trouble you with repeating what passed at my reception by the King and Queen. 
</p><p>
On the next day I dined with M. Dumouriez, and delivered 
the letter from the President to the King, on his acceptance of 
the constitution, of which letter I had previously made a translation, to avoid mistakes of their agents, which are not uncommon. Several members of the Corps Diplomatique have spoken to me on the subject of this letter, which has given them a high idea of the President's wisdom. I took occasion, according to your instructions, to mention the obnoxious acts of the late 
Assembly, both to M. Dumouriez, and to M. Bonne-Carrere, 
his confidential secretary. The latter told me that he coincided witk me in opinion fully on that subject, but that nothing 
could be done till they brought the Assembly into more consistency. That they could indeed command a majority, but that 
they could not bring that majority into a support of other measures than those of the moment. That, however, we might digest the business, and put it in train. M. Dumouriez told me 
that his system of politics was extremely simple. That a power so great as France stood in no need of alliances, and there 
fore he- was against all treaties other than those of commerce. 
That he would very readily enter with me into a consideration 
of a treaty of commerce, but wished me to defer it until he 
should return from the frontiers. 
</p><p>
In order that you may fully understand the facts, which I shall 
have occasion to communicate, I think it most advisable to 
mention the state of affairs in this country, such as it appears 
to me. I shall avoid speaking of characters, for evident reasons. You are already informed, I suppose, of the reasons 
which led to a declaration of war against the King of Hungary, 
and you know that the hope of an insurrection in the Austrian 
Flanders was among the reasons. Indeed, the intention to 
excite it, and the efforts made to that effect, have, (for the first 
time. I believe, in modern days) been publicly avowed. This 
hope has hitherto proved fallacious, and indeed as far as can 
be judged from the temper and character of the Flemish people, and from the information I have been able to collect, it 
seems to be the better opinion, that however they may feel an 
aversion to the Austrian government, they are still less disposed 
to that of France. There is, therefore, no probability of any 
capital diversion in that quarter, and the chance of it is daily 
decreasing, from two natural causes. First, the French troops 
are extremely undisciplined ; and secondly, the force of their 
enemies will soon receive very considerable additions. 
On the first of these heads I need say nothing, since you will 
receive from various quarters the sufficient evidences. In respect to the latter, having combined all the intelligence which 
can be relied on, it results that about the middle of next month 
the allied armies will be one hundred and eighty thousand 
strong, exclusive of the French emigrants. 
</p><p>
It is doubtful whether these last will be permitted to act, 
and for the following reasons. First, it is not to be supposed 
that twenty thousand gentlemen volunteers serving at their own 
expense can be well disciplined ; consequently it is to be apprehended that they will be more injurious to their friends than to 
their enemies. Secondly, it is next to impossible that in such 
a number, all irritated by injuries either real or supposed, there 
should not be some who will act more from motives of private 
vengeance, than regard to public good, and it is certain that 
acts of cruelty and injustice will rather tend to prolong than 
terminate the contest, at least to give it that termination which 
they wish for. Thirdly, it is notorious that the great mass of 
the French nation is less solicitous to preserve the present order of things, than to prevent the return of the ancient oppres 
sions, and of course would more readily submit to a pure despotism, than to that kind of monarchy whose only limits were 
found in those noble, legal, and clerical corps, by which the 
people were alternately oppressed and insulted. 
</p><p>
And this observation leads naturally to the object of the 
combined powers, which I conceive to be the establishment of 
a military government on the ruins of that anarchic system 
which now prevails, and in the continuance of which no power 
but England has any interest. The others, seeing that without 
a counterpoise in the marine scale, Britain must possess the 
Empire of the Ocean, (which in the present commercial state 
of the world is a kind of universal empire,) cannot but wish to 
reestablish this kingdom. 
</p><p>
But a great question occurs. What kind of government 
shall be established ? The emigrants hope for their darling 
aristocracy; but it can hardly be supposed, that Kings will 
exert themselves to raise abroad what they labor incessantly to 
destroy at home, and more especially as the French revolution having been begun by the nobles, the example will be so 
much the more striking, if they become the victims of it. But 
if the allied monarchs have an interest in destroying the Aristocracy, they have a much stronger and a more evident interest in preventing a free and well poised system from being 
adopted. Such system must inevitably extend itself, and/or 
the neighboring powers to relax from their tyranny. If the 
court of Berlin could have been insensible to this truth, in 
which it is so deeply interested, the zealous reformers here 
would have not permitted the Prussian ministers to slumber 
over their danger. The desire to propagate and make converts to their opinions has led them so far, that the quarrel 
which might have been only political has become personal, and 
I have good reason to believe, notwithstanding the profound 
secrecy which is preserved respecting the designs of the grand 
alliance, that it is in contemplation to put all power into the 
hands of the King. 
</p><p>
Things have been prepared for that event by the inconsiderable partizans of liberty. In their eagerness to abolish ancient 
institutions they forgot that a monarchy without intermediate 
ranks is but another name for anarchy or despotism. The first, 
unhappily, exists to a degree scarcely to be paralleled, and 
such is the horror and apprehension, which licentious societies 
have universally inspired, that there is some reason to believe 
the great mass of French population would consider even despotism as a blessing, if accompanied with security to person 
and property, such as is experienced under the worst governments in Europe. 
</p><p>
Another great means of establishing despotism here, is to 
be found in that national bankruptcy which seems to be inevitable. The expense of the last month exceeded the income 
by about ten millions of dollars. This expense continues to 
increase, and the revenue to diminish. The estate of the 
clergy is consumed, and the debt is as great as at the opening 
of the States-General. The current expense has, by taking 
away the property of the church, been increased about a sixth. 
The dilapidation in every department is unexampled, and they 
have, to crown all, an increasing paper money, which already 
amounts to above three hundred millions of dollars. 
</p><p>
From such facts it is impossible not to draw the most sinister presages. The country people have hitherto been actuated 
in a great measure by the hope of gain. The abolition of 
tithes, of feudal rights, and burthensome taxes, was so pleasant that a cold examinatibn of consequences could not be admitted ; still less an inquiry into the strict measure of justice. 
</p><p>
Next to the abolition came on those philosophical and math ematical arrangements of the Fisc, which are very beautiful and 
satisfactory, and to which there lies but one objection of any 
consequence, which is, that they are inexecutable. Now I 
have frequently observed, that when men are brought to abandon the paths of justice, it is not easy to arrest their progress 
at any particular point, and therefore, as the whole kingdom 
(Paris excepted) is interested in the non-payment of taxes, 
the question will be decided without much difficulty, if once 
the legislature get out of this city. 
</p><p>
They are already preparing for a march, and it is intended 
to take the King with them, to which effect a decree has al 
ready passed to disband his life guard, and another to collect 
20,000 men to the northward of this city. An opposition will be made by the Parisian militia to the latter decree, 
because they begin to perceive the object ; and as it seems to 
be a pretty general opinion among them, that no capital opposition will be made to the Austrian and Prussian troops, they 
consider the person of Louis the Sixteenth as forming the 
most solid reliance they have to protect them from plunder and 
outrage. This decree may therefore occasion either a schism 
between the militia and the Assembly, or among the inhabitants 
of Paris, or both. 
</p><p>
Already there exists a serious breach between the members 
of the present administration, and a part of them must go out. 
I have the best reason to believe, that the whole will be changed 
before many weeks, and some of them within a few days. 
There exists also a mortal enmity between different parties in 
the Assembly. At the head of the Jacobin faction is the 
Deputation of Bourdeaux, and that city is, as you know, particularly indisposed to our commercial interests. It is this 
state of universal hostility, or rather confusion, to which Dumouriez alluded when he apologised for delaying my audience. And it was this also that his confidant had in view, when 
he mentioned the necessity of waiting for a greater consistency 
in the legislature, before anything could be done. 
</p><p>
I mentioned to you above, that M. Dumouriez had it in contemplation to visit the frontiers. This was in his quality of principal minister, and certainly not as minister of Foreign Affairs. 
One of his principal advisers tells me that he has dissuaded him 
from taking that step. The object was to bring the army to action ; for having brought on a state of hostility, of which personally he is deeply concerned in the success, he has little 
hope unless from a coup de main, before the armies of the ene 
my are collected. In consequence, he has given repeated orders to fight, both to Monsieur Luckner and Monsieur La fayette. The former has declined, and the latter peremptorily 
refused ; the situation of their respective armies not permitting 
any well grounded expectations. At present the two armies 
are in march to form a junction, when the whole will be commanded by Monsieur Luckner. It is expected that he will be 
at the head of sixty thousand picked troops, and the Austrians 
cannot well oppose above thirty-five thousand. It is said that 
they are to act immediately, but I have pretty good reason to 
believe that the stroke will be about the twentieth to the twenty-fifth. 
</p><p>
M. Dumouriez told me that he was perfectly easy in respect to Prussia, whose only object was to get the House of 
Austria fairly engaged, and then to take advantage of its embarrassments. I told him that he must of course be well informed 
on that subject, but that since the departure of the Prussian minister, without taking leave, I could not but suppose the intentions of that court were more serious than he imagined. He 
gave me many reasons for his opinion, which I should have 
supposed to be only an ostensible one, if his intimates had not 
on another occasion quoted it to me, and if I did not know the 
principal channel through which he derives his intelligence. A 
late circumstance will tend rather to establish than remove this 
opinion ; I mean the attack of Poland by the Empress of Russia to overturn the new constitution, Whether this movement 
be in concert with the Austrian and Prussian cabinets or not, is 
doubtful. I cannot as yet make up any tolerable judgment on 
the subject, but I believe that in either case those cabinets will 
pursue their objects in regard to this country. 
</p><p>
The details I have entered into, and the informations which 
you will collect from the public prints, will show that in the 
present moment it will be very difficult to excite attention to 
other objects, than those by which they are so strongly agitated. 
The best picture I can give of the French nation is, that of 
cattle before a thunder storm. And as to the government, every member of it is engaged in the defence of himself, or the 
attack of his neighbor. I shall, notwithstanding, pursue the 
objects which you recommend. The obstacles to success form 
but incitements to the attempt. It must however be made 
with caution, because any sudden change of affairs may bring 
forward persons, who would oppose a measure merely because 
their predecessors had approved of it. 
</p><p>
You desired me among other things to send you the Moniteur, 
but the editor of that paper does not give so faithful a report of 
what passes in the Assembly, as you will find in the Logographe. 
If there be any one of the Gazetteers who is impartial, it 
is the author, or rather transcriber, of this. I send you of course 
the Gazette of France, which says, you know, whatever the ministry orders it to say. The Patriots Frangais, written by M. Brissot, will give you the republican side of the question, as the 
Gazette Universette does that of the kind of monarchy proposed by the constitution. The paper called the Indicateuris written by a party, who wish a more vigorous executive, although 
(strange to tell) this party consists of the persons, who in the 
beginning of the late Assembly did everything to bring the kingdom into the situation now experienced. The journal of the 
Jacobins will give you what passes in that society. The Gazette of Ley den, which I transmit according to your request, 
will convey a kind of digest of all these different sentiments 
and opinions. Thus, Sir, if you have the patience to look over 
these several papers, you will have a clear view not only of 
what is done, but of what is intended. 
</p><p>
For the present I take my leave, with the assurances of that 
sincere respect and esteem, with which I am yours,

</p><p>
My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor to write to you on the tenth instant. The 
ministry is changed rather sooner than I expected, that is to 
say, as to the totality. Messieurs Servan, Roland, and Claviere were dismissed by M. Dumouriez. He filled the 
places of the two former with his particular friends, and as this 
step was decisive and would certainly bring on very serious 
quarrels, it was supposed that he had prepared himself before 
hand for all consequences. 
</p><p>
It would seem, however, that he was less firmly fixed than 
he had imagined, for as the reason for sending away the other 
ministers was, that they insisted on the royal sanction to the 
two obnoxious and unconstitutional decrees, it was in the 
natural order of things, that they should be immediately sent 
back to the Assembly. Instead of that it is said, that Monsieur Dumouriez insisted on passing both, and in case of refusal 
threatened resignation. To his surprise the King accepted 
the resignation, and in consequence, his friends newly appointed go out with him. As the present set have not all taken 
the oaths, I will defer giving you the list for the present, but 
put at the foot of my letter the names and places of such as 
may finally be fixed on. 
</p><p>
The Jacobins were busy all last night to excite a tumult in 
the city, but the precautions taken to prevent it have as yet 
proved successful. I am told that M. Lucloier and M. de 
Lafayette still persist in their determination not to risk an 
action. If so, the present state of uncertainty may continue 
some time. If they fight and gain a victory, it is not improbable that we may witness some outrages of the most flagitious 
kind. If on the contrary there is any capital defeat, the Jacobin faction will be a little moderated. On the whole, Sir, we 
stand on a vast volcano, we feel it tremble and we hear it 
roar, but how, and when, and where it will burst, and who may 
be destroyed by its eruption, are beyond the ken of mortal 
foresight to discover. 
</p><p>
While I am writing I learn the following to be the arrangement for the new ministry. Of the old set, two remain, M. 
Duranthon and M. Lacoste. The former is said to be a 
pretty honest man, but rather too much attached to the Faction Bordeloise. The latter is considered as an honest man, 
well acquainted with the business of his department, the 
Marine. M. Lajarre is appointed to the department of War. 
He is a creature of M. de Lafayette. His ability doubtful, 
but his principles sound. M. Chambonas is appointed to the 
office of Foreign Affairs. He is un homme tf esprit, but une mauvaise tete, un mauvais sujet, and ignorant of the business, 
at least so says my informant, and he is well informed. M. 
Mouciel, a very worthy man, is named to the department of 
the Interior, but his acceptance is very doubtful. The 
minister of Impositions is not yet fixed on. He will I believe 
be a cypher, for two or three such have been applied to. 
</p><p>
This new ministry will be purged, at any rate, of some of 
its members, but one great doubt exists whether it will not be 
driven off by the Jacobin faction. It is in contemplation to 
make a serious effort against that faction in favor of the constitution, and M. de Lafayette will begin the attack. I own 
to you that I am not sanguine as to the success. Very much 
is to be done, and there is very little time to do it in, for the 
foreign enemy will soon be greatly superior in number, and it 
seems now to be ascertained, that Alsace and Lorraine are 
disposed to- join the invaders. Thus, while a great part of 
the nation is desirous of overturning the present government, 
in order to restore the ancient form, and while another part, 
still more dangerous from position and numbers, are desirous 
of introducing the form of a federal republic, the moderate 
men, attacked on all sides, have to contend alone against an 
immense force. 
</p><p>
I cannot go on with the picture, for my heart bleeds when I 
reflect that the first opportunity, which ever presented itself for 
establishing the rights of mankind throughout the civilized 
world, is perhaps lost, and forever. I write on as events arise, 
and shall continue to do so until an opportunity to send my 
letters shall present itself. I am, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
According to your orders I sit down to render this day a 
state of my account, which will be but short, because I shall 
charge at present no contingencies. There are some such 
which will come in my next account, and which would be stated this day, but as I have not yet got into the house which I 
hired immediately after my arrival, and which I have daily been 
in the hope of entering, my papers and books remain in the 
state in which they were. Add to this, that the amount is not 
great, and that I am very much occupied and very frequently 
interrupted. 
</p><p>
I left London on the last day of April; wherefore my salary to the last day of June being for two months was fifteen 
hundred dollars. My outfit is nine thousand, making, together, ten thousand five hundred dollars, for which I have drawn 
on the bankers of the United States at Amsterdam. 
</p><p>
I have boxed up the several newspapers to this day, and 
shall send them to Havre. My secretary's salary will now 
commence. I am, &ic.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have already had the honor of informing you of the good 
dispositions of the United States toward France, of which they 
are sincerely desirous of giving multiplied proofs. I have had 
the honor also of informing you, that during the last session of 
Congress, although heavy duties were laid upon wines imported from other countries, no addition has been made to the du 
ties paid by those of your country ; which amounts, in fact, to 
allowing them a premium from which they must derive a considerable sale. It is thus, Sir, that the American government, 
while employed in paying its pecuniary debt, endeavors at the 
same time to discharge that of gratitude. You may rely on 
its faithful exactness, and give the King this assurance. 
</p><p>
I should, however, but ill fulfil my duty to my country, and 
should give but a weak expression of the attachment, which I 
have so long entertained for your own, if I should attempt to 
conceal the discontent that has been excited in America by 
the decrees of the Constituent Assembly, which are inflicting 
a blow upon the system of commerce established between 
France and the United States before the year <a href='/results.php?year=1789'>1789</a>. I refrain from all observations on this subject, because I refer the 
whole matter to your wisdom, and to the sentiments of your 
nation, and I venture to believe, that even if their own interests alone were concerned, the National Assembly would not 
allow regulations to continue in force, which are still more oppressive to the French consumers, than they are injurious to the 
American ship-owners. 
</p><p>
There is another subject, Sir, to which you will certainly 
lend all the attention that its importance deserves. The Constituent Assembly expressed a wish, that the King should 
cause a new treaty of commerce to be negotiated with America. This was communicated to the President of the United 
States by the Minister Plenipotentiary of his Majesty, but, hitherto, nothing has been the result of this project. lam instructed to assure you, that the United States will very cordially receive any overtures, that shall be made to them on this subject, 
and that they are desirous to establish this treaty on foundations that shall be just, firm, and reciprocally beneficial to the 
two nations. The Minister Plenipotentiary of France at Philadelphia is in a better condition, than any one else, to appreciate the advantages of such a treaty, and I venture to assure 
you now, that if he is intrusted by the King with this negotiation, he will experience on our part the most open and amicable dispositions. You will do me a great pleasure, Sir, when 
you shall be pleased to authorise me to write, that such a com mission has been given him. I have the honor to be, &c.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor to write to you on the first instant. On the 
seventeenth of the last month I mentioned the plans then in 
contemplation, and gave a short view of the existent state of 
things. I did not communicate those events, which have since 
taken place, because you will find the most ample details in 
the several Gazettes. 
</p><p>
On Saturday, the seventh, a farce was acted in the Assembly, in which the principal performers played well their parts, 
and the King was duped according to custom. Things are 
now verging fast to the catastrophe of the play. For some 
weeks, the adverse parties, I mean the court and Jacobins, 
have been laboring, each to cast on the other the odium of violating entirely the constitution, and commencing the civil war. 
The party which calls itself independent, and which in fact is 
the fearful party, begs hard for peace, and seizes eagerly what 
ever bears the appearance or the name. It was to catch these 
gudgeons that the scene of Saturday was exhibited. 
</p><p>
The King and Queen, believing that the actors were in ear 
nest, and knowing that their lives had been at stake, were over 
joyed ; and their timid counsellors, trembling under the tyrannous powers of the Assembly, seized with eagerness the bait of 
reconciliation, which had been thrown out without any hope 
that they would swallow it. One of them, whom I have already mentioned to you as a very worthy man, saw through the 
thin veil of deception, and opposed the opinion of the others, 
but in vain. Events in justifying him have fixed his predominance. This day the King will commence a new career, and 
if he goes through, I think he will succeed. I have every reason to believe that this letter will go safely, but yet I cannot 
justify saying more on the subject, because otherwise the confidence reposed in me might in the course of events prove fatal to my informant. 
</p><p>
The present intention of the King is to secure the liberty of 
France ; but whether he will preserve the steady purpose 
through those varying events, which must soon take place, to 
me appears uncertain. Indeed, I doubt whether he will be 
sufficiently master of his own party to execute such purpose, 
even if it be not changed. Whether he will live through the 
storm is also uncertain. It will blow hard. 
</p><p>
The exterior enemy hovers over his prey, and only seems 
to wait the moment which he has fixed to himself for his own 
stroke. New parties to the grand alliance daily show them 
selves. The Palatinate has declared ; Holland seems on the 
point of adhering ; and doubts in regard to England begin to 
appear. The force, which France can oppose to her numerous assailants, does not exceed one hundred and eighty thou 
sand undisciplined men ; some of whom wait but the opportunity to desert. Against her, are collected two hundred and 
fifty thousand of the best troops in Europe, under the command of the ablest General in this hemisphere. The intention 
was not to enter before the harvest, in order that subsistence 
might be easily procured. Whether this plan will be changed 
in consequence of what is like to happen here, I cannot say. 
I rather think it will. I understand that the manifesto, which 
precedes attack, will disavow the constitution, and claim for 
the King (what it calls) his rights; for the clergy, their posses 
sions. That this city will be rendered responsible for the royal 
family. That the Gardes Rationales will be considered as armed peasants, meddling with business not their own, and there 
fore not under the protection of the laws of war. The allied 
monarchs are to declare themselves in arms, not against France, 
but against the revoltes. You will easily see that these broad 
terms will mean whatever power may choose to explain them 
to mean. 
</p><p>
I have repeatedly pressed the minister of Foreign Affairs 
to come to a settlement of accounts, which he has promised 
to do, and I think I shall accomplish my purpose, because 
the Marine department is to treat with me for supplies to St 
Domingo. I mean to be generous in the terms of exchange 
for this supply, obtaining at the same time a beneficial liquidation of past payments ; for you will observe, Sir, that the 
whole account is open. Two reasons operate with me on 
this occasion. First, I think that we ought to encourage our 
own argriculture and arts ; and secondly, I think what is paid 
here goes into a gulph of unbottomed profusion, and can but 
little advance the real interests of the nation. 
I have also repeatedly called the minister's attention to the 
obnoxious acts of the late Assembly, and to their proposition 
of a new commercial treaty. He has replied very candidly, that 
for himself he should be glad to settle everything to my satis 
faction, but that his ministerial existence is too precarious to 
undertake any extensive plan ; that the attention of government is turned too strongly towards itself, in the present moment, to think of its exterior interests ; and that the Assembly, 
at open war with the executive, would certainly reject whatever should now be presented to them. These are truths which 
I knew before, and therefore I thought it best not to urge too 
strongly for a decision, in the unpropitious moment. The ap 
parent reconciliation of Saturday seemed to give a better prospect. The court on Sunday had an air less embarrassed, and 
therefore, although the dictate of my judgment was different 
from that of others, I thought it my duty to make a formal ap 
plication, which I did yesterday in a letter, a copy of which 
shall be transmitted. My intelligence of this morning justifies 
the opinion I had formed, and proves that the matter must be 
yet for some time suspended. I am, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My last was of the tenth of July. Mr Livingston, who is on 
his way to America, presents an opportunity of writing, which 
must not be neglected, although I am engaged at present in 
examination of the account received from the Commissioners of 
the Treasury. I have already mentioned to you, Sir, that the 
whole of this account is open, and I must now observe, that I 
do not find myself particularly authorised to make the final adjustment. If it becomes necessary, I will do it, but I shall 
avoid it as long as I can. In respect to the payments made 
and making in America, I am at ease, because there I have your orders ; but not so in regard to those made by 
I shall hope however to be favored with your instructions in 
consequence of his communications. I shall write particularly 
respecting the account, when I have gone through it. 
</p><p>
In a former letter I mentioned that M. de Lafayette was 
about to commence an attack upon the Jacobin faction. I have 
not followed that business in my correspondence, because the 
Gazettes will furnish the most ample intelligence. I mentioned my apprehension, that it would not be successful, and it furnishes a new instance of the instability of human affairs, especially of those which depend on the opinion of an ignorant populace. I verily believe that if M. de Lafayette were to appear 
just now in Paris unattended by his army, he would be torn to 
pieces. Thank God, we have no populace in America, and I 
hope the education and manners will long prevent that evil. In 
the present state of things, it seems evident that if the King be 
not destroyed, he must soon become absolute. I think the 
prime movers of the revolution see no other mode of establishing the affairs of their country, on any tolerable footing, and will 
therefore declare their adherence to his Majesty, grounded on 
the abolition of the constitution by the Assembly, and their masters, the Jacobin club. 
</p><p>
In my last I told you, that the King would that day commence 
a new career ; but while I was writing all was changed, and 
my letter was gone off but a few minutes, before I was informed 
that the ministry had given in their resignation. I will not communicate the reasons, because they would be uninteresting to 
you, and should my letter miscarry, it would occasion much of 
that noise and nonsense, in which it is unpleasant to find one's 
name. And the wrong-headed people, who get hold of such 
things, cannot distinguish between a person who has obtained 
exact information of what is doing, and those who are actors in 
the business. For the same reason, I must decline mentioning 
the plans in agitation, at present, to establish a good constitution. I dare not say that I hope this will take place. I ardently wish it, but I have doubts and fears, because I have no confidence in the morals of the people. The King is anxious to 
secure their permanent happiness ; but alas ! they are not in a 
state of mind to receive good from his hands. Suspicion, that 
constant companion of vice and weakness, has loosened every 
band of social union, and blasts every honest hope in the moment of its budding. 
</p><p>
You will have se^en in the report of the minister of Foreign 
Affairs to the Assembly, that the impressions are made, which 
you desire, respecting the dispositions of the United States. 
After this report was made, some persons spoke to me of those 
dispositions in a tone of irony ; but I assured them, very seriously, that our grateful sentiments for the conduct of this nation 
would be demonstrated by our conduct, whenever occasion 
should require. That the changes they might make in their 
own administration, would by no means affect our regard for 
them, nor diminish our attachment. As this language was not 
ministerial, but held in the sincerity of social life, it surprised 
those who, unfortunately for them, can find for the conduct of 
nations no motive but interest, and are so short-sighted as not 
to perceive, that a virtuous and honorable conduct is the truest 
interest which a nation can pursue. 
</p><p>
In respect to other objects which are committed to me, it is 
hardly necessary to say, that nothing can be done in the pre 
sent moment. Such time as the Assembly can spare from the 
discussion of party disputes is necessarily engrossed by the department of war and finance. The determination to suspend 
the King has been a little palled by the information, that their 
armies would immediately revolt, and particularly the Southern 
army, on which they made their greatest reliance. This circumstance has greatly deranged the plan of operations, and the 
more so, as many instruments especially convened and collected for that grand stroke are at present no small incumbrance to 
the contrivers of it. Among these are the Bretons and Marseillois now in this city. Some of the chiefs of the Jacobins have, 
I am told, prepared the means of their escape to America, and 
among them your old acquaintance Condorcet. They are to 
embark at Dunkirk and St Valery. I am, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the pleasure to acknowledge yours of the first of Au 
gust by a courier, who left this city a few hours after I received it. I hope this will find you well and happy in London. 
The young gentleman whom I mentioned to you as being about to come hither is arrived, so that we must wait for another 
conveyance for the packet. In the mean time be so kind as 
to let me know your address in London. Mine is Rue de la Planche, No. 488. 
</p><p>
We have had here within these few days some serious 
scenes, at which I am not surprised, because I foresaw not 
only a struggle between the two corps, which the constitution 
had organized, viz. the executive (so called) and the legislative. But I was convinced that the latter would get the better. 
Such is the natural, and indeed the necessary order of things. 
It is nevertheless a painful reflection, that one of the finest 
countries in the world should be so cruelly torn to pieces. 
The storrn which lately raged is a little subsided, but the winds 
must soon arise again, and perhaps from the same, perhaps from 
another quarter. But that is of but little consequence, since 
in every case we must expect a little rage and devastation. A 
man, attached to his fellow men, must see with the same distress the woes they suffer, whether arising from an army or from 
a mob, and whether those by whom they are inflicted speak 
French or German. 
</p><p>
An American has a stronger sympathy with this country 
than any other observer, and nourished as he is in the very 
bosom of liberty, he cannot but be deeply afflicted to see that 
in almost every event, this struggle must terminate in despotism. 
Yet such is the melancholy spectacle, which presents itself to 
my mind, and with which it has long been occupied. I eanestly wish and pray, that events may prove all my reasonings to have been fallacious, and all my apprehensions 
vain. I am, &c.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My last was of the first instant. Since that period another 
revolution has been effected in this city. It was bloody. 
Success, which always makes friends, gives to the present order 
an air of greater unanimity than really exists. A very considerable party is deeply interested to overturn it, but what 
may be their conduct is uncertain. Whether they will con 
fine themselves to idle vows and empty wishes, or whether 
they will break out into action, is doubtful. Some of them 
are men of enterprise, but it is rather .small than great enterprise. 
</p><p>
As you know well this kingdom, it may perhaps be 
sufficient to mention the kind of persons who compose this 
party. They are those who called themselves the moderate, 
or middle men, and who hoped to balance the two extremes, 
and govern the kingdom by playing off one set against the 
other. This, in quiet times, requires great talents, as well as 
great address, and they had more of the latter than the 
former. In times of turbulence it is necessary, that those who 
play this game should have a considerable armed force, 
because neither argument, nor persuasion, can then avail. It 
remains to be proved by the fact, whether they possess such 
force. If they do, it must be in the hands of M. de Lafayette ; 
and as all must depend on an immediate exercise of it, I 
rather think that the precious moment will be suffered to pass 
away. I have long been convinced that this middle party, 
who by the bye were the prime movers of the revolution, must 
fall to the ground, and that those who compose it must join 
one of the great factions. 
</p><p>
The Aristocratic faction is split into two or more. Some 
are for absolute monarchy, some for the ancient regime, some, 
and those but few, desire a mixed government. The framers 
of the late constitution had got up to this last ground, but the 
idea of a hereditary Senate stuck in their throats. The King. 
who has an uncommon firmness in suffering, but who has not 
the talents for action, and who is besides a very religious man,, 
found himself fettered by his oaths to the constitution, which 
he in his conscience believed to be a bad one ; and about 
which indeed there is now but one opinion in this country , 
because experience, that great parent of wisdom, has brought 
it already to trial and condemnation. The King, from the 
causes just mentioned, would not step forward, and of course 
there was no standard to which the adherents of the two 
chambers could repair. 
</p><p>
The republicans had the good sense to march boldly and 
openly to their object, and as they took care not to mince 
matters, nor embarrass themselves by legal or constitutional 
niceties, they had the advantage of union, concert, and design, 
against the disjointed members of a body without a head. If, 
under these circumstances, the foreign force were out of question, I should have no doubt that the republican form would 
take place quietly enough, and continue as long as the morals 
of the country would permit. You know the state of morals 
here, and can of course, if it be necessary, form the calculation 
for yourself. The circumstance of foreign force is however, 
on the present occasion, a preponderant object, and I think 
its effect will depend upon its activity. Should the Duke of 
Brunswick advance rapidly, he will be joined by great numbers, even of the armies opposed to him ; because the late 
change will furnish to some a reason, and to others a pretext, 
for abandoning the cause they had espoused. If, on the 
contrary, his progress be cautious and slow, it is probable that 
those who are now silent from fear, will habituate themselves 
by degrees to speak favorably of the present government, in 
order to lull suspicion : and that thus a public opinion will 
appear, which, when once pronounced, governs the generality 
of mankind. If by this means the new republic takes a little 
root, foreign powers will, I believe, find it a difficult matter to shake it to the ground, for the French nation is an immense 
mass, which it is not easy either to move or to oppose. 
You will observe, Sir, that matters are now brought to a 
simple question, between an absolute monarchy and a republic ; 
for all middle terms are done away. This question also must 
be decided by force, because on one side it is in the hands of the 
people, who cannot treat for themselves, and who will not permit others to treat for them in respect to the important interests which are now at stake. If, as in former times, some factious nobles were at the head of a party, they would, as formerly, take the first opportunity to stipulate for themselves at 
the expense of their party ; but without entering here into a 
question of relative integrity, I do not think the people are so 
attached to any particular men, as to have what may be called 
leaders ; and those who appear as such are in my opinion rather instruments than agents. 
</p><p>
I do not go into the history of things, nor trouble you with a 
recapitulation of events. I enclose, and shall send by the pre 
sent opportunity, the gazettes since my last, which will communicate all particulars, which you may desire to know. Since 
the operations of the tenth, the Logographe, Gazette Universelle, and Indicateur, are suppressed, as indeed were all those 
which were guilty of Feuillantisme, that is, adherence to the 
Club des Feuillants soi-disant Constitutionel. You must there 
fore make allowances for what you find in the other Gazettes, 
written not only in the spirit of a party, but under the eye of 
a party. The first must influence the most honest printer in 
the coloring of some facts, and the second will restrain the 
boldest printer in the publishing of other facts. If it were necessary, or could be useful, I should communicate all the particulars which come to my knowledge ; but this invidious task 
would answer no good end, and long before my letters could 
reach you, changes must inevitably take place. 
</p><p>
One particular however it is becoming to note. You will 
find that the Assembly immediately superseded the appointment of a Monsieur Bonne-Carrere, as minister to the United 
States. This man's character is as bad as need be, and stained 
by infamous vices. By what influence he was introduced into the office of Foreign Affairs I know not, for I was then in 
England ; but I have reason to believe it was the poor expedient of the Feuillants to watch, and check, and perhaps to be 
tray the Jacobin ministry. While the King was pressing M. 
Sainte-Croix (an eight day minister) to accept the department 
of Foreign Affairs, this last declared that he would not serve 
if Bonne-Carrere was retained ; and to get rid of him they in 
vented the expedient of sending him to America. I considered this step as a kind of insult, and transmitted my sentiments 
on the subject to the King, who thereupon told M. SainteCroix that I was angry at that appointment, and he must ar 
range the matter with me ; that he wished I would prevent 
his being received. 
</p><p>
The minister apologised for himself by saying the nomination had taken place before he came into office, and that he 
had remonstrated against it. He apologised for the thing as 
well as he could, admitting always that it was wrong ; and added that his embarkation should be delayed, and I was at liberty to prevent his being received. To this I replied, that he 
must not embark at all, but be removed ; and that would have 
been done, for when hs presented the Bon for his appointments, 
the minister refused to sign it. In the mean time the new revolution took place, and the history of M. Bonne-Carrere's ministry 
is at an end. It may perhaps be misrepresented, and therefore 
having stated the facts, I think it right to add that it proceeded from downright weakness. He was supposed to possess the 
confidence of a great many of the nobility, and therefore they 
were afraid to turn him about his business. Perhaps also he had 
been trusted so far that he knew too much. This was the 
case with some others, not better than him as to essentials, 
though not so much abased. 
</p><p>
I shall send herewith a packet, containing my correspondence with the Commissioners of the Treasury, relative to our 
debt, and in the same packet you will find a letter from Mr Cathalan to you relative to a riot at Marseilles, and his conduct 
therein. He has written two long letters to me on that subject, 
and I have replied by one of the thirteenth instant, which you 
will also find enclosed with his letter to you. 
</p><p>
I have already had occasion to mention to you, Sir, that I did 
not find myself authorised to go into the settlement of the 
account finally with the Commissioners of the Treasury. This 
observation I must again in this place repeat, and add that not 
withstanding my utmost efforts, I have not been able to bring 
the minister of Foreign Affairs to consider for a moment the 
question referred to me, respecting the sums paid and paying in 
America. What is still more surprising is, that the minister of 
the Marine, although authorised to treat with me for supplies to 
the colony of St Domingo, has done nothing in that affair. 
Two ministers have occupied that place since the decree. 
Each has given me various rendezvous, but neither has appeared at the time and place, because circumstances of the moment have obliged them to attend to something else. Indeed 
the executive of the late constitution has been at the last agony 
for these three months, and of course has thought more of saving its life than of doing its business. The present executive 
is just born, and may perhaps be stifled in the cradle. 
</p><p>
If a general arrangement could have been made with the 
late government, for paying the whole of the debt at some 
fixed exchange, so as to do justice, and fulfil the honorable 
intentions of the United States, I should have been well pleased, 
and although not exactly authorised should probably have taken 
on me to make the needful engagements ; and in so doing I 
should have made a great sacrifice to the public, because I wish 
of all things to be free from any pecuniary transactions, for I 
know by experience, that the utmost possible purity will not 
prevent malicious insinuations, which however unfounded will 
always find some believers. 
</p><p>
It appears, however, a probable event, that before our debt 
is paid, we may experience some considerable losses on ex 
change, not to mention the dead charges which are considerable too. It has therefore appeared to me most advisable to 
make one general statement and settlement of the whole ; and 
if it shall appear that we have gained, and that they have lo" 
by the modes of payment, then to give a good round sum as a 
compensation, and as it were gratuitously, because by that 
means we have the reputation of the good we do, and the sacrifice we make ; and because otherwise the agents of this government might attribute to their address an advantage gained, 
instead of giving credit to our generosity for a compensation 
granted. And it seems important to establish the latter idea, 
because it cannot fail to extend our credit throughout the world, 
and consequently to facilitate all pecuniary operations, which 
hereafter we may have occasion to make. 
</p><p>
Before I conclude this letter, permit me, my dear Sir, to 
request the orders of the President respecting my line of con 
duct in the circumstances about to arise. Perhaps these orders may not reach me, until the circumstances are past, but 
even then they may serve as a ground to reason on, in the circumstances which succeed. If they arrive in season, they will 
relieve my mind from a great weight. At present I feel my 
self in a state of contingent responsibility of the most delicate 
kind. I am far from wishing to avoid any fair and reasonable 
risk, and I rely on the justice of government, at the same 
time, to mark out as exactly as possible the conduct to be pur 
sued, as well as on its goodness to judge favorably of causes 
unforeseen. I am, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Mr Short, just before he departed from this city, left with 
me a Memoir in Dutch, respecting the mint. I was to get it 
translated for you, but not not having been able to find a per 
son acquainted with the Dutch and English languages, I have 
now determined to send you the original, which you will find 
here enclosed. I hope it may prove useful, and answer the end 
you had in view. I have transmitted to Mr Jefferson copies 
of my correspondence with the Commisioners of the Treasury 
here, respecting our debt. You seem to have supposed, that 
the instalments due had been paid, and this may turn out to 
be the case, when the account shall have been strictly exam 
ined, which I shall take care of. Mr Short left (as I presume 
he informed you,) this business unfinished, supposing that my 
powers would be competent to it, which they are not; and in 
deed I should be glad to avoid all interference in pecuniary af 
fairs, if possible. Not on account of the labor, for you may lay 
as much of that on me as you please, but I would avoid all occasions of slanderous imputation. 
</p><p>
I formerly recommended to Mr Short the opening of a loan 
at Antwerp, and it was attended with the best effects ; for the 
capitalists of Amsterdam, who had shortly before induced our 
Commissioners to believe that money could not be obtained 
there under five per cent, soon after let us have it at four. This 
1 was sure would happen, for I had been in Holland, had studied the character of the money lending people, and made my 
self acquainted with the manner of transacting business. 
</p><p>
I am still of opinion, that it is wise to multiply the scenes on 
which to display our credit. Those, who have lent money to a 
nation, naturally incline to speak well of that nation, first to justify the confidence they have placed, and next to increase the 
value of the stock they possess. It may at first seem more eligible, because more convenient, to perform all our pecuniary 
operations at one place, and those, who are interested in establishing that dcctrine, will find many plausible arguments in sup 
port of their favorite theory, just as somebody (I believe it was Silas Deane) endeavored to prove, that we had better buy teas 
and nankins in London than in China. I remember the thing 
made an impression on me at the time, as the India Company 
were then buying at Dunkirk some teas, which had been shipped from America. 
</p><p>
To return from the digression, I apprehend that confining 
this business to one spot, may in the end have a very unfavor 
able influence both on our commerce and exchange, because 
the necessity of remittances being known, and the periods also, 
capitalists can take their measures beforehand to give you the 
law. And if, which God forbid, public events should compel 
us to make loans, our creditors knowing our absolute dependence on them alone, will impose whatever terms they please. 
I do not dwell on these topics, because a word is sufficient to 
you.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
If I have not hitherto mentioned the application made to 
me by the foreign officers, who have certificates, whereof the 
interest is payable in this city, it has not been for want of 
sufficient reason, but because I daily hoped to have received 
some orders on that subject.  Many have spoken to me, 
written to me, and called upon me. I have given to all the 
general assurances, that justice would be done, that I would 
transmit their claims, and the like. I now enclose a letter 
from the Polish Envoy, relative to the claims of Brigadier 
General Kosciuszko, and I have told the Count d Oraczewski 
that I daily expect despatches from you on this subject. I 
did this because General Duportail told me, that he had information from Colonel Ternant, that these claims are honorably 
provided for. In the uncertainty as to what may have been 
done, I feel it my duty to bring the matter to your recollection, persuaded that you will do everything which may be proper on the occasion. 
</p><p>
I enclose, in like manner, a letter I have received from 
Mr Francis Coffin of Dunkirk, respecting the Consular office 
in that city. I tell him in answer to it, that I shall inquire of 
M. de Lamotte as to the appointment he complains of, and 
will transmit his letter to you, and take your orders. These 
you will, I trust, be so kind as to give me. I know not Mr Coffin, and consequently can say nothing either for or against 
him. I am, &;c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My last was of the seventeenth instant. In mine of the 
sixteenth, I mentioned the revolution of the tenth. I suggested my idea, that the force commanded by M. de Lafayette 
would not be brought to immediate action, and that in such 
case he and his friends had nothing to hope for. He, as you 
will learn, encamped at Sedan, and official accounts of last 
night inform us, that he has taken refuge with the enemy. 
Thus his circle is completed. He has spent his fortune on a 
revolution, and is now crushed by the wheel which he put in 
motion. He lasted longer than I expected. Some other officers tried to influence their troops in favor of the late constitution, but without effect. They are, it seems, yet to learn 
that an officer has never complete possession of his soldiers, 
till rigid discipline has led them by the hand over fields of 
glory, in which he has shared then- danger, and pointed to 
them the path which leads to triumph. 
</p><p>
These scenes are yet remote, but if the combined powers 
cannot succeed in the present plans, they must hereafter take 
place. In the mean time much suspicion, much jealousy, and 
many victims, are all in the natural order of things. 
</p><p>
I do not find that the Prince of Brunswick has made those 
rapid movements, which the existent state of things required, 
and he loses much by delay. He probably understands too well 
the business of war, and his high station requires a man in whom 
the accomplished General should be but a secondary talent. 
I cannot for a moment suppose a possibility of beating him with 
the French army, if army it can be called where there is no 
discipline ; but if he will not commit himself a little to fortune, 
it appears to me a very easy matter to wear away the time 
till winter shuts the theatre. We are now far advanced in 
August, and he has at most three months before him. 
</p><p>
The day before yesterday, the British Ambassador received 
a despatch from his court, which he immediately transmitted 
to the present minister of Foreign Affairs, and at the same 
time asked for passports. This despatch has not yet been 
communicated to the Assembly, because it runs rather counter to expectations which had been raised, and of course the 
public mind is not duly prepared. The purport of this despatch is, that Britain is determined on a strict neutrality, that 
she means to preserve it, and therefore, as his letters of credence are to the King now dethroned, he had best come 
away. To this is subjoined a hope, that nothing will happen 
to the King or his family, because that would excite the indignation of all Europe. This despatch, turned into plain English, is shortly, that the British court resent what is already 
done, and will make war immediately if the treatment of the 
King be such as to call for, or to justify, measures of extremity. ; 
</p><p>
The different Ambassadors and ministers are all taking their 
flight, and if I stay I shall be alone. I mean however to stay, 
unless circumstances should command me away, because in 
the admitted case that my letters of credence are to the Monarchy, and not to the Republic of France, it becomes a matter 
of indifference whether I remain in this country, or go to England, during the time which may be needful to obtain your orders, or to produce a settlement of affairs here. Going hence, 
however, would look like taking part against the late revolution, 
and I am not only unauthorised in this respect, but I am bound 
to suppose that if the great majority of the nation adhere to 
the new form, the United States will approve thereof; because 
in the first place we have no right to prescribe to this country 
the government they shall adopt, and next because the basis 
of our own constitution is the indefeasible right of the people 
to establish it. 
</p><p>
Among those who are leaving Paris, is the Venetian Ambasdor. He w^as furnished with passports from the office of Foreign Affairs , but he was nevertheless stopped at the barrier, 
was conducted to the Hotel de Ville, was there questioned for 
hours, and his carriages examined and searched. This violation of the rights of Ambassadors could not fail, as you may 
suppose, to make an impression. It has been broadly hinted 
to me, that the honor of my country and my own require that 
I should go away. But I am of a different opinion, and rather 
think that those who give such hints are somewhat influenced 
by fear. It is true that the position is not without danger ; but 
I presume, that when the President did me the honor of naming 
me to this embassy, it was not for my personal pleasure or safety, but to promote the interests of my country. These, there 
fore, I shall continue to pursue to the best of my judgment, and 
as to consequences, they are in the hand of God. I have the 
honor to be, with great respect, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Heretofore I have mentioned to you, that I had not been 
able to adjust with the minister of Foreign Affairs the rate of 
exchange, which should govern the payments made, and mak 
ing, in America, on account of our debt to France ; and that 
I had not been able to see the minister of Marine, to adjust 
with him the sums which the Assembly had determined to 
apply out of that debt to the use of St Domingo. You will 
have seen, by my correspondence with the Commissioners of 
the Treasury, that the last payment of six millions will nearly 
balance the account according even to their statement of it, 
over and above the four hundred thousand dollars, which are 
to be paid at Philadelphia during the current year. 
</p><p>
A few days since M. Monge, the present minister of the 
Marine, desired an interview, and at our meeting he presented 
me a regular contract for payment of eight hundred thousand 
dollars, as being equivalent to the four million of livres, which 
the Assembly had appropriated as above mentioned. I will 
not trouble you with the conversation, because it ended in a 
request on his part to meet <a href="/results.php?tla=leb" rel="met colleague">M. Lebrun</a> the minister of Foreign 
Affairs, and M. Claviere the minister of Public Contributions. 
This meeting took place yesterday by their appointment. 
The same form of agreement was again produced, and M. 
Claviere, who was principal spokesman, mentioned my signing 
it as a thing of course. I told him that I had been authorised 
to settle with the late government the exchange of one half of 
that sum already paid, and paying, on this very account. 
He spoke of such settlement as the easiest thing in the world, 
and advanced on the subject exactly those principles, which 
Mr Short had refused to be governed by ; and rejected as 
visionary those, which Mr Short had stated as just, and which 
I think are reasonable and right. 
</p><p>
The great object however was to get the money, and Congress was to fix the exchange. I told them, (which is very 
true) that I felt a sincere desire to furnish aid to that unhappy 
colony, and had done everything in my power to comply with 
the wish of the legislature in that respect, but in vain ; that 
at last our bankers in Holland being extremely anxious to discharge themselves of the large sums which had for months 
been lying in their hands, their own Commissaries of the Treasury being also desirous to receive it, Mr Short, to whom the 
management of that business had been committed by the 
United States, being also solicitous that the payments should 
be made, I had desired him to place in the hands of the 
bankers named by the Commissaries an equivalent of six mil 
lions of livres, by which means the instalments of our debt already due, were overpaid. That of course any advances now made must be on account of those instalments, which 
are to become due hereafter. That I had no instructions 
respecting them, for reasons I had already assigned, and that 
of consequence, if I should enter into the agreement they 
wished, I should probably be blamed for exceeding the line 
prescribed to me. That there remained, however, another 
point worthy of their attention, which was that my agreement 
would be in itself void, because I had no powers to treat with 
the present government. It followed, therefore, that the ministers of the United States would feel themselves as much at 
liberty, as if nothing had been done, and act according to their 
own ideas of the object, distinctly from any engagements. 
That it would be equally useful to them,, and more proper in 
me, to state the whole matter to you in the first instance, and 
that I would add my earnest request to make the desired payment. 
</p><p>
This however did not at all suit their ideas. M. Claviere 
made many observations on the nature of our debt, and the 
manner in which it had accrued. He said that the United 
States would certainly act in a different manner towards the 
present Government, from what the Monarchs of Europe did. 
That it was impossible I should have any difficulty, if I inclined to do what they asked, and then concluded by asking me 
peremptorily whether I would, or would not. 
</p><p>
His language and manner were such as naturally to excite 
some little indignation, and although I would pardon much in 
a man, whose stockjobbing life had but little qualified him for a 
station in which delicacy of manner and expression is almost 
essential, yet I could not submit to an indignity in my per 
son, towards the country I represent. I told him therefore that 
I did not understand what he meant to say. My countenance 
I believe spoke the rest of my sentiments, and led him to say, 
in explanation, that it was necessary for them to have some 
positive engagement, because otherwise they must make pro 
vision for the service from another source, and then he again expressed his conviction, that the United States would recognise them ; and at any rate would not disavow the engagements which I might make. I told him it was not proper for 
me, a servant, to pretend to decide on what would be the 
opinion of my masters. That I should wait their orders, and 
obey them when received. That the present Government 
might collect my sentiments from my conduct. That I could 
not possibly take on me to judge questions of such magnitude. 
That I would do everything I could with propriety, and again 
repeated my offer, which they would not listen to, and I left 
them, not a little displeased, if I may judge from appearances 
by no means equivocal. 
</p><p>
The Dutch Ambassador, who dined with me, told me that 
he had received his orders, and should ask for passports this 
day. The British Ambassador went off two days ago, and 
Mr Lindsay, their Minister, intends going tomorrow. He offers to take my letters to Mr Pinckney, to whom I shall en 
close this to be forwarded to you. 
</p><p>
Last evening between ten and eleven, I received a visit 
from some Commissaires de Section, who came in consequence 
of a denunciation made by some blockhead, or rascal, that I 
had arms concealed in my house. I made them sensible of 
the impropriety of their conduct, told them that I had no arms, 
and that if I had, they should not touch one of them. That 
in such case, they must apply to me through their minister of 
Foreign Affairs, and ask me to cede them. I insisted that the 
man who had presumed to make this denunciation should be 
seized, and then I would demonstrate the falsehood, that he 
might be punished. The scene finished by apologies on their 
part. Last night there was a general visit and search through 
out the town for arms and I presume for persons also. It still 
continues. Between nine and ten, the Commissary called on 
me with many apologies, and took a note of my reply, so that 
we met and parted good friends. 
</p><p>
You will see by all this, my dear Sir, that I have sufficient 
cause to take offence and depart, if I were so inclined ; but I 
will stay, if possible, so as to preserve to you the most perfect 
liberty of action. I do not indeed feel offended at what is 
done by the people, because they cannot be supposed to understand the law of nations, and because they are in a state of 
fury which is inconceivable, and which leaves them liable to all 
impressions, and renders them capable of all excesses. I 
shall endeavor, nevertheless, to preserve the proper firmness, 
and let what will happen^ I hope that though my friends should 
have occasion to lament my fate, they will never be obliged to 
blush for my conduct.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 30th of August was not delivered to me 
until four o clock yesterday. I shall reply to it in detail, 
and with the shortest delay possible. 
</p><p>
You do me the honor to tell me, that I am able to fulfil 
the engagements entered into by Mr Short, relative to the eight 
hundred thousand dollars to be held in North America at your 
disposal, for the purchases necessary to supply your colonies. 
I have already observed to you, Sir, and I now repeat it, that 
the care of making the payments of our debt to France was 
confided to Mr Short, and that / have never been authorised to 
meddle with it. I venture to add, Sir, that you have in your 
own office proofs of this fact. 
</p><p>
Your predecessors informed me, that they had received 
from the French Minister at Philadelphia the copy of a letter, 
written to him by Mr Hamilton, our Minister of Finance, and 
dated the eighth of March. You will perceive, that Mr Hamilton there says ; &lt; After the instructions given to Mr Short, 
after the known progress of these operations, and .from some 
passages in one of his letters of the 12th of November last, 
I conclude with certainty, that he has paid all arrears of interest and reimbursements of capital become due up to the close 
of the year <a href='/results.php?year=1791'>1791</a>. He adds (with respect to the four hundred thousand dollars, which it was agreed to pay in the course 
of the year <a href='/results.php?year=1792'>1792</a>) that this sum will be in anticipation of what 
becomes due at a future time. I Here I should observe to you, 
Sir, that all engagements, made by Mr Short, will be fulfilled 
by the United States, with the greatest precision. 
</p><p>
I pray you moreover, Sir, to fix your attention upon another 
very important fact, which I had the honor to lay before you. 
Mr Short had left in the hands of our bankers at Amsterdam 
very great sums for many months, while waiting for definitive 
arrangements to be made with regard to the payments, arrangements which were not made during his mission. On the 30th of 
July last, I stated to the Commissaries of the national treasury, 
that it was impossible for me to do anything decisive on this point, 
until I should receive the orders of my government, (les ordres 
de ma cow.) At this time, Mr Short urged me to pay over 
to the Commissioners of the treasury the money, which was at 
his disposal, and the Commissioners on their side begged me to 
make the same payment. Accordingly, having agreed with 
them on the rate of exchange, by which we should be regulated 
at the time, always excepting the definitive arrangements to be 
made with the person, who should be appointed for this purpose by the United States, I requested Mr Short, by letter, on the 6th of August to give orders to our bankers to pay to 
Messieurs Hoguer, Grand and Company, bankers designated 
by the Commissioners of the treasury, the sum of one mil 
lion six hundred and twenty five thousand florins, (florins de banque) which, at said rate of exchange, amounted to six 
millions of French money. 
</p><p>
You will have the goodness to observe, Sir, that according 
to the calculation of the Commissioners, there was due to 
France, on the first of July last, a sum of six millions and a 
half; that in this sum was included that of three millions one 
hundred and fifty-seven thousand seven hundred and fifty-eight livres, which was not taken into Mr Hamilton's calculation, and of which a part at least is still to be verified. You 
will be pleased to remark also, that in this calculation the payments, which have been actually made in America, are not included, which make still another item of more than two mill 
ions. It follows then, at all events, that the reimbursements 
to be made, up to the present time, are all discharged. I 
would observe farther, that I am in no way authorised to dispose of any sums, which were or might be in the hands of our 
bankers at Amsterdam, and that all I have done, or could do, 
was to apply to Mr Short, who alone has authority in this matter. 
</p><p>
It still remains for me to recall another very important fact 
to your mind, which you will find authenticated in the same 
letter of Mr Hamilton ; that owing to the extra expenses occasioned by our Indian war, it was impossible for him to promise the payment of the sum of four hundred thousand dollars, 
at any nearer intervals than those specified, the last of which 
extends to the first of December, <a href='/results.php?year=1792'>1792</a>. You may judge, after this exposition, whether it would be possible for me to go 
farther than to make the offer I have already made, of earnestly soliciting my Government to lend you the assistance you 
demand. A proposal which you refused to accept. 
</p><p>
As to the suspension of the King, Sir, you must surely agree 
with me, that a Minister has no right to express any opinion 
whatever, without the previous orders of his nation. And 
when I spoke of it to you, I was not disposed to give any opinion; nor at your solicitation, did I express anything farther, 
than that you might perceive that even if it were possible for me to run the risk of committing myself, by consenting 
to the pecuniary arrangements which you desired, and which 
were not confided to me fry my government, you would still 
be unable to claim from them the execution of my engagements ; for though they might recognise your authority, yet 
they would consider it necessary for you to wait my new credentials. 
</p><p>
In the letter, which I had the honor of writing to you on the 
twenty-first of August, I informed you that it was my intention 
to remain in Paris ; but the style of yours of the thirtieth of 
August obliges me to request from you a passport to leave 
France. I shall travel by short stages with my own horses, 
taking the route to England by Calais. I shall leave my 
house in its present condition, my secretary, and part of my 
family, till I receive orders from the United States. I have 
the honor to be, &c.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Yours of the fourth instant arrived yesterday afternoon, and 
I write now, that I may be in time for the post tomorrow. I 
believe the delay of my letter was not in this city. As the 
six millions are, I suppose, paid, it is not necessary to dilate 
on that subject. 
</p><p>
In regard to the extent of my powers, I will explain to you my ideas thereon. At first I supposed that the management of 
what relates to our debt was in some sort a needful appendage to this mission. Mr Jefferson's letter committing to me expressly an incidental negotiation, respecting a small part of it, 
undeceived me. Counting however on your concurrence in 
such measures as might appear proper, I should have gone on 
to prepare with the Minister a plan for the final liquidation of 
this object, could I have prevailed on him to attend to it. I 
have since had occasion, when I treated with the Commissaries 
of the treasury, to examine a little more minutely into my powers, so far as they relate to the debt, and I found that the management of it was committed entirely, and of course exclusively to you. Whether the knowledge they must have acquired 
before the present moment, that nothing final is done, joined 
to the idea that you are in Spain, will induce them to address 
their orders to me, I know not ; and you will, I trust, excuse 
me for adding that I hope not. 
</p><p>
Of all things I wish to steer clear of pecuniary transactions, 
because they involve a species of responsibility which is most 
irksome, and expose the agent to the chance of being called 
by every calumniator, to answer at the bar of public opinion. 
</p><p>
You tell me, in the very moment you express an apprehension as to the validity of transactions with the present government, that you would be glad that I should take up certain of 
our obligations, &tc. &c. On this head I must observe to you, 
that the informations you have received and communicated to 
me respecting the state of the account, and the objections made 
by the Secretary of the Treasury, prove beyond a possibility of 
doubt, that our government do not mean or wish that I should 
meddle therein. I have not received a line from the Secretary of the Treasury of any kind. 
</p><p>
To return however to your wish. You will doubtless see 
with me, that our obligations do not constitute, but only evidence 
our debt. To possess ourselves of them, therefore, otherwise 
than by due payment, would not cancel or alter the debt. 
And from the moment you impeach the right of the present 
government to receive the money, you invalidate any transactions respecting it which they may make. This observation I 
make for your consideration ; it cannot in any wise affect my 
conduct, because I am for the reasons already mentioned quite 
unauthorised, and indeed indirectly prohibited from acting in 
that behalf. 
</p><p>
Among the many scenes of bloodshed, which have of late 
been exhibited, you will lament the fate of the Duke de la 
Rochefoucault, killed in the presence of his aged mother. I 
am, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The object of this is merely to transmit a letter forwarded to 
me by Mr Cathalan, who desires me to communicate the 
scarcity to my friends, and at the same time mentions, that if 
I will encourage him thereto, he will immediately set off to 
America to procure wheat. My answer of this date is 
enclosed. 
</p><p>
By the first convenient opportunity I shall write to you 
respecting the state of things here, and I shall now send with 
this letter the several gazettes. We have had one week of 
unchecked murders, in which some thousands have perished in 
this city. It began with between two and three hundred of 
the clergy, who had been shut up because they would not 
take the oaths prescribed by the law, and which they said 
were contrary to their conscience. Thence, these executors 
of speedy justice went to the Abbaye, where the persons were 
confined, who were at court on the tenth of August. These 
were despatched also, and afterwards they visited the other 
prisons. All those who were confined either on the accusation, 
or suspicion of crimes, were destroyed. Madame de Lamballe 
was, I believe, the only woman killed, and she was beheaded 
and embowelled, the head and entrails paraded on pikes 
through the streets, and the body dragged after them. They 
continued I am told in the neighborhood of the Temple, until 
the Queen looked out at this horrid spectacle. 
</p><p>
Yesterday the prisoners from Orleans were put to death at 
Versailles. The destruction began here about five in the 
afternoon on Sunday, the second instant. A guard had been 
sent a few days since to make the Duke de la Rochefoucault 
prisoner. He was on his way to Paris under their escort with 
his wife and mother, when he was taken out of his carriage 
and killed. The ladies were taken back to la Roche Guyonne 
where they are now in a state of arrestation. Monsieur de 
Montmorin was among those slain at the Abbaye. You will 
recollect, that a petition was signed by many thousands to 
displace the Mayor on account of his conduct on the twentieth 
of June. The signing of this petition is considered as a sufficient proof of the crime of Feuillantism, and it was in contemplation with some to put all those who were guilty of signing 
that petition to death. This measure seems, however, to be 
suspended, for the present at least ; but as there is no real 
executive authority, the plan may be easily resumed, should it 
suit the views of those who enjoy the confidence of that part 
of the people, who are now active. I am, &c.

Sir, 
</p><p>
I have had the honor of receiving your letter of the 16th. 
After the explanations contained in it, I shall not again recur 
to that of the 30th of August, and as it was that which decided 
me to leave France, I now resume my determination to re 
main here, and await the orders of my government. 
</p><p>
As to my personal opinions, Sir, they are of no importance 
in so serious an affair, but you may be sure, that I have never 
questioned the right of any people to govern themselves ac 
cording to their own pleasure. For these many years I have 
desired sincerely, that France might enjoy all the liberty and 
all the happiness possible ; and I am confident that I express 
the sentiments of the United States, in assuring you that in 
this wish all my countrymen unite.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I shall confine myself, on the present occasion, to transmitting copies of my correspondence with the ministry, on the 
subject of the conference mentioned to you in mine of the thirtieth of last month. I transmit, however, a copy of what I 
wrote on the twentieth of August, because the answer of the 
eighth of this month would not be otherwise intelligible. I 
will not at present make any comments on this correspondence, 
and I do not know whether I shall ever mention it again. 
I send you also, as the best means of communicating the 
state of this city and kingdom, the short but lively picture drawn 
of them in the Assembly by Monsieur Masuyer, on Saturday 
last, the fifteenth instant, and the report made on Sunday morn 
ing, by Monsieur Roland, the minister of the Interior. 
</p><p>
I wish it were in my power to communicate a more flattering prospect, than is held out by these extracts. It gives me 
pain to write, and will, I am sure, give you pain to read, the 
distressful state of a country for which we have both a sincere 
regard. All which I can do under present circumstances, is, 
to be silent. Bad news have a flight so rapid, that I will not 
add to their wings.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
In my last I transmitted copies of my correspondence with 
the Minister, respecting the subject of the conversation mentioned in mine of the thirtieth of last month, of which, as well as of 
those of the seventeenth and twenty-second, copies are here en 
closed. 
</p><p>
I think it is proper to mention to you now a circumstance 
relating to that conversation, because it may explain transactions connected therewith. I had good reason to believe, that 
a private speculation was at the bottom of the proposals made 
to me, and the extreme urgency which was exhibited by one 
of the conferees, who had been designated to me as concerned 
therein, tended not a little to confirm the information I had re 
ceived. The wrath excited by the unwillingness on my part 
to jump over all the bounds of my powers and instructions, did 
by no means lessen, but came in support of the same idea. 
Since that period I have been asked by a person, who said he 
was offered a bill drawn by the government here on the treasury of the United States, whether such a bill would be paid. I 
expressed my surprise, and was told that this bill would be for 
the sum decreed by the Assembly to be employed in purchasing supplies for the colony of St Domingo. I observed that it 
seemed a strange procedure either to sell or buy such a bill ; 
because the vender could only employ the money in America, 
and of course need not risk a draft ; and the purchaser, who 
must make the expenditure, could not, I supposed, find his ac 
count in the transaction. This led to an explanation. The 
bill was to be paid for in Assignats at par, six or nine months 
hence, and the produce was to be employed in purchasing manufactures suitable to the colony in this country. I told the 
person who applied to me, that I did not think this would be considered in America as falling within the decree, and that no 
good reason could be assigned for paying, under great disadvantages in Philadelphia, what could be paid with great advantage 
in Paris, when the sum paid was not to be expended in the 
United States but. in France. At length the true object of this 
application to me came out. I discovered it was merely a 
scheme of speculation to be carried into effect, if I could be induced to recommend the payment, under what was known to 
be a favorite idea with me, viz. the expending in America what 
we owe to France, and for the support of the colony of St Domingo. As my concurrence could not be hoped for, I believe 
the plan is abandoned, but perhaps it is only abandoned in appearance. 
</p><p>
I also take the liberty to enclose the extract of a letter from 
Mr Short respecting M. de Lafayette, with my answer. I 
understand that he was forwarded from Luxemburg privately on the route to Vienna, and had got as far as Brisgaw 
several days ago. I presume that his treatment will depend 
very much on the success of the military operations. If the 
allied monarchs, finding themselves disappointed in their 
expectations from the present campaign, are obliged to look 
forward to more extensive and more permanent efforts, they 
will probably endeavor to gain one of the great parties in this 
country ; and should they turn their eyes towards the Quatrevingt-neufs, or Feuillants, they will naturally consider M. 
de Lafayette as the most fitting instrument to be employed, 
and he will naturally desire to aid in the establishment of the 
party and the principles, which he considers as true supporters 
of liberty in this country. For you will observe, that in like 
manner as the Clerical and Aristocratic parties considered 
the Assembly in <a href='/results.php?year=1789'>1789</a> as a usurper, the leaders of that 
Assembly affixed on the Jacobins the same charge of usurpation, and now the leaders of the last revolution are charged 
by some of their brethren with Feuillantism. 
</p><p>
You will see by the gazettes, that there is the same enmity 
between the present chiefs, which prevailed heretofore against 
those whom they considered as their common enemies, and if 
either of the present parties should get the better, it would 
probably again divide ; for party, like matter, is divisible ad 
infinitum, because things which depend on human opinion 
can never be tried by any common standard. And not only 
is it unavoidable, that there should be differences among different men, but it is even uncommon to find in the same man the 
same sentiments, for a continued length of time, even upon the same subject, for either the circumstances change or else the man. 
</p><p>
You will see that the King of Prussia has made some overtures for treaty, which were not listened to. I consider the 
offer as a mere military manoeuvre, because it is not possible 
that treaty should succeed in the present moment, and because 
preparations are making for more vigorous efforts the ensuing 
campaign. I am told that both Sweden and Denmark have 
acceded to the league, and that they count on the assistance 
of Great Britain, should that become necessary. 
</p><p>
On this last subject much may be said. Of the King's personal opinions there can be no doubt, and I have some little 
reason to believe, that not only his ministers, but the great mass 
of property and interest in that kingdom would readily embark 
in a contest to crush opinions, which are considered fatal to the 
peace and order of civil society. And you know of how little 
consequence it is, as to human action, whether opinions be or 
be not well founded. On the other hand, there is a party in 
England, not inconsiderable as to numbers, and very important 
from the activity of its members, who, joining to high notions 
of civil liberty some mixture of the enmities and prejudices of 
particular sects of religion, aim at a subversion of Monarchy, 
Hierarchy, and Aristocracy. But as any great convulsion 
must necessarily overturn the stupendous fabric of national 
credit, which has been erected within this century, there are 
among the chieftains even of this party several, who rather 
wish that the battles for freedom should be fought on French 
than English ground. Yet these same men, should it become 
necessary to take a decided part, would range themselves, I 
think, under the revolutionary standard. But in this uncertain 
state of men and things the ministry have to fear from inaction, 
that the principles of the government will be sapped, and they 
have to fear a total defeat, should they declare war without 
first securing the aid of the opposition. This they have been 
laboring at for some time, but with little effect, because there 
are two or three great places desired by both parties. Of 
these intrigues, however, Mr Pinckney will, I doubt not, give 
you ample details, as they are closely connected with the objects 
of his mission. I have little doubt but that a junction, or coalition, between these two parties would enable the government 
to act with all the energy it could wish, and there seems to me 
to be a little cause not much noticed, but of considerable effect, 
which may lead them into a war. It is the legal advantage to 
be gained over those, who, in supporting certain opinions, may 
in case of war be brought under the statute of treasons as adhering to the foreign enemy. 
</p><p>
An opponent more dreadful than any of the armies which 
can be sent against this country &gt; or any of the parties by which 
it may be distracted, seems to be preparin ghis vengeance. Fa 
mine is among the things on which to calculate. The crop in 
Sicily was short ; that of the Southern provinces, always insufficient, is much less than usual. The supplies usually 
drawn from the coast of Barbary will, I am told, be totally cut 
off by those powers, who, in consequence of the affair of the 
tenth of August, mean to break with this country. The grain 
provinces on the north and east, if not possessed by the enemy, 
will be totally exhausted by the two armies ; and Poland, 
whose granaries are shut up till the next spring, will be engrossed by the enemy to furnish his own magazines. I consider it 
therefore as next to certain, that the want here will be very 
great during the ensuing year ; and as this must, by the end of 
December, become apparent to everybody, most other resources will then be shut by the hand of mercantile speculation. 
Hence it would seem, that our merchants would act wisely in 
sending hither cargoes of flour, and I have but one apprehension in recommending it, which is, that, from the laxity of government, property of that sort may become precarious, when 
the price has got so high as to oppress the poor, and yet it 
must so rise, or else the merchant will suffer, because the 
exchange cuts off a great- proportion of what he receives. 
</p><p>
I submit, my dear Sir, to your better judgment all these 
ideas, persuaded that you will turn them to the best account ; 
and I pray you to believe in that sincere regard with which I 
am, &c.

</p><p>
My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Yours of the twenty-first of June is at length safely arrived. 
Poor Lafayette ! Your letter for him must remain with me yet 
some time. His enemies here are as virulent as ever, and I 
can give you no better proof than this. Among the King's 
papers was found nothing of what his enemies wished and expected, except his correspondence with M. de Lafayette, 
which breathes from beginning to end the purest sentiments 
of freedom. It is therefore kept secret, while he stands accused of designs in conjunction with the dethroned monarch 
to enslave his country. 
</p><p>
The fact respecting this correspondence is communicated to 
me, by a person to whom it was related confidentially by one 
of the parties who examined it. You will have seen in my 
letters to Mr Jefferson, a proposition made by Mr Short respecting M. de Lafayette, with my reply. I had very good reason 
to apprehend, that our interference at that time would have 
been injurious to him, but I hope that a moment will soon offer in which something may be done for his relief. In reading 
my correspondence with Mr Short you must consider, that I 
wrote to the French and Austrian government, as each would 
take the liberty to read my letters. 
</p><p>
You will have seen also that in my letters to Mr Jefferson, 
I hint at the dangers attending a residence in this city. Some 
of the sanguinary events which have taken place, and which were partial executions of great plans, will point to a natural 
interpretation thereof; but these were not what I contemplated. Should we ever meet, I will entertain you with the recital of many things, which it would be improper to commit to 
paper, at least for the present. You will have seen, that 
the King is accused of high crimes and misdemeanors ; but I 
verily believe that he wished sincerely for this nation the enjoyment of the utmost degree of liberty, which their situation 
and circumstances will permit. He wished for a good constitution, but unfortunately he had not the means to obtain it, or 
if he had he was thwarted by those about him. What may 
be his fate God only knows, but history informs us, that the 
passage of dethroned monarchs is short from the prison to 
the grave. 
</p><p>
I have mentioned to Mr Jefferson, repeatedly, my wish to 
have positive instructions and orders for my government. I 
need not tell you, Sir, how agreeable this would be to me, and 
what a load it would take from my mind. At the same time 
I am fully sensible, that it may be inconvenient to give me 
such orders. The United States may wish to temporize, and 
see how things are likely to end, and in such case, leaving me 
at large with the right reserved to avow or disavow me according to circumstances and events, is for the government an eligible position. My part in the play is not quite so eligible ; but 
although I wish the Senate to be sensible of this, I am far from 
wishing that any precipitate step be taken to relieve me from 
it, for I know how contemptible is every private consideration, 
when compared with the public interests. One step however 
seems natural, viz. to say that before any new letters of credence are given, it will be proper to know to whom they are 
to be directed, because the Convention, a mere temporary body, is to be succeeded by some fixed form, and it may be a 
long time before any such form will be adopted. 
</p><p>
Mr Jefferson, from the materials in his possession, will be 
able to give you an accurate account of the military events. 
I discover three capital errors in the conduct of the Duke of 
Brunswick. First, his proclamation arrogated rights, which 
on no construction could belong to him or his employers, and 
contained threats which no circumstances could warrant, and 
which in no supposable success could be executed. They 
tended however to unite the nation in opposing him, seeing 
that no hope remained for those who had taken any part in 
the revolution ; and the conduct observed towards Monsieur 
de Lafayette and his companions was a severe comment on 
the cruelty of the rest Thus in the same moment he wounded the pride, insulted the feelings, and alarmed the fears of all 
France. And by his thundering menaces to protect the royal 
family, he plunged them into the situation from which he 
meant to extricate them. 
</p><p>
The second error was, not to dash at Paris the Instant he 
received the news of the affair of the tenth. He should then 
have advanced at all hazards, and if in so doing he had declared to the several Generals and armies, that he expected their 
assistance to restore their dethroned prince and violated constitution, I am persuaded that he would have met with as much 
support as opposition. I learn within these two days, that the 
delegates of Lorraine and Alsace had so little hope, or rather 
were so thoroughly persuaded that those provinces would join 
the enemy, that they made unusual haste to come forward, lest 
they should be apprehended. Great activity in that moment 
would have done wonders ; but then he was not ready. 
</p><p>
The third great error was, that after waiting so long he came 
forward at all this season. By menacing the frontiers with 
great and increasing force, vast numbers of the militia would 
have been drawn to the utmost verge of the French territory. 
The difficulty of subsisting them there, would have been extreme. By taking strong and good positions, his troops would 
have been preserved in full vigor, and the French, wasted by 
disease, tired of inaction, and stimulated by their natural impatience and impetuosity of temper, would have forced their Generals to attack, even if they had the prudence to be quiet. The 
consequence of such attack, excepting always the will of God, must have been a complete victory on his part, and then it 
would have been next to impossible for them to escape. Then 
the towns would have surrendered, believing the business to be 
over, and he might have come as far forward this autumn as 
the needful transportation of stores would permit. Next spring 
France would have found it almost impossible to subsist the 
armies needful for the defence in that part of the country, 
which is most defensible, and of consequence her enemy would 
have reached the point from which he lately retreated, without 
the smallest difficulty. 
</p><p>
The appearances are so vague and contradictory, that I can 
not pretend to tell you whether the alliance will or will not be 
preserved for the next campaign. If I were to hazard conjectures on the present state of things, it might cast suspicions 
where I have not sufficient ground, and therefore I will bury 
them in my own bosom, lest accident should put this letter in 
to improper hands. France has a strong ally in the feelings of 
those nations, who are subject to despotism, but for that very 
reason, she has a mortal enemy in every Prince. If, as is very possible, the league should hold firm till next spring, it will 
then have gained considerable auxiliaries, and I am very much 
mistaken if this nation will make as great efforts as those she is 
now making. The character of nations must be taken into 
consideration in all political questions, and that of France has 
ever been an enthusiastic inconstancy. They soon get tired 
of a thing. They adopt without examination, and reject with 
out sufficient cause. They are now agog with their republic, 
and may perhaps adopt some form of government with a 
huzza ; but that they will adopt a good form, or, having adopted, adhere to it, is what I do not believe. There is a great 
body of royalists in the country, who do not now declare them 
selves, because it would be certain death, but a favorable occasion would bring them out of their holes. 
</p><p>
The factions here are violent, and among those who administer the government there is not, I and told, that degree of character which lays hold of the esteem and respect of mankind, 
but rather the contrary. In their opponents there is a nervous 
temper, which sticks at nothing, and if I see rightly there is in 
the current of their affairs a strong eddy, or counter tide, which 
may change materially both men and things. Yet let what will 
happen, I think it hardly possible that they should blunder as 
much as the emigrants, and I am prone to believe, that in war 
and politics the folly of our adversaries constitutes our greatest force. The future prospect, therefore, is involved in mist 
and darkness. 
</p><p>
There is but one sovereign in Europe, the Empress of Russia, who is not in the scale of talents considerably below par. 
The Emperor, who it is said is consumptive and cannot live 
long, is now much influenced by Manfredi, a statesman of the 
Italian school, who takes insincerity for wisdom. The Prussian Cabinet is far from strong. Leuchesini, an able man, is 
said to be rising in influence there, but there is such a mixture 
of lust and folly in the chief, that no one man can keep things 
steady. The alliance with Vienna is disagreeable to the Prussians, and particularly to the inhabitants of Berlin, which may 
have some influence in destroying it, and his Majesty has given 
three strong proofs since his accession, that he is by no means 
nice on the subject of public faith. The invasion of Brabant 
will, I am persuaded, alarm both Britain and Holland, but whether they will confine themselves to court intrigue, or come into 
the field, is doubtful. 
</p><p>
Thus you will perceive, Sir, that nothing can be predicted 
with tolerable certainty respecting the affairs of this country, 
either internal or external, at the present moment. I am, &tc.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My last was of the twenty-seventh of September. Since 
that period, and within a few days, I have received yours of the sixteenth of June. In sunding the gazettes, it would be 
well, I think, to put them in an envelope open at each end, and 
direct them to the Consul at Havre, who should be desired to 
forward them to me by the stage. This will avoid the heavy 
postage. 
</p><p>
The unexpected events, which have taken place in this coun 
try since your letter was written, and of which you will have 
been informed before this reaches you, will show you that I 
cannot, until I receive the President's farther orders, take up 
any of the objects to which it alludes, not having indeed the 
proper powers. I apprehend also that the United States will 
wish to see a little into the establishment of the new Republic, 
before they take any decided steps in relation to it. In this 
case I may be a long lime without such orders, which is to me 
a distressing circumstance, because it involves a degree of responsibility for events, which no human being can foresee. It 
may indeed be replied, that in a position like mine, the proper 
conduct is to preserve a strict neutrality, and of course to do 
nothing ; but cases often arise in which to do nothing is taking 
a part. I need not state the many situations of that sort which 
occur. I had it in contemplation to leave Paris, and visit 
Bordeaux and Marseilles, but I found it necessary to continue 
here for the sake of such of my countrymen as were in this 
city, and who might, in the madness of the moment, have 
been exposed to danger, but certainly to inconvenience. A 
proof of which is, that the English, who remained after Lord Gower went away, found it so difficult to obtain passports, 
though possessed of those he had given, that many, after waiting for weeks in fruitless attendance, went off at all hazards 
without them. 
</p><p>
I informed you in my last, that I believed the plan for speculating on the sum appropriate d for St Domingo, was abandoned, but a further attempt was made by the Minister, who 
pressed me again on the subject, and I of course again declined, referring him to Mr Short, who in fact is alone em 
powered in that respect. What they may have since done,, I 
know not. The intercourse with Holland is much interrupted 
just now, and a letter which Mr Pinckney forwarded for me 
by Colonel Smith, from Mr Short, and which was put into the 
postoffice at Dieppe, has not yet come to hand. I suppose 
that it relates to M. de Lafayette, who is, I am told, at Wezel, 
and of course in the power of his Prussian Majesty. 
</p><p>
The gazettes will inform you of the retreat of the Prussian 
army. I have been told on good authority, that the cannonade of the twentieth of September was only to amuse ; that 
during its continuance the Duke of Brunswick made a masterly movement, by which he opened to himself the roads to 
Rheims, and to Chalons; that the French army was so 
much in his power, that he might either have driven them 
away and dissipated them, or if under every disadvantage they 
would risk an action, that he could have cut them to pieces. 
And why did he not ? To this natural question two answers 
are given. It is said, that the plan fixed for the campaign 
was, that the King of Prussia, at the head of his army, should 
form the point of a wedge, of which two columns of Austrian 
troops should form the angles. The right, under General 
Clairfayt, to penetrate the Loisons ; the left, under the Prince 
de Hohenloe, to penetrate, after masking Thionville and Metz, 
to Chalons. That by this means the magazines, sick, and 
wounded, of the three armies, would have been completely 
covered, and the police of the country been maintained by the 
emigrants, under the immediate orders of the King's brothers. 
Another body of troops was at the same time to make a powerful diversion, or to penetrate, as circumstances might permit, or direct, from the Brisgaw. 
</p><p>
You will observe, that all which depended on the Austrians, 
in the plan above supposed, completely failed, and that in con 
sequence, if the King of Prussia had advanced any farther, the 
French would have closed in upon his rear, and of course his 
sick, his wounded, and his magazines, would have been sacrificed, perhaps his retreat cut off. It is said that the three days 
consumed in treaty, were to give time to the columns in question to advance, and by their demonstrations to drive off the 
corps, which infested one of his flanks, and menaced the other r 
and to show at the same time that he had completely performed his stipulations. In effect he had surmounted the obstacles,, 
which nature had opposed to his march, had disentangled him 
self from ihe Ardennes, and was complete in force, and in view 
of the two great plains of Champagne, the one leading by 
Rheims, and the other by Chalons, to his object. 
</p><p>
It is said, that without the aid of the columns in question., 
his farther progress would have been useless, because he could 
not detach to the right and left so as to cut off the communication between this city, and the southern and western parts of 
the Empire. To this it is added, that a season of which there 
is no parallel in the memory of man, and disease beyond all 
reasonable expectation, had almost crippled the Duke's army 
before he could extricate himself from the defiles, and drive 
off the parties which were in possession of them. 
</p><p>
This is one solution of the events, which took place subsequent to the twentieth. Another is of a different nature; it is 
said that Monsieur Dumouriez, convinced that an opposition ta 
the combined forces would prove unavailing, and supposing 
that the rivalry of Austria and Prussia must prevent any cordiality of union ; being farther induced to believe, that the 
Prussian cabinet would pursue its own separate interest when 
occasion should offer, without much regard to previous stipulations, and would in fact, rather sacrifice somewhat even of its 
particular interest, than aggrandize in any degree a rival, sore 
from ancient and recent injuries ; Dumouriez, prompted and 
encouraged by these ideas, sought eagerly the occasions of 
treaty with the King of Prussia. That at length he succeeded 
so far as to show that Prince, that the present was a favorable 
moment for giving a final blow to the House of Austria, and 
that France and Prussia would find immense advantage in a 
union, by which he might take up again the business he had 
abandoned in Poland, and thereby foil the schemes of both 
Russia and Austria, That a more evident advantage, though 
not more certain, would be found in a subsidy of two hundred 
millions of livres, and that he must see the danger of the war 
in its present situation, and might thence the more easily estimate the advantage of abandoning it. 
</p><p>
These reasonings are said to have had the desired effect, 
and that a kind of treaty was entered into ; one article of 
which related to the Royal Family of this country, which is 
to be set at liberty. I have been told farther, that the Executive Council here will not confirm that part of the bargain 
which relates to the subsidy and the Royal Family, saying, 
which is true enough, that they are in this respect without 
authority. 
</p><p>
I must slightly mention another solution of the late movements, because it is possible that it may be well founded. A 
lady, I think Madame de Guisne, but certainly the daughter of 
Madame de Polignac, is said to have made an impression on 
his Majesty, who is, it seems, very susceptible of violent, 
though not of lasting affection. This young lady is said to 
have been ill treated by her mother, and others who are 
among the principal emigrants, and to have used her influence 
with the King to avenge the slights of her countrymen and 
relations. In the midst of all these different accounts, of 
which perhaps not one is true, the leaders here seem to con 
sider Prussia as weighing no longer in the scale against them. Duiaouriez is on his march to Brussels, in which he means to 
take up his winter quarters, and there is in this more of cool 
good sense than at first sight may appear. 
</p><p>
I have already communicated to you the state of things 
here, in what regards subsistence. The country, late the seat 
of war, is totally consumed. Never abundant, it is now T so 
bare that the inhabitants will be reduced to the utmost straits, 
and although the northern frontier is not yet in the same state, 
it would be not far from it before the end of January, if the 
whole of the French army, late in the centre, were stationed 
there. This army is now very numerous, and, from the want 
of discipline, consumes much more than is usually allotted to 
one of equal number. It is furthermore very sickly, and of 
course the followers must be greatly increased. If he can 
penetrate into Flanders and Brabant, he not only saves the 
provisions which would have been consumed in France, but 
he destroys so much of the resources of the enemy. If he 
can create .a revolution, which may be effected by a very 
small number of the people while supported by a victorious 
army, he obliges the Emperor to confine his efforts to a single 
side of France, namely, that defended by the Ardennes in 
part, and in part by the Rhine. And on this side; it will be 
very difficult to make any serious impression, so long as the 
French continue in their present mind. These objects justify 
some risk by M. Dumouriez ; and he is better able to calculate the extent of that risk, than any mere spectator, 
because he has long had intelligence in that country. The 
undertaking is not however without considerable difficulty. 
There are not indeed any strong towns in his way, but there 
are three strong positions, of which the first is near Mons ; the 
second still stronger on a hill about half way (to the best of 
my recollection) between Mons and Brussels ; and the third 
not far from Brussels itself. The military face of that country is, you know, understood by all military men with 
perfect exactness, having been the theatre of war for the two 
last centuries ; of course all the advantages, which it gives to 
disciplined armies, will be made use of by those who are to 
defend it. Add to this, that we approach the end of October, 
and though we are just now flattered with fine weather, it is 
not to be expected that those who go due north will meet 
with warm nights and long days in November. A failure 
therefore must be fatal to many ; but this is little thought of 
here just now, because there is no want of men. It will 
count, however, in the next season. Fortune has hitherto 
smiled on the French arms in a manner unexpected to them 
selves, and it may perhaps continue to do so. Much of this 
is in my opinion owing to the folly of their opponents, who 
seem to have fostered the determination to reduce them 
under a military despotism. The Divine justice will never, I 
hope, permit such impious plans to succeed ; and I always con 
sider Princes, and Generals, and Statesmen, as mere instruments, and generally blind instruments, in the hands of the 
Almighty to work out his ends by ways, which are for the 
most part inscrutable to us. 
</p><p>
I do not say anything about the incursions into Savoy and 
Germany, both brilliant, and the former of which bids fair to 
extend the French Republic to the foot of the Alps, because 
these things, fully detailed in the gazettes, speak for them 
selves. 
</p><p>
As to the domestic affairs here, they are by no means quiet. 
The great majority of the Convention is united in opposition to 
a few members, who are joined to some chiefs in this city, and 
meditate further revolutions. They aver that those, whom they 
call the Brissotines, had no wish to overturn the monarchy, 
but only to get the loaves and fishes for themselves and their 
friends. That the affair of the tenth of August happened not 
only without their aid, but contrary to their wish. That having 
happened, they did indeed take advantage of it to obtain the 
executive power for their particular friends, but even they would 
not consolidate the revolution by destroying its enemies ; a 
business, say they, which was effected on the second of September, and the following days, and which those who now safely enjoy the fruits of it pretend to blame. 
</p><p>
The Brissotines on the other hand contend, that they alone 
are the true friends of republican government, for which they 
have incessantly labored, ever since the second Assembly met. 
That the attachment they professed to the late constitution was 
only simulated, arid was necessary to cover their attack 
upon it ; that in their various decrees they constantly kept in 
view the advantage to be gained by obliging the King, either 
to sanction what (though agreeable to the popular wish) was 
contrary to the constitution, in which case the constitution would 
have become a dead letter, and have left the field of contest 
open between the King and the legislature, or else, if the King 
withheld his sanction, it turned the voice of the people against 
him, and left him in consequence exposed to a successful attack, 
whenever the favorable moment should present itself. That 
it was they, in short, who brought forward the plan of an army 
of twenty thousand republicans under the walls of Paris, and 
who took private and effectual measures to bring that army in 
to the field, if, as was apprehended, the King should put a veto 
on the decree. That it was owing to these measures, that the 
Bretons and Marsellois, and other Federes, were on the spot to 
execute the plans of the tenth of August, &tc. 
</p><p>
These are the outlines of the arguments made use of on 
each side to convince the public, that each is exclusively the au 
thor of a republic, which the people find themselves possessed 
of by a kind of magic, or at least a slight of hand, and which 
nevertheless they are as fond of as if it were their own offspring. 
</p><p>
To these main arguments are added a number of subordinate ones, with all the little accessories of time, place, and circumstance. The majority of the Convention, however, diffident of the people of this city, and apprehensive that they may 
take it into their heads to make another revolution, when they 
grow tired of the present state of things, have called (privately) for a guard from the different departments. This now 
forms the bone of contention. You will see in the gazettes the 
arguments pro and con. I own that I think it a false stroke in 
politics, though, as a peaceable citizen of Paris, and interested 
in the preservation of order, it is personally agreeable to me. 
On the ground of argument it is clearly a feature not republican, and prima facie implies that the Convention means to do 
things, which a majority of the capital would disapprove, and 
hence it follows again, that either the interests of the capital 
and the provinces are different, or else that the measures in 
contemplation are contrary to the inclinations of both. But it 
is not, I think, on the ground of theoretic argument, that such 
things are to be tried, but from an examination of probable 
consequences. A guard of this sort evidently draws a strong 
broad line of separation between the city and the Convention. 
It gives of course many means for operating on the people to 
those, who are opposed to the Convention. It is among the 
things to be calculated on, that the guard after it has been here 
some time should catch the spirit of the city, be that what it 
may. In such case, instead of protectors they will find enemies in their guard ; but admitting that this should not happen, 
if the guard be feeble, it will be overawed ; if strong, those who 
can influence the guard, will command the Convention, who in 
this case will only have changed masters. If any little check 
should happen on the frontiers, it will be too unpopular to keep 
a considerable body of men for parade, who might be useful 
in camp ; and as soon as they go, the people will rise at once 
to resent the insult offered to them. It seems probable, there 
fore, that this guard will be among the reasons why the Convention may leave this city, and that would give a very serious 
shock, and in many ways. It is to be noted also, that when 
they shall take up a report on the form of government, the op 
position will find vast resources in the opinions of the majority, 
let those be what they may. To these leading points, I might 
add a thousand little things, but you would be tired of such 
particularities. 
</p><p>
With respect to the present temper of the people of this 
country, I am clearly of opinion, that the great decided effective majority is now for the republic. What may be the temper and opinion six months hence, no prudent sensible man 
would, I think, take upon him to declare. Much must depend 
on the form of government, which shall be presented by the 
Convention. If vigorous, it is very problematical whether the 
departments will adopt it, unless compelled by a sense of impending exterior danger. If feeble, it is (humanly speaking) 
impossible that it can control the effervescent temper of this 
people, and that appears sufficiently by the fate of the late 
constitution. Whether they will be able to strike out that happy mean, which secures all the liberty which circumstances admit of, combined with all the energy which the same circum 
stances require ; whether they can establish an authority which 
does not exist, as a substitute (and always a dangerous substitute) for that respect, which cannot be restored after so much 
has been done to destroy it; whether, in crying down and 
even ridiculing religion, they will be able on the tottering and 
uncertain base of metaphysical philosophy to establish a solid 
edifice of morals ; these are questions which time must solve. 
I am, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Yours of the first of September reached me a few days ago. 
Accept my sincere thanks for the information it contains, 
which is precious and highly pleasing. 
</p><p>
I might comment on what you say respecting a print, which 
censures every measure of government, but you will readily 
anticipate all which I might say on that subject. I cannot 
give you such desirable intelligence respecting the state of 
things here, as I might have done if the late revolution had 
not taken place, because I find my intercourse of necessity suspended, and until I have orders respecting the new government I am bound to preserve a neutrality of conduct, so that I 
cannot as heretofore peep behind the scenes. Add to this, that 
there is at present no very certain march anywhere, each feeling himself obliged to deviate according to circumstances from 
the course which he might wish. I will attempt, however, to 
give you an abbreviation of the late events, and in my letters to Mr Jefferson, which may perhaps be communicated to 
the Senate, and at any rate from the gazettes preceding and 
subsequent to the tenth of August, you will be able to fill 
up the outlines of the sketch. 
</p><p>
The late revolution has for its remote cause that excess in 
the human temper, which drives men always to extremes, if 
not checked and controlled. Fonts pr oximate cause it has 
the vices and defects of the late constitution, and particularly 
that an executive without powers was rendered responsible for 
events, and that a legislature composed of a single chamber of 
representatives was secured by every precaution, and under 
no control except some paper maxims and popular opinion. 
That the people, or rather the populace, a thing which thank 
God is unknown in America, nattered with the idea that they 
are omnipotent, and disappointed from necessity in the golden 
prospects originally held out to them, were under no restraint, 
except such as might be imposed by magistrates of their own 
choice. It resulted inevitably, that the executive must be in 
the power of the legislative, and this last at the mercy of such 
men as could influence the mob. 
</p><p>
By reducing the royal authority below all reasonable mea 
sure, the constitution makers had created a moral impossibility, that the people should believe the King sincere in his acceptance, even if it had been possible that he should without 
regret have beheld himself reduced from the first place allotted 
to man, to a state so low as to be exposed to insult from the 
lowest. It was evident then, that the constitution could not 
last, and in the overturn three things might happen, viz. the 
establishment of despotism, the establishment of a good constitution, or the institution of a democracy. The first under an 
able and ambitious Prince was inevitable. The second was 
extremely difficult, not in itself, but because the chiefs of different parties all found themselves committed to different points 
and opinions. The last was only a natural continuation of the 
progress of men's minds, in a necessary succession of ideas 
from the bill of rights. The advocates for republican government therefore had an easy task, although both to themselves 
and others it appeared difficult. 
</p><p>
From the moment that the second Assembly met, a plan was 
formed among several of the members and others, to overturn 
the constitution, which they had just sworn to observe, and establish a republic. This arose in part from the desire of placing themselves better than they could otherwise do, and in 
part from a conviction that the system could not last, and that 
they would have no share in the administration under such a 
pure monarchy. As they had a strong hold upon the lowest 
class of people, as the aristocratic and constitutional parties 
were at open war, as these last avowed openly their wish to 
amend, in other words, to change the constitution, which at the 
same time they assumed to venerate, it was not a difficult 
matter to assault a monarch, who adhered to that form which 
he could not be supposed to approve, and whose faults became 
daily more and more apparent. 
</p><p>
Add to this, that the court was involved in a spirit of little 
paltry intrigue, unworthy of anything above the rank of foot 
men and chambermaids. Every one had his and her little project, and every little project had some abettors. Strong manly councils frightened the weak, alarmed the envious, and 
wounded the enervate minds of the lazy and luxurious. Such 
councils, therefore, if perchance any such appeared, were approved but not adopted, certainly not followed. The palace 
was always filled with people whose language, whose conduct, 
whose manner were so diametrically opposite to everything like liberty, that it was easy to persuade the people that the 
court meant to destroy the constitution, by observing strictly 
the constitution. Some persons avowed the tactics, which 
from the moment of such avowal were no longer worth 
a doit. The King, whose integrity would never listen to 
anything like the violation of his oath, had nevertheless 
the weakness to permit those, who openly avowed unconstitutional sentiments, to approach his person, and enjoy his 
intimacy. The Queen was still more imprudent. The re 
publicans (who had also their plan to destroy the constitution 
by the constitution) founded on the King's personal integrity 
their operation to destroy his reputation for integrity, and hold 
him out to the world as a traitor to the nation, which he was 
sworn to protect. 
</p><p>
They in consequence seized every occasion to pass popular 
decrees, which were unconstitutional If the King exercised 
his veto, he was accused of wishing a counter revolution. If 
he sanctioned the decree, he was so far lost with those, who 
were injured by the decree, and of course became daily more 
and more unprotected. The success of his enemies was beyond their own expectation. His palace was assaulted. He 
took refuge with the Assembly, and is now a prisoner of state 
with his family. 
</p><p>
But now the ideas of revolt, which had been fostered for his 
overthrow, are grown very troublesome to those, who have 
possessed themselves of the authority. It is not possible to 
say either to the people or to the sea, so far shalt thou go and 
no farther ; and we shall have, I think, some sharp struggles 
which will make many men repent of what they have done, 
when they find with Macbeth, that they have but taught 
bloody instructions, which return to plague the inventor.

My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received yours of the twenty- second of June, and am 
in the hourly hope to hear farther from you. I need not tell 
you that it will give me pleasure. Enclosed you will find the 
copy of a letter, which I wrote to Mr Jefferson on the 7th of 
November, <a href='/results.php?year=1791'>1791</a>. This, with some other communications at 
the same epoch, he never acknowledged. I know not why, 
but I think the paper enclosed in that letter will be agreeable 
to you, though not very amusing. 
</p><p>
It would seem that your friend Scipio is not much attached 
to Paulusj at least if I may judge from some things which I see. 
However, there is a great chasm in my newspapers, which 
breaks the thread of my conjectures, as well as of my information ; for I have little, I might almost say, none of the latter but 
from the gazettes ; of course I know what passes about two 
months after everybody else. Tell me, I pray you, how Sccevola stands affected between the parties just named. I think 
he never had a very high opinion of the first mentioned, but he 
was attached to Tarquin immeasurably, and that, with some 
local circumstances, may have formed a stronger chain than I 
should otherwise suppose. 
</p><p>
You will have seen that the late constitution of this country 
has overset ; a natural accident to a thing, which was all sail and 
no ballast. I desire much, very much, to know the state of 
opinions with you on that subject. Some gentlemen, who con 
sidered it as the acme of human wisdom, must, I suppose, find 
out causes which persons on the spot never dreamt of. But 
in seeking or inventing these causes, what will be their opinion 
of present powers, what the conduct they wish to pursue ? 
These are to me important questions. Brutus will doubtless 
triumph, but I wish to feel the pulse of opinion with you, or 
rather to know beforehand how it is like to beat. There are 
pros and cons, whose action I cannot estimate. The flight of 
<a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Monsieur De Lafayette</a>, the murder of the Duke de laRochefoucault and others, with many similar circumstances, have, I 
know, affected the ideas of some. But what will be the repub 
lican sense as to the new republic ? Will it be taken for grant 
ed, that Louis the Sixteenth was guilty of all possible crimes, 
and particularly of the enormous one of not suffering his throat 
to be cut, which was certainly a nefarious plot against the peo 
ple, and a manifest violation of the bill of rights ? Paulus, who 
is no enemy to Kings, will not believe that-they are all tigers ; 
but I am not certain that, if he were here, he would not con 
sider them as monkeys. 
</p><p>
However, we are done with them in France, at least for the 
present. There are two parties here. The one consists of 
about half a dozen, and the other of fifteen or twenty, who are 
at dagger's drawing. Each claims the merit of having made 
the young republic. My public letters and the gazettes will 
bring you acquainted with things here, as fully as I can in any 
way communicate them. It is not worth while to detail the 
characters of those now on the stage, because they must soon 
give place to others. Adieu.

My Dear Carmichael, 
</p><p>
I have received your letters of the twenty-ninth of August, 
and fifteenth of October. I feel perfectly your situation and 
have frequently lamented that you had not powers equal to 
the position in which you are placed. It would seem that 
we know not yet the value of the moment, and I fear that we 
shall find to our cost that post est opportunitas calva. When 
Mr Short was here, he talked of going to Madrid, but, from 
what cause I know not, appeared to me indecisive, and apprehensive, to a degree which was astonishing. Whether this 
arises from nature, or from long habits of ease in this city, I know not. 
</p><p>
I shall forward by Colonel Smith to Mr Pinckney, the intelligence you sent me for him. I shall tell him at the same 
time that, in my opinion, the principal object in contemplation 
is France, and that the United States are only affected by a 
side wind. However, that is of little importance, since a side 
wind may do as much mischief to our ship as any other. 
</p><p>
As to the state of things here, I can give you no very satis 
factory or flattering accounts. True it is that the French 
arms are crowned with great success. Towns fall before them 
without a blow, and the declaration of rights produces an effect equal at least to the trumpets of Joshua ; but as on the 
one hand [ never questioned the force of France if united, and 
her natural enthusiasm warmed by the ardor of newborn freedom, so on the other I was always apprehensive, that they 
would be deficient in that cool reflection, which appears needful to consolidate a free government. We read in the history 
of man, as it is developed in the great book of nature, that empires do by no means depend on their success in arms, but on their 
civil, religious, and political constitutions, and that in the framing 
of these it is a useless question what kinds are best in them 
selves. The more so, as good and bad here below, but especially in that which we now contemplate, are mere relative 
terms. The true object of a great statesman is to give to any 
particular nation the kind of laws, which is suitable to them, 
and the best constitution which they are capable of. Now 
by as much as it is an easy thing, and within the compass of 
every schoolboy, to deal in generals and abstractions, pursuing 
demonstrations which in moral subjects are frequently least 
exact when they appear to be most evident, by so much is it 
of high and almost insurmountable difficulty, to descend into 
the nice estimates of manners, habits, and sentiments, and, 
amidst the discord of loud and contradictory passions and interests, to discover the means of establishing a harmonious 
system, where each part has the needful relation to every other, 
and to the great whole. &gt; 
</p><p>
These observations are, I know, familiar to you, and to every other sensible man, who has had much experience in hu 
man affairs ; but they are heathen Greek, or, if you will, flat 
nonsense, when addressed to those new fledged statesmen, who 
are always positive and peremptory in proportion to their ignorance of politics. But even if we should suppose, that by 
miracle the men of a day should be imbued with the important truths, which it is necessary to the peace and happiness of 
society that its rulers should be acquainted with, still we are a 
great, and I might say, an immense distance from the object. 
Before the people will assent to the form of government, 
which in hypothesis shall be supposed the most fitting for 
them, they must be convinced of the fitness. No easy task, 
believe me ; even if man were a reasonable creature, but he 
is not. He is a creature of sense, and governed invariably by 
his feelings. Now you can easily make him feel, that in point 
of right he is equal to every other man. Vanity may even 
whisper to him that he is so in point of talent, and if vanity wedb remiss, the prompter flattery is at hand. But the more 
he feels his equality of rights and talents, the more must he 
feel his inequality in point of possessions. Where these are 
wanting, he has rights which he cannot exercise, talents which 
he cannot employ, desires which he cannot gratify, and, in 
consequence, resentments which he cannot allay. 
</p><p>
Now the severe law of property is, that in any well settled 
country a few must soon possess all, and the majority, the 
great majority, nothing. Between that economy, which constitutes the tyranny of the rich, and that misery which en 
slaves the poor, let the form of government be what it may, 
there is a constant struggle which forms great men, and great 
men are generally ambitious men. Their equals in property 
are as much enslaved by their pleasures, as the poorer kinds, 
can possibly be by their wants. In such a state of things, 
where the constitution is not balanced in its structure, and 
supported by strong props of private interest, it must be 
overturned. I quit these investigations to tell you, that all 
here is in a state of uncertainty. Time will disclose the 
events with which he is charged in their due season. Some 
of them I think will be of sable hue. I am, &LC.

My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received yours of the ninth, and will show to the 
bearer, Mr Scott, every attention which my time and affairs 
will permit. 
</p><p>
The Swedish Minister, whom you speak of, is not yet arrived, neither do I expect one. The former Ambassador did 
indeed announce to his family, the intention to come hither 
in his way to Switzerland, in order to settle some private affairs. An important negotiation would not be committed to 
him, I think. , f ; , 
</p><p>
Success, as you will see, continues to crown the French 
arms, but it is not our trade to judge from success. We must 
observe the Civil, Moral, Religious and Political Institutions. 
These have a steady and lasting effect, and these only. You 
will soon learn that the patriots, hitherto adored, were but little worthy of the incense they received. The enemies of 
those, who now reign, treat them as they did their predecessors, and as their successors will be treated. 
</p><p>
Since I have been in this country, I have seen the worship 
of many idols, and but little of the true God. I have seen 
many of those idols broken, and some of them beaten to dust. 
I have seen the late constitution, in one short year, admired as 
a stupendous monument of human wisdom, and ridiculed as an 
egregious production of folly and vice. I wish much, very 
much, the happiness of this inconstant people. I love them, I 
feel grateful for their efforts in our cause, and I consider the 
establishment of a good constitution here as the principal 
means, under Divine Providence, of extending the blessings of 
freedom to the many millions of my fellow men, who groan in 
bondage on the continent of Europe. But I do not greatly 
indulge the flattering illusions of hope, because I do not yet 
perceive that reformation of morals, without which liberty is 
but an empty sound. I have the honor to be, &c.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received your favors of the twelfth of July, and fifteenth of October. The last reached me yesterday, by express from Bordeaux. I am astonished to find, that so late as the 
middle of October you had received but one of my letters. I 
had taken every precaution against miscarriages, but there is 
no answering for the negligence of those one is obliged to em 
ploy in the posts. 
</p><p>
When I mentioned supplies to St Domingo, I certainly 
meant that such supplies should be purchased by French 
agents in the United States, and that the money should be advanced by us in diminution of our debt, upon such terms as 
that the United States should not lose in the mode of payment, 
but the contrary, besides the advantage of expending such 
large sums in the purchase of objects, the growth, produce, and 
manufacture of our country, and of its industrious inhabitants. 
As to specific supplies, I had declared in pointed terms, that 
the American government would by no means enter into stipulations of any kind, with relation thereto. I am happy to find 
that, on this occasion, my sentiments have so fully coincided 
with yours. 
</p><p>
It gives meal so great relief to be informed, that until further 
orders the payments are suspended. You will have seen that 
on this point I have been hard run, and I do assure you that 
if fear, or interest, would have induced me to swerve from the 
line of duty, there were not wanting sufficient motives. But 
it is not needful to relate such particulars, and you may rely 
that I shall not communicate your present instruction respecting our debt, unless I shall be of opinion that it will become 
serviceable to the honor or interest of the United States. 
</p><p>
I see with concern that the Indian war is like to continue. 
This war prevents the investments of European money in the 
purchase of our waste lands, and I have already expressed to 
you my conviction, that this species of investiture would be as 
salutary, as the engrossing of our domestic debt is pernicious. 
The distressed state of things here induces many to turn their 
attention towards us, and consequently occasions numerous applications to me. I endeavor, as far as propriety will admit, to 
lead people to a preference of American lands, but I am sorry 
to observe that the disposition to invest in our funds is predominant, and that we shall thereby become tributary to those who 
obtain, below its value, a share of those funds. I think it my 
duty to mention this to you, to the end that if any measures 
can be devised to enhance the value with you, and thereby 
lessen the negotiations, or at least obtain thereon the competent value, such measures may be adopted. 
</p><p>
Although I step very much out of my sphere for the purpose, 
I feel myself bound also to mention, respecting this Indian war, 
some ideas which have formerly suggested themselves to me, 
and which the circumstances of the present moment seem to 
favor in a peculiar manner. I cannot but think, that it would 
be well to build a fleet on Lake Erie, having for that purpose 
established a strong post at Presque Isle, which is, I believe, the 
only good harbor on the south side-of that Lake, and to send 
also a Flotille from Oswego, with flour and salt provisions, to 
be transported by way of Niagara. As to this last measure, 
if not obstructed by the British, it would considerably lessen 
the expense, and if opposed, would terminate that situation of 
demi-hostility, which has but too much existed with them. If 
a body of fifteen hundred men were sent with all the needful 
stores by water, in good vessels, they might establish a strong 
post near the Miami Towns, and carry on from thence a war of 
devastation, which would force the savages to abandon the country, and that is, I believe, the only effectual means of obtaining 
peace with them. 
</p><p>
You will find enclosed herewith my letters of the twenty-seventh of September, and twenty-third of October. I have had no good opportunity since the latter of those dates. If, 
indeed, America had been at the distance of only fifty leagues, I should have given you every two or three days the state of 
men and things ; but placed as we are, both morally and physically in respect to this country, I should only have wearied 
you by the little uninteresting histories of persons and projects, 
whose existence will soon be consigned to an endless oblivion. 
It has however appeared to me important to obtain, as nearly as 
may be, a view of the greater events which may probably 
arise, because the conduct of the United States will, I presume, be squared rather to that state of things, which you may 
conceive likely to be established, than to the fluctuating chances of an hour which passes away. 
</p><p>
I shall resume, then, my account of things where I last left 
it, viz. in the projected invasion of Flanders ; and first, it may 
be proper to cast an eye on the structure and consistence of 
the French armies. The leading feature here is an artillery, 
which is, beyond all controversy, the best in Europe, and likely to continue so from two causes. First, that the Frenchman 
is by nature a better artillerist than almost any other man, it 
being in his temper, and, and if I may say so, in his blood 
and marrow to act suddenly and without deliberation. Hence 
he becomes very dexterous in those things, which are to be per 
formed at a single motion, and by a single glance, but rarely 
acquires a knowledge of any business which requires constant, 
close, and undissipaied attention. Secondly, the excellence 
of the French artillery depends upon the great care and culture of their natural disposition. The able men, who have formerly been at the head of their military affairs, had the merit 
of knowing the character they had to do with, and therefore 
(quitting what appeared unattainable in the military art) sought 
perfection there, where Frenchmen could find it. They des 
paired of forming solid columns of infantry, moving with the 
exact precision of German discipline. It happens, therefore, 
that the present French army differs less from what the French 
armies have been heretofore, than would easily have been sup 
posed. The same enthusiasm of enterprise, the same con 
tempt of danger, the same impetuosity of valor, and the same 
impatience of control, still mark the nation which inhabits the 
country that was once ancient Gaul. 
</p><p>
They have, as heretofore, overrun Flanders, made impression on Germany, and occupied Savoy. Dumouriez, in his 
Flemish expedition, combined the arts of a politician with the 
bravery of an experienced soldier. You know that the inhabitants of the Low Countries were indisposed to the domination 
of the House of Austria, particularly since the attempts of Joseph the Second to weaken the influence of the priesthood. 
During the latter part of his reign, there had sprung up three 
parties, viz. the Bigots, who wanted a kind of theocracy, to be 
exercised by the priesthood ; The Nobility and substantial 
burghers^ who wished to established a free and well organized 
constitution ; and the French party, or those who were desirous 
of levelling the nobles; and above all, the church, which possesses as you know the greatest part of the Flemish territory. 
</p><p>
On the return of imperial authority, after the revolt under 
Vandernoot and Van Eupen, the second party above mentioned, naturally enough fell in with the government, as they had 
already experienced no little tyranny from the priests, and saw 
much danger in the prevalence of French ideas. They stick 
led however, for a confirmation of ancient chartered rights, 
and the disputes on that chapter were still open. They hoped 
that the war, whose avowed object on the part of France was 
to drive out the House of Austria, would induce the Emperor 
to cede the points in controversy. The cabinet of Vienna, on 
the other hand, believing in a certain victory over the French 
government, rather wished, than feared revolt ; and when the 
face of affairs had materially changed, it was too late to retract, 
since the concession of weakness, neither conciliates affection 
nor commands respect. 
</p><p>
The agents of the different parties, who had preserved a connexion more or less direct with Dumouriez, were urgent with 
him to go into Flanders, as soon as the Prussian army began to 
retreat, and he adroitly flattered each with the hope of favoring 
its particular views. This was done at the expense of a little 
lying, which does not cost him much. By these means the 
crafty priests were as completely duped as their adversaries, 
and more so. 
</p><p>
After the battle of Jemappe when he had taken possession 
of Mons, he took care to proscribe the adherents to the Emperor, which left but two parties to deal with ; and although the ecclesiatics began to perceive their danger, it was now too late, 
and they were obliged to pretend an attachment which they 
did not feel, and which served his temporary purpose as effectually as if it had been sincere. But he had too much sense 
not to know, that measures hostile to the real interests of the 
country could only be carried into effect by those, who have 
no common interest with the country, the populace of the large 
towns, who, having some chance to gain by turning all things 
topsy turvy, and who being happily secure against the possibility of loss because they have nothing to lose, are always the 
ready instruments of mischief to those, who can bring themselves. 
to use them for destructive purposes. He, therefore, published 
a proclamation, which may in a few words be transmitted into an 
order to be free, according to his ideas of freedom, on pain of 
military execution. As a military man, he had almost insured 
success by advancing with three armies, the last of which was 
equal to all the force the enemy could muster, and the centre, 
which he commanded, was double that spread over the different parts of that level country. At the affair of Jemappe, he 
commanded eighty-six thousand men, although they were not 
all in action, because eighty thousand cannot act together on 
only two sides of eighteen thousand. By the bye, this affair, 
notwithstanding the accounts published, was decided by the 
immense train of heavy artillery which the French employed, 
and the proof is in the retreat of the Austrians, who carried off 
their cannon, a thing impossible, had the lines been taken, as 
was said, by assault ; but the truth is, that the assault was given after the retreat was begun, and the Hungarian Grenadiers, who brought up the rear, were in course cut to pieces. 
</p><p>
Dumouriez, as soon as he had got fairly in possession of 
Brussels, began to develope his particular plans. It was 
never his intention to continue, if he could avoid it, in the 
capacity of a servile agent to the Executive Council ; but they 
also were aware of his views ; hence the course of his successes naturally tended to a breach between them. There 
were additional reasons on each side, both of safety and advantage, too tedious to enumerate, because it is sufficient to state 
those sentiments which may govern events, without developing 
all the sources from which they originate. The Council gave 
orders for opening the Scheldt, with design to captivate by that 
measure, the attention of the people of Brabant, and, lessening 
his influence, increase their own. He struggled against that 
measure but in vain. Having, however, made the step, he 
formed the farther plan of attacking the Dutch, who were by 
no means prepared to receive him ; and the party in that 
country, which calls itself Patriotic, and which others would be 
very apt to term Aristocratic, immediately opened an intelligence with him. 
</p><p>
The governing powers here, in the midst of all these plans, 
(and intoxicated by success, perhaps,) declared themselves 
the allies of all those, who would revolt against established 
authority, and the enemies of all those who would not revolt. 
They determined that everybody should be free, French fash 
ion, and should pay the expense which might attend the making of them free. This last address to the purse was not, 
perhaps, well calculated for the taste either of the Hollanders 
or Flemings ; but the latter must for the present submit to 
whatever impositions may be laid on them, being in the power of this country. 
</p><p>
Shortly after the plan was laid for invading Holland, of 
which the above mentioned decree was a partial execution, 
two circumstances arose which changed the measures of the 
Council. The French army began to lessen very much ; but 
this is a subject which I must treat separately ; and therefore 
barely mention it in this place. The other circumstance was, 
that the ministers and agents they had employed in London 
assured them, that, although the declaration respecting the 
Scheldt had occasioned much alarm, and irritated at the same 
time the British cabinet, yet they might avoid hostilities, if 
they did not actually invade the Dutch territory. They, in 
consequence, gave orders to Dumouriez to abandon his design 
upon the Netherlands, and turn his arms to another quarter. 
These he refused to obey ; but being reiterated, and things here 
being a little different from what he hoped, he has within 
these few days submitted ; but I shall come to this part of the 
history presently ; and here I will conclude as to Holland, by 
adding that the agents of the patriotic party press the government hard to attack their native country immediately, but are 
told that the time is not favorable, that they will certainly 
march that way by and bye, but that at present they have not 
sufficient force nor supplies. 
</p><p>
You will observe, that <a href="/results.php?tla=leb" rel="met colleague">M. Lebrun</a> declares to the Assembly, that they are guiltless of any design against Holland, and 
that England cannot justly complain on that score. I presume, however, that the British ministry are exactly informed 
of the contrary ; but be that as it may, you may rely on what 
I relate to you. In respect to the Flemish, before I leave 
them, I must tell you that their ancient hatred to the French is 
all revived, and is, if possible, more violent than ever. Several reasons for this appear from what I have already said ; but 
there is one cause, affecting equally all the neighbors of 
France, and which it may be well in this place to mention, ft 
would seem, at first sight, somewhat strange, that the people in 
the world, the most amiable at home, should be the most disagreeable abroad ; but this is strictly true. The morals, or 
rather the want of morals, in this country, places every one at 
his ease. He may be virtuous if he pleases, but there is no 
necessity either to be, or to appear so, consequently, both good 
men, and bad men, can enjoy the society of Paris; but when 
the French go abroad, they desire to introduce among other 
people the same free and easy principles, which do by no 
means suit the taste of those, who consider a chaste and orderly deportment essential to the peace and happiness of civil society. 
</p><p>
The open contempt of religion, also, cannot but be offensive 
to all sober minded men ; add to this, a style of conversation, which runs on the insulting comparison between their own 
usages, and those of the people with whom they live. In this 
they naturally, and I believe justly, give a preference to their 
own, but this preference becomes irksome to others, especially, if, in the expression of it, there should be mingled some little contempt, which is not uncommon. The French emigrants had wearied out all those countries, which for two years 
past they have infested, and had accumulated on their own 
heads the antipathies, which had been previously extended to 
all their countrymen. Nay, from this hatred to them sprang 
up a kind of left-handed love for the Jacobins, it being natural 
to like those who war on the persons whom we dislike. But 
no sooner do the French armies enter into a country, than the 
scene changes. The emigrants do not indeed find favor, but 
the original sentiments of the people return in regard to the 
French nation. These sentiments are universally unfavorable, 
as I observed (with sorrow and surprise) in a journey I made 
two years ago through Flanders, and a part of Germany, viz. 
that which is the seat of the war. 
</p><p>
The irruption into Germany, under Custine, was attended 
with the same rapid success as that of Dumouriez, into the 
Low Countries. Mayence was surrendered, rather to the Assignats, than to the arms of France, it is believed. Frankfort 
naturally fell, as being a neutral city. Contributions were 
raised in both, and you will see with astonishment, that the 
Deputies sent from Frankfort, to solicit the remitment of her 
contribution, were made prisoners here, when their city was 
retaken by the Prussian and Hessian forces. This recapture 
was attended with strong circumstances to show that hatred of 
the French, which I have above mentioned. Custine's ad 
vance into Germany was certainly hazarded beyond the rules 
of prudence, and it will be well if he escapes with no further 
loss, than what he has already suffered. His present situation 
is certainly critical, since the Council have thought proper to 
order on Dumouriez to his relief. And here, by the way, it 
will be well to remind you, that the distance from Valenciennes to Liege is about one half the distance from Liege to 
Mayence, and that the former is a level, open country, the latter a country of defiles, at least for a considerable part of the 
distance. Add to this, the season, which is already severe in 
that quarter, and must, in all human probability, become more 
so every day, and you will easily see why Dumouriez in 
agreeing, at last, to obey his orders, has declared that he will 
by no means be responsible for the success. You will recollect, also, the diminution of the French armies, which it is 
proper now to state more particularly. 
</p><p>
The alarm spread through France after the affair of the 
tenth of August ; the call to defend their country, a call which 
must ever be efficacious so long as men are endued with the 
feelings of men ; the boiling spirit of the nation, and the 
strenuous exertions of those against whom the Duke of Brunswick had denounced an inexpiable war, had called into 
the field six hundred thousand men. Presently, France renewed the appearance of a nation of warriors, overflowing on 
every side, and bearing down with an irresistible impetuosity every obstacle. Her enemies, who had never brought against 
her, in the whole, above one hundred and fifty thousand, and who were much reduced by sickness and fatigue, found them 
selves obliged to retire, and had no resource but to impede a progress which they could not prevent. This government, on 
the other hand, sensible that the next campaign would press them hard, and feeling, in spite of delusive appearances, that 
a paper system of finance must at length sink under the enormous weight of their expenses, thought it wise to push to the 
utmost their successes, and were little solicitous about a loss of men, which they could supply more easily than their enemies. 
</p><p>
But there is, to the physical powers of man, a narrower 
bound than to his moral conceptions. Excessive fatigue, want 
of necessaries, and bad accommodations, have carried many to 
the grave. Not a few have fallen in action. At the present 
moment, there are in the different military hospitals seventy-five thousand sick beds, and at Liege their hospital stores are 
so greatly deficient, that the inhabitants have been compelled 
to furnish all their spare beds and mattrasses, notwithstanding 
which, many of the sick soldiers lie on the straw. The ex 
tent of country which they occupy, and the projected changes 
in government, contrary to the wish of the majority of the 
people, render it necessary to keep up garrisons, beyond those 
which are placed on the communications. 
</p><p>
A great proportion of the volunteers, who had turned out 
at first to defend their country, who had afterwards been 
prompted by a national spirit and temper to march into the 
neighboring states, and who, from the same spirit and temper, 
pursued as long as their limbs would support them, sinking at 
last under fatigue, have stopped, and from that moment it is 
in their nature to return, such of them at least as are able ; of 
consequence, the troops in condition to act are, comparatively 
speaking, but a handful, although still numerous. 
</p><p>
You will see by the gazettes, that the armies of France have 
frequently been straitened for subsistence, and surely this is 
not to be wondered at. Lorraine is so completely eaten up, 
that, as I am credibly informed, above one hundred thousand 
of its inhabitants had left it before the present month, for want 
of food. A contagious dysentery had swept off numbers in 
that quarter. You know the country from Aix La Chapelle 
to Coblentz, and that having been the theatre of war almost 
since the first of August, it will be impossible to find anything 
in it, and that confined by the Ardennes on one side, and the 
Rhine on the other, nothing can be brought to it but by a 
land transportation of at least fifty leagues. I fear that even, 
had Dumouriez quartered his troops as he intended in and 
about Liege, it would have been extremely difficult to have 
collected magazines, especially for his cavalry. What must it 
be, when he gets to the neighborhood of Bonn. Beurnonville 
is, you will see, pushing with an army of thirty thousand men 
towards Coblentz, by the way of Treves. A rugged country 
of fastnesses, defended by the winter, and fifteen thousand 
Austrian troops are opposed to him. Consequently his progress 
is slow, and by and bye his convoys will be exposed to parties 
from the garrison of Luxembourg. Thus you see, Sir, that 
France is warring at present against nature herself, as it were, 
and sanguine men hope for success. If it be obtained, the 
enemy will open the next campaign under manifest disadvantages. But we must not yet enter into that consideration. 
</p><p>
You will have seen that the Jacobin club is as much at war 
with the present government, as it was with the preceding. 
Victory or death, is the word with both parties. Hitherto the 
majority of the Convention have had rather the advantage, al 
though they frequently decree what they do not wish. The 
ministers, possessing vastly more patronage than any monarch 
since Louis the Fourteenth, secured by that means the influence of the majority, their friends and the Jacobins, who, 
backed by the Parisian populace, have been several times 
within an inch of ruin. Luckily for them, their adversaries 
are many of them timid, while the Jacobin leaders are daring 
and determined. 
</p><p>
It is now some time since the Jacobins despatched BonneCarrere to make overtures to Dumouriez, whose quarrel with 
the Council was then just breaking out. It was then understood, 
that if Dumouriez threw up his commission in disgust, his 
army would presently retreat back to Valenciennes ; and this 
it was supposed would justify a coup de main in this city, and 
extend the influence of it through all France, Ever since 
this embassy of Bonne-Carrere, things have been ripening fast 
on both sides. At present there is a schism in the ministry, 
and Pache, the Minister of War, throws his weight into the 
scale of opposition. Dumouriez has, I am told, acceded, 
notwithstanding the adulations and concessions of the other 
party, and the coalition now nearly balance their opponents. 
</p><p>
A late circumstance brought forward a show of forces, and 
though it is rather anticipating a different subject, I must state 
it here. The Brissotines, finding themselves hard pushed 
towards the killing of the King, and apprehensive, not without reason, that this might be a signal for their own destruction, determined on a measure not a little hazardous, but decisive. This was the expulsion of the Bourbons, a blow 
originally levelled at the Duke of Orleans. The motion was 
carried, but the Convention have been obliged to suspend the 
decree, and that is, I think, equivalent to a repeal. The sus 
pension evidently was pronounced under the influence of the 
Tribunes. Many members have talked of leaving Paris, but 
the same fear, which controls them while in this city, will pre 
vent them from quitting it. At least, such is my opinion. 
</p><p>
I come now to the trial of the King, and the circumstances 
connected with it. To a person less intimately acquainted 
than you are with the history of human affairs, it would seem 
strange that the mildest monarch who ever filled the French 
throne, one who is precipitated from it precisely because he 
would not adopt the harsh measures of his predecessors, a 
man whom none could charge with a criminal or cruel act, 
should be prosecuted as one of the most nefarious tyrants, that 
ever disgraced the annals of human nature. That he, Louis 
the Sixteenth, should be prosecuted even to death. Yet such 
is the fact. I think it highly probable that he may suffer, and 
that for the following causes. The majority of the Assembly 
found it necessary to raise, against this unhappy Prince, the 
national odium, in order to justify the dethroning him (which, 
after what he had suffered, appeared to be necessary even to 
their safety) and to induce the ready adoption of a republican 
form of Government. Being in possession of his papers, and 
those of his servants, it was easy, if they would permit them 
selves to extract, to comment, to suppress, and to mutilate, 
it was very easy to create such opinions as they might think 
proper. The rage which has been excited was terrible ; and, 
although it begins to subside, the Convention are still in great 
straits ; fearing to acquit, fearing to condemn, and yet urged 
to destroy their captive Monarch. 
</p><p>
The violent party are clamorous against him, for reasons 
which I will presently state. The Monarchic and Aristocratic 
parties wish his death, in the belief that such catastrophe would 
shock the national feelings, awaken their hereditary attachments, and turn into the channels of loyalty the impetuous 
tide of opinion. Thus, he has become the common object of 
hatred to all parties, because he has never been the decided 
patron of any one. If he is saved, it will be by the justice of 
his cause, which will have some little effect, and by the pity 
which is universally felt, though none dare express it openly, 
for the very harsh treatment which he has endured. 
</p><p>
I come now to the motives of the violent party. You will 
see that Louvet, whose pamphlet, with many others, I send 
you, has charged on this party the design to restore royalty in 
the person of the Duke of Orleans. This man's character and 
conduct give but too much room to suspect him of criminal 
intentions. In general, I doubt the public virtue of a profligate, 
and cannot help suspecting appearances put on by such per 
sons. I have besides many particular circumstances, which 
lead me to believe that he has, from the beginning, played a 
deep and doubtful game ; but I believe also, that on the present 
occasion, as on some preceding, he is the dupe. Shortly after 
the tenth of August, I had information on which you may rely, 
that the plan of Danton was to obtain the resignation of the 
King, and get himself appointed chief of a council of regency, 
composed of his creatures, during the minority of the Dauphin. This idea has never, I believe, been wholly abandoned. 
The Cordeliers, (or privy council, which directs the Jacobin 
movements,) know well the danger of intervening the order of 
succession. They know how to appreciate the fluctuating opinions of their countrymen, and though they are very willing to 
employ the Duke of Orleans in their work, I am much mistaken, if they will consent to elevate him to the throne. So that, 
for his share of the guilt, he may probably be rewarded with 
the shame of it, and the mortifying reflection that after all the 
conflicts of his political warfare, he has gained no victory but 
over his own conscience. 
</p><p>
It is worthy of remark, that, although the Convention has 
been now near four months in session, no plan of a constitution 
is yet produced. Nevertheless, the special authority commit 
ted to them by the people, and the only authority, perhaps, 
which cannot be contested, was to prepare such a plan. 
</p><p>
I shall now, Sir, make a few reflections on the state of Foreign powers. The adoption of Savoy, as an additional department, forms one ground on which the adversaries of this country contend, that their protestations against conquest were only 
delusive. But the declaration, that they would erect the standard of liberty everywhere, forms the great cause with some, 
and pretext with others, for endeavoring to crush the Republic. 
</p><p>
On" the conduct likely to be pursued by Great Britain, al 
though that of Holland stands in close connexion, I shall not 
permit myself to hazard much conjecture, because Mr Pinckney will, I am persuaded, keep you fully informed, and be 
cause the accounts which Mr Short has given you will throw 
light on the same subject. I have already troubled you with 
some ideas respecting the interior state of Great Britain, and I 
add here my opinion, that sooner or later they must go into 
the war. Mr Hammond's manoeuvres will give you some good 
clue, I think, and perhaps hostile decisions at St James's may 
produce pacific dispositions among the Indian tribes. I am 
sure I need not add that it would be well to make the Indians, 
as the price of peace, declare who set them on. Perhaps in 
resentment of that conduct which may be pursued, they may 
take it in their heads to make Mr Simcoe a visit. 
</p><p>
The Elector of Hanover, as member of the German Empire, must come into the field ; and from inclination and interest he will do so, I think, fully. The contingent of Saxony 
will be sent forward with speed, and notwithstanding the debauched temper of the Elector of Bavaria, as his dominions in 
the Palatinate are exposed, as well as his Dutchy of Juliers, 
he must exert himself. A strong squadron of British men of 
war would rouse all Italy. And without them, the French 
arms may make considerable progress in that fertile, feeble 
country. 
As to Spain, I think the court is too corrupt, and too profligate, to make any considerable efforts. Bankrupt, almost, in full 
peace, with the mines of Mexico and Peru at their disposal, 
what would a war produce ? The chances are, that France 
will make an inroad, rather than suffer one in that quarter. 
Russia menaces, but the state of her finances, and the great distance, must make her efforts fall short of her wishes. Every 
art is used on each side to influence the Turk, and I own to 
you, that I rather apprehend that England and the Imperial 
Courts combined will prove successful, especially as Monsieur 
de Choiseul Gouffier is now openly active there on the part of 
the emigrant Princes. Should his Highness interfere, he will 
draw after him all the Barbary powers ; and the want of the 
grain usually drawn from them, will not be the least evil that 
will thereby fall upon the Provinces bordering on the Mediterranean sea. 
</p><p>
Austria and Prussia are making their utmost efforts, and the 
Prince of Hesse, who (strange as it may seem) is adored by his 
subjects, will second those efforts to the utmost of his ability. 
</p><p>
Such, my dear Sir, is the foreign storm lowering over this 
country, in which you will see, that my predictions respecting 
corn, have been hitherto exactly verified. How they are to obtain supplies from abroad, in the face of the maritime powers, I 
own myself at a loss to conjecture. It is nevertheless in this 
awful moment, and immediately after expediting the orders 
to recruit their army to six hundred thousand effectives, in order to sustain the land war, that they affect to wish Britain 
would declare against them, and actually menace, as you see, 
the government with an appeal to the nation. There are 
cases in which events must decide on the quality of actions, 
which are bold or rash, according to the success. 
</p><p>
The circumstances of a war with Britain becomes important to us in more cases than one. The question respecting 
the guarantee of American possessions may perhaps be agitated, especially if France should attempt to defend her islands. 
There will doubtless be many in the United States, who will 
contend that the treaty made with the King is at least suspended, if not abrogated, by the abrogation of his office and authority. Without entering into the numerous arguments on this subject, some of them forcible, and all of them plausible, I will only pray your indulgence while I express my wish that all our 
treaties, however onerous, may be strictly fulfilled according 
to their true intent and meaning. The honest nation is that, 
which, like the honest man, 
</p><p>
Hath to its plighted faith and vow forever firmly stood, 
</p><p>
And though it promise to its loss, yet makes that promise good. 
</p><p>
I feel, nevertheless, the full force of your observation, 
that until the nation shall have adopted some regular form of 
government, we may not know in what manner, or to what 
person, our obligations are to be acquitted. 
</p><p>

My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I wrote to you on the twenty- fourth of October, and have 
not since received any of your letters. In that I acknowledged yours of the 22d of June. You will have seen from the 
public prints the wonderful success of the French arms, arising from the following causes. 1. That the enemy, deceived 
by the emigrants, counted too lightly on the opposition he was 
to meet with. 2. That from like misinformation, instead of 
attacking on the northern frontier, backed by the resources of 
Flanders, and those which the ocean would supply, they came 
across the Ardennes to that part of Champaign, nicknamed 
the lousy, from its barrenness and misery. 3. That in this expedition, where the difficulty of the roads, transportation and 
communication was the greatest they expected, it so happened 
that the season, usually dry and fair, (when those bad roads 
are at the best) was one continued rain for two months, so that 
at length they were nearly stuck fast, and had as much as they 
could do to drag back their cannon, &c. through the mud. 
Lastly, that France brought into the field, and has kept up until very lately, the immense number of six hundred thousand 
troops. This has been done at an average expense of about 
five millions sterling per month beyond their resources, and 
yet they have ordered a like army for the next campaign, and 
talk boldly of meeting Great Britain also upon her element. 
What say you to that, Monsieur le Financier? But I will tell 
you in your ear, that in spite of that blustering, they will do 
much to avoid a war with Great Britain, if the people will let 
them, but the truth is, that the populace of Paris influence in 
a great degree the public councils. I think they will have 
quite as many men as they can maintain ; but what that may 
amount to is hard to determine. 
</p><p>
The ministers here are most extraordinary people. They 
make nothing of difficulties, as you shall judge by a single trait 
of M. Pache, the minister at War. He had sent Beurnonville 
to occupy the Moselle river down to Coblentz, taking Treves 
and other places in his way. Now this way lies through a very difficult mountainous country, in which the snow is very 
deep, therefore Beurnonville, having got a little neck of land 
between the Saar and the Moselle, puts his troops into winter 
quarters, pleading their nakedness as an excuse. The minister has sent him a brace of commissioners, who have power 
to impress in the neighborhood whatever may be needful for 
the troops, and then (their wants supplied) summon him to 
obey his orders. T have given to Mr Jefferson a pretty full 
account of the state of things, so that if you see that account, 
which I take it is of course, you may measure by the standard 
now given you all other affairs. 
</p><p>
If I may venture to judge from appearances, there is now in the wind a storm not unlike that of the second of September, 
Whether it will burst or blow over, it is impossible to determine. 
</p><p>
It has occurred to me, that I never yet assigned a reason 
why the completion of payment of six million livres, which at 
Mr Short's request I had stipulated for with the government 
lately abolished, appeared to me desirable. In effect, I left 
this as I do many other things to the sense of the gentle reader, but as readers are sometimes ungentle, it is not amiss to 
communicate that reason to a friend. I saw that the new 
government would be hungry, and would urge us for money in 
the double view of obtaining an acknowledgment of them, as 
well as of supplying their wants. It was therefore, I thought, 
right to take a position where we might say there is nothing 
due. This would leave open a question, which it would be 
very delicate to answer either way, as things appeared then, 
and as they are now that appearances have changed. You 
will have seen the manoeuvres to force me in that intrenchment ; but at last, like your friend General Lee, I was quite 
at the worst for a retrograde manoeuvre. 
</p><p>
But I concluded that supplies of money to support the 
colony of St Domingo would, in all events, have been considered as a good and effectual payment on our part, and, had my 
offer of recommending such supplies been accepted, I would 
on that ground have proposed the measure, which, anticipating 
the next instalments, would have still kept open the main 
point as long as you should think proper. And thus my 
apparent retreat was in effect a mode of more permanent 
defence, and this is more, I believe, than poor Lee could say 
for himself. I am truly yours, &ic.

</p><p>
My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I did myself the honor to write to you on the twenty-third of 
October. Since that date the exterior affairs of this country 
have put on a more steady appearance. My letter of the twenty-first instant to Mr Jefferson will communicate my view of 
things, to which I could add but little at this day. 
</p><p>
I have not mentioned to him the appointment of M. Genet, 
as Minister to the United States. In fact, this appointment 
has never been announced to me. Perhaps the Ministry think 
it is a trait of republicanism to omit those forms, which were 
anciently used to express good will. In the letter, which is 
addressed to you, is a strain of adulation, which your good 
sense will easily expound. Let it be compared with <a href="/results.php?tla=leb" rel="met colleague">M. Lebrun's</a> letter to me of the 30th of August. The fact is, that 
they begin to open their eyes to their true situation ; and be 
sides they wish to bring forward, into act, our guarantee of 
their islands, if the war with Britain should actually take 
place. 
</p><p>
As to that war, I am told that the British ultimatum is as 
follows. France shall deliver the royal family to such reigning 
branch of the Bourbons as the King may choose, and shall re 
call her troops from the countries they now occupy. In this 
event, Britain will send hither a Minister, and acknowledge 
the republic, and mediate a peace with the Emperor and 
King of Prussia. I have several reasons to believe, that this 
information is not far from the truth, and that if the Ministers 
felt themselves at liberty to act, they would agree to the terms. 
These terms are, it is said, consequential to the sentiments de 
livered by opposition in the British Parliament ; who are, as 
you will see become quite insignificant, but it was thought best 
to place them in a necessity of supporting the measures of 
administration. 
I consider these terms, or something very like them, in a 
different point of view. If the French retire, and consequently eat up again their high toned declarations in favor of 
the people, and denunciations against Kings, they will, at the 
next attempt, find as many enemies as there are men in the 
neighboring countries, and of course the mediator will pre 
scribe such terms as he may think proper. Secondly, as it 
is almost evident that the republic must be torn to pieces by 
contending factions, even without any foreign interference, her 
population, wealth, and resources, above all her Marine, must 
dwindle away ; and as much of her intelligence and industry, 
with the greater part of her money capital, must on this hypothesis seek the protection of law and government on the other 
side of the channel, he r rival will increase both in positive and 
relative power. Thirdly, an exiled monarch on the other side 
of the Pyrenees, (for it is at Madrid that he would probably 
take refuge,) would enable Britain at any moment to distract 
the French affairs, and involve the republic in a war with 
Spain. Lastly, it seems an almost necessary conclusion, that 
if France in some years of convulsive misery should escape 
dismemberment, she would sink under severe and single despotism, and when relieved therefrom by the King, or his descendants, or relations, she would be in a state of wretchedness 
for at least one generation. 
</p><p>
I understand that the French, in the consciousness that 
their principles have ruined their colonies, are willing to pay 
them as the price of peace ; but on the other hand Mr Pitt 
has, I am told, refused the offers which the colonists have 
made to him, partly because he does not wish to excite alarm, 
and partly because the only useful part of the colonies, their 
commerce, will, he conceives, naturally fall to Britain in pro 
portion to the interior ruin, which has already made great 
ravages in this country. 
</p><p>
If the terms offered by Britain, whatever they may be, are 
not accepted, I think a declaration will not suddenly follow, 
but only an increase of preparations ; because time must be 
given for the co-operators, Spain and Holland, who are both of 
them slow. Besides, it will be necessary that a body of Prussian troops should be collected, through Westphalia, in the 
neighborhood of Flanders, to be joined by Dutch, Hanoverian, 
and perhaps British troops. The more the French advance, 
the more they expose themselves to this danger ; and you may 
rely, that if a large body of troops be thrown into Flanders, 
that country will join them eagerly to expel or destroy the 
French. 
</p><p>
I think it possible, that in case the war should break out , 
there may be a treaty of partition, in which the Elector Palatine 
may have Alsace and Lorraine in lieu of Bavaria, and that the 
Low Countries may be given by the Emperor, in exchange for 
Bavaria, to the Duke and Dutchess of York. This would 
suit everybody but France, and she will not in such case be 
consulted. 
</p><p>
I have not yet seen M. Genet, but Mr Paine is to introduce 
him to me. In the mean time I have inquired a little what 
kind of a person he is ; and I find that he is a man of good 
parts and very good education, brother to the Queen's first 
woman ; from whence his fortune originates. He was, through 
the Queen's influence, appointed as Charge d Affaires at Petersburg, and when there, in consequence of despatches from 
M. de Montmorin written in the sense of the revolution, and 
which he interpreted too literally, he made some representations in a much higher tone than was wished or expected. It 
was not convenient either to approve or disapprove of his con 
duct, under the then circumstances, and his despatches lay unnoticed. This, to a young man of ardent temper, and who, 
feeling genius and talents, may perhaps have rated himself a 
little too high, was mortifying in the extreme. He felt himself 
insulted, and wrote in a style of petulance to his chief, believing always, that if the royal party prevailed, his sister would 
easily make fair weather for him at court ; which I doubt not. 
At the overturn of the monarchy, these letters were so many 
credentials in his favor to the new government, and their dearth of men has opened his way to whatever he might wish. 
He chose America, as being the best harbor during the storm, 
and if my informant be right, he will not put to sea again until it is fair weather, let what will happen. 
</p><p>
In addition to what I have said respecting the King to Mr Jefferson, it is well to mention to you, that the majority have it 
in contemplation not only to refer the judgment to the electors of France, that is, to the people, but also to send him and his 
family to America, which Paine is to move for. He mentioned this to me in confidence, but I have since heard it from 
another quarter.. Adieu, my dear Sir. I wish you many and 
happy years.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I transmit herewith a duplicate of what I had the honor to 
write on the twenty-first of last month. Since that period, this 
government, perceiving that they had been wholly deceived 
respecting the British nation, have made advances towards 
conciliation. At least, so I am informed ; and also, that these 
advances are by a declaration that, however general the terms 
of their decree, they had no idea of exciting revolt, except in 
the dominions of the powers leagued against them. That as 
these powers had entered into France with design to change 
the established government, they are justified in turning against 
them the weapons of revolt, which they had intended to use. 
</p><p>
If this should ever become an object of diplomatic controversy, it will perhaps be objected, that until the asserted meaning of a general decree be declared by some other decree, 
the words must be taken in their plain and natural import. 
Should such new decree be passed, which by the bye would 
take from France a very powerful engine, the case of Savoy 
will be quoted, where, whatever may have been the supposed 
intentions, no facts existed to support the conduct which has 
been pursued, in such manner as to show a consistency with 
the limited interpretation put upon the decree. Lastly, as to 
the Austrian Netherlands, it will, I presume, be alleged, that 
not only the aggression was on the part of France, but that it 
was avowedly made with a view to excite revolt in that country. 
</p><p>
But I do not believe we shall have any such war of words, 
for I am convinced that France must, to avoid a war, do some 
thing more than make professions and explanations. I say 
nothing about the navigation of the Scheldt, and the projected 
invasion of Holland. I shall not, either, make any remarks on 
the unanimity in the British Parliament, which your; good 
sense and knowledge of that people had certainly anticipated. 
</p><p>
Accept, I pray you, Sir, the compliments of the season, and 
believe me, &ic.

P. S. The French armies are at length permitted to go 
into winter quarters ; that under Dumouriez amounted by the 
last returns to thirty-five thousand effectives, after the junction 
of Valence and Miranda.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
This will, I trust, be soon and safely delivered by Mr Short, who is now on his way to Madrid. Herewith I send you a copy of what in my last letter relates to the situation of this country. 
</p><p>
A problem to be resolved just now is, whether the convention of neutrality lately entered into with Spain is, on the part 
of the latter, concerted with Great Britain ; or whether your 
Due d Alcudia prefers otium cum NOVA dignitate to the uncertain splendors of a great undertaking. As I am not apt to 
trace up to rational causes the conduct of a creature so irrational as man, I should decide at once, perhaps, that the un 
nerved indolence of a courtier has more to say in the decision, 
than any complicated combinations of state policy, if there were 
not a remarkable coincidence in the time and circumstance 
with what has passed lately in the British Parliament. Is the 
conduct of Spain to be attributed to a design of making future 
hostilities popular, by making them appear to result from French 
aggression ; or does it arise from the dread, that war might 
awaken the court from that profound oblivious sleep, in which 
its interest and its glory are all forgotten? 
</p><p>
On the contingent answers to these questions- there results 
an alternative, which may operate favorably to the object of 
Mr Short's mission. If, for instance, a war should be imminent, I think that they would wish to avoid any contest with 
us ; and if ease and luxury be their motives, I think you may 
plague them into concessions, which, after all, (under the rose 
be it spoken) are of very little consequence to our country ; for 
I have no golden hopes from an uphill navigation of three or 
four hundred leagues. 
</p><p>
I will not now go into any long discussions on the state of 
affairs here, because I have communicated my opinions to Mr. Short pretty fully, and shall continue to do so until he takes 
his departure. The Council here talk so highly to Great Britain that you, who know mankind, will conclude them to be 
afraid ; and this conclusion is not far from the truth. Mr Pitt 
has the nation now in his hand, and may do what he pleases. 
Will he make war? The King is, I believe, decidedly for it. 
Will he make war? Perhaps he can gain more by peace. 
Will he make war ? He envies, I am told, his father's fame. 
A gentle armament places him in a condition to make the belligerent powers bid high for his favor, while it will convince 
Old England that when at last he strikes, it is her honor which compels the blow ; and then she will fight, you may rely on it. I am, &sc.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Mr Short, who is so kind as to take charge of my letters as 
far as Bordeaux, will go, he says, this day. I therefore take 
the latest opportunity to write, and to inform you, that the appearances have not at all changed since mine of the first. 
Dumouriez has been some days in Paris ; he stays at home 
under pretence of illness, but in fact to receive and consider 
the propositions of the different parties. 
</p><p>
It would seem that he is not reconciled to Pache, the minister of War. Pache is very strong in Paris, and that circumstance renders him formidable, both to his colleagues and to 
the Convention. I am told that the majority of the latter body 
expect soon to be supported by a considerable number of volunteers from the departments. I am also told that it cannot 
be long before the bursting of the storm, which has been so long 
brewing. This last intelligence is from one of those who, 
though a promoter of the last revolution, is now marked as one 
of the victims. He says he will die hard, but laments the feebleness of temper which he experiences among those who, like 
him, are doomed to destruction. 
</p><p>
On the other hand, a person of cool discerning temper and 
understanding, who is in the confidence of those who direct the 
Jacobins, told me when last I saw him, that they are determined to rule, or perish. You will easily suppose, that this provision of horrors is far from pleasant. I have, I assure you, 
been not a little tempted to spend a few days with some of my 
friends in the country during the festive season, which would 
render such an excursion natural, but the critical state of things 
with Great Britain might take a turn, which it would be important for you to know, and, therefore, it is right that I stay 
here. I have the honor to be, &-c.

</p><p>
My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
As I have good reason to believe that this letter will go safely, I shall mention some things which may serve as a clue to 
lead through mysteries. Those who planned the revolution, 
which took place on the tenth of August, sought a person to 
head the attack, and found a M. Westermann, whose morals 
were far from exemplary. He has no pretensions to science, 
or to depth of thought; but he is fertile in resources, and endued with the most daring intrepidity. Like Cresar, he believes in his fortune. When the business drew towards a point 
the conspirators trembled, but Westermann declared they 
should go on. They obeyed, because they had trusted him 
too far. On that important day his personal conduct decided 
in a great measure their success. Rewards were due, and 
military rank, with opportunities to enrich himself, was grant 
ed. 
</p><p>
You know something of Dumouriez. The Council distrusted him. Westermann was commissioned to destroy him, 
should he falter. This commission was shown to the General. It became the bond of union between him and Wester 
mann. Dumouriez opened a treaty with the King of Prussia. 
The principal emigrants, confident of force, and breathing vengeance, shut the royal ear. Thionville was defended, because 
a member of the Constituent Assembly saw in Lafayette's 
fate his own. Metz was not delivered up, because nobody 
asked for the keys, and because the same apprehensions were 
felt which influenced in Thionville. The King of Prussia 
waited for these evidences of loyalty until his provisions were 
consumed. He then found it necessary to bargain for a re 
treat. It was worth to Westermann about ten thousand pounds, 
The Council, being convinced that he had betrayed their bloody 
secret, have excited a prosecution against him for old affairs of 
no .higher rank than petit larcency. He has desired a trial by 
court martial. 
</p><p>
You will judge whether cordial union can subsist between the 
Council and their Generals. Vergniaud, Gaudet, &c. are now, 
I am told, the intimates of Dumouriez, and that the present 
administration is to be overturned, beginning with Pache, the 
minister of War. You will have seen a denunciation against 
these members of Assembly for a letter they wrote to Thierry, 
the King's valet-de-chambre. This affair needs explanation, 
but it can be of no present use. 
</p><p>
The King's fate is to be decided next Monday, the fourteenth. That unhappy man, conversing with one of his counsel on his own fate, calmly summed up the motives of every 
kind, and concluded that a majority of the Convention would vote for referring his case to the people, and that in consequence he should be massacred. I think he must die or reign. 
I am, &c.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The late King of this country has been publicly executed. 
He died in a manner becoming his dignity. Mounting the 
scaffold, he expressed anew his forgiveness of those who persecuted him, and a prayer that his deluded people might be 
benefitted by his death. On the scaffold he attempted to 
speak, but the commanding officer, Santerre, ordered the 
drums to be beat. The King made two unavailing efforts, 
but with the same bad success. The executioners threw him 
down, and were in such haste as to let fall the axe before his 
neck was properly placed, so that he was mangled. It would 
be needless to give you an affecting narrative of particulars. 
I proceed to what is more important, having but a few minutes to write in by the present good opportunity. 
</p><p>
The greatest care was taken to prevent a concourse of 
people. This proves a conviction, that the majority was not 
favorable to that severe measure. In effect the great mass of 
Parisian citizens mourned the fate of their unhappy Prince. 
I have seen grief, such as for the untimely death of a beloved 
parent. Everything wears an appearance of solemnity, which 
is awfully distressing. I have been told by a gentleman from 
the spot, that putting the King to death would be a signal for 
disbanding the army in Flanders. I do not believe this, but 
incline to think it will have some effect on that army, already 
perishing by want, and mouldering fast away. The people of 
that country, if the French army retreats, will, I am persuaded, take a severe vengeance for the injuries they have felt, 
and the insults they have been exposed to. Both are great. 
The war against France is become popular in Austria, and is 
becoming so in Germany. If my judgment be good, the testament of Louis the Sixteenth will be more powerful against 
the present rulers of this country, than an army of a hundred 
thousand men. You will learn the effect it has in England. 
</p><p>
I believe that the English will be wound up to a pitch of 
enthusiastic horror against France, which their cool and steady 
temper seems to be scarcely susceptible of. 
</p><p>
I enclose you the translation of a letter from Sweden, which 
I have received from Denmark. You will see thereby, that 
the Jacobin principles are propagated with zeal in every 
quarter. Whether the regent of Sweden intends to make himself King, is a moot point. All the world knows that the 
young Prince is not legitimate, although born under circumstances which render it, legally speaking, impossible to question his legitimacy. 
</p><p>
I consider a war between Britain and France as inevitable. The continental powers opposed to France are making 
great and prompt efforts, while on this side I as yet see but 
little done to oppose them. There is a treaty on foot, I believe, between England and Austria, whose object is the 
dismemberment of France. I have not proof, but some very 
leading circumstances. Britain will, I think, suspend her 
blow till she can strike very hard, unless indeed they should 
think it advisable to seize the moment of indignation against 
late events for a declaration of war. This is not improbable, 
because it may be coupled with those general declarations 
against all Kings under the name of tyrants, which contain a 
determination to destroy them, and the threat, that if the 
ministers of England presume to declare war, an appeal shall 
be made to the people, at the head of an invading army. Of 
course, a design may be exhibited of entering into the heart 
of Great Britain to overturn the constitution, destroy the 
rights of property, and finally to dethrone and murder the 
King. All which are things the English will neither approve 
of, nor submit to. 
</p><p>
Yours of the seventh of November is just received. I will 
reply to it by the first good opportunity.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Since my last, I have had every reason to believe, that the 
execution of the King has produced on foreign nations the 
effect which I had imagined. The war with England exists, and it is now proper, perhaps, to consider its consequences, to 
which effect, we must examine the objects likely to be pursued by England, for in this country, notwithstanding the gasconades, a defensive war is prescribed by necessity. 
</p><p>
Many suppose that the French Colonies will be attacked, 
but this I do not believe. It is indeed far from improbable 
that a British garrison may be thrown into Martinique, but as 
to St Domingo, it would require more men than can be spared 
to defend it, and as much money as it is worth. Besides 
which, there are higher considerations to be attended to. 
In one shape or another, this nation will make a bankruptcy. 
The mode now talked of, is to pay off the debt in a species of 
paper money, which shall be receivable for the sales of confiscated property, and which shall bear no interest. When once 
the whole of the debt shall be fairly afloat, the single word depreciation will settle all accounts. You will say, perhaps, that 
this measure is unjust, but to this I answer, that in popular governments, strongly convulsed, it is a sufficient answer to all arguments, that the measure proposed is for the public good. 
Supposing, then, the debt of France thus liquidated, she presents a rich surface covered with above twenty millions of people, who love war better than labor. Be the form of government what it may, the Administration will find war abroad 
necessary to preserve peace at home. The neighbors of 
France must therefore consider her as a great power, essentially belligerent, and they must measure themselves by the scale 
of her force. 
</p><p>
In this view of the subject, to take her islands, is to possess 
but the paring of her nails, and therefore more serious efforts 
must be made. Strange as it may seem, the present war is, 
on the part of France, a war of empire, and if she defends 
herself, she commands the world. I am persuaded that her 
enemies consider this as the real state of things, and will there 
fore bend their efforts towards a. reduction of her power; and 
this may be compassed in two ways, either by obliging her to 
assume a new burden of debt to defray the expense they are 
at on her account, or else by a dismemberment. The latter 
appears the more certain mode. In this case, it will, I presume, be attempted to make the Saome her northern boundary 
as far as the Ardennes, and then along the Ardennes to the 
Vosges mountains, to mount Jura, and along mount Jura to the 
Alps. This will throw French Flanders, Artois, and a part of 
Picardy into the circle of Austrian Flanders, which may be 
erected into an independent State, and the country lying east 
of the Vosges and mount Jura may be a compensation to the 
Elector Palatine, for the cession of Bavaria. 
</p><p>
On such a project, if it exists, the first question is as to the 
means of execution ; and these are well prepared, if the enemy knows how to make use of them. Alsace is attached to 
the German Empire, and to the cause of religion. The only 
thing, which pleases them in the revolution, is the abolition of 
the tithes, and they are as much disgusted by the banishment 
of their priests. I speak here of the Roman Catholic only. 
The sentiments of this people cannot be unknown to the enemy. As to French Flanders and Artois, the cause of religion 
is with them the first care, but as yet they have not had a fair 
opportunity to show themselves, because they are awed by the 
numerous garrisons spread through their country. I think, as 
I mentioned in my last, that there exists a treaty respecting 
Flanders between England and Austria, but I cannot find out 
the exact purport. Prussia is, I think, to find her account in 
Poland. 
</p><p>
As to the conduct of the war, I believe it to be on the part 
of the enemy as follows. First, the maritime powers will try to 
cut off all supplies of provisions, and take France by famine ; 
that is to say, excite revolt among the people by that strong 
lever. Give us again our bread and our chains, might perhaps 
be the language of Paris. I think I can perceive some seeds 
already sown to produce that fruit. It is not improbable, that 
our vessels bringing provisions to France may be captured and 
taken into England, the cargoes paid for by the government. 
Secondly, Britain may perhaps land a body of troops in Normandy, with intention to prenetrate to Rouen, and cause the 
royal standard to be erected by the French Emigrants. If a 
large body of the people flock to it, they might come on to 
wards the capital, if not, they may move along the coast to 
Abbeville, and thence form a junction with the army acting in 
Flanders. For this descent, if it takes place, is but a secondary operation ; the main stress will be in Flanders, for there 
the troops of Britain, Holland, Hanover, Austria, and Prussia, 
can be fed from the ocean at a very cheap rate, and the more 
their operations may be confined to the sea coast, the more will 
it be difficult for France to oppose them, because the provisions 
must in such case be carried to an extreme corner of the country. Thirdly, an attack of great energy will be made on the 
side of Mayence, in the view to destroy totally the army under 
Custine, and penetrate into lower Alsace. But the real at 
tack of that ci-divant province will, I think, be on the side of 
Upper Alsace, for which purpose nothing will be left undone 
to bring the Swiss into action, as thereby the fire of war will 
extend all along from the German Ocean to the Mediterranean 
Sea. Fourthly, the efforts on the side of Savoy will probably be confined to the recovery of that country, and such di 
version as may occupy a part of the French army for their own 
defence. Fifthly, on the side of Provence and Languedoc 
there will be only a predatory war, a war of alarm, such as 
may increase the want of bread by multiplying the consumers, for I do not believe in a serious attempt on either Toulon 
or Marseilles. Under this chapter, and as an incidental consideration, are the intrigues with the Turk to engage the Barbary powers. I think a British squadron in the Mediterranean will do more towards these than a dozen Ambassadors. 
Lastly, on the side of Spain there will, I believe, be nothing 
more than diversion. How great that may be will depend on 
contingencies, not within the compass of human foresight. A 
revolution at court which should dismiss the Queen and her 
paramour might give some energy to the administration,, 
which at present is extremely feeble. 
</p><p>
Having thus run through the probabilities on the side of the Adversary, I come now to what appear to be the views of 
France. You will have seen, that the effective army for <a href='/results.php?year=1793'>1793</a> 
is fixed at something more than five hundred thousand men. 
These they will be able to get together. The recruiting service goes on well, and although many of the last year's men 
return with design not to re-engage, their places will be sup 
plied ; so that by the beginning of June that immense army 
(barring accidents) will be completed. 
</p><p>
The main object at present is to overrun Holland ; a thing 
which might have been affected six weeks ago, but at present 
I believe it is not to be done. If the Prussian aud Hanoverian troops advance rapidly, it will hardly be attempted. It is 
however expected that Maestricht may fall as suddenly as Mayence, and perhaps by similar means. If this should happen 
it would greatly impede the confederates, and of course they 
will exert themselves to prevent that misfortune. Never 
were the moments more precious, than they are to both par 
ties in that quarter ; for there the first blow will be more than 
one half of the battle. Should the enemy become speedily 
superior in the field, there is nothing to stop him till he comes 
to Valenciennes, and at every step he would gather new force ; 
besides, he need not embarrass himself with convoys, because 
he would soon receive abundance from the side of the sea. 
As to the colonies, I believe that France will not attempt to 
defend them, and their whole commerce falls naturally into 
the lap of America, unless the British prevent it, and I think 
they will find it more convenient to neglect that small object 
to pursue the great ones, which open themselves to view in 
this quarter. 
</p><p>
What I have just said leads me very naturally to your letter of the seventeenth of November. You had previously instructed me to endeavor to transfer the negotiation for a 
new treaty to America, and if the revolution of the tenth of 
August had not taken place, but instead thereof the needful 
power and confidence been restored to the crown, I should perhaps have obtained what you wished as a mark of favor and confidence. A change of circumstances rendered it necessary to change entirely my conduct, so as to produce in 
one way, what was impracticable in another. 
</p><p>
As I saw clearly, or at least thought I saw, that France and 
England would at length get by the ears, it seemed best to let 
them alone, until they should be nearly pitted. When I found 
this to be the case, I asked an interview with the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, and mentioned to him my wish that an exception should be made in the decree against emigrants, in favor 
of those who were in the United States. I told him truly, that 
I wished the alliance between the two nations to be strictly pre 
served. I told him with great frankness, that notwithstanding 
appearances, and the flattering accounts transmitted by some 
of his agents, Britain was, in my opinion, hostile, and an at 
tempt at alliance with her, idle. He assured me he was of the 
same opinion. I then observed to him, that in such case, 
there would be no doubt but Mr Hammond would exert him 
self to inculcate the opinion, that our treaty having been made 
with the King, was void by the Revolution. He said that such 
an opinion was absurd. I told him, (premising in this place, 
that the whole conversation was inofficial, and unauthorised on 
my part, from circumstances he was well acquainted with,) that 
my private sentiments were similar to his, but I thought it 
would be well to evince a degree of good will to America, 
which might prevent disagreeable impressions, and had there 
fore taken the liberty to suggest the exception in favor of emigrants to America. 
</p><p>
Here I left it, and changed the conversation. Now I know 
well, that some of the leaders here who are in the Diplomatic 
Committee hate me cordially, though it would puzzle them to 
say why ; and I was determined rather to turn that disposition 
to account than to change it, because I see some advantages to 
result from it. Thus I contributed indirectly to the slight put 
on me, by sending out M. Genet without mentioning to me a 
syllable either of his mission or his errand, both of which, 
nevertheless, I was early and sufficiently informed of. The 
pompousness of this Embassy could not but excite the attention of England, and my continuance at Paris, notwithstanding 
the many reasons which might have induced me to leave it&gt; 
would also, I thought, excite in some degree their jealousy ; and 
I have good reason to believe that this effect was produced. 
From all this I conjectured, that both parties might be brought 
to bid at your auction, At any rate the thing you wished for 
is done, and you can treat in America if you please. Whether 
you will or not is another affair. Perhaps you will see that 
all the advantages desired do already exist, that the acts of the 
constitutional Assembly have in some measure set us free from 
our engagements, and that, increasing daily in power, we may 
make quite as good a bargain some time hence as now. 
</p><p>
It remains to add a few words in reply to what regards me 
personally in your letter. I am very happy, indeed, to find 
that my conduct, as far as it was known, is approved of. This 
is the summit of my wish, for I. candidly acknowledge that the 
good opinion of the wise and virtuous is what I prize beyond 
all earthly possessions, I have lately debated much within 
myself what to do. The path of life in Paris is no longer 
strewed with roses, as you may well imagine ; indeed it is extremely painful. I have already given my reasons for staying 
here, but now the scene is changed, and I had thoughts of 
making a tour to the different Consulates. There are, how 
ever, some pretty solid objections to that plan for the present. 
</p><p>
The next thing which suggested itself was to hire a country 
house for the summer season, in the neighborhood. At length, 
that my leaving the city might give no offence to anybody, I 
have bought a country house in an out of the way place, 
where it is not likely that any armies will pass or repass, even 
should the enemy penetrate. If I lose the money paid for it, 
I will put up with the loss. The act in itself shows a disposition friendly to France, and as it is between twenty and thirty 
miles from Paris, I shall be at hand, should business require 
my presence. Mr Livingston, my secretary, will continue 
in town unless driven out of it by war or famine. In this way 
I hope to avoid those accidents which are almost inseparable 
from the present state of society and government, and which, 
should they light on the head of a public Minister, might involve consequences of a disagreeable nature. It is more pro 
per also, I conceive, to make arrangements of this kind in a 
moment of tranquillity, than when confusion is awakened in 
to mischief. In all this my judgment may err, but I can tru jly say that the interest of the United States is my sole object. 
Time alone can tell whether the conduct be as right as I 
know the intention to be. 
</p><p>
Before I close this letter, I must pray your indulgence for 
referring to the enclosed copy of what I wrote on the twenty-^ 
seventh of last month, to the bankers of the United States in 
Amsterdam. I make no comment thereon, only as I had no 
right to give the order in question, I consider it as of course, 
that if disapproved of I must replace the money which may be 
advanced on it. This is one of the cases in which not to act 
is taking a part, and in which it is ruin to balance.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I am to acknowledge yours of the seventh of last November, which I cannot do without expressing my concern at a 
resolution, which will deprive the United States of an able and 
faithful servant. Since you declare your determination to be 
unalterable, it would be idle to offer reasons to dissuade you, 
besides which it seems probable that ere this can arrive, you 
will have acted. But were it otherwise, I know not whether 
in my present feelings I could attempt to divert from the sweets of private and domestic life one, who has so long been deprived of them. Every day makes me contemplate with additional pleasure the prospect of retirement, and that tranquillity whose loss is not perhaps to be compensated by anything else. 
</p><p>
If, however, the die be not cast, permit me to express one 
wish. It is, that you would hold your place until a successor 
can be fixed on, whom you think fully equal to the duties of the 
office. This may perhaps be a painful sacrifice, but it is one 
which I hope you will make to the interests of our country in 
the present very critical moment. If you shall have quitted, or 
persist in doing it, give me, I pray, your opinions and advice. 
These, so long as T stay here, will be very useful to me, and I 
trust not quite useless to the United States. 
</p><p>
In whatever situation you maybe, believe, I pray you, in 
that respectful esteem with which I am, &ic.

My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received yours of the twentieth of October, which 
was very long on its way. You will find that events have 
blackened more and more in this country. The present prospects are dreadful. It is not so much perhaps the external 
force, great as that may be, for there are always means of de 
fence in so vast a nation. The exhausted state of resources 
might also be borne with, if not remedied. But the disorganized state of the government appears to be irremediable. The 
venality is such, that if there be no traitors, it is because the 
enemy have not common sense. Without the aid of venality, 
there are not a few who, from mistaken zeal, and from ignorance, contribute to the success of those powers who are leagued against France. Many also under the garb of patriotism 
conceal their attachment to the, former government. In short, the 
fabric of the present system is erected on a quagmire. The 
new constitution has not yet made its appearance, but it is easy 
to conjecture what it will not be. In the mean time I learn, 
that the ministers of War and Marine declare it impossible for 
them to go on. How all this will end, God only knows, but I 
fear it will end badly. 
</p><p>
I will not speak of my own situation ; you will judge that it 
is far from pleasant. I could be popular, but that would be 
wrong. The different parties pass away like the shadows in a 
magic lantern, and to be well with any one of them, would 
in a short period become the cause of unquenchable hatred 
with the others. 
</p><p>
Happy, happy America ; governed by reason, by law, by the 
man whom she loves, whom she almost adores. It is the pride 
of my life to consider that man as my friend, and I hope long to 
be honored with that title. God bless you, my dear Sir, and 
keep and preserve you. Your cool and steady temper is now 
of infinite consequence to our country. As soon as I can see 
the way open to anything decisive, I shall inform you of it. 
At present I weary myself with unavailing reflection, meditation, and conjecture. A partition seems the most probable 
event at present. Adieu.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My last was of the sixteenth of January, of which I now 
enclose a copy. It has so happened that a very great pro 
portion of the French officers, who served in America, have 
been either opposed to the revolution at an early day, or felt 
themselves obliged at a later period to abandon it. Some of 
them are now in a state of banishment, and their property confiscated. Among these last there are a few, who had entrusted 
to their agents the certificates received from our treasury, and 
these last under the pressure of penal decrees either detain 
those certificates, or have delivered them up to those persons 
appointed by the republic to take charge of confiscated property. 
</p><p>
There certainly can be no question on this subject, under 
the laws hitherto existing among nations ; but I shall not undertake to decide either on rights or pretensions to right, 
especially where I am not authorised to act ; but it is proper 
that I should lay before you a state of facts, for your ulterior 
decision. The only one at present before me is the case of 
Colonel Laumoy, to whom I shall write in answer to his ap 
plications, that I am not authorised to make payment but on 
production of the certificate, and therefore he must address 
himself on the subject to you, in the full confidence that right 
and justice will take place, such being the clear determination 
of the United States. I am, &tc.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received by yesterday's post your letter of the twenty-second. In reply to which I beg leave to refer you to 
mine of the eighteenth, and to add farther here, that any 
application to the government would imply doubts, which do 
not exist in my mind, and for which there is no foundation. 
On the contrary I have every reason to be convinced, tl at all 
stipulations in the treaty between France and the United 
States of America will be scrupulously complied with. It is 
true, that the first decree for fitting out privateers was hastily 
passed, and needs correction ; but all such correction as may 
be needful will be made. 
In the mean time, I think it a matter of no consequence what 
may be the rate of insurance against capture at Lloyd s. 
Real Americans certainly will not pay a premium where they 
run no risk, and as to those who borrow our flag under false pretences, it is no matter what they pay. I hope the Americans will have so much good sense, as to see that the proof of 
payment of a premium to insure against capture ought to operate, as an evidence against them in the courts of this country. 
If I were to sit as judge, I would certainly consider it as a 
strong presumption, that the property, however covered, was 
not American, and probably should on that presumption condemn it as prize, leaving the party to his appeal, in order to 
take off before the higher court by good evidence the weight of such presumption. I have the honor to be, &c.

</p><p>
My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I think that you should be acquainted with a fact, which it is 
very important to communicate to our Secretary of State as 
soon as may be. I am informed, in a way that precludes 
doubt, that the Executive Council here sent out by M. Genet 
three hundred blank commissions for privateers, to be given 
clandestinely to such persons as he might find in America inclined to take them. They suppose that the avidity of some 
adventurers may lead them into measures, which would involve 
altercations with Great Britain, and terminate finally in a war. 
This appears to me, waving all question of honesty, no very 
sound measure politically speaking, since they may, as a 
nation, derive greater advantage from our neutrality than from 
our alliance. 
</p><p>
But whatever light it may be viewed in as to them, it is in 
respect to us a detestable project. I learn that some seamen have lately by British cruisers, who claim to be Americans. I presume that the claim will not be admitted, but if 
the government should cause them to be executed as Pirates, 
a knowledge thereof would go a great way to prevent our citizens from engaging in a war, contrary to the wishes of 
our government, especially if, as I doubt not, the President 
should by proclamation, enjoining the observance of a strict 
neutrality, declare that all those who contravene shall be at the 
mercy of the party by whom they may be taken, and not en 
titled to the protection of the United States. 
</p><p>
I am the more solicitous on this subject, in that we may 
well expect a back game of the same kind by Britain, and in 
such case it would be impossible for the French to distinguish 
among their prisoners, between those who were and those who 
were not English. As there is nothing more destructive to 
morals than the spirit of gambling, especially when murder is 
placed among the means of gaining the property of others, 
and as the security and happiness of the United States depend 
so essentially on the morals of their citizens, I feel a more 
than usual solicitude to prevent a practice inconsistent with all 
good principles. 
</p><p>
I have no late news from America, and none of any date which you would with to know. Our Secretary of State seems 
much attached to brevity, and reminds me of a maxim of his predecessor, that least said is soonest mended. The length 
of this letter will show you that I have not profited by such wise lessons, but it will also show you, I trust, the confidential esteem with which I am, &c.

My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Since I had the pleasure of writing to you on the fourth of 
January by our friend, Mr Short, I am without any of your 
letters. I lament this, because they always communicate to 
me both pleasure and instruction, 
</p><p>
As far as I can judge, this nation approaches to the point 
where the vigor of laws must supply the place of enthusiastic 
zeal, for this latter begins to abate. There will, however, be 
enough to furnish out a considerable force, when the weather 
grows a little warmer, especially should events somewhat distant, and rather untoward, require great exertion. Another 
supposition, (for I do not here notice that continuation of vic 
tories which people can easily reconcile themselves to,) another 
supposition is a heavy reverse at a distant point. Now the 
effect of this would, I think, be various, according to the nature of the calamity. If for instance the enemy should strike 
a blow, it would probably rouse the nation into effort. If a 
great project should fail, it would probably spread despondency. 
</p><p>
So much for calculation, which after all must depend on 
some moral causes, which neither France nor the Allies seem 
sufficiently to estimate, but which with me have very great 
weight. I believe it more easy to conquer by laws than by 
arms ; and had I been counsellor to the Duke of Brunswick 
and Company, I would have repeated to hid from Shakspeare, 
that when lenity and cruelty play for kingdoms, the gentlest 
gamester is the surest winner. And so, my dear old friend, 
adieu. Reproach yourself sometimes for not writing often, 
and always believe me with truth and affection yours, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Enclosed you have copies of what I had the honor to write on the twenty-fifth of January, and thirteenth of February ; also 
the copy of a letter of the twelfth of February, from Mr Pinckney, with my answer of the eighteenth. I send these last, to 
the end that due attention may be paid to such vessels as may be furnished with his passports, and which may perhaps prove to be British bottoms. 
</p><p>
I am so well persuaded that the United States will strictly 
observe the laws "of nations, and rigidly adhere to their neutrality, that [ am solicitous to prevent a practice which might 
expose us to suspicion, and finally involve us in war. On 
this chapter it is proper also, that I should communicate a fact 
which I have mentioned to Mr Pinckney, and desired him to 
transmit. 
</p><p>
Monsieur Genet took out with him three hundred blank 
commissions, which he is to distribute to such as will fit out cruizers in our ports, to prey on the British commerce. I 
am convinced that few of my countrymen will be so lost to all 
moral sense, as to embark in a game so abominable, where the 
murder of their fellow creatures enters as a leading chance. 
I am apprehensive, however, lest some profligates may be led 
to fix a blot on our national character, and deprive both them 
selves and their countrymen of the great and certain advantages to flow from honest industry on the present important occasion, an occasion, which, duly attended to and properly 
cultivated, will give to our navigation an increase too rapid al 
most for conjecture, and place us in the happy situation to be 
in two or three years the exclusive carriers of our immense 
productions. These considerations weigh much, but they are 
still but a feather in the balance with those of a much higher 
nature, which stand in connexion with the nature of our government, and of course with the happiness of generations to come. 
I know of nothing so dangerous, and I might say fatal to morals, 
as the sudden acquisition of wealth by bad means. Industry 
is thereby discouraged, and honesty discountenanced. The 
vulgar are soon dazzled by the glare of prospering vice, and 
the young are seduced from the paths of virtue ; and virtue 
once gone, freedom is but a name ; for I do not believe it to be 
among possible contingencies, that a corrupted people should 
be for one moment free. Excuse, I pray, my dear Sir, these 
observations, which I cannot restrain. They flow from the 
conviction of my earliest reason, and are strengthened by the 
experience of twenty years. 
</p><p>
In mine of the thirteenth of February, I mentioned to you 
that this country would procure the five hundred thousand 
men required, and at that time there was every reason to think 
so, because the recruiting service went on well for all the new 
corps which had been ordered ; but it now appears that this 
arose from little circumstances of dress and flattery, calculated 
to catch idlers, and that there is a real scarcity of men. The 
losses of the last campaign are sensible in the mass of population, so that notwithstanding the numbers thrown out of em 
ploy by the stagnation of some manufactures, and the reduction of private fortunes, the want of common laborers is felt 
throughout the whole country. Already they talk of drafting 
for the service, an experiment of very doubtful and dangerous 
complexion. Jt would however succeed just now ; but if delayed it would not, I believe, go down ; and at any rate would 
not produce in season the required force ; especially if the enemy should have any considerable successes; for you must 
not imagine that the appearances in this country are all real, 
and you must take into your estimation, that the Convention is 
falling into contempt, because the Tribunes govern it imperiously. They try to save appearances, but the people cannot long 
be dupes. It is the old story of King Log, and how long it 
may be before Jupiter sends them a Crane to destroy the Frogs 
and Froglings, is a matter of uncertainty. Already they begin 
to cry out for a Dictator. An insurrection also is brewing, 
whose object I am told is to destroy the faction of the Gironde. 
I think I mentioned to you, that the death of the King would 
be but the forerunner of their destruction. And already they 
see the sword hanging over their heads. The majority of the 
Convention is clearly at the disposition of their enemies. 
The consuls will forward to you, and you will see in the 
gazettes, the decree for opening all the ports of this nation to 
our vessels on equal terms with their own. You will be so kind 
as to observe, that this was done on a report of the Committee 
of Safety. Now you must know that the members of this 
Committee, or at least a majority of them, are sworn foes to 
the members of the Diplomatic Committee. This is necessary to explain a little of what is said in mine of the 13th, about 
the latter Committee. I have received indirectly a kind of 
assurance from the former, (which disposes entirely of the 
Convention) that they will do anything for the United States 
which I will point out, but in fact I know not anything which 
we ought to ask 5 the decrees above mentioned contain, I believe, all that we want. The history of them is not material. 
</p><p>
I had the honor to mention to you also, that I did not believe the attempt against Holland would succeed, and also that 
time was extremely precious to both parties, especially in regard to Maestricht, in whose fate was involved perhaps that of 
the whole campaign. This town had, I am told, offered to 
capitulate, but terms of such rigor were insisted on, as to induce a longer defence, and this delay has saved them. The 
siege is raised, and unless the French army should gain a vic 
tory, I do not see how they are to escape, provided the enemy 
exerts himself. Dumouriez had taken Breda, and was preparing to enter Holland, being ordered by the Minister of War ; 
to whom he replied, that he would go in, but the Minister 
must find his way out. This latter may be no very easy 
task. The enemy on the side of Maestricht are, I believe, 
superior in numbers ; and certainly if the French in that quarter are beaten, the Allies may cut off the retreat of Dumouriez, in which case his fate must depend not only on the 
strength of his army, not over numerous, but also on the state 
of his magazines, which I believe to be bad. Should Valence be able to make good a gentle retreat, then he may be 
joined perhaps by Dumouriez at Louvain, and together they 
may cover Brussels. 
</p><p>
But all these things, again, depend on some moral contingencies, such for instance as the following questions. What 
will be the temper and spirit of those departments nearest to 
the scene of action ? What will be the degree of hope or apprehension among the inhabitants of the Low Countries ? As 
to them you will see by the gazettes, that they are fast expressing their adherence to the French Republic freely pronounced. 
</p><p>
But since it has been no small question among metaphysicians, what it is that constitutes the freedom of the will, there 
is no small question also on this subject among politicians, as to 
the case before us. Are men actuated by interest, are they 
instigated by desire, are they seduced by hope, are they compelled by fear? Alexander, you know, cut the knot which he 
could not untie, and the French have imitated the example of 
that conqueror. Some striking examples of those, who op 
posed the union with France, induced all the rest to give both 
their speedy and their free consent. It is therefore a problem 
to be resolved, what degree of force must be produced by the 
Allies to operate on the free will of this people, in a counter 
sense. I think the solution of that problem is in Brussels. 
</p><p>
On the whole, my dear Sir, the hour is big with important 
events. As soon as I learn anything more, I will communicate 
it ; in the mean time accept the assurances of that respect, with 
which I have the honor to be, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
In reading over my letter of yesterday, I find that I omitted 
to mention the war with Spain. The truth is, that it was a 
matter so much of course and of so little importance, that it 
escaped my recollection. Our Commissioners will doubtless 
turn it to account. 
</p><p>
Last evening I was informed that the French army in Flanders has been defeated, but as this is not an official account, I 
merely mention it as it is, viz. a letter sent express by an 
individual at Brussels on seeing sundry runaways arrive, and 
stores, &c. &c. coming in at sixes and sevens, with the re 
port that the enemy were at the gates. On the other hand, 
you must take into account that the siege of Maestricht being 
raised only the third, one day's rest was necessary for the 
troops, which had come on by forced marches. Now as the 
action must have taken place at Tongres, about forty miles 
from Brussels, and the courier in question left that city in the 
night of the fifth, it would follow that the enemy must have 
marched from Maestricht in the night of the fourth, and at 
tacked at break of day ; otherwise the runaways would hardly 
have got in by the evening of the fifth. On the whole, there 
is but just time enough for such an affair to have happened, 
and that is all. If there is any confirmation I will mention it. 
I am, &c.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The intelligence communicated in mine of yesterday is fully 
confirmed. The accounts given to the Convention are so lame 
and blind, that one is obliged to piece them out like a tattered 
writing, where whole sentences are wanting. 
</p><p>
It would seem, then, that the enemy, though at what time 
is yet uncertain, made an attack on the army which had besieged, or rather bombarded Maestricht, and which was then at 
Tongres. The route has, I believe, been complete, and the 
enemy, by pushing on to St Tron, have cut off the retreat of 
those who were at Liege before the battle, or who fled to it 
afterwards ; so that in all human probability the greater part 
of them have fallen, with all their artillery and stores. They 
had indeed one road open, viz. that along the banks of the 
Meuse up to Huy and Namur ; but whether the enemy in Luxembourg have detached on that side, seems as yet uncertain. 
Probably they have not. It would seem that such of the 
French army, as escaped by the way of St Tron, have been 
totally dissipated, for it is said that the enemy is in possession 
of Brussels ; and of course he must have come on from eighty 
to a hundred miles in the space of four or five days. 
</p><p>
The French have sent off everything they could save to Valenciennes, which is about sixty miles on this side of Brussels, 
and in which the broken remnants of their army will probably 
be collected. Going on the supposition that the allied army is 
at Brussels, it appears to me that Dumouriez is completely cut 
off, unless he be possessed of very considerable magazines, for 
he is, you know, in a horrible country. In front, a navigable 
river, and in the rear a pitiless desert until he gets back to the 
neighborhood of Antwerp, Malines and Louvain. 
</p><p>
Now the enemy could be at Malines as soon as at Brussels, 
these places being equidistant from LouvaiOj through which 
they must in either case have passed, and the distance from Malines to Antwerp is about one third of what Dumouriez had 
to pass over, unless he began his march as soon as he received 
the news, that the enemy were on their way to Maastricht. 
This intelligence did not I presume reach him till the night of 
the third, or morning of the fourth ; and it is a question of moment, whether he took instant, measures for his retreat, which 
must of necessity be slow through the very bad roads which 
he has to struggle with, till he gets to the pavement within 
about a league, if I remember right, of Antwerp. The intention of the enemy is, I am certain, to cut him off; and if that 
be done, God knows what will happen ; for the frontier towns 
are almost without garrisons, the whole force having been called off to the expedition against Holland. 
</p><p>
The force in the low countries has been stated very highly 
by those, who counted on success in that quarter, but I do not 
believe that the whole amounted to more than fifty, or at most sixty thousand ; and should those events, which are now probable, take place, very few of that number will get back again 
to France. I understand that the militia are to be drafted im 
mediately, and what may be the success of that measure can 
not be foreseen. I have not sufficient data on which to fix an 
opinion, but should it be accompanied by delay, or encounter 
opposition, the safety of Paris is more in distance than in 
force. I am, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
In mine of the ninth instant I mentioned to you&gt; that the 
enemy was in possession of Brussels, and so it was then asserted by authority, but it seems that he confined himself to Tongres and Liege, leaving the French army in possession of St Tron. At the same time it appears, that he was employed in 
pushing forward a column on his left, to turn their right flank, 
and had that movement been completed, the French army 
would, in all human probability, have been destroyed. To 
prevent the threatened danger, Miranda fell back to Lou vain, 
keeping open thereby the two roads to Antwerp and Brussels. 
</p><p>
As the enemy will doubtless endeavor to cut him off from 
the latter, I suppose that Dumouriez, relinquishing his expedition against the Netherlands, will form a junction with Miranda. In this case a battle must decide the fate of Flanders, 
and both parties will collect for the purpose all the force they 
can muster. I do not think the position taken at Louvain is 
tenable, because Brussels may be reached by the route of Namur, towards which the enemy will probably turn his 
attention in the first instance. 
</p><p>
Great exertions are making here to reinforce Dumouriez, 
and still greater to bring about a new revolution, whose effect, 
if successful, would be, I think, the destruction of what is called here the faction of the Gironde, and which calls itself the 
republican party, qualifying its enemies by the term Anarchists. To avoid if possible the carnage of the second to the 
eighth of last September, a tribunal, called the Revolutionary 
Tribunal, is organised, with very large and wide powers. It is 
one of those instruments whose operations are incalculable, 
and on whose direction depends the fate of the country. 
Opinion seems to set very strongly against the Convention. 
They are supposed to be incapable of steering the State ship 
in the present rough weather, but it must blow yet a little 
harder before they are thrown overboard. 
</p><p>
I believe I never mentioned to you that a constitution was 
reported ; but the truth is, that it totally escaped me. A 
paper of that sort was read at the Convention, but I learnt 
the next morning, that a council had been held on it over night, 
by which it was condemned ; so I thought no more of it, 
neither have I heard it mentioned until yesterday by one of 
my countrymen, which brought me to recollect that in my 
correspondence I had not noticed it. I am, with great respect 
and esteem, yours,

Sir, 
</p><p>
Many complaints have reached me respecting the outrages 
committed against American vessels, by the French privateers. 
I have taken no notice of it to you, Sir, until now, in the hope 
that such examples would not multiply ; and I have replied to 
many letters on this subject, which were addressed to me by 
our Minister Plenipotentiary at London, in a way to tranquillize 
the fears, with which the enemies of the French nation endeavored to inspire my countrymen. But it appears to me of the 
utmost importance to prevent, as speedily as possible, such violations of the law of nations and of treaties. 
</p><p>
I have already been informed of the capture of the ship 
Aurora, of Baltimore, by the privateer Patriot, of Marseilles ; 
of the brig Bacchus, also of Baltimore, by a privateer of Cette ; 
and of the ship Laurens, of Charleston, by the privateer Sans 
Culotte, of Honfleur. I will spare you, Sir, the melancholy 
recital of the violence committed on these different occasions; 
and which was the less excusable, as it was done after possession had been taken, and when no resistance was made. But 
I earnestly entreat you to give the necessary orders, that for 
the future these illegal acts, whose unhappy consequences are 
incalculable, may not be permitted. 
</p><p>
I take the liberty to recall to your mind on this point, the 
provisions of the fifteenth article of the treaty of commerce and 
amity between France and the United States of America, 
which was concluded at Paris, on the 6th of February, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>. 
Your justice, as well as your good sense, Sir, warrant me in 
the belief, that you will labor effectively to preserve the union 
between France and the United States ; a union, which will, I 
hope, subsist forever, and become more and more a common 
bond of prosperity and happiness. I have the honor to be, &c.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I enclose a copy of the letter from Dumouriez to the Convention, of the twelfth instant, which, not having been publicly 
read, he has caused to be printed in Flanders, and the enclosed 
is from Brussels. This letter, and the proclamations which 
accompanied it, form a singular contrast with the conduct pursued by that General on entering victoriously into the country, 
which I had the honor to communicate in mine of the twenty- 
first of December. It accords but badly also with a later 
transaction. He had opened a large loan, on his private credit and account, at Antwerp ; but the capitalists having no 
great confidence in him, it went on slowly ; and to stimulate 
their zeal, he threatened them with something very like military execution. 
</p><p>
Having mentioned, here, my letter of the twenty -first of 
December, I cannot avoid observing to you that the correspondence between Pache and Dumouriez, as published by the 
latter, shows that the orders given by Pache to reinforce Custine were far more extraodinary than I had conceived ; seeing 
he was directed to march in midwinter across the pathless 
mountains of the Ardennes, in which he could have found 
neither food, forage, nor shelter from the storms. Similar orders to Beurnouville had pushed him, as I therein informed 
you, on the road to Treves. No good opportunity offering, 
I did not then communicate the result of that expedition ; 
which by the bye was never made public here ; but the fact 
is, that he lost one half of his army, and those who returned 
were as fit for the hospital as for the field, almost ; so that 
the Austrian General, Beaulieu, pushed his advanced posts 
forward with impunity to the French frontier. 
</p><p>
In the enclosed letter of Dumouriez are three things worthy 
of notice. First, the great diminution of the French armies in that quarter ; secondly, the violence used to obtain 
an appearance of union with France ; and thirdly, the temper and disposition of the Flemish nation. On the first of 
these points, I refer for the force which he commanded on entering the Low Countries, to the above mentioned correspondence with Pache, mutilated as it is, and from which you will 
find that the account I had given you of his numbers was ex 
act. Between one hundred and one hundred and ten thou 
sand Frenchmen broke into the Low Countries last autumn, 
and yet what I told you on the first day of the present year, viz. 
that the effectives under Miranda and Valence, when united, did 
not exceed thirty-five thousand, is strictly true. But there 
were sundry posts and garrisons spread through the country, 
and all along to the sea coasts, making up about ten thousand 
more ; and it is true that many have come out of the hospitals, 
and many recruits have been sent on ; but some have gone in 
to the hospitals, and straggling parties have constantly returned, 
so that forty-five thousand men were about the existent force, 
previous to the efforts for the expedition to Holland, about all 
which I shall say more presently, and only observe here, that 
he states the army as being reduced by sickness, skirmishes, 
and desertion, to less than one half of their force. Such, says 
he, was our situation, when on the first of February you declared war against England and Holland. 
</p><p>
The second point, namely, the manner of obtaining three 
vote of the Belgic people for a union with France, I had mentioned to you in mine of the seventh instant, upon very full in 
formation from various quarters of that country. The account 
which Durnouriez gives, is a curious piece for history. The 
conduct, which may naturally be expected from men so abused, 
I had mentioned to you on the twenty-fifth of January, and as 
signed on the thirteenth of February the reason why they had 
not already avenged the injuries they had received. But no 
sooner did the movements towards Holland lessen the garrisons 
distributed among them, than the smothered flame began to 
break out, and the French have already paid pretty severely 
for a conduct, of which the instances in modern times are 
rare. 
</p><p>
In my last I mentioned to you that a battle appeared probable, and that it would decide the fate of the Low Countries. 
This battle took place definitively on the eighteenth, having 
been preceded by some warm skirmishes on the preceding 
days. As I mentioned on the ninth the whole force of the 
French, as not being more than from fifty to sixty thousand men, 
it may not be amiss to give here some general state of the force 
now at the disposition of the Republic. Speaking in round 
numbers, the force required was, about five hundred thousand, 
to complete which, an apportionment was made on the first instant of near three hundred thousand, viz. two hundred and 
ninety -six thousand five hundred and fifty- three, on the different departments, exclusively of the army of reserve, which we 
may suppose to consist of the paper surplus beyond five hun 
dred thousand, whatever that may be. Thus it would seem? 
that the existent force on the first instant, as borne on the re 
turns, was about two hundred thousand. 
</p><p>
This force is divided, and to be divided, into eight different 
armies, viz. that of the North, commanded by Dumouriez ; the 
Ardennes, by Valence ; the Moselle, by Beurnonville ; the 
Rhine, by Custine ; the Alps, by Kellermann ; Italy, by Biron ; 
the Pyrenees, by Servan ; and the Sea Coast, by Labourdonnaye. Deducting from the supposed existing force, for garri 
sons, sick, posts, and communications, and the numberless 
contingencies of service, eighty to ninety thousand, we have 
remaining a total of one hundred and ten thousand to one hundred and twenty thousand, in the different armies under arms. 
</p><p>
So much for a general view. I will now give a more particular one coincident therewith. The army of Dumouriez 
may be stated at ninety thousand, that of Custine fifty-four 
thousand, that of Biron at eighteen thousand, those of Valence 
and Beurnonville, each seven thousand, those of Kellermann, 
Servan and Labourdonnaye each nine thousand, making together two hundred and three thousand. But of these there are 
only the three first worth noting here, as the others are all in different posts and garrisons. And, by the way, that we may finish at once with Biron's army, (intended to be about fifty thousand strong, but avowedly defective on the first instant about 
thirty two thousand,) as it has been in a kind of small action 
for the last three months, and must keep up sundry posts in the 
county of Nice, and on the communications, the total operative force cannot exceed twelve thousand men. 
</p><p>
We shall come to Custine by and bye ; but at present we 
will return to the northern army. As this was to be exposed 
to the greatest efforts of the enemy, and as the government 
counted on success in that quarter for the means to dictate its 
own terms of peace, the force of it was to be one hundred 
and forty thousand ; but the avowed deficiency being fifty 
thousand, leaves the above number of ninety thousand, deducting therefrom twenty-five thousand for the several garrisons 
(of which there are at least a dozen) and for the sick, we have 
a remainder of sixty-five thousand, of which fifteen thousand 
were under Dumouriez in Holland. 
</p><p>
The armies, then, of Miranda and Valence did not exceed 
five thousand, and the enemy give an account of above ten 
thousand of these in the affairs of the 28th February to the 
4th March, besides what may have gone off in different directions. The army, therefore, which Dumouriez commanded at 
Louvain on the fifteenth instant, could not exceed forty thou 
sand. His loss between that and the nineteenth was at least 
twenty thousand. He cannot therefore on the twentieth have 
had more than twenty thousand left. Probably about fifteen 
thousand. From the Dutch expedition, if ever they get back, 
not more than ten thousand can ever join him, because the 
losses in that quarter also have been considerable. When the 
want of discipline and the desertions are considered, you will 
see that there remains but a very trifling force to be scattered 
through the frontier towns, in addition to the very weak garri 
sons above mentioned. If this army be cut off, it seems to me 
that the towns cannot be all defended, and if ever it should re 
turn, a very strict defensive is the utmost which can be expected. 
</p><p>
It is proper, in this place, to say something about the plans 
and movements of the enemy. From the best information I 
have been able to procure, it seems that the Allies intended to 
open the campaign in the first fortnight of April, at which period the different armies were to be completed. The Austrians 
under the Prince de Cobourg, including those on the Moselle under the Prince de Hohenloe, were to be near ninety thousand 
strong ; the British and Hanoverians were to be twenty thou 
sand ; the Prussians, with some troops of the Empire, about 
twenty to thirty thousand. The Dutch contingent depended 
on circumstances. The scattering bodies of emigrants also 
formed an eventual force. The whole might perhaps be carried to one hundred and fifty thousand, from which it might 
be well to deduct one third for posts, garrisons, contingencies, 
maladies, and deficiencies. On the first of April, therefore, 
the Prince de Cobourg would have been at the head of at 
least one hundred thousand men, although not all united. 
</p><p>
He was obliged to commence his operations a month or six 
weeks sooner than had been agreed on, because the Prince of Hesse, commanding in Maestricht, informed him that he could 
not answer much longer for the defence of that place, a great 
part of his garrison being illy disposed, and the citizens unwilling to resist while their houses were crumbling about their ears 
I have reason to believe that the information I received of an 
offer to surrender was unfounded. In this state of things a 
council of war was held, and it was resolved to undertake, at 
all hazards, the raising of the siege. This was done by the 
Prince of Cobourg, at the head of about twenty-five thousand 
men. The Prussians, under Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, 
came up the Meuse on the side of Cleves and Wezel, with a 
body of ten to fifteen thousand men, and drove the French 
from Ruremonde. The French lost in these affairs not less 
than twelve thousand men, killed, wounded, and taken, besides 
the dispersion of their troops in different directions. 
</p><p>
The stores taken at Liege were immense. Of artillery 
alone, above one hundred pieces of different caliber, as is 
said. The Austrians suffered very little, since it was rather 
a rout than a battle. The Prussians lost some men. These 
last marched, soon after, to Bois le Due, to effect a junction 
with the British troops. The Austrians prepared for action 
again as soon as they were recovered from their fatigue, and 
had made the needful dispositions. To this effect, orders 
seem to have been given to General Beaulieu to advance 
towards the Meuse from Luxembourg, and to the Prince de 
Hohenloe to replace the force of Beaulieu ; but this line being 
long and parallel to the French frontier, the movements must 
be made with caution ; and the more so, as a month was to 
elapse before the corps of Beaulieu and Hohenloe were to be 
completed. 
</p><p>
The Prince de Cobourg seems to have sent off, however, a 
column of between eight and ten thousand men on the side of 
Namur, for the purpose of dislodging the French, opening, the 
whole course of the Meuse up to the French frontier, forming 
a junction with the army of Beaulieu, and eventually cutting 
off the retreat of the French army, by possessing a post in 
their rear between Mons and Brussels, should they retire 
towards Valenciennes. 
</p><p>
Such was the state of things when Dumouriez joined the 
army, which had fallen back to Louvain. He sent off, I 
presume, his orders immediately to evacuate Holland, so as 
to form a junction with those troops, and make good his 
retreat ; but shortly after, finding that the column of Austrians just mentioned was advancing rapidly on his right, 
sensible that his enemy would, if suffered quietly to collect 
his force, be soon superior in numbers, and that his whole 
army must, in consequence, be cut off; he determined as a 
last resource, to fight them, because a victory would give him 
time to receive reinforcements, and secure the doubtful junction with the army in Holland. 
</p><p>
The army of the Prince de Cobourg must, at this time, 
have been inferior to Dumouriez, because, even supposing 
that he had collected from the Rhine men sufficient to occupy the posts in his rear, and to carry his army to the number 
of near thirty thousand, yet the detachment on his left had 
reduced it to twenty thousand. He had pushed forward his 
advanced posts to Tirlemont, but the army of Dumouriez 
drove them back, and this latter General marched forward by 
his right, so as to cut off the communication between the 
main body of the Austrians and the corps, which had been detached on their left. If under these circumstances he had 
gained a victory, it would have been decisive. It was on the 
same field that the Mareschal de Luxembourg beat King 
William, the twenty-ninth of July, <a href='/results.php?year=1693'>1693</a>, and nearly in the 
same respective positions. 
</p><p>
The event however was reversed. The action was very 
warm, and although Dumouriez writes to one of his officers 
that the retreat was a knowing or skilful one, (savante) he 
appears to be more indebted to the night, than to his general 
ship, or to the manoeuvres of his troops, for his left wing was 
cut to pieces, and his right very severely handled. The 
great superiority of the enemy's cavalry would, in those circumstances, have wholly destroyed his army, had the day 
light continued. Although we have no account of the 
enemy's loss, we may well suppose it to have been consider 
able, and of course much was to be done before they could 
attack the French, who had taken a strong post near Lou vain, 
and the more so, as by persisting in his movement to the left, 
the Prince de Cobourg might hope to prevent Dumouriez 
from getting back to the frontier towns, and in the mean time 
his reinforcements were coming on. 
</p><p>
It was under these circumstances that Dumouriez prepared 
for his retreat. To that effect, after having collected his scattered forces at Cumptich, he retired to Louvain, and sent off 
his stores and artillery from Brussels. The sick were taken 
away, as I am told, by water on the twenty-second, when the 
Commissioners from the National Assembly also left Brussels, 
and then some parties of the Austrians had, it is said, appeared 
in the neighborhood. It would seem, then, that the plan of 
Dumouriez, who is said to be on his retreat towards Mons, is 
to go to Tournai, in order to form there a junction with the 
troops from Holland, to whose protection it would seem that 
he has committed his sick and wounded, who may be forwarded to Ghent, and thence by the canals along through West Flanders to the French territory. 
</p><p>
In this way he will cover the retreat of the troops from 
Holland by the Scheldt, and the reinforcements intended for 
his army will be thrown into Valenciennes, and he himself 
will take post eventually near Lisle. This plan supposes the 
evacuation of all Flanders, which indeed seems to be indispen 
sable, for in three weeks from the present time the enemy will 
be in complete force. He may, as it were, immediately collect fifty thousand men, by bringing up the Prussian and British troops, and these again may be followed by the Dutch and 
Hanoverians. 
</p><p>
Now on the supposition that Dumouriez should extricate 
himself in the course of ten days, he would not, on the whole 
frontier from Valenciennes to Dunkirk have more than fifty 
thousand men ; and that, on the supposition that the recruits 
should have joined, to the number of ten thousand, so as to 
replace deserters and supply the deficiencies of sick and 
unfit for duty, which bear daily a greater proportion to the 
whole number, as losses in action and by desertion increase. 
</p><p>
I expect that in a very few days the campaign will open on 
the side of the Rhine, and this circumstance will leave the 
Prince de Hohenloe more master of his motions, seeing that 
a column of troops under the orders of the Duke of Brunswick 
will be of course sent to occupy the passes along the Rhine 
above Coblentz, and as the two armies of the Ardennes and the 
Moselle (which on the first of the month did not exceed 
from sixteen to twenty thousand men) cannot be increased in 
any reasonable time, beyond what may be necessary for the 
garrisons on that frontier, and to prevent the enemy from entering by the Meuse. The left of the Prince de Cobourg's 
army may bend all its efforts that way, and I daily expect to 
hear of a stroke in that quarter. 
What may be the fate of Custine, I know not. He has 
taken great pains to fortify himself, and to defend the banks of 
the Rhine from Switzerland to below Mayence ; but these 
very precautions would seem to render the passage certain, 
because it is next to impossible that a line so long should be 
defended through all its extent. 
</p><p>
. The King of Prussia seems determined to take Mayence, 
let it cost what it may. The inhabitants are universally in his 
favor, and should Custine, who is a brave but a blundering 
soldier, be taken with his army, the whole province of Alsace 
is lost. It may indeed fall in a different way, for I am well 
convinced that the imperial troops will make a serious effort in 
the upper end of it ; and here the conduct of Switzerland be 
comes important. People differ much on that subject, but I 
believe that England will have a very large body of Swiss in 
her pay to act in conjunction with the Austrian troops, and 
that having penetrated to Befort, which is but about thirty miles 
from Basil, the ulterior movement will depend on the existent 
state of things between the armies at Mayence. In one contingency an effort may be made to penetrate to Besan^on, distant 
about fifty miles, and thence to Lyons, which is distant from 
Besan^on, along the rivers Doux and Soane, by Dole and 
Chalons, about one hundred and fifty miles, but by the road, 
seventy. I need not say, that the possession of Lyons would 
oblige both Kellermann and Biron to retreat, and open the 
whole of that country to the troops of Savoy, whatever might 
have been the previous situation of those armies ; for you 
know, that on that quarter the difficulty of subsisting in the 
country is much greater than that of keeping the enemy out 
of it. 
</p><p>
I had mentioned to you, in mine of the seventh instant, my 
idea as to the recruiting, if forced forward immediately. It 
has been tolerably successful. In some places very much so. 
In others it has met with serious opposition. Upper Britanny 
is in revolt, and both Nantz and Rennes are menaced, while 
a descent is apprehended at St Malo. Does the insurrection 
proceed from a plan laid by the enemy, or from impulses of 
the moment? Both may have concurred, but I think that, 
like the campaign, it has happened sooner than was expected. 
It is, however, very serious, and should they take St Malo, 
and receive a supply of arms, ammunition, and provisions, with 
a few troops and a little money from England, it is not possible to calculate the extent of mischief; for Normandy is, I am 
persuaded, ready to revolt as soon as a fair opportunity offers ; 
and it is in that quarter, that I supposed a descent would be 
made, and I am still of that opinion, and that the movements 
mentioned in mine of the thirteenth of last month will take 
place. 
</p><p>
In the midst of these troubles, with an expense which last 
month exceeded the receipts near two hundred millions of 
livres, (worth at present prices at least four millions sterling) 
the insurrection which I formerly mentioned, as likely to take 
place against the Brissotins, is still in agitation, and will in a 
few days, most probably, take effect. 
</p><p>
I enclose a copy of my letter of the 24th instant to <a href="/results.php?tla=leb" rel="met colleague">M. Lebrun</a>, 
respecting the capture of American vessels, which will sufficiently explain itself. I ought also to mention to you, which I 
omitted in its due season, that M. Genet before he went hence 
called to take leave, and apologised for <a href="/results.php?tla=leb" rel="met colleague">M. Lebrun</a>, on account 
of his constant business, for not calling on me to present M. 
Genet, &c. &c. The truth is, that I attach very little importance to these matters, whether of compliment or inattention, and I believe that I estimate them at their true 
value. I am, &c.

Sir, 
</p><p>
Yesterday afternoon I was arrested in the street, and conducted to the Section de la Butte des Moulins, because I had 
not a Carte de Citoyen. Fortunately a person who knew me, having heard what had passed, came to my rescue, and brought me out of the affair, on his own responsibility. I have 
the honor to send you, herewith, the copy of the pass given me by the Section. I beg, Sir, that you will have the goodness to secure me against similar accidents, troublesome in 
themselves, and scandalous from their publicity. 
</p><p>
I pray you, also, to grant me protection from domiciliary visits. Armed men came into my house yesterday, and although I had every reason to be satisfied with their conduct, (for they 
went away as soon as I convinced them of the impropriety of their proceedings,) yet I think that when general orders are 
given for these visits, such houses ought to be excepted as are under the protection of the Law of Nations. 
</p><p>
Will you do me the favor also to send me a passport for travelling into the interior ? In the month of January it happened to me to be arrested and sent back to Paris, under pretence 
that the passport you gave me was out of date. I am in expectation of going forthwith to pass a few days at my country house, and it may be that I shall be again stopped. 
</p><p>
Will you have the goodness, Sir, to sign the enclosed certificates for the members of my family ? I have the honor 
to be, &c.

Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor of receiving yours of the 29th of March, and 
in consequence I send the enclosed formula of the certificates 
of registry, with which American vessels ought to be furnished. 
Our government grants these certificates only to those vessels, 
which belong exclusively to American citizens. They must 
also have been built in the United States, or at least have 
belonged since the sixteenth of May, <a href='/results.php?year=1789'>1789</a>, to American 
citizens. The law of the United States also exacts, that the 
captain be an American citizen, and that before the vessel is 
recorded, one of the owners shall make attestation under oath, 
of the truth of these facts. In fine, captains and owners are 
forbidden to give, sell, or lend these certificates, and in case 
they are made use of by any foreign vessel under the American flag, the offender shall incur the penalty of confiscation. 
</p><p>
Such, Sir, are the regulations made on the 1st of September, <a href='/results.php?year=1789'>1789</a>; and I have not learned that since that time there 
have been others. I have read, it is true, in one of our gazettes, that in the course of the month of January, a new law 
on the subject had been presented to the President of the 
United States for his acceptance, but I am ignorant of its con 
tents, not having yet received a copy of it. I am persuaded 
however that it does not differ essentially (as to the subject 
in question) from that which I have just had the honor of presenting to you. I shall hasten to communicate it to you as soon 
as it arrives, for it is my inclination, as well as my duty, to 
prevent as much as possible foreigners, and especially the enemies of France, from enjoying the privileges of our neutrality. 
</p><p>
I am fully persuaded, Sir, of the friendly disposition of the 
French republic towards that of America, and I shall continue 
to render a faithful account of it, for I sincerely desire to 
strengthen more and more the bonds, which unite the two countries. Will you have the goodness to give me a copy of the decrees passed by the Convention, to which you did me the honor to refer ? Hitherto I have been unable, in my despatches, 
to speak of them except in general terms, as they have not 
been communicated to me in any other manner, than through 
the very uncertain channel of the gazettes. I have the honor 
to be, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Enclosed you have copies of <a href="/results.php?tla=leb" rel="met colleague">M. Lebrun's</a> letters to me of 
the twenty-sixth of March, mine to him of the twenty-eighth, 
and his to me of the twenty-ninth. I also enclose under this 
cover the journal of the debates and decrees. These will 
give you the present state of our news up to the last even 
ing. 
</p><p>
You will perceive, that all my conjectures respecting the 
army of Dumouriez are more than realized. From the 
letters of Custine you will perceive that he has been totally 
defeated, for he found it necessary to fall back about forty 
miles, leaving a garrison in Mayence, which must fall of course, 
and we may hourly expect to hear of farther misfortunes in 
that quarter. Perhaps the Prussian army may stop to besiege 
Mayence, but I think a part of their force will be sufficient 
for that purpose. The country, as I have mentioned in a 
former letter, is universally indisposed to France, and I can 
say on good information the same thing of Savoy. 
</p><p>
It is now very fine weather in this city, and if the season 
be proportionably advanced in other quarters, the campaign 
will be soon opened on every side. There will be a great 
want of bread before we have another harvest, unless peace 
should take place. If Lisle and Valenciennes should surrender at once, the campaign in that quarter will not be so much 
advanced as might be apprehended, because as yet the m aga-zines are not brought up, and time must be allowed for that 
purpose. 
</p><p>
It seems indeed probable, that the enemy have taken considerable magazines belonging to France, but even these are 
at some distance. I expect every hour to hear of an attempt 
upon Givet or Maubeuge, and it would seem from the best in 
formation to be had, that neither of these places can be defend-ed long. In short, on every side, the horizon looks darkly. 
Whether Dumouriez will be able to lead his army against Pa 
ris, seems as yet uncertain. Perhaps he may experience a 
similar fate to that of Lafayette, but he is in much better circumstances for a high game, and much abler to play it. At 
any rate, the enemy derive advantage from the squabble between him and the Convention. Here they are not yet fully 
apprised of their danger. Like those who die of a hectic, 
hope gleams to the last, and the latest breath is spent in expression of some splendid fancy. In the expiring struggles, 
however, let them happen when they may, we shall experience new horrors. Such, at least, is the probable chance. 
</p><p>
The constant complaints on account of the capture of Ame 
rican vessels, and the necessity of giving protection to such of 
our countrymen, as are here, have prevented me hitherto 
from leaving Paris. At present, the barriers are strictly guard 
ed, and those who have applied lately for passports have been 
disappointed ; but in a few days we shall know something 
more upon this subject. The ministry seem to be in a fair way 
towards an entire dissolution. In short, everything here is in 
almost as much confusion as on the frontiers. I am, &tc.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I did myself the honor of writing to you yesterday. Colonel Touzard, who takes charge of my letters, having been 
detained a day longer, it furnishes the opportunity of sending 
this day's gazettes, and such intelligence as is now arrived. 
</p><p>
It appears that the army of Dumouriez is attached to him, 
and will go all the lengths which he desires. What is worse, 
te that the militia also adhere, so that he has all chances now 
in his favor, and probably as soon as the magazines are duly 
replenished he will advance, for under such circumstances we 
are not to expect much resistance from the frontier towns. 
The affair of Custine has been very serious. 
</p><p>
The garrison of Mayence is shut up in that town, and if it 
capitulates the enemy will derive from the magazines lodged in 
it the means needful for ulterior operations. Hence I conclude, 
that such terms will be offered as will be accepted. Custine's 
left flank is entirely open, and in all human probability the 
several passes in the Vosges mountains will be occupied by 
the column of Hessians, and in that case his retreat to France 
becomes impossible, and he must make the best of it in 
Alsace. Every hour is now big with important events, and 
how matters will go in this city, the Lord knows. I am, &c.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Since mine of the fifth, I learn that the militia have, in general, quitted the standard of Dumouriez, but he has about twelve 
thousand of the regular troops, and there is reason to believe 
that others mean to join him. The terror excited by his defection begins to subside, or rather it is suspended until some 
great blow shall be struck. There seems to be more of treason in this country than was imagined, and every day increases 
suspicion, which, whether well or ill founded, has always the 
effect of distracting the public councils. 
</p><p>
Most people wonder at the delay of the Prince de Cobourg; 
but, besides the necessity of collecting his magazines, artillery, 
&c., which is a very heavy affair, I have reason to believe that 
he waits until some other schemes are ready for execution, 
and, therefore, it may be yet four or five days before he commences the siege of Valenciennes. Conde is a needful preliminary, as in that place he must receive the various supplies 
which come up the Scheldt. It cannot hold out long. 
</p><p>
You will observe that Dumouriez, and, after him, the Prince 
de Cobourg, declare themselves in favor of the late Constitution, with such alterations as the nation may adopt ; and the 
latter gives the most solemn assurances, that he will not meddle 
with the internal affairs of France. His conduct is wise, and 
will doubtless gain them a considerable party in the country, if 
they act consistently with those declarations. It is said here, 
(and those who say so to me, tell me that they speak on good 
authority,) that the powers allied against France begin already 
to be disunited. That they will disagree, if very successful, 
there can be little doubt, because they are actuated by different interests and motives ; but, I think that at present, those 
who assert the disunion rather speak from induction than from 
information. Custine has retired, you see, to Weissenbourg, 
and there he has a bad position. The enemy will probably 
attempt to cut off his retreat, before they attack him in front. 
As yet, we do not learn that the Austrians have crossed the 
Rhine in Upper Alsace, and that will be, perhaps, a preliminary to the operations against him. 
</p><p>
As far as I can judge of the public mind, it appears that 
there is a general state of suspense. Success, on either side, 
will fix the opinions of a very great number, who will then act, 
to show their sincerity. Here, they hang people for giving 
their opinion in favor of Royalty, (that is, they cut off their 
heads,) but yet, I am told, that such opinion is openly avowed 
and supported in the streets. I am told, that there is a majority, even of the Convention, who think a King necessary ; but, 
as they see the loss of their own lives, in connexion with the 
re-establishment of the throne, it is not to be supposed, that 
they would tell such thoughts ; and, therefore, the information 
may well be suspected. Time will show that there are among 
them some false brethren; and, certainly, the most intelligent 
must be convinced, that the republican virtues are not yet of 
Gallic growth. 
The Duke of Orleans is in the way of reaping the fruits of 
his conduct, being, as you will see, sent a prisoner to Marseilles. 
The storm thickens all around us ; but, as yet, one cannot certainly determine how it will burst. The attempts made to ex 
cite disturbances in Paris have hitherto proved ineffectual ; but 
that stroke seems to be reserved for the moment when the 
Deputies, now in commission in the departments, shall return. 
It is possible, merely possible, that all may go off smoothly ; 
but the chances are greatly the other way. I am, &LC. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gom" rel="me">Gouverneur Morris</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I should have mentioned that, I am told, there is a 
plan in operation here to detach Great Britain from the con 
federation, and to make a separate peace with her; but I am 
persuaded that the attempt, in itself vain, must fail, from the 
parties said to be employed, if from no other cause.

Sir, 
</p><p>
I have just learned that the National Convention, in its session of the ninth, has authorised French ships of war and privateers to stop, and bring into the ports of the Republic, neutral 
vessels which shall be found loaded, wholly or in part, either 
with eatables belonging to a neutral power, shipped for enemies 
ports, or with merchandize belonging to enemies, which merchandize is declared good prize. 
</p><p>
I am ignorant, Sir, of the reasons which might explain the 
motives that led to the making of this decree, but I think I 
foresee, that the regulations just adopted by the Convention respecting eatables, will be eagerly followed by its maritime ene 
mies, and that in future the speculations of neutral commerce 
will, in fact, depend on the naval superiority of the belligerent 
powers. 
As to the dispositions of the decree, with respect to enemies 
merchandize shipped on board neutral vessels, I might go in 
to minute observations on the subject, if this point were to be 
decided upon by a treaty now to be made; but this being al 
ready definitely determined by the treaty of commerce, between France and the United States of America, I will only 
observe, Sir, that by the general terms in which the decree is 
expressed, its provisions might be extended to American vessels, which certainly could not enter into the views of the 
Convention. 
</p><p>
It seems to me then of immediate importance, that a decree 
should be made supplementary to that of the ninth, limiting the 
application of it, in accordance with justice and the good faith 
of the French nation. I have the honor to be, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
You will see by the gazettes the state of affairs as given to 
the public ; but much allowance must be made, as I have 
already had occasion to mention. It is, however, clear that 
the greater part of those troops, which adhered to Dumouriez, 
have returned to their country and many to their standards. 
It is evident, also, that the Prince de Cobourg's conduct in holding out against the old constitution has been disapproved by his masters and their associates, since he has found it pro 
per to recall that proclamation ; but whether it be for what is 
there said as to the government, or as to the territory of 
France, may admit of doubt ; perhaps there may be a little of 
both in the objections made against it. 
</p><p>
The delay to be noticed in the operations of the allied 
armies proves, in my opinion, two important facts ; one, that 
they mean to leave as little as possible to chance, and, there 
fore, wait the arrival of all their forces ; and, the other, that 
the original plans of the campaign are to be steadily pursued. 
Hence I infer, that the supposed disunion, mentioned in my 
last, does not exist in any essential degree. It seems that the 
Austrian artillery was not come up, until very lately, so as to 
open the trenches against Conde, which hitherto has been 
rather invested than besieged. It seems also that the Han 
overian troops have come on so slowly, as to have given every 
advantage to the French armies in Holland, if the successes 
of the Prince de Cobourg in Flanders had not rendered the 
proposed invasion abortive. However, the period being now 
arrived, about which it might reasonably be expected that the 
weather would permit of offensive operations, and the coun 
try afford resources to the cavalry of the armies, we shall 
soon know somewhat of the comparative strength of parties. 
</p><p>
On the northern frontier, they have to besiege not only 
Conde, but Valenciennes, Bouchain, and Cambray, in order 
to open a road in the direct line of advance ; besides which, 
it would seem, that they want Douay and Arras on the right, 
with Bavay and Maubeuge on the left, to cover their flanks. 
Hence results the formation of seven sieges after Conde, in 
order to open the road fairly to Paris, while on the sea coast 
they would want only Dunkirk and Calais ; after which, they 
might march surely along the coast, taking possession of the 
ports, and erecting slight works to cover their retreat, should 
retreat become necessary. I am persuaded, therefore, that 
the main efforts will be made still in that last direction, unless 
intelligences are established in the towns on the other route. 
</p><p>
I learn, but on slender authority, that the citizens of Valenciennes and the regular troops are not disposed to resist. 
The militia, or volontaires, are, however, well determined. I 
know that the government are very apprehensive as to Normandy, and I still believe in a descent there, and consequent 
revolt. You will have seen that the insurgents on the south 
west of the Loire have had hitherto very great success, 
although the gazettes have teemed with accounts of the vic 
tories obtained over them. That they have hitherto received 
no succor from abroad, confirms me in my opinion, that the 
main blow is to be struck on the side of Normandy, unless 
indeed the enemies of France are absolutely blind. 
</p><p>
I learn that the army of Biron has suffered very severely 
in the defeats, all published as victories gained over the Piedmontese. However, as yet the French territory, notwith 
standing the numerous foes, remains untouched, though on all 
sides greatly menaced. 
</p><p>

My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
When yours of the twenty-eighth of January reached me, 
(long after it was written) the war with Spain, with (but to 
cut short all enumeration,) the European world, put it out 
of my power to send you an answer. I write now merely to 
take the chances which may offer, and to tell you that I stil 
exist. I will tell you further, that I am here on the banks of 
the Seine, in a neat little house, in a pretty little garden, with 
some green trees, and more green grass than my neighbors, 
for you will observe, that we are so scorched by a long 
drought, that, in spite of all philosophic notions, we are beginning our processions to obtain the favor of the bon Dieu. 
</p><p>
Were it proper for un homme public et protestant to interfere, I should be tempted to tell them, that mercy is before 
sacrifice. I remember that about a year (or indeed eighteen 
months) ago, I was desired in a large society to draw the horoscope of France, to which I answered, that it might be done 
in three words Guerre, Famine, Peste. This, which appeared 
to me at the time more than possible, has long been certain as 
to a part, and but too probable for what remains. I pray God 
the prediction be not fully accomplished. 
</p><p>
I will not speak to you of news or of politics, because I will 
give no temptation to interrupt my letter, and because the 
contents would not deserve the name of news, when they 
should happen to arrive. Adieu, my dear Sir.

I have now the honor to transmit the copy of the decision 
made by the municipality of Dunkirk, on the third instant, respecting the ship Fame, which I received last night, in a letter 
from that place, of the seventh, which informs mo that the 
ship had then sailed. 
</p><p>
I have just now written to <a href="/results.php?tla=leb" rel="met colleague">M. Lebrun</a>, (who, by the bye, is 
en etat d arrestation) a letter of acknowledgment, a copy of 
which is enclosed. I did this the more readily, because I 
shall have new complaints to make, in all human probability, 
for in the best regulated governments it is difficult to prevent 
the violation of the rights of neutral powers, and much more 
so, where, in the tempest of a revolution, government resem-bles more a weathercock, marking from whence the hurricane 
comes, than a tower to resist its force. Whenever a good 
opportunity presents itself, I shall take the liberty to hazard 
my opinion on the late events, for I cannot say revolution, be 
cause it is not quite determined whether that shall be the con 
ventional appellation of what passed in the end of May. I 
am, &c.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have just received the copy of a declaration, made by the 
captain and crew of the American ship, the Little Cherub, 
which proves that this ship, having taken on board thirty French 
passengers, whom the Spanish government had sent away, 
conducted them to Havre ; which place he left on the third in 
stant, provided with a passport from the Executive Council, for 
going to Hamburg ; that, on the evening of the sixth, being 
then near Dunkirk, he was taken by the privateer, le Vrai 
Patriote, and the lugger, FJlrgu-s, belonging to the Republic, 
and conducted to this latter port ; that the captain and crew 
have been very ill treated, although they made no resistance ; 
and that the French having entire possession of the American 
ship, one of them seized the second mate by the collar, and 
without the slightest provocation blew his brains out. Facts 
of so serious a nature oblige me, Sir, to make complaint to 
you, and earnestly beg that a strict search may be made into 
this business, and in case they should be proved to be such as 
they were represented to me, that the murderer may be punished with death. 
</p><p>
I was much astonished, Sir, to learn, some days since, that 
the Convention had repealed, on the 28th of last month, its de 
cree of the 23d, and that consequently the provisions of the 
decree of the 9th, acknowledged to be contrary to the treaty 
by that of the 23d, were again in force. I could not believe 
it, but a copy of the decree has been sent to me. 
</p><p>
I see that the Committee of Public Safety, in conjunction 
with that of the Marine, was charged with making a definitive 
report on this affair, in the course of three days. It is very 
important to pass a definitive resolution respecting it, for the 
fate of a rich cargo is already depending on it, and we must 
expect to see contests of this kind multiply, in which cupidity on one side, and fear on the other, give rise to calumnious in 
sinuations, which lead persons of little information to believe, 
that national decisions are influenced by individual interests- 
I have the honor to be, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
This will, I expect, accompany my last, of the twelfth 
instant, no opportunity having offered since it was written, I 
do myself the honor to enclose herein the copy of what I wrote 
on the nineteenth instant to <a href="/results.php?tla=leb" rel="met colleague">M. Lebrun</a>, respecting an atrocious 
violation of our Flag, and respecting a very extraordinary step 
taken by the Convention in the repeal, on the motion of a 
member, of the decree by which our ships were exempted 
from the seizure, to which those of others were exposed. I 
was informed that the object of the decree I complain of was, 
to effect the confiscation of a large cargo belonging to citizens 
of the State of South Carolina, and which has been some time 
since acquitted at Havre ; but an appeal was made from the de 
cision of the court, though grounded on the clearest principles. 
The captors then declared, that they would obtain a decree 
for the confiscation, by means of their friends in the Conven 
tion, and some time afterwards that of the ninth of May 
appeared, in which a retrospective clause covered precisely 
the object they had in view. Such a coincidence of circumstances was somewhat remarkable. However, I made no 
allusion to it in my first application, which, as you will have 
seen, produced the desired effect, being the decree of the 
twenty-third of May. The interested parties, as soon as this 
decree was passed, went to work, as I was afterwards 
informed, and by force of money, as my informant says, produced the decree of the twenty-eighth. Certain it is, that the 
former was not sent to be enregistered until after the latter had 
passed, and then both were immediately forwarded together. 
It did not become me to give ear to calumnious suggestions, 
nor yet could I be totally deaf to a matter of such general 
importance to the United States. You will perceive, in the 
close of my letter to <a href="/results.php?tla=leb" rel="met colleague">M. Lebrun</a>, some general observations, 
which will render the corrupted members (if such there be) a 
little more cautious. I shall enclose herewith <a href="/results.php?tla=leb" rel="met colleague">M. Lebrun's</a> 
answer of the twenty-first instant to mine of the nineteenth. I 
had directed Mr Coffyn, the agent at Dunkirk, to cause a 
prosecution to be commenced against the murderer of our 
fellow citizen. 
</p><p>
In a letter written long since, I mentioned to you, Sir, that 
I was in quest of Monsieur M. I have since found him and 
conversed with him. He is immensely rich, but seems to 
have been the father of his own fortune, amassed, as fortunes 
frequently are, without rendering the possessor respectable. 
If I can judge from his countenance, the inquiry was set on 
foot in the hope of negative answers, and the affirmative is, ofcourse, not pleasing. Certain it is, that he showed no inclination to spare to the necessities of his nephews a part of his own 
abundance ; but this is the less reprehensible, in that he treats 
himself no better than his needy relations. 
</p><p>
Your favor of the twentieth of April reached me two days 
ago, and now I have those of the eighth of that month, and 
twelfth and fifteenth of March. To the contents of the last 
mentioned letter, I shall pay all due attention, whenever 
opportunities can be found or made for the purpose. I am 
happy to find, by what you say in the beginning of yours of the 
twelfth of March, that your sentiments accord so entirely 
with those, which I had the honor to express in mine of the 
twenty-second of August, and that the conduct, which I had 
thought it proper to pursue, is thereby justified. My corres ondence with Mr Short will have shown you, Sir, that I have 
been very far from questioning the principles which you state, 
and I perfectly agree, that there is little difficulty or embarrassment in the application of clear principles, when the facts are 
clear. 
</p><p>
But while events are doubtful, the feebleness of human 
foresight may, I hope, be pardoned for hesitating, where things 
of vast moment depend on the steps to be immediately taken. 
A man of eminence in the late revolution, and who has since 
left France, urged me much to go away shortly after the tenth 
of August. As I had not, and have not, any reason to question, either on my own account, or on that of my country, the 
sincerity of his advice, I could only examine the ground of his 
judgment, which has always been esteemed a good one. We 
differed in opinion ; but this sentiment he expressed strongly, 
In your case, said he, I would go to England or Holland, 
and from thence state the existing facts, and ask my Court to 
decide on my conduct, without waiting for future events. As 
it was clear from hence, that his reflections turned principally on my personal situation, I told him that my conduct would be 
influenced by considerations totally different ; and, therefore, 
conceiving it to be most conducive to the interests of the United States, I should stay. 
</p><p>
In the present moment, you will observe, Sir, by the public 
papers, that a majority of the departments declare themselves 
against the authority of the present Convention, after the arrestment of their fellow members, just as in the month of June 
last, a similar majority declared their execration of the at 
tempts on Louis the Sixteenth. But who will venture to tell us 
what August is to produce ? No small part of France is in 
open war with the rest; and wherever the insurgents arrive, it 
appears that the whole country is friendly to them ; so that, if 
one were to judge by what passes in that quarter, France 
would be nearly unanimous in the re-establishment of royalty, 
should they come in force to Paris. Then the established principle of administration would undoubtedly be, that all which 
has been done within the last year was an abominable usurpation, &LC. &ic. And without questioning our principles of government, they might dissent from the application of them, by the 
subtle distinction between the voice of a nation, and what would 
then be called the voice of a faction. Under circumstances 
of this sort, I am particularly happy to have received your orders, which I shall implicitly obey. Accept, I pray you, 
my sincere thanks for having given them so opportunely. 
</p><p>
I will apply to the Minister for the orders you wish respecting payments to our citizens, and I make no doubt that they 
will be transmitted. -And, indeed, I should suppose that if, 
without such orders, the payments were made by the treasury 
of the United States, the government of this country (let what 
ever government may be established) would allow the justice 
of a deduction to the amount from what we owe. It is possible that we may hereafter have occasion to insist on that principle, among other reasons, because of the plundering of our 
ships, of which complaints are daily made to me; and which 
the present government of this country is too feeble to prevent. 
</p><p>
Doubtless there are many things of the sort, which do not 
come to my knowledge ; for, in some cases, the masters and 
crews, being taken out of the American ships and put on board 
the privateers, are carried very far from where their vessels 
arrive, and put on shore where chance directs or circumstances 
permit ; and, as many of the privateers are taken by British 
cruisers, some of our citizens may find their way to England, 
and some to the British colonies and foreign possessions. 
</p><p>
I am very happy to find that it has been in the will, and in 
the power of the United States, to make advances for the colony of St Domingo, and also to send supplies of bread to this 
country. On the 27th of September I mentioned to you the 
plan of a speculation, on drafts to have been made on the United 
States, could my concurrence have been procured. Events 
have shown that this speculation would have been a good one 
to the parties, who would have gained, (and the French nation, of course, have lost) about fifty thousand pounds sterling, 
in less than eighty thousand. I was informed at that time, that 
the disappointed parties would attempt to have me recalled, and 
some more tractable character sent, who would have the good 
sense to take care of his own interest. Well, Sir, nine months 
have elapsed, and now, if I were capable of such things, I 
think it would be no difficult matter to have some of them 
hanged. Indeed, it is highly probable that they will experience a fate of that sort. It is a year ago, that a person, who 
mixed in tumults to see what was doing, told me of a Sans 
Culotte who, bellowing against poor Lafayette, when Petion 
appeared, changed at once his note to vive Petion, and then 
turning round fc) one of his companions; Vois tu ! C est notre 
ami, n est ce pas ? Eh bien&gt; ilpassera comme les autres. And 
lo ! the prophecy is fulfilled ; and I this instant learn that Petion, confined to his room as a traitor or conspirator, has fled, on 
the twenty-fourth of June, <a href='/results.php?year=1793'>1793</a>, from those whom he sent, on 
the twentieth of June, <a href='/results.php?year=1792'>1792</a>, to assault the King in the Tuile.ries. In short, you will find in the list of those, who were ordered by their brethren to be arrested, the names of those who 
have proclaimed themselves to be the prime movers of the 
revolution of the tenth of August, and fathers of the Re 
public. 
</p><p>
I am hurt and vexed at the delay of my letters. By what 
you say of the advices you had received on the eighth of April, 
mine, down to the thirteenth of February, ought to have reached you by that time ; and, indeed, notwithstanding the length 
of winter passages, there was room enough for their arrival. 
But the mischief arises from the ports where vessels are put 
up, as to sail on one day named, and some four or five weeks 
after, we learn that they are still detained. 
</p><p>
I have not yet received the plans of the federal town, which 
you were so kind as to send, which I am sorry for, because, if 
there is any part marked out for sale in Europe, I think, in 
the present critical moment, purchasers would be found. By 
the bye. I think a plan might be formed for purchasing land, 
and building houses there, by way of actions, but I shall not 
dwell thereon at present, and will write more fully about it, 
when I receive the plans and letters accompanying them. 
</p><p>
By the first very good conveyance which may offer, I will 
send out the dies you order. At present I have none such, 
and only time to write by the person who takes this with him, 
and who is to sail from Havre for New York. I would rather 
give them in charge to some one who is himself going over, for 
great neglects happen in the ports, as I know by frequent experience. 
</p><p>
Mr Pinckney has doubtless informed you long since, that 
Mr Droz declines going out to America. There was some 
misunderstanding on the subject, between him and Mr Short, 
which he entered into a long history of, and desired me to 
communicate it to you, for whom he expressed the utmost deference and respect. As I found it to be impossible to get him into the service of the United States, which was the main object, I thought it unnecessary to trouble you with a long chapter of little sorenesses, which were, I could clearly see, the effect of prudent caution in Mr Short, on the irritable delicacy 
of the Artist. I am sorry, however, for the thing, because the 
conversation I had with him, and the inquiries I made, lead 
me to believe that he would have been a very faithful and useful officer. 
</p><p>
The assurances you give in your letter of the twentieth of 
April, that our fellow citizens are disposed to preserve an ex 
act neutrality, give me sincere pleasure, as you will find from 
what I took the liberty to say on that subject in former letters. 
I fear that the frequent violations of our neutrality by the privateers, fitted out in the French ports, may provoke a change of 
sentiment. T labor incessantly to keep things quiet in that regard, and I think it likely that some of my countrymen may 
think me too much attached to France, because I do not enter 
into the violence of their resentments, for which there is, as 
you will see, more ground than I choose to acknowledge to 
them. 
</p><p>
How long the war may last I know not ; but this I know, 
that it is very much our interest not to be drawn into it. The 
new constitution, upon which, at present, I shall make no re 
marks, but send you a copy, may, if adopted with enthusiasm, 
be the means of lengthening out the struggle, in which case 
France, or rather the ruling party in France, might triumph 
over all opposition. Otherwise, it would seem, humanly 
speaking, that if there be a perfect accord between the different powers without, and the royalists within, this campaign 
must put an end to the whole affair. Yet who can answer for 
the contingencies of war and the fluctuations of opinion ? I 
have the honor to be, &c.

</p><p>
My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have just received yours of the twenty-fifth of March. 
Not having had time to read the gazettes , which are but just 
(and but in part) arrived, I cannot from them derive the in 
formation you allude to, but my first glance at them shows 
what I am sorry to see, and from thence I am induced to 
quote a sound maxim from an excellent book. { JL house divided against itself cannot stand. 
</p><p>
As to your re-acceptance, Sir, you know my sentiments, 
which on that, as on some other subject, are, I think, unchangeable. It will be time enough for you to have a successor, when 
it shall please God to call you from this world's theatre. If 
such successor is then able to fill the President's chair, it will 
be matter of surprise to those, who can from a competent idea 
of the office, but during your life I consider the thing as utterly impossible. And do not imagine, my dear Sir, that you can 
retire, though you may resign. You will in such case become 
the man of the opposition, however your good sense may differ 
from their madness, and your ^irtue from their villany. De 
pend on it, theyw ill cite you as being of their sentiment. If 
you are silent you assent, and if you speak you are committed. 
In the mean time your poor successor is obliged to struggle 
under all the weight of your reputation, as well as that of the 
office ; and he must be a strong man who can carry either ; of 
course a very rash man who would attempt to take up both. 
</p><p>
I am very happy to find, that the determination to maintain 
a strict neutrality is so general in America. I shall not dwell 
on that topic, because my several letters to Mr Jefferson contain enough of it to weary your patience. By the bye, I am 
mortified more than I can tell you, at the delay my letters experience in their passage. I task my mind to its utmost bent 
to discover those events, which are most likely to happen, in 
order that (so far at least as my judgment can be relied on) 
you may be duly prepared, and after all you hear of the event 
before my almanac comes out. This is provoking, and would 
be much more so, did I not find from experience that the 
things I wish are done as well, and perhaps better than if my 
conjectures had reached you. 
</p><p>
I trust that long ere this you will have received what I had 
the honor to write on the twenty-eighth December, sixth and 
tenth January, and fourteenth February. You will have seen 
that in the end of last month and beginning of this, the long 
expected insurrection took place, by which a new set of men 
are brought into power. Sould the present society be able to 
establish themselves, I think M. Genet will have a successor ; 
and if, the revolution completed, things return to the point 
from whence they started, I am sure M. Genet will have a 
successor. As to those who rule, or rather the few by whom 
they are directed, you may depend that they have just ideas 
of the value of popular opinion. They are not, however, in 
a condition to act according to knowledge, and should they be 
able to reach a harbor, there will be quite as much of good luck 
as of good management in it. At any rate, a part of the crew 
will be thrown overboard. It is my opinion that the members of the Convention lately arrested will do nothing, for the 
greater part of them have only parole energy ; and if I were 
called on by any cogent motive to act, it should be in conformity to that idea. In my letter to Mr Jefferson of this day I 
tell him, that I shall implicitly obey his orders; but this is in 
reply to the broad hint, that my embarrassments may have 
arisen from inattention to the principles of free government. 
You may rely, Sir, that I shall be cautious to commit the 
United States as little as possible to future contingencies. In 
my last letter I gave you my idea of popularity : 
</p><p>
I have never thought that three parties would conveniently 
exist in any one country, and therefore it seems to me that 
one of those into which they who call themselves democrats 
are divided, must join the royalists. I do not inquire what 
negotiations are carried on to that effect, for I have no desire 
to meddle with such affairs, directly or indirectly, and should 
be very sorry to have the appearance of siding with any one 
party or faction whatever, being convinced that I can best do 
the business of the United States by keeping aloof from them 
all. 
</p><p>
Those who command the royal or Christian army, as they 
call themselves, on the Loire, are good officers. Their enemies have, in my mind, passed the highest eulogium on tlrem, 
in saying that the soldiers are brought to such a pitch of folly 
and madness, as to rush on, armed only with clubs, and possess themselves of the artillery to whose fire they were expos 
ed. As far as I have been able to learn, they profess them 
selves the friends of order and justice, and act conformably to 
such professions, protecting both persons and property wherever they arrive, and paying for whatever they take. Hence 
it happens, that their dominion is constantly extending itself, 
and if they should get possession of Nantes, which seems to be 
their present object, they will be truly formidable, because 
then by means of the Loire a passage will be opened into the 
heart of the kingdom for as many troops as foreign powers 
may choose to send thither, or if they should prefer fighting 
the battle with Frenchmen, they, need only furnish money and 
warlike stores, and they would have as many men as they 
please, and the most fertile part of France to subsist in. 
</p><p>
Farewell, my dear Sir ; may God bless and keep you, not 
merely for your sake, and still less for that of your friends, but 
for the general good of our country.

Sir, 
</p><p>
The United States of America, faithful to their friendship for 
the French nation, in compliance with the request made them 
by M. Ternant, have engaged in the assistance of St Domingo, in consequence of the decree passed by the National 
Assembly ; and the payment of the four millions, which occasioned that decree, has been completed. In consequence of 
this same friendship, and in conformity to another request of 
M. Ternant, the necessary arrangements have been made for 
placing at the disposal of this Minister a sum of three mil 
lions, which is to be appropriated to the purchase of provisions 
for France. 
</p><p>
The government of the United States, in communicating to 
me the measures which I have the honor to lay before you, 
has informed me, that the administration of the Colony of St 
Domingo had purchased several cargoes, sent to that island by 
American merchants, that it had seized others, and that in 
payment of the whole it had given drafts on the representative 
of the French nation at Philadelphia, who, for want of funds, 
has been unable to honor them. No one suspects that France 
will fail to discharge at last a debt so sacred ; but in a case 
of this kind, delays are very prejudicial to the persons concern 
ed. Consequently, Sir, I have received orders to solicit from 
the French Republic instructions to her Minister in Philadelphia to answer these drafts, by appropriating to this purpose a 
part of the funds to be paid to him by the Treasury of the 
United States. I have the honor to be,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have just received your letter of yesterday, and it gives 
me much pleasure to be able to congratulate you upon your 
nomination, at the same time that I thank you for the friendly 
sentiments you do me the honor to express for the United 
States, as well on your own part, as on that of the French nation. The good will of the United States is by no means 
equivocal, and my personal attachment to France is of long 
standing, and sincere. I shall therefore feel double pleasure, 
whenever opportunities occur for giving new strength to the 
bonds which unite the two nations. I most ardently desire, 
that nothing may disturb the harmony subsisting between 
them. 
</p><p>
Permit me, Sir, at this time, to renew to you my solicitations respecting the decree of the Convention of May 28th. 
I learn with satisfaction the daily arrival of wheat and flour, 
sent to you from America, but I feel some uneasiness respecting that which has not yet arrived. Indeed, how can the enemies of France be prevented from following, with regard to 
us, the example she has set them, and especially England, 
who, not being restrained by the faith of treaties, (since we 
have made none with her,) will follow no impulse but that of 
her own interests. And how can we complain of it, after the 
marked preference we have given to France, and the decree 
of the 9th of May ? 
</p><p>
I say nothing to you, Sir, of the impression which this decree will necessarily produce in America. I would rather that 
such considerations should be presented to you, by your own 
reflections, than in consequence of mine. But it is of moment 
that the Convention should come to a definitive decision, be 
cause this delay, leaving the decree in force, exposes you to 
all the inconveniences which must result from it, and without 
any advantage. I ought moreover to observe to you that it 
will be very difficult, and perhaps impossible, to prevent your 
privateers from committing illegal and outrageous acts, as long 
as they are permitted to bring into your ports all the American vessels laden with eatables for countries at war with 
France. I receive many complaints to this effect, and often 
what was destined for another port is brought into a French 
one, which is the cause of great inconveniences. I have the 
honor to be,

Sir,

I have just received the letter, which you did me the honor 
to write me on the third, with the accompanying copies of the 
decrees. The reparation enjoined by the representatives of 
the French nation is worthy of its justice, and consequently 
the United States will be perfectly satisfied with it. 
</p><p>
They will also discover, Sir, in that which exempts their 
vessels from the dispositions of the decree of May ninth, a 
new proof of the fidelity of the French in fulfilling their engagements. I shall give them an account, at the same time, of 
the instructions which you have the goodness to send to citizen Genet. I beg you, Sir, to accept the assurances of my 
gratitude for the promptness with which you have attended 
to this business. ;&gt; ...

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have had the honor of receiving your two letters of the 
twenty-ninth and thirtieth July. I thank you for your attention to the affair of the brig Patty, and your services in that of 
the ship Laurens. I received, at the same time, a letter from Havre, dated the first of this month, and with it the copy of a 
decree, passed July twenty-seventh, upon the petition of the 
owners and crew of the privateer, le Sans Culotte, of Honfleur. 
This decree upholds the dispositions of that of May ninth, 
relative to neutral vessels, and annuls all measures which may 
contravene it. 
</p><p>
I cannot think, Sir, after all the Convention has done in this 
matter, that it has decided to break the treaty with the United 
States of America. I therefore persuade myself, that its good 
faith has been betrayed into passing the decree in question. 
In any case, it is of great moment that we should know on 
what to depend. The decree of May ninth was announced 
to me from Havre, before it was passed. The means employed to obtain it were pointed out to me ; but I persisted in believing, that such means could never succeed, the rather, as 
the interests of the French Republic seemed to me obviously 
opposed to it. The decree, however, was passed. And you 
see, Sir, that England has adopted its provisions. I have no 
doubts that Holland and Spain will imitate her example, and that 
the representations of the Ministers of the United States will 
be met by this decree of May ninth. It has been twice solemnly repealed, in consequence of the representations which I 
had the honor to make ; but it has twice been revived again, 
at the solicitation of the same persons, and to obtain the confiscation of property, which I was assured was American. 
</p><p>
I have been further assured, that the hope of the owners is 
founded solely on the want of certain formalities, required by 
the French laws&gt; but not by ours, and in themselves unimportant. I see, with regret, Sir, that great national interests thus 
become the sport of petty intrigues, and I believe the Convention will feel indignant at beholding the measures into which it 
has been led, with regard to this subject. First, a decree is 
surreptitiously obtained from it, which infringes its treaty with 
the United States, and endangers the subsistence of the people, which they are expected to furnish in a time of scarcity. 
Then this decree is modified with respect to the United States, 
in conformity with the terms of the treaty, and the principles 
of good faith. But, a few days after, these modifications are 
annulled. Better informed, the Convention re-established 
them, and notwithstanding this, some persons dared to declare 
to the tribunal, that they should again be made void before the 
thirty -first of July ; and in effect they succeeded in destroying 
them on the twenty-seventh of that month. 
</p><p>
It is for the wisdom, the justice of the Convention, Sir, to 
decide at length this great question, and if it desires to maintain the treaty, as I have every reason to believe, it will be pro 
per to declare plainly and simply, that the treaty concluded 
on the 6th of February, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>, with the United States of 
America, holds good in every point ; that every resolution op 
posed to it is null, and that henceforward no decree can impugn it, unless the treaty be particularly designated. Such a 
measure, Sir, would prevent all imposition, and, by showing 
respect for the principles of good faith, would afford a new 
proof of republican integrity. I have the honor to be, &c.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Enclosed herewith you will find my account up to the first 
of last month. I did not send it sooner, because I wished to 
comprise therein those of the Consulates, none of which are 
come forward. I shall, therefore, write to them on the subject. You will observe, that I charge therein twenty-four 
livres, given to an American sea officer. He appeared to be, 
and really was, in very great distress, so that I could not 
avoid giving what I conceived needful to carry him to the 
nearest seaport. He has since applied to me again repeatedly, but he has been refused all farther aid. 
</p><p>
You will find also a charge for engraving passports. 
This became necessary, because from the time of my arrival, 
or very shortly after it, the difficulties in the way of travelling 
were so great, that people, with all the formalities required by 
law, could scarcely get along ; and among the municipalities a 
handsome piece of paper, with a seal to it, had much more 
effect than the ministerial signatures. If, however, either or 
both of these charges be deemed improper, let them be re 
charged to me. 
</p><p>
I sent out more pamphlets than those I have brought to 
account, because, when an opportunity offered, I put up not 
only those I had procured for your office, but all others which 
were at hand, and which having been originally purchased for 
my own information, I did not think it proper to charge them 
to the United States. 
</p><p>
I also enclose herein a table of the value of the Assignats, 
compared with specie, for one year ending with the last of 
June. During the month of July, they may be stated at 
about twenty per cent ; but upon that value, as well as on 
those contained in the table, it is necessary to observe first, 
that the fluctuations of exchange are great ; so that, to deter 
mine with precision the value requires information, which I 
believe it is impossible to obtain. For instance, louis d ors 
have sometimes borne a premium of above five per cent 
compared with silver ; and at other times have gone at par. 
Nay, this change has taken place from one day to another ; 
and on the same day there has been a difference of above five 
per cent in the price of specie. It would be necessary, therefore, to know at which of two such different prices, the greatest sum was negotiated ; and also, in other cases, whether the 
principal negotiations were in gold or silver. At first sight, 
indeed, it might be supposed that the metal of highest price 
was the one principally bought ; but I am assured that this 
rule did not hold good ; and as for the reason why it did not 
hold, we must seek it in the trick of the day, or the lie of the 
day. Sometimes, also, in the searchings and plunderings. 
</p><p>
But, secondly, this table, however accurate it might be, 
would not, I conceive, form a proper standard on which to 
proceed in our custom houses, because the value of commodities has been by no means dependent on that of the assignats. 
The prices have considerably increased, but not proportionately ; and the particular increase depends on the article, so that 
a history of each would be necessary. Bread, although sup 
plies have constantly been brought from abroad, has been 
kept very nearly to the old standard. Flesh is more than 
double. Vegetables four, or five, or six, times as dear as 
formerly. Merchandizes for export have not risen in proportion. Wines and brandies were getting up rapidly, but the 
war damped them. They took afterwards a great rise from 
the demand of the armies, so that the low Burgundies were 
getting up to the price of the high almost. 
</p><p>
I am not enough acquainted with the subject to go into the 
needful details, and only say thus much, to show that merchandizes did not depend for price on the same principles 
as the precious metals, since these last were purchased by 
the Nation for its armies, by the emigrants for their support, 
and by people in general, as a resource in the moment when 
paper should be decried. 
</p><p>
Lastly, the price of specie did not go on regular principles 
of apportionment or comparison with the mass of paper. In 
the months of May or June, I 792, it rose, because the old 
Ministers having purchased large sums of specie, their successors found that they could dispense with immediate supplies. 
In July, August, and September, notwithstanding the political 
events, it was kept tolerably steady by the stockjobbing maDoeuvres, backed with the sums in the Treasury, and also by 
the fear of plunder after the tenth of August ; for many were 
plundered during the visites domiciliares, and it was given out 
by authority, that specie would be taken by force, and paper 
given in exchange. The benefits, which those at the centre 
of these operations expected to derive^ were prevented by the 
great, and unlocked for, successes of the French arms in October and November. In the end of November, and in the 
beginning of December, the proportion was about seventy-three per cent, being higher than is stated in the table, be 
cause in November, the exchange was lower in the beginning, 
and in December at the end of the month 5 wherefore the 
average of each is diminished. 
</p><p>
In the month of December, the trial of the King, the probability that he would be put to death, the consequences naturally resulting from that catastrophe, the certainty of another, and 
more serious campaign, the situation of the armies, and, in fine, 
the abundance of the Assignats, when the cold weather forced 
back presumptuous hope into the region of austere reflection, 
brought down the exchange to about sixty per cent. In January it was tolerably steady at about fifty-eight, and in February at about fifty-six. The paper during this period went on 
in its natural course of gentle decay. In the beginning of 
March it was still at about fifty-six ; but the successes of the 
enemy shortly after reduced it to forty-eight. In the beginning of April, it was brought down to about forty-four; so that 
in one month's time it lost about one fifth of its value. From 
that time it went on gradually again, being about forty-two at 
the end of April, and then rapidly, so as to be about thirty in 
the end of June, consequently the degradation monthly, for 
those two months, was about one sixth each. 
</p><p>
But in July it took a terrible plunge, viz. from thirty to 
twenty, being one third of the value taken off in a few 
days. This was owing, in part, to a view of public affairs 
both foreign and domestic, and partly to stockjobbing manoeuvres carried on by authority, with a view to ruin the stockjobbers. These manoeuvres had, in part, their effect, for having 
forced the exchange below its natural level, it rose towards the 
end of the month, and, of course, those who speculated on a 
farther fall were taken in. The prime movers did, indeed, 
expect a wonderful rise, from the taking out of circulation 
about 1,700,000,000 of livres, on which the king's head is 
impressed ; but this stroke was broken, by the necessity of 
confining it to one half the sum, being the large Assignats, because 
the small ones dispersed in the hands of the Sans Culottes 
might have deprived the government of the support of its 
friends. 
</p><p>
But, besides this, the stroke was in itself a bad one, because 
it injures the paper more by depreciating its credit, than it 
benefits what remains by lessening the mass, even could the 
mass be thereby lessened, which it is not, for all the effect is to 
give a different direction to the proscribed paper in those districts which respect the decree. Many people persist in believing that the Assignats, with that condemned impression, are 
better than the others, and even that their value is increased 
by the decree, which, drawing a line of division between 
them, leaves the future government at liberty to annul the circulation now favored with an appearance of justice. 
</p><p>
You will observe, that men calculate upon the dissolution of 
the present system as on a datum, although the period, in 
which it is to arrive, is considered as uncertain. It is far from 
being impossible that they reckon without their host ; but the 
opinion is as important as the thing in respect to a species of 
money, whose value depends on opinion. Another circumstance, which should have been taken into consideration, and 
which was not duly weighed, is, that the value of the mass 
of paper depends on the course in the capital, and there the 
new Assignats must be rather more plentiful than the old ; of 
course destroying the old cannot do much good to the new. 
And, besides, the holders of the old, as well as the new, being 
in effect the great money dealers, can by their united efforts 
apportion the value to each as they please, and their common 
interest will excite a common action ; and they have over the 
government an advantage, which no power of legislation can 
compensate, because they act with the paper in circulation, 
and the government with that which goes to increase the circulation, and which, of course, lessens the value which they wish 
to increase. 
</p><p>
From all this I conclude, that the paper must go on perishing day by day, and, like other consumptive patients, be alike 
weakened by the doctor and the disease. On the whole, Sir, 
to return to your original object, I believe the safest way in 
America, and the most equitable, would be to value articles imported from this country at the prices of <a href='/results.php?year=1788'>1788</a>. I am, &ic.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Enclosed herein you will find copies of my letters of the 
twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth of June, and sixth of August, 
to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, with copies of his letters 
to me of the third, nineteeth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth of July. 
From these you will perceive, that my application for an order to the Minister of France in America to pay, out of the 
funds to be furnished by the United States, the drafts made on 
his predecessor from St Domingo, produced the desired effect. 
Some subsequent circumstances have induced me to believe, 
that under that cover an attempt will be made to pay the bills 
drawn on Europe in favor of French citizens. I have certified signatures which seemed to be calculated for that purpose ; but, as I presume that measures will be taken of a cautionary nature, I shall not pretend to suggest any. 
</p><p>
You will perceive, Sir, in this correspondence one of the 
many violations of our flag in the case of the Little Cherub, which, being attended with circumstances of peculiar atrocity, 
called for more pointed animadversion. The conduct of the 
government on the occasion was perfectly proper. The per 
son, who committed the murder has, however, been acquitted 
on the testimony of his companions, in direct contradiction to 
that of the American master and crew. The case of the ship 
is still depending, and I know not what will be the event. It 
now appears that a part of the cargo on board of her was for 
account of Flemish merchants, and to be delivered at Ostend. 
But more of this presently. 
</p><p>
I must, however, take the liberty of recommending to the 
notice of government, Francis Coffyn, of Dunkirk, an old deputy of Mr Barclay, while he was Consul General. On many 
occasions, especially in the affair of the Little Cherub, he has 
behaved with much sense, spirit, and industry. The conduct 
of such business is by no means pleasant, neither is it without 
some personal danger, for, in the present situation of this country, the laws are but little respected, and it would seem as if 
pompous declarations of the rights of man were reiterated, only to render the daily violation of them more shocking. 
</p><p>
You will see, Sir, in my letter of the fourth of July, a 
clause asking the liberty of an American citizen. In my applications on that subject, I have been very cautious, fearing 
that I might be deceived by British seamen, and, consequently, that our countrymen might afterwards be without redress ; 
as, in such case, the government here would throw all the 
complaints aside as being unfounded. Among others, who 
have asked the protection of the United States, are some Nantucket whalemen. And, at first, their requests were so artfully made, that I was near being the dupe. I have, however, 
declined all interference in their favor, telling them that when 
they embarked under a foreign and rival flag, they forfeited 
by their own act the protection afforded by that of the United 
States, and must console themselves in their present situation 
by the privileges, which they formerly enjoyed, and which 
tempted them to engage in the British service. This is the 
general idea I have held out, but differently modified according to the various circumstances, which individuals have 
brought forward. These people are a sort of citizens of the 
world, and, wherever they went, were the most pernicious enemies to their native country ; because everywhere they solicited, either exclusion of, or else heavy duties on, the produce of our fisheries. At present, those who were settled 
at Dunkirk have, I am told, engaged in privateering. Probably, if the war lasts, the whole hive may settle again within 
the territory of the United States, and the more they endure, 
in the mean time, the sooner will they adopt that salutary de 
termination. 
</p><p>
The decree respecting neutral bottoms, so far as it regards 
the vessels of the United States, has, as you will see, been 
bandied about in a shameful manner. I am told from Havre, 
that it is by the force of money, that the determinations, which 
violate our rights, have been obtained; and on comparing 
dates, events, and circumstances, this idea seems to be but too 
well supported. I will make no comments on the facts, 
because my opinions are of no consequence. The true state 
of them will result from the enclosed pieces, and the United 
States will judge thereon. I have, &c.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
Four persons, who are sent to me by the Captains of American vessels, a list of whose names I have the honor to send 
you herewith, have arrived here from Bourdeaux. These 
Captains represent to me that the owners of their respective 
vessels sent them here, in consequence of the decrees passed 
by the Convention in favor of American commerce, and with 
the confidence that they would be permitted to transact their 
business unmolested; that, relying on the public faith, pledged 
by these same decrees, they brought here considerable cargoes 
of grain, flour, and other provisions; that in consideration of 
the state of foreign exchange, the said cargoes have been sold 
at an immense loss ; that they have no mode of repairing this 
loss, but to take in return commodities and articles manufactured in France; that many of them have freighted their 
vessels to carry merchandize to the French colonies, for 
French merchants; that the exportation of all merchandize 
being prohibited, they will be obliged to discharge what they 
have on board, and to depart in ballast, in consequence of 
losing the considerable freight which had been stipulated. 
</p><p>
I do not pretend, Sir, to interfere in the internal concerns 
of the French Republic, and I am persuaded that the Convention has had weighty reasons for laying upon commerce the 
restrictions of which the American captains complain. The 
result will nevertheless be, that this prohibition will seriously 
aggrieve the parties interested, and will put an end to the 
commerce between France and the United States, which was 
beginning to be brisk, and promised us fortunate results. It is, 
then, from a sincere desire to see the bonds of amity between 
the two nations more closely drawn, that I beg you, Sir, to 
have the goodness to examine whether there be not some way, 
either by an exception to the law, or by especial permission, 
to let the vessels of the United States depart, with their cargoes, 
for the ports of the said States, or the French Colonies. I 
have the honor to be, &tc.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My last was of the thirteenth of last month. This will ac 
company a triplicate of what I had the honor to write on the 
seventh of August, also some copies of letters to the Ministers. 
By the bye, I shall cease to send you copies of my various 
applications in particular cases, for they are so numerous, that 
they will cost you more in postage than they are worth. I 
suppose Mr Pinckney has his hands full of similar business, 
for I learn, now and then, that the British privateers make as 
free with our vessels as the French have done. 
</p><p>
I understand that it is still in contemplation to repeal the decree I complained of, and that, in the mean time, it has not 
been transmitted to the tribunals. We shall see, in effect, 
that this decree can do very little harm, because the fleets of 
this country are confined by those of the enemy, and the privateers by a decree of the Convention. 
</p><p>
The exchange, during the last month, experienced great 
shocks, owing to the violent measures pursued by the government to support it. On the whole, they have kept it at about 
two and a half to three for one. But merchandizes have risen 
rapidly in price, and must continue to rise ; among other reasons, which will easily suggest themselves to your mind, be 
cause the compression on the paper mass in one place must 
force it out in another. Even lands feel the effect, although 
the market has been for two years, at least, greatly overstocked with that article. 
</p><p>
The paralyzing of apart of the Assignats had, as I told you, 
an effect which could be but momentary. A further decree 
was therefore passed against them, whose effect also diminished in the first moment. To prevent agiotage, the Effets 
publics were ordered to be recorded, and the India Company's property was seized ; and as this was not sufficient, the 
Caisse d Escompte was abolished. Still the immense amount 
raised by political gas, could not but bring down with it the 
supporting balloons ; wherefore, at last the bankers and brokers were laid hold of. I am told that amid the menaces 
against those who may remit to foreign countries, agents of the 
government offered some bills cheap, and that the purchasers 
were imprisoned as Gens suspects. However, experience 
shows that evils inherent in the nature of things cannot be pre 
vented, otherwise than by destroying the things themselves. 
By the law, it is death to sell or buy specie, and yet specie is 
publicly bought and sold every day. 
</p><p>
You have, I hope, received the new constitution, which you 
see is suspended, until the revolution shall be finished. You 
will have seen also, that the party of the Girondes, or Brissotins, is quite down ; but as yet none of them have been executed. Probably the first great misfortune will call them from 
their dungeons as expiatory victims. I am not possessed of the 
proofs which exist against them, and it is, you know, a maxim 
of our law, that every man is presumed to be innocent, untft 
his guilt is proved. If one may judge from the infinite precautions taken, one would conclude that the very great majority 
in this country is become royalist. I think I have already 
mentioned my conviction, that there cannot long exist three 
parties. It is said that the Brissotins, as soon as their adversaries gained the upper hand, enlisted themselves, in secret, 
under the royal banner ; but I think strong proof should be 
required before that fact is admitted. 
</p><p>
I do not mention to you the military events, because you 
will learn them fully from the different gazettes, and because I 
do not think military events decide so much as is generally 
believed. If the success be nearly balanced, France is so far 
victorious. But her resources are wearing away very fast, and 
the period seems to approach when the state of her finances 
will be of little moment, because the needful things will no 
longer exist ; and, of course, they can neither be bought with 
money, nor seized by force, nor obtained through solicitation. 
Will the allied armies push on to Paris ? What would be 
the effect of their appearance? Two important questions, 
To answer the first would be presumption, and to answer the 
second would look like madness. I am, &c.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to send you herewith, the copies of two 
judgments, rendered with regard to the American vessel, the 
George. By the first, the tribunal, in conforming itself to the 
treaty of <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>, declared her unlawful prize; but by the secondj a part of the cargo is condemned, as hostile property ; 
and the tribunal has founded its decision upon the decree of 
the twenty-seventh of July. 
</p><p>
Captain Richard Stevens, of the American vessel, the 
Hope, also complains very bitterly of a sentence rendered lately against a part of the cargo of this vessel, which is incontestably American property. This captain informs me, that the 
tribunal of St Brieu has founded its decision on the circumstance, that in the invoice, the owners of the vessel had added 
their commission to the price of the articles therein comprised ; 
a thing in use among merchants, who by this means insuring 
the whole shelter from maritime danger, the price of their 
labor, as they do that of their merchandizes. I do not cite, 
Sir, this sentence in the form of a complaint, first, because 
I have not yet received an authentic copy of it, and above all, 
because I am persuaded that the superior tribunal, to whom an 
appeal must be made, will not fail to render justice. 
</p><p>
I desire only to let you see, Sir, how much discontent the 
execution of the decree of the 27th of July must excite. 
</p><p>
Persuaded that the Convention wishes to maintain the closest connexions between our two Republics, I have given to 
our Ministry the most positive assurances of it ; but they will be contradicted by the injured persons, who doubtless will accuse the Minister with supineness, who does not adopt the feelings of his fellow citizens ; and my efforts will fail of their effect, as soon as it can be imagined, that I do not render a faithful account of the dispositions of the French Republic, from 
the want of intelligence or exactness. 
</p><p>
I request you, Sir, to pardon an observation which regards 
the particular interests of France. The circumstances of the 
moment prevent the fitting out of privateers, consequently, it 
would cost her nothing to cause the treaty to be observed with 
the greatest exactitude. Then the contrast, which the Americans would make between the conduct of France, and that of 
her enemies, could not but be favorable ; but at present, on the 
contrary, every time we complain of the conduct of the English, they shut our mouths by this decree of the 27th of July. 
Nothing is more embarrassing for our Minister at London, and 
nothing can be more injurious to the French Republic, in the 
opinion of the neutral powers. 
</p><p>
I hope, Sir, that you will observe in the freedom of the observations I have just made to you, the amicable and fraternal 
dispositions, which have dictated them. I am sure, at least, of 
conforming to the views of the United States, in following my 
own inclination, to remove everything that might change the 
good harmony, which exists between two nations, allied as well 
by the force of sentiment, as by that of treaties. I have the 
honor to be, &tc.

Sir, 
</p><p>
I have just received despatches, which I think it important 
to communicate to you, with the least possible delay. I therefore hasten to send you them, in the original r begging you 
to return them to me, when you have read them. I am persuaded, Sir, that you will find in them multiplied proofs of a 
sincere attachment on the part of the United States, and of 
their determination to fulfil exactly their engagements with the 
French nation. Unhappily, they will show you, that the 
agent, whom you employed to maintain harmony between our 
two Republics, has been at least indiscreet, and that interests 
the most essential are, in his hands, seriously endangered.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Yours of the sixteenth, twenty-second, and twenty-sixth of 
August were delivered to me at my ^country house on Saturday morning, the fifth instant. That of the thirteenth of June, 
mentioned in yours of the sixteenth of August, I have never received. I arrived in this city the afternoon of the fifth. I 
had an interview with the Minister of Foreign Affairs on the morning of the eighth. He promised me to recall Genet immediately. I came home and transmitted that, which you had 
written for the purpose, with a note, of which a copy is en closed.

I am busied about obtaining a proper successor, and taking 
measures to prevent for the future what you have lately experienced. I expect to find everything in good order by the

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have written a short letter this day, in answer to your 
despatches. Herewith I do myself the honor to transmit the 
copy of what I wrote on the 22d of last month. The 
exchange has been sustained as there mentioned. 
</p><p>
On the eighth of last month, I desired Mr Jones (with 
whom Mr Fenwick had entrusted his consular affairs during a 
voyage he made to England) to give you his opinion respecting the situation and temper of Bourdeaux, with the reasons 
therefor. The gazettes will have shown you, that apprehen 
sions were entertained respecting the dispositions of people in 
that quarter. I believe that there is still cause to apprehend, 
more especially as the insurrection in the Vendee is more 
menacing than ever. 
</p><p>
The conduct of the Convention respecting our treaty, will 
have formed a useful reinforcement to those, who would pre 
serve our Constitution. My efforts to support the treaty have 
been constant and persevering, although, in my private judgment, the breach of it on the part of our allies, by releasing us 
from the obligations it has imposed, could not but be useful 
under the present circumstances. 
</p><p>
I am very anxious that Consuls and Vice Consuls should be 
appointed in all the ports. My countrymen are incessantly 
applying to me from every quarter about property taken 
from them. I am desired from abroad to claim such property. 
The courts chicane very much here, under the pretence that 
claimants do not produce proper authority from the owners, fee. 
I have decidedly refused to lend my name on such occasions, 
because I am certain that I should be thereupon represented as 
a party interested, and, of course, my representations against 
the iniquitous proceedings, which are but too frequent, would 
be disregarded. It happens also that I am called upon to 
name proper agents in the ports where there is no Consul. In 
such cases, I must take the recommendation of a banker, and 
incur the risk of placing a person, interested in a capture, as 
protector of the property taken. 
</p><p>
The state of public affairs here involves me in another 
very disagreeable predicament. My fellow citizens are aggrieved and apply for redress, to which they are justly entitled, and which they are led to expect with the greater certainty, as every public act breathes warm attachment to the 
United States. On the other hand, it is frequently impossible to obtain redress, because the government, omnipotent in 
some cases, is, in others, not merely feeble, but enslaved. I 
am forced to see that my demands must embarrass and frequently irritate them. The ministers, who ought to be 
accountable agents of public authority, are placed in such 
direct subordination to the Comite de Salut Public, that even 
the common routine must await their fiat, and they are unaccountable, and swayed by the terror of an insurrection, which 
may be excited at any moment, should they displease the leaders of this city. Consequently, while they see and 
lament the consequences of many acts, they are obliged to commit them. 
</p><p>
A knowledge of this reduces me to the necessity of choosing between national and particular interests. In preferring 
the former, the latter become clamorous, and I am sure that 
I shall be represented as an idle and unprofitable servant. 
To this inevitable evil I must submit. But another has 
arisen out of it, which gives me concern. In assigning to 
complainants the reasons why their expectations must be disappointed, I have been obliged to state things, which, being 
repeated and misrepresented, have produced a disagreeable 
effect in the minds of those, who are to decide on the applications I make. 
</p><p>
This will appear more clearly from an example. On the 
twentieth of August a deputation of four ship captains, chosen 
by their brethren of Bordeaux, called upon me with a representation of the injustice they experienced in being prevented from sailing with their cargoes, &c. Their suffering was 
occasioned by one of those decrees, which, being commanded 
by the popular cry in a time of violence, the legislature, 
though it may perceive the impolicy, dares not repeal. The 
deputation, as is natural, had flattered themselves with immediate and ample redress. It was my duty to moderate their 
expectations, and to explain the difficulties. Interest is often 
blind and seldom just. My moderation was ill suited to their 
wishes, and my letter to the minister, of which a copy is en 
closed, seemed to them rather an abandonment of their cause, 
than the prosecution of the only redress which appeared to 
me attainable, and in the only way by which it might be 
effected. I had cautioned them particularly not to ask too 
much, because they would thereby run the risk of not obtaining what they asked, or, if they should obtain ft, of seeing 
their hopes blasted in the bud, by a repeal of an indulgent 
decree. 
</p><p>
What had passed respecting the article of our treaty, favor 
able to the navigation of neutral vessels, was an instance so 
clear of the influence which prevails in the Convention over 
the principles of policy, as well as of justice, that, while it 
gufded my advice, it ought to have swayed their conduct. In 
closed you have a copy of their memorial to the Convention. 
I have not thought it worth while to inquire by whom it was 
written. The style shows it to be from a French hand. I 
learn that a favorable reception was secured by repeating 
such parts of my conversation, as might at once irritate the 
members of the Comite de Saint Public, and justify the personal application of American citizens while their Minister 
was on the spot. A decree was obtained, and before it 
could be executed was repealed. 
</p><p>
Thus it has happened, that they did mischief, without any 
benefit to themselves, and only served an ambition so contemptible, that I shall draw over it the veil of oblivion. The 
important facts of this matter came to my knowledge in the 
close of the last month, and, therefore, in mine of the first 
instant to M. Deforgues, of which a copy is enclosed, I took 
occasion to meet the mischief without going out of my way 
to seek it. This was the situation of things, when I received your important despatches. I need not comment upon it, 
because you will naturally place yourself in my situation and 
feel its unpleasantness. 
</p><p>
I will not now give you anything in the style of news, deferring that until the moment when Captain Culver shall be 
about to depart. In the mean time, I pray you to accept the 
assurances of that esteem and respect, with which I have the 
honor to be, &c.

Sir,

I have the honor to send you herein enclosed, the copy of a 
letter, which has been addressed to me by citizen Postic, a 
lawyer residing at Morlaix. It appears, that in the proceedings of which he has given an account, there are extraordinary irregularities, and I think it my duty to inform you of them, 
as on the justice of tribunals often depends the salvation, and 
always the prosperity of a State. 
</p><p>
I request you at the same time, Sir, to permit me to make 
two general observations on the whole of this business; one of 
which applies to the organization, and the other to the proceedings of the commercial tribunals. The referring of questions on sea prizes to these tribunals, appears to me dangerous, 
since they involve the interpretation of the treaties, and the 
application of the law of nations ; consequently of peace and 
of war. Now we may be permitted to entertain some doubt, 
as to the knowledge of the judges, and we ought besides to 
fear, lest they may be interested, as owners of privateers, in 
the questions which are submitted to them. 
But whatever may be the organization of the tribunals, it 
appears to me essential, Sir, that in their proceedings they 
should receive all the claims which may be made to them ; 
that they should even invite, without waiting for the authority 
of the persons interested, who are often at the distance of one 
thousand leagues. The jurisdiction of the tribunals, within 
whose cognizance are the questions of prize, is in rem. They 
take possession of the thing, and by that means render them 
selves responsible for it. Now as the tribunals, which are the 
depository of the thing, ought not to dispossess themselves of 
it, without a formal authoritative act of the true proprietor, it is 
their duty, not only to admit, but also to seek proofs, which 
may establish to whom the property truly belongs. This is a 
double duty, towards the neutral proprietor, and towards their 
own nation ; for every government, which permits its citizens 
to fit out privateers, arms with the destructive sword of war, 
hands which are interested to extend its ravages, and renders 
itself responsible for the abuses, which result from so dangerous a delegation of sovereignty. For the purpose of repressing them, the Admiralty tribunals have been established 
throughout the different nations of Europe. In these tribunals, 
the government furnishes the means of information, by the facility with which it admits therein every species of claim. It 
preserves, by appeals, the right of deciding in the last resort 
on the contests which therein arise ; and it gives the necessary 
time to enlighten its conscience on thorny questions, before 
the pronouncing of a sentence, which might extend or prolong 
the horrors of war. 
</p><p>
These, Sir, are the reflections which experience has dicta 
ted to me. They daily make on me a more lively impression, 
on account of the claims addressed to me by my countrymen, 
of which I have communicated to you but a very small part. 
I always send to the tribunals the injured persons, by giving 
them the most positive assurances, that they will there obtain 
complete and prompt justice. I have the honor to be, &c.

My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Mr Livingston delivered to me yours of the 25th of July. 
He says that you alone gave him an idea of this country like 
the reality. His astonishment proves that he did not believe 
you, and, could you hear him, you might, in your turn, be astonished to find that your sound understanding, while it grasped the future event, had never contemplated the progressive 
circumstances. I leave to others the painful task of drawing 
pictures, which, to resemble the truth, must, like an Indian 
warrior, be painted red and black. 
</p><p>
 It is in your character of Financier, that I transmit the 
annexed report, which suspended for a few doubtful days the 
weight which, with crushing force, falls on the monied men. 
Early in <a href='/results.php?year=1789'>1789</a>, I ventured to declare, from what I then observed, that the laws of property being violated, all would, in 
their turns, be sacrificed on the same altar. Already the 
Church, the Magistrature, the Nobility have passed away. 
Bankers, merchants, and manufacturers are now in the crucible. 
I leave to your algebraic science to resolve the problem of 
how long a supposed society can exist, after property shall 
have been done away. Perhaps you may be too busy to form 
equations, and may reply as a statesman, that government being instituted to protect property, is respected only in proportion to the fulfilment of that duty, and durable only as it is respectable. I respect you too much to contradict your opinions, 
and therefore confine myself to the more agreeable task of assuring you that I am, &c.

My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
You will see by the official correspondence, that your orders are complied with, and that your intentions are fulfilled. 
Permit me on this occasion to remark, that had the people of 
America been well informed of the state of things on this side 
of the Atlantic, no one would have dared to adopt the conduct 
which M. Genet has pursued. In reading the few gazettes 
which have reached me, I am surprised to see so little sound 
intelligence. 
</p><p>
The present government is evidently a despotism both in 
principle and practice. The Convention now consists of only a part of those, who were chosen to frame a constitution. 
These, after putting under arrest their fellows, claim all power, 
and have delegated the greater part of it to a Committee of 
Safety. You will observe, that one of the ordinary measures 
of government is to send out Commissioners with unlimited 
authority. They are invested with power to remove officers 
chosen by the people, and put others in their places. This 
power, as well as that of imprisoning on suspicion, is liberally 
exercised. The revolutionary tribunal established here to 
judge on general principles, gives unbounded scope to will. 
It is an emphatical phrase in fashion among the patriots, that 
terror is the order of the day. Some years have elapsed since 
Montesquieu wrote, that the principle of arbitrary governments is fear. 
</p><p>
The Queen was executed the day before yesterday. In 
sulted during her trial, and reviled in her last moments, she 
behaved with dignity throughout. This execution will, I 
think, give to future hostilities a deeper dye, and unite more 
intimately the allied powers. It will silence the opposition of 
those, who would not listen to the dismemberment of this 
country, and, therefore it may be concluded that the blow by 
which she died was directed from a distance. 
But whatever may be the lot of France in remote futurity, 
and putting aside the military events, it seems evident that she 
must soon be governed by a single despot. Whether she will 
pass to that point through the medium of a triumvirate, or 
other small body of men, seems as yet undetermined. I think 
it most probable that she will. A great and awful crisis seems 
to be near at hand. A blow is, I am told, meditated which 
will shroud in grief and horror a guilty land. Already the 
prisons are surcharged with persons, who consider themselves 
victims. Nature recoils, and I yet hope that these ideas are 
circulated only to inspire fear. I am, &c.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
The attention, which several pressing affairs required, made 
it impossible for me sooner to answer the letter, which 
you did me the honor of writing to me on the 14th. I 
have examined, with respectful care, the decree of the 9th of 
May, emanating from the conduct of your enemies, and sup 
ported by some reasons to which you have given their 
greatest lustre. 
</p><p>
It is possible, Sir, that the difference of our position leads 
us to see the same object in a different manner. But although 
T cannot be of your opinion, I do not intend farther to discuss 
the considerations, which have produced the decision of the 
French government. I confine myself to the rendering of a 
faithful account of it to the government of the United States, 
and I am persuaded that in considering them, liberal friend 
ship will put in the balance the difficulties of a revolution, and 
of a war without example. 
</p><p>
I ought, however, to observe to you, Sir, that the question 
does not appear to me to turn on the law of nations, but on an 
exception to that law, by the stipulations of a treaty. This 
treaty, in derogating from this law, in favor of merchandizes of 
your enemies found in our vessels, has derogated, in like manner, from it, to the prejudice of our merchandizes found in the 
vessels of your enemies. We have seen at Philadelphia the 
public sale of a cargo, the property of one of our citizens, taken by a French privateer on board an English vessel. All 
opposition was of no avail, because, according to the constitution, our treaties are the supreme law of the land. You will 
agree, Sir, that it is hard for my fellow citizens not to have 
the advantage either of the treaty or of the law of nations ; to 
lose their merchandizes by the treaty, and not to be able to 
compensate themselves for it, under the protection of this same 
treaty, by the freight of enemy's merchandizes. In comparing 
the facts of the same epoch, you will be amazed on seeing 
what passed at Paris and at Philadelphia. Your good sense 
will lead you to anticipate the claims of our merchants, and 
the insinuations of our enemies. I have the honor to be, &LC.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My last will accompany this, and I enclose herein the co 
pies of letters from the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the tenth, 
fourteenth, and seventeenth instants, and also copies of mine to 
him of the 11th, 12th, and 13th, and also one just written. 
</p><p>
By his letter of the tenth, you will see the determination to 
act decisively. In a subsequent conversation he assured me, 
that Genet should be punished. I replied that the United 
States had only ordered me to ask his recall, and I could go no 
farther. The idea is to send over a Commission of three or 
four persons; and to authorise that board to send him over a prisoner. I kept the advice boat here a week, in order to em 
bark the Commissioners on board of her. But although the 
instructions are all ready, there remains some little embarrassment about the appointment of one of the persons. This 
prevents them from being ready ; and, as it appears to me 
very important that you should have early advice, I cannot 
by any longer delay risk the near approach of winter on the 
American coast. 
</p><p>
It is probable that the successor of M. Genet may ask the 
interposition of our government in the discussions likely to 
arise. I have given assurances to the extent of what our laws 
and constitution may authorise. You will be able to measure 
better than I can that extent, and, at any rate, this hint will be 
kept secret, for that is, as you will readily see, of the utmost 
importance. 
</p><p>
In M. Deforgues letter of the fourteenth, and the decree 
which accompanied it, you will see the reasons assigned for 
violating the treaty. You will see, also, that it was not from 
the difficulty of refuting them, that I declined entering into 
the controversy. In effect, he had acknowledged and lamented to me the impropriety of the decree, but, unable to prevail 
over a greater influence for the repeal of it, he is driven to 
the necessity of excusing a step, which it is not possible to 
justify. There is no use in arguing with those who are alrea 
dy convinced ; and, where no good is expected, some evil 
may follow. I have, therefore, only stated the question on its 
true ground, and leave to you in America to insist on a rigid 
performance of the treaty, or slide back to the equal state of 
unfettered neutrality. Your orders will, of course, be given 
to me according to the determination, which the President 
shall take, and until then I hold the matter open. 
</p><p>
We have constantly the news of victory, but the public is 
incredulous. Lately orders were expedited to attack in every quarter; and as this is a measure originating with the 
government, those who pretend to judge of intelligence be 
forehand, say, that it must be favorable. There is, at any 
rate, the resource of concealing it, and although it would, at 
first sight, appear next to impossible that, in a country flooded 
with gazettes, there should he no note of long and bloody 
battles, yet the severity of the decrees against those who discourage the exertions of the Republic, and the greater severity 
with which all such decrees are executed, awe the boldest 
printers, and hush even the whispers of private information. 
You must not be surprised, therefore, to find in the Dutch 
and English gazettes the account of actions, which are passed 
over in silence by those I send you. 
</p><p>
It is unfortunate that you are thus disabled from comparing 
different accounts, and forced to judge from partial recital, 
The best remaining resource is to contrast the ministerial and 
opposition prints. Among the persons best informed, it seems 
to be doubtful, whether the Allies will push on towards the city, 
or wear away the national resources by warring on the frontiers. The former would have consisted better with a determination to restore the monarchy, and the latter seems to indicate a projected dismemberment. 
</p><p>
In the mean time, the expense of blood and treasure to this 
country is inconceivable. Already artisans and laborers of every kind are extremely rare. The price of mechanics is risen 
to twelve livres, that of common hands to five livres, and this, 
notwithstanding the regulation of subsistence to something very near the ancient standard. Manufactures are becoming 
very dear, and the attempt to limit prices, though enforced by 
the dreadful guillotine, cannot but produce the reverse of what 
it is intended for. 
</p><p>
The ensuing winter, unless some important changes take place, 
must be productive of scenes most melancholy and distress 
ing. If the enemy possesses himself of the strong holds along 
the northern frontier, he will undoubtedly ravage Picardy with 
his immense cavalry during the winter season, and thus destroy 
one great granary. The resources of Barbary, Sicily, and 
Italy are already cut oft from the south. The Vendee is in 
train to become a desert. The army of the Republic lays it 
waste with fire and sword. I will not endeavor to paint the 
various wretchedness, which has been described to me as existing in that quarter. If the war continue another year, the 
wishes of those who meditate the ruin of France will be so far 
accomplished, that many years of peace will not be able to re 
store her wealth and population. This will, I think, be a misfortune to the United States, and in all possible events the 
present turmoil of Europe will furnish terrible examples to the 
present age, and to a distant posterity. I am ; &c.

My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had hopes until last evening, that the persons, who are to go 
out as Commissioners from hence, would have embarked with 
Captain Culver, but circumstances have delayed the appointment. The plan which was in agitation, and which will 
probably be carried into effect, is to send over three or four 
Commissioners, one of whom will be charged with Letters of 
Credence, but instructed to conform to the directions of the 
Board. It is probable that the new Minister, immediately on 
being presented, will ask you to aid in securing the person 
and papers of the old one. My public despatch of this day 
contains a remote hint to lead the investigation of the Secretary 
of State. I did not choose to be more particular, because you 
can both give and take the informations you think proper. 
I have favored, or rather excited the idea of this procedure 
for the following reasons. First, such a public act will place 
in a contemptible light the faction connected with M. Genet. 
Secondly, the seizure of his papers, by exposing his connexions 
with prime movers, will give a lesson to others. And thirdly, 
the Commissioners who exercise this high handed authority 
will, on reflection, feel the necessity of respecting your government, lest they should meet a similar fate. Having alarmed 
their apprehensions, as to the effect which M. Genet's imprudence might produce, and knowing the public and private 
views of the parties, I have insinuated the advantage which 
might result from an early declaration on the part of the new 
Minister, that as France has announced her determination not 
to meddle with the interior affairs of other nations, so he can 
know only the government of America. In unison with this 
idea, I told the Minister that I had observed an overruling 
influence in their affairs, which seemed to come from the other 
side of the Channel, and at the same time had traced the 
intention to excite a seditious spirit in America. That it was 
impossible to be on a friendly footing with such persons, but 
that at present a different spirit seemed to prevail. This 
declaration produced the effect intended. The Minister has 
himself the wish to go out to America as Plenipotentiary, and 
M. Otto, his principal secretary, having the same wish, they 
will, I believe, endeavor while they stay to put things in good 
train here. 
</p><p>
It may be an important question, how far the Minister is protected by the law of nations, after the arrival of his 
successor. In my opinion the same principles, which exempt 
him from the municipal law, subject him to the will of his 
sovereign, and of course the aid given to the new Minister is 
not an act of the judiciary but of the executive, performed as 
an ally and friend, and is merely discretionary. I find that 
this Commission will endeavor to get hold of the debt from 
America to France by anticipation. If no other reasons militated against the advance, the advantage of a pledge to satisfy 
damages, which our citizens may sustain during the present 
violence, is considerable, and will not, I presume, be overlooked. 
I am, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I intend to despatch Captain Culver tomorrow morning, and 
shall give into his charge a box containing three dies of medals, 
and three boxes containing each one pair of dies. Whether 
he will be able to take them to you is uncertain, owing to 
trifling circumstances. I have not yet got the passports for 
them ; and he tells me, that his vessel is in the basin at Havre,, 
consequently must come out at the present full tides, or stay a 
long time; so that, if I have not the passport in the morning, I 
will take the chance of sending it after him. 
</p><p>
It appears that the French army has forced the Prince de 
Cobourg to raise the siege of Maubeuge ; but he has crossed 
the Sambre in good order, and perhaps we may soon hear of 
him again. Be that as it may, the French have experienced 
a complete defeat in Alsace. The lines of the Lauter have 
been forced, and they have lost everything. A great part 
of the army is cut to pieces, and the rest is we know not 
where. 
</p><p>
I have been told that a plot for delivering up Strasbourg has 
been discovered, and that a great majority of the inhabitants 
are concerned in it. Also that serious apprehensions are yet 
entertained for the fate of that city. The advanced period of 
the season is, however, favorable to the party which is on the 
defensive in that quarter. November generally brings foul 
weather there ; so that the assailants must, I think, look out for 
winter quarters instead of pushing into the country. I am, &c.

</p><p>
My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
M. de Laforest called just now, while I was at the Minister s, to inform me that he will probably leave Paris tomor 
row morning. I, therefore, write this as an introduction to 
you, and proceed to give a hasty sketch of the form in which 
the business now stands. 
</p><p>
A Commission is named, (the appointments not yet gone 
through the forms,) to consist of four persons. The Minister 
is M. Fauchet, Secretary of the Executive Council, a young 
man of about three and thirty, whom I have not yet seen, but 
he is said to possess genius and information. The Secretary 
of Legation is M. Leblanc, a man of about fifty, and who 
was lately at the head of the Police Department in this city. 
Him also I am, as yet, unacquainted with ; but he is mentioned to me as a prudent, sensible man. 
</p><p>
M. de Laforest goes out as Consul General, and M. Petrie, 
his friend and companion, as Consul in the port of Philadelphia. These two will undoubtedly draw together, and will 
probably sway the conduct of the Commission ; for the Minister is to take no important steps without being previously 
authorised by the Board. 
</p><p>
I understand that a kind of etiquette has been established, 
by which the Consuls, as not being properly diplomatic characters, are not received or invited with the Minister, and I 
perceive that there is a strong wish to enjoy the exterior 
respect of office, as well as the solid authority. I cannot 
pretend to judge, nor even to guess how far anything of this 
sort consists with the general rules, which you may have 
found it proper to establish ; but, I think, I can perceive that 
the two Consuls expect to govern the Commission by two 
means ; one, their greater knowledge of our country, laws, 
and inhabitants ; the other, a persuasion to be inculcated on 
the Minister and Secretary, that they enjoy the confidence of our government. Perhaps a little vanity may also be for 
something in the business ; but your judgment will well discern motives, and, therefore, I only give hints. 
</p><p>
I think that M. de Laforest and his friend, being men of 
understanding, will endeavor to keep things in a line of prudence and propriety ; therefore, being uncertain, at present, 
as to the personal characters of the other two, it seems to be 
well that the Board is to be kept steady by the anchors we 
are acquainted with, and as the others unfold themselves, it 
will appear what reliance can be placed on them. 
</p><p>
The Minister, in the conference I had with him just now, 
has again reiterated the assurance, that he and the other members of this government have the most sincere desire to be on 
the most cordial terms with us, and I am the more disposed 
to believe in their assurances, because America is the only 
source, from whence supplies of provisions can be drawn to 
feed this city, on which so much depends. The coming 
winter will be, I believe, dreadful, and the spring, should the 
war continue, must open with partial scarcities, if not general 
want. To the sufferings, unavoidable from many other 
causes, no small addition will be made by the laws limiting 
prices, enforced by the iron hand of necessity. I am, &c.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My last was of the twentieth of October. Captain Culver 
did not, I find, get out of the port of Havre till the first instant. 
He took with him the medal dies. 
</p><p>
The Consul charges me with- a balance of nineteen hundred 
and ninety-three livres, eight deniers, nine sous, telling me, that 
bethinks, by your letters, that you would choose that he should 
draw on you, but that it would be very difficult, and therefore 
prefers receiving payment from me. I shall accordingly ad 
vance this sum ; and, as I understand from Captain Culver that 
he paid a considerable part of the disbursement for his vessel 
by dollars sold at twelve livres, I suppose that the owners 
of the vessel will charge you for the whole, to wit, five thou 
sand seventy-three livres, eight deniers, nine sous, at that rate 
being one hundred sixty-six dollars and seventy-nine cents. 
Wherefore, I will carry to the debit of the United States 
the sum above mentioned at the same rate, being one hundred sixty-six dollars and eleven cents, so that you will owe 
only two hundred fifty-six dollars and sixty-eight cents to them. 
</p><p>
In my last, I had the honor to inform you, that the rate of 
depreciation had continued nearly about what it was on the 
twelfth of September, viz. two and a half to three for one. But, 
since that time, it has been approaching, at first gradually, and 
now rapidly, to par. When I left Paris, two days ago, gold 
was at about one and a half, and silver at about one and one 
tenth. The reason of this difference will go far to explain the 
phenomenon of a paper money rising in value, while the sum 
emitted goes on increasing. Gold is more easily concealed 
than silver. Whatever is discovered hidden is confiscated, and 
that which is not hidden is taken to the treasury, to be paid in 
Assignats at par hereafter. 
</p><p>
There is, however, another reason ; the war tax on the rich, 
added to the other taxes, disables them from placing their contingent of the forced loan, and therefore they are reduced to 
the necessity of selling what they possess most valuable, and 
the treasury, which can alone purchase with safety, fixes its 
own price. If, therefore, louis d ors should at length be under 
par, I should not be surprised. The sum of precious metals 
and materials in the treasury and mint is already very great ; 
(they say a milliard., or forty millions sterling) ; it is, I sup 
pose, exaggerated, but it is daily increasing. And. at the rate 
things go on, government will have accumulated in the city of 
Paris all the gold and silver, and a great part of the diamonds, 
pearls, &ic. of France. Of course, they will be in a condition 
to dismiss the Assignats from all farther employment, and to 
begin a new system full handed. 
</p><p>
They seern to think that, in this way, provision will be made 
for two campaigns, and that their enemies, astonished at such 
an immense resource, will be inclined to treat. A previous 
difficulty is, however, to be removed ; that is to say, some one 
person, or some small number of persons, must be named, who 
shall hold the unlimited power of treating and of executing the 
treaty. This will, I suppose, be speedily effected. It will re 
main to be discovered, whether those who are so sanguine, as 
to the dispositions of some, if not all of the Allied Powers, do 
not reckon without their host. 
</p><p>
I must, by the way, drop one word as to the overthrow of 
the Catholic religion. It is now expiring under wounds from 
the true French weapon, ridicule. The people who, five 
years since, fell down in the dirt as the consecrated matter 
passed by, now dance the carmagnole in holy vestments, and 
perform other mummeries, which it might seem profane to 
mention. The late Feast of Reason is a very striking feature 
in the countenance of the revolution. You know the opera 
girl, Saunier, who is, though very beautiful, next door to an ideot, as to her intellectual gifts. It is said also that she is 
anything, except what the French call sage. It is she, who 
lately asked the painter, David, to invent for her (to appear in 
the Ballet of Paris) some dress which should be more indecent 
than nakedness. And the painter, it seems, had genius 
enough to comply with her wish. But I speak only from hear 
say, not having been at any of the theatres for nearly two 
years. 
</p><p>
Well, Sir, it so happened that this actress, remarkable for 
fine attitude in dancing, was pitched upon to represent Reason 
in a kind of opera performed at Notre Dame. In the course 
of it, she stood in the place ci-devant most holy, and was 
there adored on bended knees by the President of the Convention, and other principal characters. At this spectacle, the 
devout will unquestionably be scandalized, and it seems, in effect, to be a strong experiment on the national feelings. The 
burning of legs, and arms, and grinders of saints, male and female, with relics from the wood of the original cross, must 
have the good effect of undeceiving those, who imagined there 
were miraculous qualities inherent in those crumbling materials. But the dismission of all the bishops and curates is a 
matter of more serious import. A national economy of near 
four millions sterling will be thereby effected ; but what degree of ferment may be excited by the disbanding of those 
ecclesiastical regiments, is yet a problem. 
</p><p>
I now proceed to state to you the grounds, on which different advocates erect their fabric of probabilities. To begin 
with those who calculate on the success of France. They 
say, that along the northern frontier from the ocean to the Ardennes, the campaign is null. That the enemy must winter in 
his own country, which, not being covered by fortresses or by 
natural defences, must be open to incursion all winter. That 
the army in Alsace, if Landau and Strasbourg be not taken, 
will find it difficult to retreat, and impossible to stay ; so that 
a Burgoynade may ensue. That from the falls of the Rhine 
to the Mediterranean, the untouched frontier is now guarded 
by impassable snows in the gorges of the Alps, leaving the re 
public in quiet possession of Savoy. That Toulon will soon 
be attacked with such vigor that it must fall. That the Pyrenean mountains now render all attempts on the part of Spain 
abortive. And that the flame kindled in the Vendee must be 
speedily extinguished, so that they will be able with undivided 
energy to oppose, nay attack, their enemies next spring, should 
they persist in hostility, and hence is adduced the probability 
of a peace, on such terms as France may dictate. , 
</p><p>
On the other hand, it is said, that Valenciennes and other adjacent places will cover the heart of Flanders and open that of 
France. That the sluices, especially in winter, form a sufficient defence for the maritime Flanders, and that a great superiority of cavalry will enable the enemy to lay waste Picardy, as 
soon as the French troops shall leave the field and go into winter 
quarters ; that Landau will be taken and Strasbourg surrendered, as it has neither garrison nor magazines ; in which case Alsace is irrecoverably lost, and the enemy, who can occupy the 
passes of the Vosges, will have an easy task to enter Champaign next spring ; that in the mountains of Franche Comte a 
second Vendee is preparing, and waits only the favorable 
moment to break out; that the Lyonese are impatient under 
the yoke, to which they have been compelled to submit, and 
will, of course, take arms whenever an opportunity offers ; that 
Toulon cannot be taken by a coup de main, and the same 
causes, which render the Alps and Pyrenees secure for the 
French, give like security to Spain, and Sardinia, wherefore 
their troops can go to Toulon ; that a numerous French army 
cannot long be subsisted there, in as much as the great city of 
Marseilles was formerly supplied from the coast ofBarbary; 
and thence it is inferred, that, the attempt on Toulon failing, 
Provence must fall, because the French troops must retire to 
a more plentiful country, so the durance will cover the pos 
session of the enemy, and enable him to turn his attention to 
wards Cevennes, in which there exists great discontent and strong 
dispositions for revolt; that should the Franc Comtois engage 
heartily in the royal cause, the Swiss may be brought into the 
league, and, pressing towards Lyons as soon as the campaign 
opens, oblige the French to retire from Savoy, and perhaps to 
abandon all to the eastward of the Rhone ; but at any rate, to 
hold a precarious possession of it until the troops, which winter in Piedmont, can advance into Dauphine. I believe that, 
on almost any hypothesis, it must be admitted that the Dauphinois can dispose of their own country. 
</p><p>
It is contended further, that the insurgents in the Cevennes 
and Auvergne could easily overrun the country along the Garonne and as far as Bordeaux, because the people are already indisposed, and only kept under by the fear of instant 
death. 
</p><p>
On the Vendee much is said. Fire and sword have been 
carried through that unhappy country ; of course, the proselytes 
made will return to their original sentiments, as soon as the 
incumbent terror is removed. It is here that the strong principle of religious fanaticism is to be calculated on. The future conduct cannot be defined, or even conjectured, on the 
ground of reason merely human. The firm persuasion, that 
death in the cause of God gives immediate possession of an 
endless beatitude, is capable of converting timidity into hero 
ism. Already the effects have been wonderful, and we ob 
serve that very few of the men, who have been sent to subdue 
the Vendee, have ever returned. 
</p><p>
A large party, which, at the lowest estimation, is not less 
than 15,000, have crossed the Loire, and marched into Lower 
Normandy and Brittany. That in this quarter they will find 
many congenial spirits is considered as certain, and also that 
their measures are combined with the British cabinet. At a 
distance from their home, nothing remains for them but victory 
or death. It is in this quarter, that the destruction of the 
Catholic religion is supposed to be most obnoxious. The 
clergy being driven to despair,. it is supposed that such of them 
as possess personal courage will march in the ranks. The 
insurgents are commanded by able men ; and the troop is com 
posed of the remnant of many battles. Hence it is concluded, 
that no opposition made to them by the raw levies from Nor 
mandy and Brittany can have any effect, and, of course, that 
the troops in the Vendee must go in pursuit of them. It is 
averred that in such case, the Vendee would rise, like a 
Phoenix from its ashes, more formidable than ever. That there 
is a corps of 12,000 men still remaining on the island of Noirmoutier and that neighborhood, which will come forward im 
mediately and recover all that has been lost and more. 
</p><p>
Lastly, it is said, that however splendid may be the financial 
arrangements, it will be impossible to hold out, unless the people can be taught to eat silver and gold, for that famine already 
partially felt must become general. This assertion is exaggerated, but I think much distress will be experienced on that 
account. 
Having thus given you the pros and cons, I leave you to 
make up your judgment. For my own part, I have observed 
that mankind are generally deceived both by their hopes and 
by their fears; and I persist in believing, that the fate of so 
great a country as this must ever depend much more upon 
interior sentiment, than on exterior operations. As to the 
operations of the insurgents, who are supposed to have in view 
either the town of St Malo, or an irruption into Normandy, or 
a march to Paris, I consider the last as the easiest and safest 
operation ; among other reasons, because it appears most difficult and hazardous. But I do not believe it will be attempted. 
</p><p>
The second, which would look like a serious combination to 
terminate the war, by re-establishing the monarchy, seems to 
me somewhat beyond the degree of talents, which has hitherto 
directed the Allies ; and, on the whole, I conclude that Britain, 
looking with an eye of cupidity at the port of Brest, wishes to 
get possession of St Malo, and extend a defensive line along 
the Ranee and Vilaine rivers, so as to include Lower Brittany, 
and try what can be done by force and persuasion towards the 
possession of that country. Whether this be the plan is one 
question. Whether it will succeed is another. Time will, 
discover the answer to one, and, perhaps, to both. I am, &LC.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
In mine of the sixteenth, I omitted to mention the fall of 
the Brissotin party and of the Duke of Orleans ; but it was a 
thing so much of course, that you had, doubtless, anticipated it. 
</p><p>
I mentioned to you that silver was nearly at par. In 
effect, it is now under par. Crowns, I am told, sell at two 
per cent discount, and bullion, I know, is at fifty two livres 
per marc, and the price for many years preceding the revolution was fifty-four, as I am told. For some days past there 
has been no foreign exchange. There are no buyers, be 
cause the person, who takes a bill, is considered as suspect 
ed, and persons suspected are put in prison, and persons in 
prison are so numerous, that none can get out, because, in the 
multitude of applications, there is no time to examine any 
particular complaint. 
</p><p>
You will form some more accurate idea of this situation, 
when I tell you that a young American by the name of Griffith, having lost at Havre my certificate that he was an 
American citizen, was taken up. I declined interfering for 
him at first, because I suspected that the certificate had been 
made use of for some sinister purpose ; but, when all matters 
were cleared up to my satisfaction, I applied to the Minister, 
and he to the Committee of Safety. I have repeated my applications for a month past, and, he has repeated his, and as 
yet nothing satisfactory is done, although I have no doubt of 
the disposition of government to give us satisfaction. 
</p><p>
They deliberate at present on the means of bringing their 
system a little more into form, and the Minister tells me that, 
as soon as that is effected, I shall have less frequent reason to 
complain, and more speedy and effectual redress. I hope 
this may be the case, for at present it is terrible. 
</p><p>
We have, as Mr Fenwick informs me, ninety-two sail of 
vessels at Bordeaux. I have formerly mentioned to you the 
embargo laid in that port. It has, at length, produced the 
greatest distress. The crews have consumed their provisions. 
The merchants will be saddled with heavy loss and cost. I 
have made reiterated applications ; but the situation of that 
city has prevented the Comite de Salut Public from a direct 
interference. The Commissaires have persisted in their 
measure of shutting the port. They promise Mr Fenwick 
redress from day to day. The Minister cannot promise 
redress to me, but he promises to try for it, and I believe he 
does try ; but I am sure that it is as yet without effect. 

In my last conference on the subject, two days ago, after 
having advanced the various reasons arising from the justice 
of the demand, and after stating to him the very great hard 
ship of the case, I hinted the extreme bad policy which 
would deter any American vessel from coming to France, 
unless reparation were made. I know not, as yet, the effect ; 
but I am sure that all commerce between this country and 
America must soon terminate, unless a more regular and 
orderly system shall soon take place. I expect that all the 
ports of America will be filled with complaints. And, from 
what Mr Fenwick writes, I suppose the public servants will 
be criminated, because France is without a regular government. This, to be sure, is not very just, but it is very natural. A choleric man beats the post, which he has struck his head against. I am, &c.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor of receiving your letters of the 7th, 14th and 
17th instants. I thank you for your attention in expediting the 
exequatur of the Sieur de la Motte, and in obtaining the liberation of the American citizen, Mountflorence. Citizen Griffith 
is still detained. 
</p><p>
I receive, every day, letters which present to me the sad 
picture of what the commerce of the United States suffers at 
Bordeaux. Our vessels came on the faith of treaties. 
Some carried provisions there, others went to take as freight, 
cargoes for the French Colonies, or foreign ports. Many 
were to return loaded with corn, flour, salt provisions, and 
other eatables. All are detained there. 
</p><p>
I will not repeat to you, Sir, the various observations, which 
I have had the honor to make to you at different times on 
this subject, for the principles of justice are so evident, that it 
is useless to speak of them. I will only mention, therefore, a 
motive of a different kind, but yet deserving attention. The 
advantage, not to say the necessity, of obtaining supplies of 
provisions for France, from foreign sources, is readily acknowl 
edged. Everything then which opposes this, is prejudicial to 
the most important interests of the Republic. Now, how can 
you persuade neutral vessels to enter French ports, when it 
will be obvious to them that they incur the risk of being 
detained there ? I should ill fulfil my duty, as the representative of a friendly and allied nation, did I not point out to you 
the danger to which the provisioning of France, and especially 
the capital, is exposed. 
</p><p>
It is true, interest is the moving spring of commercial operations, but the American owners, who have made voyages for 
France, in preference to the other countries of Europe, have 
also followed the impulse of feeling, which always influences 
the judgment, and consequently the calculations. Those of 
your friends, then, who are most attached to you. are the sufferers from this detention. I leave it to your good sense, Sir, 
to infer the consequences, and flatter myself that a just indemnification for this detention, and speedy permission to depart, 
will soon efface the unpleasant impression of the losses, which 
they have sustained, and that a hundred vessels, which are in 
the port of Bordeaux, will return loaded with flour, in three 
or four months, and thwart the designs of those who wish to 
starve the city of Paris. I have the honor to be, &tc.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I transmit to you enclosed a letter received open from Mr Cathalan, who has been disappointed in giving the needful 
surety for the due execution of his office, by the delay of his letters during the seige of Lyons, and other circumstances resulting from local situation. It seems probable that my corres ondence with him may be soon cut off, for if the French ar 
my does not speedily get possession of Toulon, I. think they 
will be obliged to abandon the enterprise, from the difficulty 
of obtaining subsistence. In that case Marseilles will fall of 
course, as well as the county of Nice, which has already cost 
much blood and treasure. 
</p><p>
The insurgents of Vendee, who had broken into Lower Normandy, seem to have divided themselves into various bands, 
and to have been attended with a varied success ; but, on the 
whole, the theatre of their operation is considerably extended, 
and we may hourly expect- to hear that they have received 
considerable reinforcements by sea. I persist in believing that 
to be the tender part of the French Republic, for many things 
concur to show, that a very large portion of the people are 
disposed to a counter revolution ; but they dare not stir until 
a sufficient force shall appear ; for they are without arms, or 
union, or any means of understanding each other, while the 
examples are so striking and terrifying, that every individual, 
whatever may be his political tenets, trembles at the exercise 
of that authority which, whether willingly or unwillingly is a 
matter of indifference, he contributes to support. 
</p><p>
Since my last, the new organization, or rather regulation, of 
the government system has taken place ; but, to my poor conception, it appears as inefficient and as discordant as ever. If 
I am not mistaken, it must soon undergo farther changes. 
</p><p>
I enclose also herein a copy of my letter of the ninth to the 
Minister, by which you will observe that I endeavor to obtain, 
by a sense of their own interest, the release of our ships from 
the harbor of Bordeaux, since the sense of justice has not yet 
produced the effect. To reason at a distance, and in generals, 
it would seem almost impossible that this outrageous grievance 
should be continued ; but yet I do not dare to flatter myself 
with the removal of it. The Representatives of the people 
sent into the departments are vested with unlimited power. In 
the exercise of it they suspend decrees of the Convention, fine, 
imprison, in short, do everything, which to them appears needful for the public safety. They assign their reasons after 
wards, if called on by the Convention for that purpose. But 
it seems to be understood, that their acts must not be reversed 
until after their return, unless they should indeed be charged 
as contre-revolutionaires, and then everything is overturned. 
</p><p>
I need not dwell on such a state of things, for you will 
readily draw all the perplexing and vexatious consequences. 
Happy they, who contemplate them at a distance. A view of 
what our countrymen suffer in this respect so torments me, 
that it is very difficult to be patient. I am, &c.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
A letter, which I have just received from the citizen Griffith, informs me that he has been two months in prison, with 
out any charge whatever being exhibited against him. It i 
a long time since I solicited the liberty of this citizen, with the 
persuasion of his innocence, but his long detention induces 
me to apprehend that I may have been mistaken. I pray 
you, Sir, to favor me with the cause of his detention, that I 
may render an account of the same to the United States. 
</p><p>
Daily complaints are addressed to me from Bordeaux, 
where the embargo is still in full force. Some exceptions in 
favor of those vessels, said to be loaded on account of that re 
public, have produced the effect, which might have been expected. Some, from a principle of respect for the government, suppose that these are individual speculations made on 
the general misfortune, in the hope that the markets of the 
United States, unfurnished in consequence of the embargo, 
will offer an early and advantageous sale for the cargoes, 
which have lately been despatched to them. Others insist 
that the speculations in question are on the account of government, and you may easily conceive the sensations which 
this idea produces. 
</p><p>
However it be, it seems to me necessary on every possible 
account to remedy the evil as soon as possible. I demand 
justice for my countrymen from the French Republic, not 
only from a sense of duty to the United States, but also from 
regard to France. Be assured, Sir, that your enemies could 
not mark out for you a course of conduct more to your disadvantage, than that which I have just laid before you. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to subjoin to this letter, the copy of a petition sent to me by the American citizen, John Gray. He 
informs me that on his arrival, on the loth of December, a 
guard was placed on board his brig, and that a member of the 
Committee at Subsistence told him, that he would be personally 
responsible, if any portion of the rice were discharged, even 
to nourish his own countrymen. He offered the cargo to this 
Committee, which referred him to the Committee appointed to 
purchase goods arriving in neutral vessels. This latter committee told him that they were not provided with the powers requisite to grant to any person whatever the conditions set forth 
in his petitions, and that he must apply to the representatives 
of the people in this city. These are too much occupied to 
pay the least attention to his business. He therefore says to 
me, as I can sell my cargo neither to the nation, nor to individuals, as I am forbidden to distribute it among my countrymen, 
who are in a state of extreme suffering, let me at least be permitted to depart, and seek commerce and liberty elsewhere. 
</p><p>
You will observe, Sir, in the petition of citizen Gray, that he 
was informed, during his passage, of the state of things at 
Bordeaux, and that he decided to continue his route, only in 
the opinion that the news he received was merely a calumny 
invented by the enemies of France. I have no doubt that this 
intelligence is now spread abroad in America. Judge then 
whether it be not of moment to efface as soon as possible the 
impression it may make. I have the honor to be, &tc.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I do myself the honor to transmit herewith duplicates of 
mine, of the sixteenth and twenty-sixth of November and 
twelfth of December. I also enclose copies of my letters 
of the twenty-ninth of December to the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs and of his answer ; of mine of the fourth of January, introducing the deputation sent up from Bordeaux, and 
of his of the twenty-sixth of Nivose in reply to it. 
</p><p>
The young man, Mr Griffith, whom I mentioned in mine 
of the twenty-sixth of November, is at length out of prison ; 
but another, of the name of Hoskins, still remains in confinement, and this merely because the multiplicity of business be 
fore the Committee prevents them from attending to anything. 
</p><p>
I learn that the number of persons arrested in this city 
amounts to fifteen thousand, and that through the Republic is 
more than tenfold more numerous. The petitions before 
them could not be read through in less than a year, supposing 
ten hours a day appropriated to that purpose ; and, as the 
arrestations are daily continued, those who are confined are in 
a sad and hopeless condition. 
</p><p>
The wiser part of those, who are at the head of affairs, are 
sensible that such severe measures must prove injurious, and 
perhaps fatal ; but they dare not appear as the advocates for 
the unfortunate, lest they should partake of their situation. 
Late experiments justify their apprehensions, and, if I may 
judge, the outs, who wish to be ins, will use this as a lever to 
overturn the power of their opponents ; so that the general 
gaol delivery, if effected, will come from those who inveigh 
against, not from those who propose it. The reason is clear. 
To advocate such a measure exposes to the charge of Moderatisme ; and you will observe here, that as Brissotisme succeeded to Fayettisme, which has succeeded to Aristocratic, so 
Moderatisme is now heir to all the odium of Brissotisme. 
Robespierre has luckily hit on the term Ultra-revolutionaire, and brought it with good success into the field against 
the term Contre-revolutionaire ; but it seems likely that 
Moderatisme, will prove too hard for Ultra-revolutionaire. 
</p><p>
I cut short these observations, to give you a sketch of the 
state of parties. Previous to which, however, lest I should 
forget it, I must mention, that Thomas Paine is in prison, 
where he amuses himself with publishing a pamphlet against 
Jesus Christ. I do not recollect whether I mentioned to 
you, that he would have been executed along with the rest of 
the Brissotines, if the adverse party had not viewed him with 
contempt. I incline to think that, if he is quiet in prison, he 
may have the good luck to be forgotten. Whereas, should 
he be brought much into notice, the long suspended axe 
might fall on him. I believe he thinks, that I ought to claim 
him as an American citizen ; but, considering his birth, his 
naturalization in this country, and the place he filled, I doubt 
much the right, and I am sure that the claim would be, for 
the present at least, inexpedient and ineffectual. 
</p><p>
There seems to be at present three parties among the doers 
of the day ; for I except those, who are entirely indisposed to 
the government. The one may be called the Dantonists, 
with whom Robespierre is connected, and who wish, by 
mildness and something like a government of laws, to inspire 
a sort of attachment to the revolution, apprehending that the 
people, so often disappointed in the expectations held out to 
them, may at length, by a kind of general effort, arising not 
from any particular plot or conspiracy, but from the universal 
sense of oppression, overturn the whole affair, which, what 
ever may be its future and national effect, must necessarily 
occasion their immediate and personal ruin. 
</p><p>
The second may be called the Parisian party, being those 
who wish by a new blow from the populace of this city to make 
a second edition of the piece acted on the 31st of May last, 
and thereby put themselves in the places of such as may be 
then sent to the guillotine. 
</p><p>
The third may be called the Ministerial party, and although 
the Ministers are, at present, no more than a kind of clerks, 
subject to the imperative, and too often the imperious, mandates 
of a Committee, yet as they are supported privately by those 
who wish to bring forward the Constitution, and as they have 
the natural advantage of men doing business with Committees, 
to see how much is sacrificed, and how much neglected, and 
thence show the great abuses inseparable from that sort of 
government, they have more weight and consistency, than 
would, at first sight, be imagined. As the present actors have 
more energy, as well as more experience, than those who 
suffered themselves to be elbowed off the stage on the 31st of 
May, I presume that things will be brought much sooner to a 
crisis. 
</p><p>
There is at present a plot in petto, which may, perhaps, 
blow up the Dantonists. I have heard different versions of it, 
and, therefore, will not give you any of them, because it is well 
known that matters of that kind undergo many changes before 
they are exhibited, and, besides, the whole affair may die 
away ; especially if any general danger should oblige the par 
ties to be friends for a month or two longer. Let parties rise or fall as they may, I do not think the present form of government by Committees can long stand. We have seen such a 
system fall by its own weight, when exercised on a much 
smaller scale, and any one who has anything to do with Committees here complains, which is the first step towards their 
ruin. 
</p><p>
The successes of the Republic will give pleasure to all those 
who are attached to France ; for whatever may be the opinions 
as to a government, which may undergo yet a dozen changes, 
it seems to be demonstrable from facts, that the plan of 
dismemberment, which I long since communicated, really 
exists, and it is that plan which has foiled the Allies. Admit 
ting what has been asserted by persons in a situation to know 
the truth, and deeply interested to prove the contrary of their 
assertion, that nine tenths of the nation are inimical to the 
government, it is an undoubted truth that ninety-nine hundredths are opposed to all ideas of a dismemberment, and will 
fight to prevent it. Hence it happens, that so few have joined 
the enemy on any part of the frontiers, except the inhabitants 
of Alsace, who have been, in their hearts, Germans; and hence 
also it happens, that the Vendee has been so vigorous in its 
operation, as in that quarter they fought simply to restore the 
ancient government and religion. If the allies had given them 
aid, God knows what would have been the consequence; but 
as the clear object, when aid was at length offered, consisted 
only in possessing themselves of strong holds for their own use, 
the whole plan has fallen through, and a great number of those 
poor people have been sacrificed. Exaggerated accounts state 
the destruction of the human race in that quarter at near a 
million of souls. It certainly has been very great, though not, 
perhaps, more than half that number. I am much mistaken if 
the spirit of revolt be quelled, although, for want of opportunity, 
it may not again perhaps break out. 
</p><p>
Toulon was evacuated rather than taken. Perhaps, if the 
evacuation had not been decided on, it would have been kept; 
but certainly the brisk attacks of the French precipitated very 
much the measures of the enemies. In my opinion, it was a 
great blunder not to throw succors into that place ; for, if it 
had been held a little longer, the French army must have re 
treated, from the want of subsistence. 
</p><p>
In like manner, it is now evident that if Bordeaux, Marseilles, Lyons, and Toulon, had all declared at the same time, 
instead of showing their evil dispositions one after the other, 
the whole southern part of France was irrecoverably lost to the 
Republic. And if the good faith of the enemy had not been 
suspected, this union of measures would have taken place. I 
learn, in like manner, that Strasbourg would have been delivered up, if the Emperor had not desired to take it in his own 
name, instead of that of Louis the Seventeenth. The Allies, 
not being able to possess themselves of this place, (in which 
the plan of surrendering was discovered, and its effects pre 
vented,) and failing at the same time in their blockade of 
Landau, which held out longer than they had calculated, were 
obliged to retire into winter quarters, and as this could not be 
unknown to the enemy, of course, they were attacked on all 
sides, and by a vast superiority of numbers. At first, the 
French were repulsed everywhere ; but the repetition of at 
tacks, (for there were in the whole between thirty and forty), 
wearied the defendants, who, by no resource of the military 
art, could bear up against the bodily fatigue of constant fight 
ing. The physical constitution of the French is more adapted to this service, than perhaps any other on earth. T &gt; re 
treat became necessary, and a retreat once begun, was continued from necessity, because the French kept pouring in 
fresh supplies of men when opposed, and continued their rapid 
advance wherever they were victorious. Mayence and Fort 
Louis could alone stop their pursuit. 
</p><p>
They are now taking off everything in .the country, which 
they have possessed themselves of, and in so doing, they form 
a barrier against themselves ; but what is to them of more importance is, that they form also a barrier against their enemies. 
On the north, it seems to be determined not to give the Allies 
any rest, and the calculation is simple. The soldiers brought 
from a distance cannot easily be replaced, and by constant 
fighting they may be destroyed, for their country being open, 
they have nothing to defend them but posts, which, however 
strong, may be carried by superior numbers. It is true that 
every one of the Germans so destroyed, may cost a dozen 
Frenchmen ; but, it is said that the dozen can be replaced 
more easily than the one. Mutual plunderings form a part of 
this warfare. Judge, then, how it must thin the ranks of man 
kind. I believe that nothing like it has appeared in Europe 
since the crusades. 
</p><p>
The resources of this country, its real resources I mean, are 
wearing away very fast, and if it be true, as it is said, that the 
population is already diminished one tenth within the last two 
years, it will have, at least, this one good effect, that the consumption of provisions must diminish in the same proportion. 
The fear of famine seems to be general ; and although I flatter 
myself that its greatest ravages may be avoided, yet I do not 
readily see how the resistance of the next campaign is to be 
effected, if the whole force engaged against France should 
continue its operation. 
</p><p>
I am premised daily, that the embargo laid on our ships in 
the port of Bordeaux shall be taken off, and an indemnification 
be granted for the losses which it has occasioned. I have 
never been able to learn why it was laid ; but have some reason to believe, that just ground of suspicion had been given as 
to the voyages, the cargoes, and even the property of some of 
the vessels then in that port. The deputation now here is pursuing the affair before the Committees, and will, I trust, be successful, as it had already been resolved on to give adequate 
redress, and I presume that they will not impair the favorable 
intentions which existed previous to their arrival. 
</p><p>
The ratio between paper and the precious metals remains 
about the same as it was when I last quoted it. Foreign ex 
changes have received a sad stroke. Monsieur Cambon had 
declared last June, that by the first of January the exchange should be at par. As the measures of policy, on which his 
prediction was founded, had not met with all the success de 
sired, it became necessary to supply the deficiency by force. 
</p><p>
You will learn with some surprise, perhaps, that all the 
funds belonging to French citizens in foreign countries have 
been put in requisition. Every man is called on to declare 
not only his own property abroad, but also that of others, 
which may have come to his knowledge ; the whole under 
the usual penalty of the guillotine. Such sums as are thus discovered are to be paid for at par, and every one is prohibited 
from purchasing bills on any pretext whatever. If this mea 
sure furnishes the expected resource, which I doubt, it cuts 
off all future hope. And if it does not furnish a very great re 
source, there will exist in the national affairs a deficit of serious magnitude, for they must face the demand abroad, or renounce the hope of supplies from thence, and on the expectation of such supplies depends the hope of avoiding in this city 
the evils of want, if not of absolute famine. 
</p><p>
It is a long time since I had the honor to mention to you 
Mr Francis Coffyn, acting at Dunkirk as Consul of the United 
States. This worthy man's interference in the affair of the 
Little Cherub (which, by the bye, remains yet undecided) has, 
through the intrigues of those concerned in the privateer, been 
the occasion of putting him in prison as a suspected person. 
The ground of which suspicion is. the having corresponded with 
Calorine, while Minister on the affairs of the town of Dunkirk, 
which had, it seems, some demand on the court. I have, in 
his absence, desired his son to attend to the affairs formerly in 
the hands of his father, and as he is a man of business, and by 
no means deficient in understanding, I trust that he will be 
able to conduct them well. 
</p><p>
I cannot, however, avoid repeating my wish, that Consuls, 
and Vice Consuls were appointed everywhere, for there is 
great need of them. It would have been happy had some one 
been named in this city as Consul, or by any other name or 
title, who might have followed up the Committees, waited day 
after day in their ante-chamber and the like, so as to plague 
them into decisions. The Ministers, as I have already mentioned, stand in such a situation that they dare not push the 
Committees very hard. You will easily see, that I cannot quit 
the regular line of application through the channel the government has thought proper to institute for the purpose. And, 
indeed, besides the impropriety of putting off the character of 
Minister to put on that of intriguant, or at best of a solicitor, I 
know that it would be a useless, as well as pernicious sacrifice of the national dignity. 
</p><p>
I have been requested by some to rename a person for that 
purpose ; but I have many objections to that measure, among 
which it is no small one that I have not the right to do it ; and, 
moreover, the state of things has long been, and still continues 
to be so critical, that every man, having even the shadow of a 
public character, is liable to the danger of compromising him 
self every instant. Hitherto, therefore, [ have left every one 
to choose his own agent for the conduct of his business, be 
cause the blame, which must inevitably fall, will then lie on 
the individual. I say that blame must fall, because those at a 
distance, judging only from appearances and from professions, 
form golden expectations, and imagine that nothing more is 
necessary, in order to realize them, than to bring forward 
something in the shape of an American. Facts are very different from such appearances. 
</p><p>
I suppose that the new Minister has, or shortly will have arrived at Philadelphia. I did not see him, for just as he went 
away, I was forced by one of the Committees into a dispute, 
which put them all out of humour, although they were soon 
sensible they were wrong. It is not worth while to go into 
the history of it, because the affair is blown over, and because 
the conduct of men in the midst of a revolution is not to be 
judged so severely as under a regular government. 
</p><p>
It is a long time since I learnt the attack of the Algerines, 
but as I knew that advices had been sent off to you, I did not 
mention it, not having then an immediate opportunity. I shall 
have occasion to say something on the subject shortly. I 
am, &c.

My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
In a newspaper of this day I find the translation of your 
message of the fifth of December to Congress, and observe, 
that after stating the violation of the treaty by a decree of the 
National Convention, you tell them I have been instructed to 
make representations on the subject. 
</p><p>
Now this, my dear Sir, is the first I hear, and all I know 
of such instructions. Indeed I have received no letters, news 
papers, or other intelligence from America, since those which 
Captain Culver brought. I suppose this arises from the difficulty of communication ; but whatever be the cause, I feel 
the effect. It would be of some use if a clerk in the office of 
Foreign Affairs had by triplicates mentioned from time to 
time which of my letters were received. Thus on the present occasion, I should know whether my correspondence with 
the Minister on the subject of this obnoxious decree was be 
fore you. 
</p><p>
As it is, not being able to determine the nature of the representations, which you have desired me to make, I am 
obliged to be silent. And unless more than one copy has 
been sent, I may never receive your orders, and at any rate it 
will be at no early day. I am sure it is superfluous to tell 
you, how painful it is for a person in my situation to be totally 
ignorant of what passes in his own country, and whether the 
conduct which, under circumstances continually changing, he 
finds it necessary to pursue, does, or does not consist with the 
views of government. Blaming a wrong step would prevent 
a repetition of it ; but really at present I walk in the dark, or 
at best by the feeble light of my own conjectures. 
</p><p>
I know not whether my brethren have the same dearth of 
intelligence. Mr Short complained of it much when I last 
saw him, and has since mentioned the same thing from Madrid, so that I conclude the evil to arise from the negligence 
of those to whom letters are entrusted. Might it not be advisable to send every month a small packet to Europe ? 
They might come alternately to Havre and Lisbon, and that 
which arrives at Lisbon come on thence to Havre, that which 
arrives at Havre go from thence to Lisbon. In this way a 
regular correspondence would be kept up, and by seizing for inimportant communications the private conveyances which offer, 
full intelligence would be given and received. Six packets 
would be amply sufficient for the service, and if, as I believe, 
small schooners could be safely employed, the prime cost 
would not be above three thousand pounds sterling, and the annual expense, I should suppose, not more than half of that sum. 
</p><p>
I beg your pardon, my dear Sir, for troubling you with this 
groaning epistle. I will not say one word of news, as in supposeable circumstances it might prevent this letter from reaching you. I adhere to the opinions expressed in my last. 
Adieu.

Sir, 
</p><p>
Thomas Paine has just made application to me, to claim 
him as a citizen of the United States. The following, I believe, are the facts with regard to him. He was born in Eng 
land; becoming afterwards a citizen of the United. States, he 
gained great celebrity there, by his revolutionary writings. In consequence, he was adopted as a French citizen, and then 
chosen a member of the Convention. His conduct from that 
time has not come under my cognizance. I am ignorant of 
the cause of his present detention in the prisons of Luxembourg ; but I pray you, Sir, if any reasons with which I am 
unacquainted oppose his liberation, to have the goodness to 
inform me of them, that I may communicate them to the government of the United States. I have the honor to be, &c.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
The government of this country having resolved, in execution of the eighth article of the treaty of amity and commerce, 
concluded between the United States of America, and his 
most Christian Majesty, on the sixth day of February, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>, 
to employ their good offices with the Regency of Algiers, to 
bring about a treaty of peace, have desired me to nominate 
and appoint some person on the part of the United States, to 
be present and assist at the negotiations to be had and 
made for that purpose ; and, you having consented to under 
take that office, I have by a commission of this day authorised you to negotiate and conclude such treaty on the part of 
the United States of America. It becomes necessary, there 
fore, to explain to you my situation, and thence, as well as 
from the circumstances of the moment, to deduce rules for 
your government. 
</p><p>
And, first, you are to know that my appointment of you is a 
mere assumption of power on my part, no such authority being given to me as that which is implied in your commission. 
I act on this occasion upon the principle, that where great 
public interests are concerned, and when, from .the nature of 
the case, it is impossible that the will of the government can 
be seasonably expressed, the confidential servants of the pub 
lic are in duty bound to imply that will. But your good sense 
will show you, that by reason hereof, a more critical degree of 
responsibility is incurred. And hence results two rules for 
your guidance. 
</p><p>
1. Avoid as much as possible all interference, leaving the 
business to the agents of this government, and only advising 
with them, so as to secure to the utmost the interests of the 
United States, in the treaty which they may be able to conclude. 
</p><p>
2. In any such treaty, whether you do, or do not, appear 
as a Commissioner, take care that it be limited to a short period, (such, for instance, as one year,) unless approved by the 
United States. Such approbation to be expressed by the 
President of the said States, agreeably to the Constitution 
thereof. 
</p><p>
I give you herewith a copy of the treaty concluded between 
the United States and the Emperor of Morocco, which will 
serve as a model or groundwork for you to go by. I expect 
that the Regency of Algiers will be exorbitant in their demands 
of money, as heretofore they have been ; and I presume that 
some unfriendly European powers (I might say unchristian 
powers) may endeavor to counteract you ; the rather, as I am 
informed, that a British Consul in that quarter has declared 
that America will never obtain a treaty with Algiers, but 
through the medium of his government. It is proper, there 
fore, that the business be conducted with the utmost secrecy, 
and that you appear, what by birth you are, a Frenchman, at 
least until some good purpose can be answered by the exhibition of your true character and country. It will be useful to 
inculcate on your companions the same secrecy, which I have 
just requested you to preserve. 
</p><p>
The method by which, as far as I can learn, a treaty has 
hitherto been avoided, and which may perhaps be still pursued 
is, by demanding of the United States a sum of money out of 
all proportion to the object. And as far as it has come to my 
knowledge, the disposition of America is divided between the 
obtaining such treaty by purchase or by force. We have 
heard, I know not with what truth, that the United States are 
fitting out thirty frigates. Be it as it may, the report can be 
turned to account on the present occasion. It may be insinuated to the Dey and his Ministers, that the United States will 
send a fleet into the Mediterranean manned with the best sea 
men in the world, (for such the seamen, natives of America, 
unquestionably are,) with orders to cruise continually and intercept all vessels whatever going to or coming from the port 
of Algiers. That with this fleet are to be connected some 
light armed schooners, and a body of riflemen hunters, whose 
skill, whose activity, and whose courage are unequalled ; that 
this armament will be directed to rendezvous in the port of 
Malta, in order to commence their operations. 
</p><p>
It will be proper to state the greatest amount of all their 
captures from the United States, since the year <a href='/results.php?year=1783'>1783</a> to the 
present hour, and, without making any deductions therefrom 
for the expense of the armaments against our commerce, (and 
which would probably exceed the value of the prizes,) divide 
the same by ten for the number of years. t It will then appear 
of how little value is the object, even could it be longer pursued without risk or inconvenience. It will appear that, if the 
whole amount had gone into the Dey's coffers, he would not 
be much benefitted thereby, and he should be made- to observe, that if the Americans pursue their plan, and obtain, as 
they may, subsidies from the Italian States and others, their 
armaments will cost them nothing, and he will lose the sum he 
now receives for preserving peace with those States. 
</p><p>
The United States have less shipping than is needful to 
carry their produce, and the latter increases faster than the 
former ; so that they can easily forego the commerce of the 
Mediterranean, seeing that they would then be unable to get 
back, of course they could take nothing from us, and would 
lose much by engaging with us. 
</p><p>
From what I have just said, you will see that it is my object 
to obtain a peace with the smallest possible sacrifice of money, 
for nothing, if you can. But whether a treaty be, or be not, 
made, it will be proper to get back the unfortunate men who 
are captives in that country. If a peace be obtained, their re 
lease should be one article of it. If not, you must contrive to 
get them away for as little money as possible. And it would 
be well to obtain such passports as may carry them home, lest 
they should be intercepted in their return. 
</p><p>
Before I conclude, it is proper to mention the expense to 
be incurred on this occasion ; and this I divide into two parts, 
national and personal. This government will make due pro 
vision for the former, and it must be your object to confine it 
within narrow bounds. It is true that neither you nor I can 
incur any responsibility in relation to that object, beause I have 
fully expressed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs my total 
want of authority ; and, consequently, their actsare purely their 
own ; but, still, as the United States will be under a kind of 
honorary obligation to discharge the debt, which may thus be 
incurred, it is our duty to render it as light as possible. 
</p><p>
As to your personal expense, I will pay it, and I pray you to 
be as economical as circumstances will permit; for I must 
again repeat to you, that, having no authority to act, if my 
conduct should be disapproved, it is but just that the cost be 
defrayed by me. 
</p><p>
And now, Sir, I commit you to your own understanding and 
discretion, of which you have a plentiful share, and to the 
protection of God. If you succeed, as I hope and believe 
you will, I doubt not you will receive the grateful acknowledgements of America. My thanks are already due for the 
readiness with which you have undertaken this task, which is 
by no means a pleasant or agreeable one. I am, &tc.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
The Captains of American vessels brought into your ports, 
and persons interested in the said vessels and their cargoes, 
address to me very serious complaints, which seem but too 
well founded. 
</p><p>
I will not here examine the measure itself, excusable per 
haps on account of the extraordinary circumstances in which 
the Republic is placed. But even could severe necessity 
justify a violation of the rights of a neutral and allied nation, 
she ought, at Jeast, to expect to suffer only the inevitable 
grievances arising from this violation. She has a right to 
expect, that the French Republic will be so much the more 
liberal and prorhpt in making compensation for these forced 
supplies, as the method by which she took possession of them 
was uncommon. 
</p><p>
But T see with regret that those who, sailing for France, had 
the misfortune to be carried into England, have had less cause 
of complaint, than those who have been brought into the ports 
of the Republic. Here delays and expense consume the 
whole. Some of the American vessels have been retaken, 
but the Captains, kept with part of their crews, on board the 
French vessels, which had captured them, have not been 
informed of their recapture until their arrival in some port of 
the Republic, where for months they have solicited indemnification, assistance, means of subsistence, and permission to 
depart. I am sorry to add that all their solicitations have 
been fruitless. The Captains Florence, Donavan, and Benjamin Rogers, carried into Brest by the ship VImpetueux, 
Captain I Eveque, are in this predicament. 
</p><p>
Many vessels and American cargoes, among others the 
cargo of the Danish ship, le Krageroc, are in the same port, 
and I am told, that there is no one there, authorised by the 
Republic, to treat for the cargoes, to pay the freight of the 
vessels, or to fix the indemnification, xvhich the aggrieved 
persons think they have a right to demand. Thus the unfortunate men captured at sea, by the ships of an allied nation, 
and carried prisoners into her remote ports, find themselves, 
although without means and almost destitute of resources, 
obliged to undertake a long and expensive journey to obtain 
that justice, which at least can only be rendered to them in the 
ports which they have left, since it is there that the articles 
must be proved, and their prices regulated according to their 
quality. 
</p><p>
I hope, Sir, that the most precise orders will be despatched 
to remedy these grievances, and that you will soon enable me 
to give a satisfactory account of them to the American 
Government. I have the honor to be, &LC.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My last was of the 21st of January. I am still without any 
advices from you since your letters by Captain Culver, which 
I attribute to the interruptions, to which all communication 
with this country is exposed, and which for that, among many 
other reasons, I much lament. Amid the political storms 
which vex this hemisphere, the opinion of the United States is 
the polar star, which should guide my course, but which is to 
tally concealed from my view. 
</p><p>
Hoskins, whose imprisonment I mentioned in my last, has 
been liberated. I mentioned also that there had been some 
feeble attempts to adopt lenient measures, and substitute a 
government of law to the present system ; but hinted, at the 
same time, my apprehension that they would prove unsuccessful. You will see by the late decree that this apprehension 
was well founded, and that entire reliance is placed on severity and the resulting fear. This may perhaps succeed, 
but is exposed to a double danger. First, it facilitates the intrigues and the operations of the foreign enemy, by exciting 
attachment to the former, and aversion to the present government ; and, secondly, it breaks the minds of the people, and 
prepares them for an abject submission to an usurper, should 
any such arise in the course of successful war, either civil or 
foreign. 
</p><p>
I have mentioned Mr Paine's confinement. Major Jackson, 
who, by the bye, has not given me a letter from you, which he 
says was merely introductory, but left it with the Comite de Surete Generate as a kind of letter of credence, Major Jack 
son, relying on his great influence with the leaders here, stepped 
forward to get Mr Paine out of gaol, and, with several other 
Americans, has presented a petition lo that effect, which was 
referred to that Committee and the Comite de Saint Public. 
This last, I understand, slighted the application as totally 
irregular ; and some time afterwards Mr Paine wrote me a 
note, desiring I would claim him as an American, which I accordingly did, though contrary to my judgment, for reasons 
mentioned in my last. The Minister's letter to me of the first Ventose, of which I enclose a copy, contains the answer to my 
reclamation. I sent a copy to Mr Paine, who prepared a long 
answer, and sent it to me by an Englishman, whom I do not know. 
</p><p>
I told him, as Mr Paine's friend, that my present opinion 
was similar to that of the Minister, but I might, perhaps, see occasion to change it, and in that case, if Mr Paine wished it, I 
would go on with the claim, but that it would be well for him to 
consider the result, that if the government meant to release him 
they had already a sufficient ground ; but if not, I could only 
push them to bring on his trial for the crimes imputed to him ; 
seeing that, whether he be considered as a Frenchman, or as 
an American, he must be amenable to the tribunals of France 
for his conduct while he was a Frenchman, and he may aee in 
the fate of the Brissotins that to which he is exposed. I have 
heard no more of the affair since ; but it is not impossible that 
he may force on a decision, which, as far as I can judge, 
would be fatal to him ; for, in the best of times, he had a larger share of every other sense than of common sense, and lately 
the intemperate use of ardent spirits has, I am told, consider 
ably impaired the small stock, which he originally possess 
ed. 
</p><p>
The plan communicated to you of a requisition on all bankers, merchants, and others, to furnish bills for their funds 
abroad, and receive payment in Assignats at par, has totally 
failed, as might have been supposed. It was the boy in the 
fable who killed the goose which laid golden eggs. As a succedaneum, they have obliged the same people to execute joint 
and several obligations (billets solidaires) payable to the bearer for fifty millions of livres, say a forced loan of two millions 
sterling. These are to be negotiated in foreign countries, and 
the nation agrees to take them up again hereafter. What is 
somewhat extraordinary is, that a few of the monied men 
seem to believe in the success of this measure ; but I own I 
can scarcely conceive of it, for if foreigners believe in the ultimate success of the Republic, and in the integrity of her future 
government, the intervention of private credit would be unnecessary ; and, if not, it must be useless ; because, should 
the Republic be overturned, the plea of duress, by the individuals who have signed, must defeat all hope of recovery ; and 
because, if the Republic succeedirig, should be deficient in her 
integrity, the individuals would be of course covered by law 
against all judicial pursuit. Add to this, that there is a kind 
of absurdity in signing such obligations, by which the richest 
man binds himself for four times as much as he is worth. On 
this pin, however, is suspended, for the present, all hope of 
facing numerous and pressing engagements for indispensable 
supplies from abroad. 
</p><p>
I told you in former letters, that I apprehended a great 
scarcity of food for the present, or rather the coming campaign, should the Allied Powers persist in their hostility. 
</p><p>
They do persist, though the King of Prussia, taking advantage of circumstances, insists on being paid for the blood of 
his subjects. Food is already very scarce. Flesh is hardly 
to be obtained in Paris, and the drought of last summer reduced the crop of garden produce so low, that it is now nearly exhausted, and no great addition to be expected for three 
long months. 
</p><p>
You, who know the abundance of former times, will per 
haps form a better judgment by price than by description. 
Take therefore, as a sample, cabbages twenty-four sous, and 
carrots eight sous a piece, and other things in proportion ; 
sea fish are reduced in quantity, by reason of the war and 
the total want of flesh on the sea coast, to a degree incredible. 
For instance, the wealthiest families in Rouen, Havre, &ic. 
are obliged for many succeeding days to content themselves 
with two or three pounds of very bad salt pork, half a pound 
of bread each, and such few vegetables as they can procure. 
The distant departments have many of them been at short allowance for three months past ; others for a shorter period ; 
and Paris has been supplied as long as possible. But the re 
sources for flesh being at an end, the bulk of the inhabitants 
must soon come to bread alone. Now supposing a very 
doubtful fact, that the magazines of corn are sufficient for 
common times, and that no difficulty be experienced in the 
manufacturing and transportation, yet, as the consumption of 
that article must be increased by the want of all others, very 
serious evil is to be apprehended. As I write, I recollect 
some other articles of price, which during my late residence in 
Paris I heard mentioned. Eggs ten sous each, and salted 
herrings the same price. These last were the only things, 
which the poor could get the day before I left town, viz. the 
first of March, and these bad. Pulse is at thirty sous a 
quart. 
</p><p>
The enemy is collecting himself for an immense effort on 
the northern frontier. The troops of the Republic have long 
been assembling in the same quarter. Will the supplies be 
sufficient for the army and for the capital ? That is a question of serious magnitude. If Paris runs resty, the revolution 
is done. If the army disbands, the game is equally over. 
And such events have taken place since the government 
adopted terror for its maxim and support, that if once that 
terror were, by superior force, to receive a counter direction 
the Ancien Regime, or any other Regime, would, I think, be 
submitted to without the slightest struggle. 
</p><p>
The Vendee, so often and so totally destroyed in reports 
made to the Convention, seems still to exist, and to wait for 
the meditated descent from Great Britain, to break out with 
more violence than ever. If the royalists should again collect 
an army in that quarter, I believe it will become on both sides 
a war of extirpation. Torrents of blood have been already 
shed there, and, if the accounts from thence be not greatly exaggerated, another campaign like the last would convert the 
whole country into a desert. Barrere, in assigning at the bar 
of the Convention the causes of the present scarcity, said, that 
the Vendee, which used to furnish Paris market weekly with 
six hundred large beeves, now wants provisions ! 
</p><p>
I have often had occasion to mention the embargo laid at 
Bordeaux, and the sufferings of our countrymen consequent 
upon it. I have also mentioned the arrival of a deputation 
from that port to solicit the business in Paris. The day pre 
ceding their arrival the Minister told me, that everything 
should be settled to my satisfaction in two or three days. The 
deputation, to whom I communicated this intelligence, seemed 
very apprehensive lest their claims for damages should be referred to persons on the spot, which I own appeared to me 
both fair and natural; but they assigned reasons against it, 
which were satisfactory to themselves, and as they were determined to have everything adjusted in their own way, and 
were well convinced that their representations must have the 
desired effect; as they seemed, moreover, to be filled with 
suspicions of Mr Fenwick, which seemed to me ill founded, 
and therefore very liable to adopt them in respect to any other 
of the public servants, I thought it best to leave the business to 
their own management. I asked them, therefore, what they 
wished me to do, after having shown them what had already 
been done. They hesitated a little, as is usual when men 
have not thought of any course of procedure before they be 
gin to act. They desired an introduction to the Minister, 
which I immediately gave, and they went to him next day, 
but came back much out of humor. They afterwards presented a petition to the Convention, which was referred to the Comite de Salut Public, and there the affair seems to have 
ended, for all their urgency to that Committee has not got 
them one inch forward. 
</p><p>
I apprehend that they may have injured their own claim, by 
interfering unnecessarily in other matters; one instance of 
which I shall presently have occasion to mention. They have 
at length called on me to make new demands, declaring their 
intention to abandon the property of their vessels. I expected 
that they would have gone back, but find that they determine 
to remain still longer in Paris, which may, I fear, prove detrimental. 
</p><p>
However, on the twenty-seventh of last month, the day after I received their letter, I wrote to the Minister on the subject. I send herewith a copy of my letter, with one of the 
same date respecting the vessels and cargoes brought in by 
French frigates, contrary not only to our own treaty, but to 
every principle of the law of nations. These captures create 
great confusion, must produce much damage to mercantile 
men, and are a source of endless and well founded complaint. 
Every post brings me piles of letters about it from all quarters, 
and I see no remedy. You have a copy of the Minister's answer to my letter, holding out the hope of a speedy decision; 
but it may be very long before it can be obtained. And, in 
the mean time, if I would give way to the clamors of the injured parties, I ought to make demands very like a declaration of 
war. 
</p><p>
What am I to do in such cases ? It is impossible for me to guess the intentions of government, and indeed, Sir, the 
responsibility is great and distressing. Our countrymen here 
find, that it is the easiest thing in the world to carry any point 
with the Committees, until they have tried. In the mean time, 
I am exposed to their clamors in this country, and most 
probably to their censures in my own, for not performing 
impossibilities. In order to complete the business, nothing 
more is necessary, than that the rulers of this Republic, 
wearied with my complaints, should apply for my recall, in 
order to get rid of a troublesome fellow. I think it is very 
likely to happen, if it be not already done. I beg your par 
don, Sir, for saying so much of myself, but it is a troublesome 
thing to navigate in the dark between Scylla and Charybdis, 
without chart or compass. 
</p><p>
I send you enclosed the copy of a letter I received on the 
fifth of last month from a number of Americans here, (including therein some of the Bordeaux deputation,) with a copy 
of my answer of the sixth. I sent copies of both to the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, and called on him shortly after to 
mention several things, some of which I have already noticed. 
Among them was the long depending affair of the Laurens, at Havre, and the decrees made in her case violating our treaty. 
I took occasion then to mention again, what I had said in 
answer to the letter from my countrymen, viz. that I was in 
hourly expectation of instructions respecting those decrees. I 
told him that, until they arrived, I should forbear any formal 
application ; but, under the existing circumstances, I would in 
a friendly manner take leave to express some single idea ; that, 
if the government meant to abide by the treaty, they had 
better anticipate the arrival of those instructions, and by a 
voluntary step preserve an air of dignity and good faith. But 
if, on the contrary, they meant to persist in the violation, then 
it would be well to consider the events likely to take place, 
and to provide for them in season. He felt much obliged by 
this mode of treating the affair, and told me that the thing was 
already before the Committee in the case of the Laurens, and that he would endeavor to procure a speedy and satisfactory decision. 
</p><p>
You will find herein the report made by Jean Bon St 
Andre, which is fully confirmatory of the treaty. Some little 
matters (errors) of form have impeded the execution of the final 
decision, and the communication which he is to make to me ; 
but I thought it a proper moment to bring forward the case of 
the Enterprise, which is the subject of the above mentioned 
letter from Ingraham and others to me. I, therefore, having 
previously concerted measures with the Minister, prepared a 
short petition from Captain Ingraham to the Comite de Salut 
Public, as an appeal . from the decision of the Executive 
Council, and sent it to the Minister, who forwarded it to the 
Committee, and intends to support before them the principles 
of the petition, and labor for a reversal of the judgment. 
</p><p>
I send you enclosed the copy of my letter to the Minister of 
the 22d of last month, respecting the imprisonment of our 
Vice Consul at Havre, and of his answer. I shall pursue this 
business to obtain his liberation. Poor CofTyn is still con 
fined. 
</p><p>
While on the subject of violations of personal liberty, it is 
proper to communicate a step, which late circumstances induced me to take. I have already hinted at a little dispute I had 
with the Comite de Surete Generale. It arose about the ar 
rest of a person in my house. Particular reasons prevented 
me from pushing the matter to a serious issue then. I shall 
perhaps, take occasion to communicate them hereafter, when I 
am sure of my conveyance. The Committee were made sensible that they had done wrong, and that was all which I 
thought necessary. 
</p><p>
They have since (though not towards me) gone greater 
lengths, by arresting the Charge d AfFaires of Malta. This rendered it proper to make a more pointed animadversion on their 
conduct, and produced the enclosed pieces of the 27th of 
February. The Minister's answer of the eleventh Ventose is 
also enclosed, and I find by the gazettes, that on the report of 
the Comite de Salut Public a decree has been passed in the 
premises, of which I have not yet received communication 
from the Minister. 
</p><p>
The Comite de Salut Public and the Comite de Surete Generale are not, I am told, on the best terms together, and will 
probably come to something more overt than words ere long. 
It is of little importance under what forms parties or factions 
may present themselves ; their real origin is in the political 
form of the society ; and if anything prevents their rage, it 
must be the situation of Foreign Affairs. It is supposed that 
the approaching famine will be the signal for hostilities between 
the contending parties ; but it would seem not over prudent 
in any man, or set of men, to aim at power under present circumstances. I am, &tc.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Shortly after the intelligence of hostilities by the Algerines, 
I applied to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, as being interested in putting a stop thereto, in order to cover the arrival 
of provisions in our ships. It was agreed that the Republic 
should, in conformity to our, treaty, endeavor to obtain a 
treaty for us with the Algerines. But as it was uncertain 
whether the Dey would negotiate such treaty with the agents 
of France, I was desired to name one for the United States. 
</p><p>
I therefore stated my want of power ; but it being impossible to get a seasonable answer from America to letters on the 
subject, I agreed to make the appointment of a person, who 
should come forward in case of necessity. I accordingly 
have sent M. James Leray, a naturalized citizen of America, 
to accompany the French Commissioners. He will appear 
as a Frenchman, unless circumstances call for the production 
of his powers. My instructions to him, after stating my want 
of authority, are, in substance, to aid in obtaining the best 
possible treaty for the smallest possible sum, and to confine 
the duration thereof to one year, unless approved of by the 
President, and to procure the liberation of our captivated fellow citizens. 
</p><p>
The French Commissioners are not yet gone, though it is 
now two months since everything was agreed on. Such are 
the delays, which result from the disorganized state of affairs 
in this country. I am, &tc.

My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I send you herewith a duplicate of my last letter, in the close 
of which I mention my adherence to the opinions expressed in 
my last. But on recurring to my private letter book, which 
was not then before me, I find that the letter I there alluded to 
was written on the eighteenth of October. It went by Captain Culver, and has, I hope, arrived in due season. Every 
day confirms what is contained in that letter ; but parties are 
so balanced, and .the impending force from abroad is in such 
threatening attitude^ that the present state of things drags on 
its existence rather from surrounding circumstances than from 
internal vigor. And strange as it may seem, the impending 
change may arise from a victory, or from a defeat, or from a 
famine. 
</p><p>
The gazettes tell us that Mr Jefferson is coming to Europe ; 
some of them say as my successor ; others say it is a secret 
mission. I have heard it said that he is to negotiate a peace 
among the belligerent powers. For my own part, I hold in 
politics the opinions which prevail in physics among sound 
philosophers, viz. that it is proper to determine facts before we 
attempt to discover causes. I wait therefore patiently the 
event. Major Jackson, who has been here for some time, 
gave me two successors ; first, Mr Bingham, and then Mr Pinckney ; giving in the latter case Mr Pinckney's place to 
Mr Bingham. So it is easy, you see, to fill up vacancies. 
</p><p>
The probable events of the campaign about to open, are not 
favorable to the French Republic. It will be extremely difficult for them to subsist the armies needful for their defence, 
and the extreme severity exercised by the present government 
will, in case of adverse events, excite a universal insurrection. 
At present, the people are restrained by fear from showing any 
sentiment unfavorable to the existent authorities, but as is usual in like circumstances, should that fear be removed, it will be 
succeeded by sharp resentments. If, however, the armies of 
the Republic should prove successful, they would, in my opinion, be the first to overturn the Convention ; for such is the 
usual course of things. A terrible perspective this, my dear 
Sir, for those who are at present in the saddle ; no wonder, 
therefore, if they ride hard. It is not the least of their misfortunes to be fully sensible of their situation ; and it results there 
fore, that as much time is consumed in providing for their de 
fence against adverse factions and contingent events, as in pre 
paring for the general defence of the country ; more perhaps. 
</p><p>
How different "was our situation in America. Every one 
performed cheerfully his part, nor had we anything to apprehend but from the common enemy. Such is the immense 
difference between a country which has morals, and one which 
is corrupted. The former has everything to hope, and the 
latter everything to fear. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear Sir; may God in heaven bless, and pre 
serve, and prosper you.

</p><p>
My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
In a letter, which I had the honor of writing to you on the 
10th of January, <a href='/results.php?year=1793'>1793</a>, I gave you some traits respecting Mr Westermann, and as my public despatches had already communicated the plans of Damon, you will not have been surprised at what has lately happened to them. I wrote to you 
on the 25th of June, that those who ruled had just ideas of the value of popular opinion. Also, that should they reach a 
harbor, it would be as much by good luck, as by good management, and that at any rate, part of the crew would be 
thrown overboard. Those I had then particularly in view were Chabot and company, of which company a part still exists. 
</p><p>
On the eighteenth of October, I gave you a short view of the nature of the then government, and added what seemed to 
be the probable termination. I therein observed that, whether 
France would pass to that point through the medium of a Triumvirate, or other small body of men, seemed as yet undetermined; but that I thought it most probable she would. At 
that period things were wound up very high, and ever since the utmost uncertainty has prevailed, as to the stroke which would be given. 
</p><p>
I enclose herein a copy of what I wrote on the twelfth of 
last month, since which, both the Dantonists and Hebertists 
are crushed. The fall of Danton seems to terminate the idea 
,of a Triumvirate. The chief, who would in such case have 
been one of his colleagues, has wisely put out of the way a 
dangerous competitor. Hence it would seem, that the high 
road must be laid through the Comite de Salut Public; unless, 
indeed, the army should meddle. But as to the army, no 
character seems as yet to have appeared with any prominent 
feature ; neither is there so much discipline as would give an 
aspiring character just ground of hope. It is a wonderful 
thing. Sir, that four years of convulsion, among four and twenty millions of people, has brought forth no one, either in civil 
or military life, whose head would fit the cap which fortune has 
woven. 
</p><p>
Robespierre has been the most consistent, if not the only 
consistent. He is one of those of whom Shakspeare's Caesar 
speaks to his frolicsome companion, He loves no sports as 
thou dost, Anthony. There is no imputation against him for 
corruption. He is far from rich, and still farther from appearing so. It is said that his idol is ambition ; but I think that 
the establishment of the Republic would, all things considered, be most suitable to him. Whether he thinks so is another 
question, which I will not pretend to answer, nor how far such 
establishment may appear to him practicable. If it be sup 
posed that a man in his situation should absolutely despair of 
the Republic, and have so much diffidence either in his abilities or his influence, as to despair also of obtaining, much less 
of preserving the supreme power, then it might be supposed 
that Danton's plan would be by such person carried into execution. Yet all this supposition is but conjectural foundation of new conjecture. 
</p><p>
And what are the Allies about? Forming schemes to be 
executed, if they should continue to be Allies. I am, &c.

My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
This letter will accompany the duplicate of my last to Mr Jefferson, of the 6th of March. Be so kind, I pray you, as to 
let me know which of my letters are missing. I presume 
there must be great chasms in my correspondence, as I have 
received the acknowledgement of very few of my letters; and 
yet I have written always by duplicates, frequently by triplicates and quadruplicates. 
</p><p>
Permit me, my dear Sir, to congratulate you on your 
appointment. It is honorable to you, and will, I believe, be 
useful to the United States. The more so, as your convictions 
respecting our form of government will restore that harmony 
to our Executive departments, a want of which gave much 
pleasure to the enemies of America. I flatter myself also, that 
your habits of attention to business will produce a more 
active correspondence with the public servants abroad. 
</p><p>
Mr Jefferson desired me some time ago to mark the state of 
depreciation to him ; which I continued to do, but omitted in 
my last, because it continued nearly in the same situation as 
when I last communicated it. The fact is, that there is now 
no certain or steady rate, because, as you will see by the gazettes, dealers in that business are frequently guillotined. 
There is no foreign exchange, and in purchases very little, if 
any, allowance would be made on payments in specie ; and 
yet bullion is higher than it was before the Assignats were 
issued. The exact rate I do not know. Louis d ors, I am 
told, are much higher than they were, owing, as I have formerly mentioned, to the greater facility of concealing or transporting them. 
</p><p>
I have long since pointed out the danger of something very 
like a famine, which has indeed in many parts put on its most 
distressing forms. Men have literally expired for the want 
of food, with the means of buying it in their possession, could 
it have been bought. Luckily, or rather providentially, the 
season advances with a rapidity scarcely ever experienced. I 
have rye in the ear, and sanfoin in blossom. It is true, that 
the sandy soil contributes to push forward vegetation ; but still 
it is a phenomenon. Apricots as large as a pigeon's egg in the 
middle of April, and that in the latitude of forty-eight to forty-nine. These facts, which, in common cases, would be more 
properly communicated to an agricultural society than to a 
Minister of State, are of vast importance, for the great bulk of 
this nation live chiefly on vegetable substances ; and in the 
south, where the scarcity was greatest, I presume, from what 
I see here, that the earth begins to furnish a tolerable support 
to its inhabitants. A frost, such as we experienced in the end 
of last May, would do more towards the starvation system, 
than all the armies and fleets in Europe. 
</p><p>
In my last, I mentioned that the King of Prussia persisted 
in the alliance, although he intended to be paid for his efforts. 
I am still of the same opinion, though it is confidently asserted 
that he means to withdraw, leaving only his contingent as a 
co-estate of the Empire. His past conduct gives no room to 
suppose, that a sacred regard to engagements taken would 
prevent him from abandoning his allies ; but I think there is 
the stronger tie of a common interest. Austria and England, 
particularly the latter, are more pointedly interested than he. 
I conclude, therefore, that the business will wind up by a good 
round subsidy, (perhaps a million sterling,) and inconsequence 
of it a very large body of Prussian troops added to the army 
in Flanders. 
</p><p>
By garrisoning a few posts along the Rhine, and leaving 
the country exposed to incursion, the allies will force the 
German militia to defend themselves ; and as to the ravages 
which may be committed, a few consolatory phrases will, per 
haps, be the only compensation, which the sufferers will ever 
receive. If this conception of the business be just, the Prussian Cabinet will keep up the idea, that it means to recall its 
army, until the last moment, and those armies will then 
turn off to the left into the Low Countries, or perhaps be 
transported by water. Something or other of an extraordinary 
nature is in agitation o~ both sides, for the armies have been 
long looking at each other, without striking or even aiming a 
blow. I have no doubt but the Allies count on the public 
discontents here, and certainly they have some foundation ; 
but as, on their side, there is no one chief who can act decisively, or form solid engagements for the whole alliance, it 
is not possible to take that advantage of those discontents, which certainly would not escape the intelligent mind of a Caesar or an Alexander. 
</p><p>
In the course of my correspondence with your predecessor, 
I have endeavored to communicate to him my views of men 
and things, and to prepare his mind for events, which appeared to me probable, and which have in due course of time 
taken place. This is what I conceived to be one of the 
most important duties of my station ; and if I have not 
been more full and particular, it is because the names 
of those, who, in their turn, were to rule and to perish, seemed to me of secondary moment ; and because, 
judging, in my lamentable dearth of intelligence, from such 
feeble lights as I could collect in scattered rays from different quarters, it seemed to me that my letters would 
have been more acceptable, had I been deceived as to facts 
and probabilities, or capable of communicating sentiments 
and opinions I did not entertain. 
</p><p>
It has appeared to me, that Paris decides for the whole of 
France, and that the Sans Culottes (alias populace) decide 
for Paris ; that, of course, factions would continually arise, 
waging inexplicable war with each other, and that the 
momentary influence of each, being founded on fear only, 
could not take on any stable form, or possess any durable 
existence ; that each new stroke of the guillotine would 
weaken the force of liberal sentiment, and, consequently, 
diminish the chances of a free system. 
</p><p>
I must repeat here, that plots and conspiracies are not to 
be attributed to the genius and temper of those who plot and 
conspire, but to the state of society ; for it would be, I think, 
inconsequent, to imagine that in a given number of individuals, born in different countries or places, there should be a 
very great disproportion of talents and qualities. It seems 
more regular to believe, that in a virtuous and just society, 
the good qualities which exist are drawn into action, and the 
bad repressed by despair of success ; while, on the contrary, 
in a depraved and vicious society, the good must remain inactive for the want of confidence and support, while the bad, 
released from the fear of shame, and prompted by cupidity or 
ambition, count on the submission of the society, if they ac 
quire the means of inspiring fear into the great mass, of which 
each individual pursues his personal interest unrestrained by 
moral principle. 
</p><p>
After this preface, which might better, perhaps, have been 
spared, -I proceed to mention, that many different schemes 
were, I think, carrying on to destroy the existent government. 
As to the idea that foreign powers excited the parties, I am 
not disposed either to adopt or reject it. I do not consider it 
as being at all r necessary to the formation of a conspiracy, al 
though very necessary to the destruction of those engaged in 
it. I explain ; the pride of the nation will at any time rouse 
them from the perfect insensibility with which they would 
behold the Convention, and all its Committees, thrown into 
the river ; and therefore it is useful to rouse that pride, by stating every attempt to overturn the government as originating 
with the foreign foe. And I remark here, that in the different 
reports made respecting these conspiracies, and the accusations against those engaged in them, it is as it were taken for 
granted, that the people would quietly submit to those, who 
by a coup de main should put themselves in possession of self 
created power. 
</p><p>
I do not say that this is true, but I have no doubt that a 
certain duration of general terror, as the basis of a system of 
government, must inevitably produce that effect. The period 
of duration, required for any particular nation, will depend 
somewhat on the national character, but more on the morality 
of the people. To reason therefore a priori on the subject, 
our ideas must take on as much of an algebraic as logical 
form. 
</p><p>
In examining historical facts, on the contrary, we are too apt, 
I think, to ascribe to individuals the events which are produced 
by general causes. The two factions lately crushed may be 
called the Dantonist and Hebertist. I should more readily 
attribute to the latter, than to the former, a connexion with foreign powers. I have strong reasons to believe that Danton 
feared from them, and hoped from those who destroyed him. 
The Hebertists, however, may be considered, I think, as the 
Anti-Conventional, and the Dantonists as the Royal, faction. I 
except always the Aristocrats, who are in fact null., and who 
in the various changes which impend will, I am persuaded, 
have very little, if any, share. The more ardent spirits among 
them flew off long ago, either into foreign countries or the Vendee. I speak in generals, not universals. Those who remain 
are of that waxen substance called the men of property, who 
in foreign wars count so much, and civil wars so little. 
</p><p>
Danton always believed, and, what is worse as to himself 
at least, always maintained, that a popular system of government 
for this country was absurd ; that the people were too ignorant, too inconstant, and too corrupt to support a legal administration 5 that, habituated to obey, they required a master ; and 
that, even had they been educated in the principles of freedom, and joined to the energy of sentiment the force of habit, 
yet like ancient Rome they had reached the period in which Cato was a madman, and Caesar a necessary evil. His conduct was in perfect unison with those principles when he acted ; but he was too voluptuous for his ambition, too indolent 
to acquire supreme power. Moreover, his object seems rather 
to have been great wealth, than great fame. He has fallen 
at the feet of Robespierre. 
</p><p>
As to the Hebertists, whatever may have been the ultimate 
view of some, I presume that the greater number had nothing 
more in view, than a second edition of the 31st of last May. 
The destruction of all these Chiefs has given great power to 
the Comite de Salut Public, whose monthly renewal is so 
much a thing of course, that they may be considered as a permanent body. Hence it follows, that the next considerable 
party ought to arise there. The Hebertists believed the Convention to be so low in public opinion, that they could overturn 
it without the aid of its own members. They were deceived, 
or at least they were anticipated. The Dantonists supposed, 
that in the want of respect for their rulers, the people would 
readily turn on the little prisoner in the temple, that enthusiastic sentiment so congenial to the heart of man, so essential 
to that which beats in a French bosom. They also were anticipated ; but if they judged rightly, they have unveiled a 
dreadful mystery. 
</p><p>
Some one observed the other day, in conversation, that 
all the men of the tenth of August have passed away already, 
and those also of the second of September. It is certain that 
the tenth of August is chiefly to ba attributed to Westermann, 
one of those lately guillotined, and that Danton was among 
the prime movers of the scenes of September. The reason for 
that massacre will be found, perhaps, in the old adage, dead 
men tell no tales. Oliver Cromwell understood well the value 
of mob sentiment, when he replied to his chaplain, vain of the 
applauding crowd which thronged round his master's coach, 
there would be as many, and as glad, to attend me at the gal 
lows. t do not believe that a good man in America can feel 
all the force of that expression ; and, therefore, I believe it is 
very difficult to form on certain subjects a just opinion. 
</p><p>
You will ask, perhaps, whether these factions are totally 
crushed, and whether, if so, similar factions are likely to arise. 
T think I have anticipated that question ; and the general re 
flections, which, perhaps, have already fatigued you, contained 
the anticipated reply. I will not, therefore, repeat ; and, be 
sides, in the vast field of conjecture, each man is free to take 
the path which his judgment may direct, or inclination choose. 
</p><p>
I have repeatedly mentioned the embargo at Bordeaux. 
Mr Fenwick, our Consul, came on lately to solicit redress on 
behalf of all the neutrals concerned, being furnished with the 
special powers of the other Consuls. Previous to his arrival, I 
had written to the Minister a letter of the eighth of last month, 
of which I enclose a copy. Mr Fenwick, after a sedulous 
attendance on the Comite de Salut Public, was so happy as to 
obtain a decision. By the bye, the Charge d Affaires of Den 
mark told me last December, that he was confidentially informed, that the embargo would not be taken off till the month of 
April. 
</p><p>

In the course of the investigations, which lately took place 
respecting plots and conspiracies, some of the Ministers were 
arrested, and among them the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The 
system also is changed, as you will see by the gazettes, so that 
in future these agents are to be in name what they were be 
fore in fact. The Charge. Provisoire of the department of 
Foreign Affairs has sent me a copy of the arrete of the Comite de 
Salut Public, of which, as well as of his note and my reply, you 
will find copies enclosed. I also enclose a short correspondence with the Charge d Affaires of Malta. I have, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My last was of the fifteenth. This is written merely to 
cover copies of mine to the Minister of the eleventh of March, 
twelfth and twenty-second of March, of his answer of the 
sixth Germinal, mine of the second of April, and the answer 
to it of the twenty-third Germinal, written by Buchot, a second 
Charge Provisoire of the department of Foreign Affairs. 
</p><p>
You will, perhaps, ask why my letters to the Minister are 
in French, rather than in my own language. It is not to save 
time or trouble to myself, as you will easily suppose , but 
there are two strong reasons for it. First, it cuts off one 
source of delay which, in the tediousness of transacting business at present, is important, and the more so, as the objects 
once thrown off the Minister's table upon a translator's desk, 
might run the risk of not being taken up again. Another reason, of a different complexion, is, to avoid misinterpretation 
and mistake. A slight change of idea in changing the phrases 
might have unpleasant consequences, for men are very ticklish 
in such revolutions as the present; and, therefore, it becomes 
me to be cautious, so as not to say either too much or too little ; 
and, moreover, to use an Eastern phrase, not to put my 
tongue in the mouth of another. 
</p><p>
Tn reading over the letters, of which copies are enclosed, I 
am reminded of what I wrote very long ago respecting Mr Coffyn, the agent at Dunkirk, who has expressed a wish to 
be appointed Vice Consul at that place, having heretofore 
acted in that capacity under the auspices of our Consul Geneeral, and of Dr Franklin. If I did not impose upon myself 
the obligation never to recommend to appointments, which I 
have no right to interfere in, the conduct of that gentleman, 
and his general good character, would have drawn from me a 
recommendation. As it is, I do not yet know whether my 
letter was ever received. 
</p><p>
In mine of the twenty-first of December, <a href='/results.php?year=1792'>1792</a>, I mentioned 
the plan of Danton, adding that I believed that it had never 
been wholly abandoned. His late execution will show that 
faith to have been well founded. And I am now told that, 
when condemned to death, he declared that he was glad to be 
rid of a state of society so abominable. I am, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
This will accompany duplicates of my letters of the I 5th 
and 18th of last month. The season continues fine and for 
ward, with every appearance of an abundant crop; and, judging from the productions now at market, the harvest will pre 
cede the usual time near a month. 
</p><p>
You will see in the gazettes the taking of Landrecy, and 
the foreign papers, particularly the English papers, will give 
you the details on that subject which we want. There has 
been much fighting in that quarter, and although, as is usual, 
the success may have been varied, it appears definitively to 
have rested with the Allies, seeing that they have not been 
forced to raise the siege, but have taken the town. 
</p><p>
I am told that the Republic now feed ten hundred and 
thirty thousand infantry, and ninety-four thousand cavalry. 
This is an immense army even on paper, and although we 
may easily suppose that there is some little exaggeration in the 
numbers, that there are some abuses in the account, and that 
casualties diminish considerably those who are really on the 
rolls, still it will appear that the force is very great. The daily expense of the provision department is about a million of 
dollars. 
I learn also, that the Comite de Salut Public have agreed to 
be unanimous, so that the minority always adhere to the majority. This Committee, and that of Surete Generate must, I 
think, be either melted into one, or else have a contest for superiority. At present, the efficient power of the State is lodged with those Committees, and the former begin to publish 
their decrees, which have the force of laws, modifying, adding 
to, and repealing those of the Convention. It seems to me 
that this Committee are not yet fully apprized of the extent of 
their own authority ; that is to say, of the wide and deep effect 
of the terror, which has been excited by such frequent and 
abundant executions as take place throughout France. I 
think they may do what they please, provided the revolutionary tribunals remain in their hands. We shall see what system 
is to follow therefrom. 
</p><p>
I am told that Robespierre's wish is to retire to private 
life, so soon as the peace shall have established that form of 
government, which may be finally adopted here. 
</p><p>
Enclosed you have the copy of a letter of the 22d of April, 
from Mr Anderson at Nantes, to me, and of my answer. I 
am, &tc.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
This will accompany a duplicate of my last, of the sixth instant, also copies of my letter of the tenth instant to the Commissioner of Foreign Relations, 7)f his answer of the fourth Prairial, 
or twenty-third instant, and of my reply of the twenty-sixth. 
You will perceive that Mr Warden had been so imprudent as 
to lodge the despatches entrusted to his care with the Justice 
of Peace at Morlaix. This was done by the advice of John Diot. acting there as Consular Agent. Whether that advice is 
to be attributed to ignorance or design, I know not ; but it 
might easily have been foreseen, that the deposit would not 
be safe. I hope your despatches are in cypher, if they contain 
anything which is not of a very public nature. 
</p><p>
The gazettes will communicate to you such intelligence as 
we have here, and you will obtain from other channels much 
fuller and earlier intelligence, as to what is called news, than 
any which I can give. Moreover, this letter may be long ere 
it reaches you, for I have not any present opportunity ; and such 
is the state of things, that, unless letters be committed specially to the care of some trusty person, there is very little chance 
that they will ever reach you. 
</p><p>
I have not received a line from you, nor from your predecessor, posterior to the despatches by Captain Culver, desiring 
M. Genet's recall. 
</p><p>
We have had a sort of novel, or farce, lately, the subject of 
which was, that certain Commissioners had arrived from the 
United States at Brest. You will see in the gazettes what relates to them so far ; and now I am told, that Mr Jefferson is 
one of them, that he has been in Paris, and is gone to Switzerland, where a Congress is to be held of the neutral powers. 
And, what is more extraordinary, this intelligence comes 
through a confidential channel, in general well informed. Now 
as I do not conceive it possible, that any commissioners from the 
United States should have passed through Paris without seeing 
me, I am at a loss to conjecture with whom the honor of the 
invention lies, and also what can have been the object. For 
as to foreign powers, they cannot be the dupes, and as to the 
people here, they think more of the guillotine than of anything 
else. 
</p><p>
In my last I mentioned to you the omnipotence of the two 
Committees. Apparently this term is applicable only to that of 
Satut Public ; but the inquisitorial powers lodged with the other (and by means of which, they can arrest whom they please) 
give them great weight in the general scales. It is, I presume, 
needless to repeat what is mentioned to me, that the Convention, as well as all those other authorities, who once could influence its deliberations, view with jealousy, but with apprehension and deep awe, these colossal pillars of the Republic, 
which they have raised, or permitted to be raised. This, as 
well as the ferment inherent in the nature of all such bodies, 
you will certainly perceive at the first glance, and your judgement will seize the remote consequences intuitively. On my 
part, therefore, it is more fitting to observe, that these consequences are more remote than might be supposed. A conviction of that instability which attends all fortuitous greatness, 
more especially such as is founded on fear, and the certainty 
of complete ruin, should they be overthrown, will long smother all minor discontents ; moreover, the apprehension from the 
foreign enemy will, in my opinion, both promote their concord 
and support their power. 
</p><p>
Should the convoy of provisions expected from America be 
intercepted by Lord Howe, it might cause a great commotion, 
because it would undoubtedly affect the subsistence of Paris, 
and no individual will take on himself any responsibility respecting that object. Hence might arise crimination and recrimination, of course discord and all its consequences. If no exterior causes should preserve union, a very little experience of 
human affairs would enable us to pronounce, that it could not 
long exist. 
</p><p>
This leads me to say one word about the northern army, 
premising that all the other armies taken together are but 
trifling diversions. The late arrangement made by Mr Pitt 
with the King of Prussia, by concentrating the interest and objects of the two chief powers, Britain and Austria, gives 
much more consistence to the war on the part of the Allies. 
They seem also to have found out at last, what indeed the 
Convention has proclaimed a dozen times, that all the magic 
of the Revolution is contained in the single word, Paris. Now 
the high road to that city is from Flanders by Valenciennes, 
Landrecy, Cambray, &tc. If matters are to be decided in the 
plains of Picardy, numbers will, I think, avail but little against 
a formidable cavalry. You will see that no quarter is to be 
given to the British and Hanoverian troops. The Austrians 
are, already, but little disposed to give quarter. The corps 
of emigrants and deserters will naturally sell their lives as 
dear as they can. This campaign, therefore, will be one of 
the bloodiest in the annals of history. I am, &c.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have already written to you a letter this day on the cur 
rent affairs. This will be devoted to a different object. I 
have lately seen in a gazette your report on the inquiries received from the belligerent powers, and also some debates in 
our House of Representatives on a discrimination between 
those nations with whom we have a commercial treaty, and 
those with whom we have none. I observe that some frigates 
are to be built for the protection of our trade. These things 
have suggested, or rather recalled, ideas which I will venture 
to communicate at the risk of tiring your patience. 
</p><p>
While I had the honor to sit in Congress during the war, it 
was my lot to oppose what then appeared to me a rage for 
treaties ; and yet the respectability, which our cause was sup 
posed to acquire by the acknowledgment of European Potentates, militated in favor of those, who wished to extend our 
diplomacy. At the peace, however, that ground of argument 
was removed. Moreover, we found ourselves in a situation 
unfavorable to the forming of treaties, because there was no 
constitutional authority to enforce the observance of them. 
Those powers, therefore, who might contract with us, were 
exposed not only to the common danger of a wilful violation 
on our part, but to that also of a general non-performance and 
of individual injury, without the permission, and beyond 
the control, of government. The obligations, therefore, not 
being equal, it was not deemed prudent by some to enter into 
engagements with the United States ; and thus we fell our selves sinking beneath the level of national character. 
</p><p>
Our new Constitution made ample provision on that subject ; and,, if I mistake not, a steady adherence to its principles will place us first in dignity, as in good faith, among 
political societies. Our treaties now form the supreme law of 
the land, and therefore our situation, in respect to foreign 
powers, is reversed ; for they can violate their contracts with 
us, but we cannot violate our contracts with them ; neither 
have we, perhaps, any constitutional means of annulling our 
obligations, when they shall have broken their engagements, 
I will not here inquire how far it would be proper to make 
a provision of that sort, as an amendment to the Constitution, 
nor whether it would not in effect destroy the clause, which 
has rendered treaties on our part inviolable ; but I will venture to infer from this our relative position, that we should 
be cautious what treaties we form,, and with whom. What 
treaties, because, if contingent engagements become onerous 
to us, we must comply with them ; whereas, should they be 
come onerous to those with whom we have contracted, they 
may release themselves. We should be cautious also with 
whom we treat, because in the contingency last stated, some 
nations will release themselves, and others will not. Now, in 
political as in natural bodies, decisions of the will depend, so 
far as good faith is concerned, on moral character and constitution. 
</p><p>
We have at present to complain, that both Britain and 
France have violated their treaties with us. Yet I can by no 
= means consider the cases equal ; for as to Britain, the act 
proceeded from cool meditation of regular government ; but 
in France, it is one among many bad effects of that extraordinary situation into which she is thrown. Without dwelling 
farther on this distinction, I shall endeavor to state those 
objections to the multiplication of treaties, which formerly 
swayed my opinion ; and, first, it is no small one, that we 
should be thereby drawn into the vortex of European politics, 
which we should, I think, avoid as much as possible. Not 
that we should be wholly unmindful of what passes in this 
hemisphere ; on the contrary, I am persuaded that we ought 
to be extremely watchful ; but I would draw a strong broad 
line between vigilance and activity. 
</p><p>
Secondly, it has always appeared to me, that the less we 
are fettered by diplomatic engagements, the better shall we be 
able to preserve a firm and equal conduct in difficult cases. 
The law of nations may be likened to the common law, in that 
all cases heretofore doubtful have been settled by able judges ; 
whereas each treaty, like a new statute, gives rise to intricate 
questions, and the ultimate mode of determining them makes a 
good mind shudder. 
</p><p>
Thirdly, it has also appeared to me, that in most controversies between European powers, we should preserve an exact 
neutrality. We may safely leave them to adjust their balance of power in their own way, because, if either of the 
scales should prove too heavy for us, the means of lightening it are at hand, and completely within our grasp. Now 
I am convinced that a neutrality may be most easily preserved, 
when no belligerent power can rightfully claim any privilege ; 
because, by conferring such privilege at our pleasure, we can 
sufficiently punish either of the parties for the injuries and 
indignities we may have cause to complain of. 
</p><p>
Lastly, I cannot but think that our present, compared with our future situation, is such that in treating now, we must make 
bad bargains, even were there any tribunal to enforce the performance in a peaceable way. The paucity of our numbers, 
the apparent feebleness of our pecuniary resources, the want of naval and military force, even the extent of our dominion, 
which is, from that circumstance, of difficult defence and easy invasion, will prevent others from granting, will even prevent 
us from asking, what we ought to have, in order that a treaty made now should be reasonable in ten years, or tolerable in 
twenty. Whatever may be the intrinsic worth of these reasons, certainly they derive weight from that morality of our national 
constitution, which has been already noticed. 
</p><p>
This constitution was made subsequent to our existent treaties, and even after the violation by Great Britain of that which 
concluded the war. Happily she has hitherto eluded a compliance, and thereby prevented the forming of a commercial 
treaty. I say happily, because I am persuaded that in a few years we shall have occasion to rejoice, and the British to regret, that perversity of counsels, which prevented their Ministers from meeting our advances. 
</p><p>
We complain justly also, that France has broken her treaty 
with us, more especially to confiscate goods of her enemies on 
board our ships. This decree is evidently against her own 
interest ; but, in my opinion, the clause in our treaty, thereby 
annulled, was injurious to our interest. As to the maxim, that 
free ships make free goods, the arguments pro and con are 
familiar to us, and, therefore, I shall not enter into them. But 
the fair conclusion of those in favor of it goes to a protection 
of all commercial property on the ocean. Therefore, the 
maxim, even were it just, would not be generally admitted until the practice of making prizes were wholly abandoned. 
Then all such clauses in a treaty would be superfluous, and 
until then, unless enforced by a strong marine, they will be 
nugatory. 
</p><p>
But it seems to me, from the view which I am enabled to 
take of our commerce, that however the transportation, in our 
ships, of goods belonging to subjects of a belligerent power, 
might prove a momentary advantage to our merchants, it must 
be injurious to our general interests. I take it for ganted, that 
our shipping is not sufficient to pursue the fisheries and to carry our own produce to market. But if it were, I should con 
sider those as the proper employments, and I should reason 
thus. By putting half of the navigation employed in transporting our own productions into this neutral carrying trade, half 
of those productions must remain on hand, or be transported 
by the belligerent powers, and in either case our agricultural 
interests must suffer ; for, as to other neutrals, their shipping 
will be employed in the same neutral carrying trade. Now if 
this reasoning be just, on the ground that we had a sufficiency 
of shipping, how much more forcible is it in the fact of an in 
sufficiency. But it may be said, that the neutral carrying 
trade, by giving encouragement to our shipping, would greatly 
increase the amount. I answer, of our fictitious shipping, 
yes; of our real shipping, no; and merchants will understand 
me. 
</p><p>
Moreover, I state hypothetically, either we have the tonnage 
needful for I our commerce, or we have not. If we have not, 
the increased freight of our own commodities will, in time of 
war, be a sufficient encouragement, and draw into that channel 
as much of the national strength and wealth as is consistent 
with the general welfare, and more perhaps, if we extend our 
views to all the moral effects of commerce, especially when it 
engages a disproportionate part of the society. If our navigation be equal to the employment our commerce can give it, 
any increase would be doubly pernicious. First, because 
throwing the surplus out of employ would occasion loss to 
owners in general, since they would be forced to underwork 
each other, till, by the ruin of some, things would return to 
their natural level. And secondly, because, whatever difference there may be in opinions, as to the propriety of taking 
men from the plough, in a thinly peopled country, to ply the 
loom or bend the sail, while manufactures and navigation are 
unequal to the demand, no man of sound mind will contend, 
that we should leave our fields untilled to rival populous countries in the carrying trade. In our vast territory, a fertile soil 
and excellent clime invite to rural and domestic bliss, the 
source of a vigorous and virtuous population. Why then 
should we imitate those who, by the severity of nature, are 
driven to seek on the ocean a subsistence, which the land denies, and who find, in the casualties of that dangerous element, 
a resource against excessive numbers ? 
</p><p>
Having said thus much on treaties, I come now to their 
sanction, an American marine. Whatever apprehensions may 
be entertained from a standing army, nothing is to be feared 
from a standing navy ; wherefore, I think we should not fol 
low the European example of building ships to lie idle, until a 
war calls them into action, at a great increase of expense, and 
by great injury to commerce. This may suit the ambitious, 
who wish to extend their possessions ; but a peaceable nation, 
placed as we are, should, I think, make perpetual provision 
for every ship that is built, and her fleet should be annually manned, victualed, and equipped, and should cruise during the fine season. I believe that we could now maintain 
twelve ships of the line, perhaps twenty, with a due proportion of frigates and smaller vessels. And I am tolerably certain, that while the United States of America pursue a just 
and liberal conduct, with twenty sail of the line at sea, no nation on earth will dare to insult them. I believe also that, not 
to mention individual losses, five years of war would involve 
more national expense, than the support of a navy for twenty 
years. One thing I am thoroughly convinced of, that, if we 
do not render ourselves respectable, we shall continue to be 
insulted. And let it not be supposed, that a remedy for our 
weakness can be found in Conventions with other powers for 
preserving neutrality. In such Conventions there are often 
dupes, and it is the weaker who go to the wall. 
</p><p>
During the last war, no sooner had the Dutch acceded to 
the armed neutrality, than Great Britain fell upon them, and 
those who set the plan a going looked on with all imaginable 
composure. In the late treaty between Denmark and Sweden, you will observe that time is given to the belligerent powers for repentance and amendment, before any hostile act of 
resentment by the contracting parties. You will observe, also, 
that the period specified is sufficient to permit the arrestation 
of all supplies shipped for this country, during the present sea 
son. Thus the next autumn and winter are left clear for negotiation, should the Mies be unsuccessful in this campaign. 
That treaty, therefore, may be considered as a demonstration 
of a force and temper, which do not exist ; and no one in this 
quarter is the dupe of such appearances. 
</p><p>
But what can be done by the weak, to preserve their little 
air of dignity ? They do not wish to join the coalition, and 
they dare not connect their fortunes with the French Republic, lest in a sudden change of government she should join 
those now acting against her. All that is left, therefore, is to 
temporize with the best grace they can. 
</p><p>
It is time to conclude this too long letter. Believe, I pray 
you, in the sincerity of that esteem and respect, with which I 
have the honor to be, &c.

Sir, 
</p><p>
During the last war, France furnished several sums of money 
to the United States of America, both under the head of loans 
and that of gratuities. The first of these advances was a mil 
lion of livres, and it appears to have been made on the tenth of 
June, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. It is entered among the gratuities, but it is not 
known to whom it was paid, nor how it was appropriated. 
Doctor Franklin, in settling the accounts of the United States 
with the French Ministry, neglected to ask for the papers, 
which relate to this subject; and afterwards, when the banker 
of the United States applied, (in the months of August and September, <a href='/results.php?year=1786'>1786</a>,) to M. Durival, in order to obtain them, he as 
sured him that he had communicated the request to the Count 
de Vergennes, who said that the receipt in question could be of 
no use to the banker, since he was not entrusted with the pecuniary affairs of the United States till January, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>, and that 
this payment was made on the tenth of June, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 
</p><p>
Our Ministers were also given to understand, that it was use 
less to urge the demand for a paper in proof of a payment, 
which would be of no account in the reimbursements to be 
made by the United States. Dr Franklin concluded from this, 
that the advance had been lodged in the hands of M. Beaumarchais, and that it was a cabinet mystery, whose eclaircise-ment ought to be a matter of indifference to us, at least till it 
became necessary to set this sum against the demands of 
Beaumarchais, for the supplies which he had furnished to the United States. 
</p><p>
This occasion has now arrived, but without this you will perceive, at the first glance, that the payment having been acknowledged by the United States, the receiver, whoever he may be, 
ought to give them an account of the manner in which he employed it. Besides, mysteries serve too often only to cover wasteful expenditures, of which the people are the victims. It is 
therefore given me in charge to solicit the papers, acknowledges the payment of a million of livres, as a gratuity made by France to the United States of America on the tenth of June, 
<a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. I think they will be found among the accounts of M. Durival, then head of the Treasury department for Foreign Affairs ; and I apply to you, in these circumstances, with the 
more confidence, as I am fully convinced of the good will of the French government towards the United States. I have 
the honor to be, &c.

Sir, 
</p><p>
I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 7th instant, and pray you to accept and present to the Comite de 
Salut Public my thanks, for the communication of the receipt of Caron de JBeaumarcbais. 
</p><p>
I think it my duty to observe to you, with regard to this subject, that considerable sums have already been 
by the United States for various objects, arms, ammunition, 
and habiliments, which he sent to America during the last war. 
Now there is reason to believe, that a part of these supplies 
were taken from the public magazines of France, and in this 
case it seems right, that he should be accountable for them to 
the French Republic. I have the honor to be, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
This letter will cover the state of my account with the United States, made up, on the first instant, agreeably to the instructions given by Mr Jefferson on that subject. No opportunity has since presented for the transmission. 
</p><p>
The bankers of the United States in Amsterdam wrote to 
me on the twentieth of June, that they have reason to apprehend, that it will be extremely difficult for them to supply me 
in future for the amount of my salary and expenses attending 
my mission. This arises from a law they have passed in 
Holland similar to the British statute, which prohibits the 
payment of funds belonging to those, who were in this country 
during a certain time. This same statute has, I understand, 
locked up my money in England ; but I have written on that 
subject to Mr Pinckney. I expect also that the Dutch ad 
ministration will except my drafts from their general system. 
</p><p>
In replying to this letter, M. Buchot observes ; I have made use 
of the suggestion, which you gave me respecting the supplies rendered 
by M. Beaumarchais to the United States during the last war, and I 
have communicated it to a suitable person to search for such proofs as 
may exist, as to the part of these supplies, which may have been taken 
from the magazines of France, and for which in such case this 
citizen is indebted to the Republic. 
</p><p>
If they do not, I must employ other resources. In this country, as you will have seen by my former letters, exchange is 
fixed at par. I have, however, in my account charged the 
value of sums paid at the time of payment, or rather carried 
to the credit of the United States the difference, as you will 
perceive. 
</p><p>
It is difficult, at present, to determine the value of Assignats compared with bullion. The sale of coin is prohibited 
on pain of death, so that no fixed course obtains. To judge 
by the prices of goods and provisions, bread excepted, the 
paper money is not worth above half its nominal amount, but 
the same articles are not to be obtained cheaper for hard money, 
and silver in bullion is by no means at double the former 
price. It has risen during the last spring from par to about a 
third advance, and is now perhaps something higher. 
</p><p>
I pray you will pay to Monsieur Nagot, the superior of the 
Catholic Seminary at Baltimore, or to Messieurs Chicoisneau, 
Tessier and Gamier, the directors thereof, the sum of two 
thousand four hundred and thirty dollars, and fifty-five cents, 
for which I have received the value here, and shall give credit 
therefor in my next account. I am, &c.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
This will accompany a (duplicate of mine dated the thirty-first of May. For the reasons mentioned in the beginning of 
that letter, I have not since written to you as I could have 
wished ; but in the interim I have received yours of the tenth 
of January, covering one of the third from your predecessor. 
Having already expressed my congratulations on your appointment, I shall not here repeat, but only confirm, what I 
then wrote respecting it. But I will mention my perfect satisfaction in perusing Mr Jefferson's statement of our dispute 
with Great Britain, which is, in my opinion, a masterly performance. I hope his abilities will not be lost to the public. 
</p><p>
At the same time, however, and with the same sincerity, I 
declare my belief, that the United States will gain by the 
change made in your department. Without balancing different qualities and qualifications, a difficult and unpleasant 
task, it is sufficient that we may now hope for a union of 
counsel and action among the different members of the Executive ; a thing which appears to me essential, and the want 
of which, or at least the idea that it was wanting, has, I know, 
been injurious. 
</p><p>
If my several letters have reached you, they will have 
communicated from time to time the best view which I could 
form of parties, temper, and opinions here. All these, however, are from the nature of things changeable, and it is only 
upon the final organization of a permanent government, and 
view of the territory over which it is to extend, that we 
can decide as to the prevailing interests and the system, which 
may thence originate. In all events, it appears probable that 
a friendly intercourse between the United States and the 
French nation will be mutually useful and desirable. Circumstances yet unborn may tend to relax or to strengthen our 
connexion. As they arise, and as they promise to arise, I 
shall study to communicate them. 
</p><p>
In mine of the thirty-first of May, I sent a copy of what I 
wrote on the nineteenth of that month to the Minister of Exterior Relations. I now transmit the copy of his answer 
of the tenth Prairial, or twenty-ninth of May, and eighteenth Prairial, or sixth of June, with my reply of the tenth of that 
month. Mr Warder came on hither the fourth of the present 
month, and has since pursued his route by the way of Switzerland ; but I have as yet heard nothing farther of the despatches he was charged with, although frequent inquiries 
have been made. I trust that they were not important, and am the less solicitous about them, as Mr Jay has doubtless 
taken over duplicates of everything essential. 
</p><p>
The gazettes will communicate, ere this reaches you, the 
great success of the French arms. As far as can be judged 
here, the King of Prussia has, according to custom, played a 
double part, and his troops, instead of joining those of the 
other Allies in Flanders, have remained where they were, 
while the French armies filed off to the left, and broke with 
irresistible impetuosity into the .Low Countries. These being 
quite open belong always to the party superior in the field. 
As yet, this Republic seems disposed rather to lay them 
under contribution, than to hold the possession ; but, if Valenciennes should submit, a different determination might take 
place. However, the sieges needful to secure them as far as 
the Rhine would consume more time than remains in this 
campaign ; for besides Luxemburg, Maestricht, and the citadel 
of Antwerp, which are on centrical situations, the whole frontier of Juliers, Guelderland, Cleves, Dutch Brabant, and 
Dutch Flanders, are stuck full of fortified towns. 
</p><p>
The success of the French arms will have secured that of 
Mr Jay's mission, whose object I learn from common report. 
The justice of the British Cabinet (whose sincerity the Presi 
dent is well acquainted with,) will, I am persuaded, submit to 
the forcible arguments, which Mr Jay is directed to use ; for 
the nation is not now in a temper to indulge Mr Pitt and Mr Simcoe in their projects. If I am rightly informed, there is an 
end to the coalition. Each party will retire as well as he can, 
and Britain will cover herself behind her wooden walls. In 
the case of a maritime struggle, they will not find the enmity 
of America to be a very pleasant thing. Of course, you will 
have abundant professions of good will, brotherly affection, &c. 
&c., and I believe they will now make sacrifices to keep us 
quiet, much more so to gain our assistance. But I will dwell 
no longer on this chapter, postponing all farther remarks, till 
the government of this country shall have adopted a plan for 
her ci-devant colonies. 
As to the interior affairs of France, one prominent and 
pleasant feature is an early and most abundant harvest. This 
is now gathering, and what is singular is the ripeness of 
wheat, barley, and oats at the same moment. In a few days, 
the whole crop will be secured, and they will begin to eat of 
it ; for there remains scarcely anything of last year's produce ; 
so that if the present had not been fit for use till towards the 
end of the next month, as is usually the case, God knows 
what would have become of us all. The abundance of the 
present year extends to every object, forage, pulse, roots, and 
other vegetables, as well as grain. The vineyards also promise more liquor than there are vessels to put it in. I conclude 
that we shall find little vent for our productions here, excepting our salted provisions, which must be in great demand. 
Moreover, I incline to the opinion that our vessels will not 
meet henceforward with the same vexations, which have been 
hitherto experienced , so that exportations of salted fish and 
flesh, may, I think, be safely encouraged for this country. To 
these may be added pot and pearl ashes, some flax seed and 
rice, also fish oil; and, in payment, our merchants will receive 
wines and brandies. 
</p><p>
There is at present a considerable ferment of parties, whose 
object, on the one hand, is to overturn, and, on the other, to 
preserve the colossal power of the two great Committees. 
Sooner or later that ferment must lead to an explosion, and 
the apprehension from the foreign enemy being greatly 
lessened, men turn more easily to the consideration of their 
domestic system. By a late decree, the Committee of Salut 
Public has secured to itself the promotion of one third to all 
places in the army, which gives them a stronger hold of that 
unwieldy instrument. Sooner or later, it must, unless dissolved, escape from the grasp of a multitudinous body. Such is 
the law of nature ; but that catastrophe is yet at a distance, 
and depends, I think, on the continuance of the war. Probably before it happens, the Committee will no longer exist in 
its present form ; for the mass of power there collected will, in 
the natural order of things, either excite so much envy as to 
dissolve the Committee, or, forcing them in self defence to 
increase it by severe and frequent exercise, so as to destroy 
all opposition, will generate in its bosom the causes of change. 
These are evils resulting from that state of violence in which 
society now exists, because in such state nothing can obtain a 
firm foundation ; and how long this may continue, God only 
knows. Hitherto power and property are at war, and the 
latter is a daily victim ; whereas it is their union, which can 
alone establish permament systems of government. 
</p><p>
Mr Jefferson's letter of the thirteenth of June, <a href='/results.php?year=1793'>1793</a>, reached 
me above a year after its date. Immediately on receipt of it, 
I wrote to the Commissioner of Exterior Relations the letter dated the twenty-first of June, of which I enclose a copy, as also 
a copy of his answer of the nineteenth Messidor, or seventh instant, from which you will learn, that the million of livres, hitherto unaccounted for, was received by M. de Beaumarchais, and, 
of course, ought, in a new statement of his accounts, to be carried to his debit at the date. The operation will then, in all 
probability, be such as to eat up the balance reported to be due 
to him. I hope this information may reach you in season. It 
would have been transmitted long ago, if, by good fortune, a 
copy of that letter of the thirteenth of June, <a href='/results.php?year=1793'>1793</a>, had been 
sent by Captain Culver. 
</p><p>
I trouble you, Sir, with copies of my letters of the twenty-third and twenty-ninth of last month to the Commissioner of Exterior Relations, his of the sixteenth Messidor, or fourth of July, 
and of one just received from him of the thirtieth Messidor, or 
eighteenth of July, from which it would seem, that my numerous complaints are at length to be attended to. I am inclined 
to think that this will happen, and I am persuaded that in pro 
portion as our administration is firm and united, it will be powerful at home and respected abroad. I am, &c. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gom" rel="me">Gouverneur Morris</a>. 
</p><p>
P, S. In making up my letter it occurs to me, that I had ta 
ken no notice of the strange complaints made against me by 
M. Genet, in his letter of the eighteenth of last September to the 
Secretary of State. I do not think it worth while to enter into 
the investigation of them ; and the more so, as the falsity of 
some, and the folly of others, are evident from facts in possession of your office, and from the style and nature of the com 
plaints themselves. But, while on this subject, it may not be 
amiss to mention, that, during the last winter in conversation with 
the then Minister of Foreign Affairs, (who, I am pretty sure, had 
instructed M. Fauchet to apply for my removal,) I told him that 
if this government wished for any person in my place, the best 
way would be to tell me so, and I would apply for my own recall. He answered by assurances of esteem. &tc. &LC.

My Dear Friend, 
</p><p>
I am preparing for my departure ; but as yet can take no 
step, because there is a kind of interregnum in the government, 
and Mr Monroe is not yet received ; at which he grows some 
what impatient. The intelligence you give me respecting 
myself is particularly pleasing. I desired much to be recalled, but I would not ask it, because I conceived my honor concerned in seeing the thing out. My only remaining wish is, 
that the measure may be as useful to the United States as it is 
pleasing to me. I am, &ic.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
This will accompany a duplicate of what I had the honor 
to write on the twenty-third of last month. Since which, viz. 
on the sixth instant, I received yours of the tenth of June ; 
that of the twenty-ninth of April has not arrived. If I could 
have permitted myself to have formed a personal wish, it 
would have been precisely what has happened. To be recalled on the application of the Committee of Salut Public, and 
to preserve, at the same time, the confidence of government, 
is getting out of a wretched position on better terms than I 
ever hoped for. Accept, therefore, my thanks, my sincere 
and hearty thanks, and present them, I pray you, to the 
President. My only remaining wish respecting this affair is, 
that my successor may fully succeed, and realize the expectations of the United States, or even surpass them. 
</p><p>
It is, I think, proper to correct two things in my last now 
enclosed. First, as to the dissolution of the alliance against 
France. I incline to think, at present, that it will take on a 
new form, instead of being dissolved. Secondly, as to the 
harvest. It is less abundant than was supposed. I will not 
say anything, just now, respecting Robespierre, &c. &tc. If 
my return to America should be delayed, I will inform you 
pretty fully of the state of things by the first safe opportunity. 
Accept, in the mean time, the assurances of that esteem and 
respect, with which I am, my dear Sir, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Yours of the 19th of April has at length reached me. It 
came through the hands of the Comite de Salut Public, and 
was, of course, read by them, which is well. I thank you for 
the information which it contains respecting public affairs ; and 
it affords me much pleasure to reflect, that my successor will 
probably receive from you similar communications, which will 
be highly useful. I have in former letters said so much on 
that subject, that I will add nothing here. 
The history you give of my recall is perfectly satisfactory, 
so far as I am personally concerned. I have never doubted 
an instant, that I should be treated with candor and honor, and 
I have even the confidence, that I shall always be blest with 
the friendship of those holiest men, who administer the government of the United States. 
</p><p>
I have said above, so far as I am personally concerned. It 
may be necessary to explain myself, and I cannot do it better, 
than by making a kind of testamentary request on behalf of 
my successor, should any of the factions or parties, which may 
prevail in this country, solicit his recall, supposing always that 
his conduct be proper in regard to the United States ; I ask 
then for him, under that restriction, the confidence and 
protection of the American government, to the end that it may 
be known and felt here. I hope a thorough conviction may 
be made to exist, that he is unmovable. T put out of question an extravagant conduct like that of M. Genet, for I am 
sure that he will not sin on that side of the line, and I hope will 
not err on the other. Whenever a stable government shall be 
established in France, it will be certainly right to have here a 
man agreeable to that government, ; and I think a coincidence 
of mutual interests will render the place of such a man easy 
and pleasant. Until that period, pardon me, my dear Sir, 
for saying, that I think a firm and decisive tone and conduct 
will best preserve the peace, as well as the dignity, of our 
country. Switzerland will not be insulted, and yet there is 
no extended waste of waters to separate her from France. 
</p><p>
I will not communicate my sentiments of public affairs, 
because I cherish the hope of doing it in person, and have 
written this letter to provide against the untoward events to 
which maritime affairs are subjected. I am, &c.

My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I shall write but a few lines by this conveyance. The re 
sources of this country will hold out till the end of April next, 
but then things will appear in a situation truly deplorable. 
Orders are given to push into Spain with all the force which 
can be collected. The object is to obtain a separate peace. 
Attempts will be made also to obtain peace with Savoy and 
Italy. These failing, to supply the south with food is impossible. Spain offered peace some time ago, but met with a 
contemptuous refusal. As yet the enemy seem to be unacquainted with the true state of things. I am, &c.

</p><p>
My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
At this late hour, and from this remote corner, J am to ac 
knowledge your favors of the 19th and 25th of June. I did 
not reply from Paris, because I wished for a safe conveyance ; 
and although none offers itself at present, yet I will write what 
occurs for communication, and take a future chance for transmission. 
</p><p>
The assurances of friendly esteem, which your letters convey, are very pleasing ; but, indeed, I never doubted of the 
sentiments you express, and even go so far as to natter myself, 
that the measure in question was not agreeable to you. It 
was highly so to me, and although I am persuaded that you 
will believe me, on my word, I will nevertheless assign some 
reasons why a change of situation was desirable. 
</p><p>
And first, you will see from what is publicly known respecting those, who administered the French despotism, how painful it must have been to represent our virtuous Republic to 
such persons. I had stayed, at some risk, after the 10th of 
August, because I thought the interests of America required 
it, and I did not ask my recall at a subsequent period, because 
it would not have been honorable to abandon a post which, if 
no longer unsafe, was at least very unpleasant. I felt that I 
was useless, and indeed that nobody could be useful, until 
some permanent system should be established. I saw misery 
and affliction every day, and all around me, without power to 
mitigate, or means to relieve ; and I felt myself degraded by 
the communications I was forced into with the worst of man 
kind, in order to obtain redress for the injuries sustained by 
my fellow citizens. 
</p><p>
During that state of things, I was grossly insulted by the arrest of a lady in my house, by order of the Committee of 
General Safety. I could not resent this, as I ought to have done, by quitting the country, because a great number of our 
citizens were then detained in France, with much of their 
property, and I knew the violence which those who administered the government were capable of. Moreover, I saw with 
regret, that the temper of America was not such as her best 
citizens could have wished ; and the conduct of Britain, rendered a temporizing conduct with France indispensable. My 
representations obtained a half apology and promise of satisfaction, but occasioned the order to solicit my recall ; of which I 
was apprised within four and twenty hours after it was given, 
and might easily have shown whence it originated ; but, to tell 
you the truth, I was inclined to wish that I might be removed 
on their application. I really believe it was necessary to my 
reputation. So long as they believed in the success of their 
demand, they treated my representations with indifference and 
contempt ; but at last, hearing nothing from their Minister on 
that subject, or indeed on any other, they took it into their 
heads that I was immovable, and made overtures of conciliation. 
</p><p>
At this time I began to apprehend, that we should be plunged into a war with England, in which case it would have be 
come my duty to aid the French as far as my abilities might 
go; but as I knew their temper, I replied to the advances 
made, that I was not to be affected by smooth words, so that 
they must begin by complying with the various demands I had 
made, and show me by facts that they were well disposed. 
Shortly after this, I received a volunteer letter from the Commissary of Exterior Relations, (a poor creature, who scarce 
dared to do anything without an order from the Committee of 
Safety), assuring me that he had transmitted my various representations to the Commissary of the Marine, and expected 
soon to give me satisfactory answers. It was written ten days 
before the death of Robespierre, shortly after which, Mr Monroe arrived. He was fortunate in not reaching France at an 
earlier period ; for, if I may judge by what fell within my observation, he would have been a little too well with that party, 
to be viewed in a neutral light by their opponents. I hope he may succeed in obtaining the redress of those grievances, 
which our countrymen labored under ; but on the 12th of October, when I left Paris, nothing was done. I build my present hopes, however, on Mr Jay's treaty, for they will now be 
somewhat more cautious respecting us than they have been. 
</p><p>
In reply to what you say about my return to America, I 
must tell you, that I could not depart in such season as that 
my communications could be of much importance, and there 
fore as I must have exposed myself to the inconveniences of 
a winter's passage, I deferred my voyage ; and the rather, as I 
have some affairs in London which I wish to wind up. I 
should have gone thither for that purpose direct, but the 
French would have harbored jealousies respecting my journey, which for many reasons I wished not to excite, and 
therefore I came round through Switzerland to this city, in 
which I am now weather bound. So much for my history. 
</p><p>
As to the state of political affairs, the Polish insurrection 
is, as you know, completely subdued, and of course the attention of Europe is all turned to France, which has lately 
triumphed in every quarter by the extreme misconduct of her 
enemies. It seems at present that they are coming to their 
senses, and if I am rightly informed, they have at length 
abandoned the idea of a dismemberment, and mean to pursue 
simply the re-establishment of the throne. If they act wisely 
and vigorously in that direction, it seems to to me that they 
must succeed, for the French are wearied and exhausted by 
the contest. They detest and despise their present rulers, 
and as far as I have been able to judge, they ardently desire 
the restoration of their Prince.

You will ask, perhaps, why then do they not restore him ? 
It is because they dare not act, nor even speak, so that they 
do not know each other's opinions, and of course each individual apprehends from the general mass ; but everything 
which has taken place leaves them to look back with regret 
to their ancient situation. In judging the French, we must 
not recur to the feelings of America during the last war. We 
were in the actual enjoyment of freedom, and fought not to 
obtain, but to secure its blessings. The people elected their 
magistrates during the continuance of the war. The property 
of the country was engaged in the Revolution, and the oppressions which it occasioned were neither great, extensive, 
nor of long duration.

But in France they have been lured by one idle hope after 
another, until they are plunged in the depth of misery and 
servitude ; servitude so much the more degrading, as they 
cannot but despise their masters. I have long, you know, 
predicted a single despotism, and you have seen how near 
they have been to that catastrophe. Chance, or rather the 
want of mettle in the usurper, has alone saved them to the 
present moment ; but I am still convinced, that they must end 
their voyage in that port, and they would probably reach it, 
should they make peace with all their foreign enemies, through 
the channels of a civil war. Adieu, my dear Sir. I wish you 
many and happy years, and am very truly yours,
