Sir, 
</p><p>
It being important to both countries, that the treaty of 
peace between Great Britain and the United States should be 
observed and performed with perfect and mutual good faith, 
and that a treaty of commerce should be concluded by them, 
on principles of reciprocal advantage to both, I wish to be ascertained of the sentiments and intentions of the Court of London on these interesting subjects. 
</p><p>
It appears to me most expedient to have these inquiries 
made informally, by a private agent ; and understanding that 
you will soon be in London, I desire you in that capacity, and 
on the authority and credit of this letter, to converse with his 
Britannic Majesty s Ministers on these points, viz. whether 
there be any and what objections to performing those articles in 
the treaty, which remain to be performed on his part ; and 
whether they incline to a treaty of commerce with the United 
States on any and what terms ? 
</p><p>
This communication ought regularly to be made to you by 
the secretary of state, but that office not being at present filled , 
my desire of avoiding delays induces me to make it under my 
own hand. It is my wish to promote harmony and mutual satisfaction between the two countries ; and it would give me great 
pleasure to find that the result of your agency, in the business 
now committed to you, will conduce to that end. 
</p><p>
I am, Sir, Your most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
My letter to you, herewith enclosed, will give you the credence necessary to enable you to do the business, which it commits to your management, and which I am persuaded you will readily undertake. 
</p><p>
Your inquiries will commence by observing, that, as the pre^ 
sent constitution of government and of the courts established in 
pursuance of it, removes the objections heretofore made to 
putting the United States in possession of their frontier posts, 
it is natural to expect from the assurances of his Majesty and 
the national good faith, that no unnecessary delays will take 
place. Proceed then to press a speedy performance of the 
treaty, respecting that object. 
</p><p>
Remind them of the article by which it was agreed, that 
negroes belonging to our citizens should not be carried away, 
and of the reasonableness of making compensation for them. 
Learn with precision, if possible, what they mean to do on this 
head. 
</p><p>
The commerce between the two countries you well under 
stand. You are apprized of the sentiments and feelings of the 
United States on the present state of it, and you doubtless have 
heard, that in the late session of Congress, a very respectable 
number of both houses were inclined to a discrimination of du 
ties unfavorable to Britain, and that it would have taken place, 
but for conciliatory considerations, and the probability that the 
late change in our government and circumstances would lead 
to more satisfactory arrangements. 
</p><p>
Request to be informed, therefore, whether they contemplate 
a treaty of commerce with the United States, and on what 
principles or terms in general. In treating this subject, let it be 
strongly impressed on your mind, that the privilege of carrying 
our productions in our vessels to their islands, and of bringing in 
return the productions of those islands to our own ports and 
markets, is regarded here as of the highest importance ; and you. 
will be careful not to countenance any idea of our dispensing 
with it in a treaty. Ascertain, if possible, their views on this 
point ; for it would not be expedient to commence negotiations 
without previously having good reasons to expect a satisfactory 
termination of them. 
</p><p>
It may also be well for you to take a proper occasion of re 
marking, that their omitting to send a minister here, when the 
United States sent one to London, did not make an agreeable 
impression on this country ; and request to know what would 
be their future conduct on similar occasions. 
</p><p>
It is in my opinion very important, that we avoid errors in 
our system of policy respecting Great Britain, and this can only be done by forming a right judgment of their disposition and 
views. Hence you will perceive how interesting it is, that you 
obtain the information in question, and that the business be so 
managed, as that it may receive every advantage, which abilities, address, and delicacy can promise and afford. 
I am. Sir, Your most obedient humble servant,

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
In my first moments of leisure I acknowledge the receipt of 
your several favors. 
</p><p>
To thank you for the interesting communications contained 
in those letters, and for the pains you have taken to procure 
me a watch, is all, or nearly all, I shall attempt in this letter ; 
for I could only repeat things, were I to set about it, which I 
have reason to believe have been regularly communicated to 
you in detail, at the periods which gave birth to them. It may 
not, however, be unpleasing to you to hear in one word, that 
the national government is organized, and as far as my information goes, to the satisfaction of all parties ; that opposition 
to it is either no more, or hides its head ; that it is hoped 
and expected it will take strong root ; and that the non-acceding States will very soon become members of the union. No 
doubt is entertained of North Carolina ; nor would there be any 
of Rhode Island, had not the majority of those people bid adieu, 
long since, to every principle of honor, common sense, and 
honesty. A material change however has taken place, it is said, 
at the late election of representatives, and confident assurances 
are given, from that circumstance, of better dispositions in their 
legislature at its next session, now about to be held. 
</p><p>
The revolution which has been effected in France is of so 
wonderful a nature, that the mind can hardly realize the fact. 
If it ends as our last accounts to the first of August predict, 
that nation will be the most powerful and happy in Europe ; 
but I fear, though it has gone triumphantly through the first 
paroxysm, it is not the last it has to encounter before matters 
are finally settled. In a word, the revolution is of too great a 
magnitude to be effected in so short a space, and with the loss 
of so little blood. The mortification of the King, the intrigues of the Queen, and the discontent of the princes and noblesse, will foment divisions, if possible, in the National Assembly, and they will unquestionably avail themselves of every 
faux pas in the formation of the constitution, if they do not give 
a more open, active opposition. In addition to these, the licentiousness of the people on one hand, and sanguinary punishments 
on the other, will alarm the best disposed friends to the measure, 
and contribute not a little to the overthrow of their object. Great 
temperance, firmness, and foresight are necessary in the movements of that body. To forbear running from one extreme to 
another is no easy matter, and should this be the case, rocks 
and shelves, not visible at present, may wreck the vessel, and 
give a higher toned despotism than the one which existed be 
fore. I am, dear Sir, &LC.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The communications in your several letters, relative to the 
state of affairs in Europe, are very gratefully received ; and I 
should be glad if it were in my power to reply to them more in 
detail than I am able to do. But my public duties, which are 
at all times sufficiently numerous, being now much accumulated 
by an absence of more than three month? from the seat of government, make the present a very busy moment for me. 
</p><p>
The change of systems, which have so long prevailed in Eu 
rope, will, undoubtedly, affect us in a degree proportioned to 
our political or commercial connexions with the several nations of it. But I trust we shall never so far lose sight of our 
own interest and happiness as to become, unnecessarily, a party in their political disputes. Our local situation enables us to 
maintain that state, with respect to them, which otherwise could 
not, perhaps, be preserved by human wisdom. The present 
moment seems pregnant with great events ; but, as you observe, it is beyond the ken of mortal foresight to determine 
what will be the result of those changes, which are either making, or contemplated, in the general system of Europe. Al 
though as fellow men we sincerely lament the disorders, oppressions, and incertitude, which frequently attend national 
events, and which our European brethren must feel, yet we 
cannot but hope, that it will terminate very much in favor of 
the rights of man. And that a change there, will be favorable to this country, I have no doubt. For under the former 
system we were seen either in the distresses of war, or viewed 
after the peace in a most unfavorable light through the medium of our distracted state. In neither point could we appear 
of much consequence among nations. And should affairs continue in Europe in the same state they were, when these impressions respecting us were received, it would not be an easy matter to remove the prejudices imbibed against us. A 
change of system will open a new view of things, and we shall 
then burst upon them, as it were, with redoubled advantages. 
</p><p>
Should we, under the present state of affairs, form connexions, other than we now have, with any European powers, 
much must be considered in effecting them, on the score of our 
increasing importance as a nation ; and at the same time, should 
a treaty be formed with a nation, whose circumstances may not 
at this moment be very bright, much delicacy would be necessary in order to show that no undue advantages were taken on 
that account. For unless treaties are mutually beneficial to 
the parties, it is vain to hope for a continuance of them beyond 
the moment when the one, which conceives itself overreached, 
is in a situation to break off the connexion. And I believe it 
is among nations as with individuals, that the party taking ad 
vantage of the distresses of another will lose infinitely more in 
the opinion of mankind, and in subsequent events, than it will 
gain by the stroke of the moment. 
</p><p>
In my late tour through the southern States, I experienced 
great satisfaction in seeing the good effects of the general government in that part of the union. The people at large have 
felt the security which it gives, and the equal justice which it 
administers to them. The farmer, the merchant, and the 
mechanic have seen their several interests attended to, and 
from thence they unite in placing a confidence in their representatives, as well as in those in whose hands the execution of 
the laws is placed. Industry has there taken place of idleness, and economy of dissipation. Two or three years of 
good crops, and a ready market for the produce of their lands, 
have put every one in good humor ; and in some instances they 
even impute to the government what is due only to the goodness of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>. 
</p><p>
The establishment of public credit is an immense point 
gained in our national concerns. This, I believe, exceeds the 
expectation of the most sanguine among us. And a late in 
stance, unparalleled in this country, has been given of the confidence reposed in our measures, by the rapidity with which 
the subscriptions to the Bank of the United States were filled. 
In two hours after the books were opened by the commissioners, the whole number of shares was taken up, and four thou 
sand more applied for, than were allowed by the institution ; 
besides a number of subscriptions which were coming on. 
This circumstance was not only pleasing, as it related to the 
confidence in government, but as it exhibited an unexpected 
proof of the resources of our citizens. 
</p><p>
In one of my letters to you the account of the number of 
inhabitants, which would probably be found in the United 
States on enumeration, was too large. The estimate was 
then founded on the ideas held out by the gentlemen in Congress of the population of the several States, each of whom (as 
was very natural) looking through a magnifier would speak of 
the greatest extent, to which there was any probability of their 
numbers reaching. Returns of the census have already been 
made from several of the States, and a tolerably just estimate 
has been now formed in others ; by which it appears, that we 
shall hardly reach four millions ; but this you are to take along 
with it, that the real number will greatly exceed the official 
return^ because, from religious scruples, some would not give 
in their lists ; from an apprehension that it was intended as 
the foundation of a tax, others concealed, or diminished theirs ; 
and from the indolence of the mass, and want of activity in 
many of the deputy enumerators, numbers are omitted. The 
authenticated number will, however, be far greater, I believe, 
than has ever been allowed in Europe ; and will have no 
small influence in enabling them to form a more just opinion 
of our present growing importance, than has yet been entertained there. 
</p><p>
This letter goes with one from the Secretary of State, to 
which I must refer you for what respects your public transactions, and I shall only add to it the repeated assurances of 
regard and affection, with which I am, dear Sir, 
Your obedient and obliged,

My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Although your letter of the tenth of June, which I have 
received, did not paint the prospects of France in the most 
pleasing colors, yet the events which have since taken place 
give a more gloomy aspect to the public affairs of that kingdom, than your letter gave reason to apprehend. 
</p><p>
A thousand circumstances, besides our distance from the 
theatre of action, made it improbable that we should have, 
in this country, a fair statement of facts and causes through 
the medium of the public prints ; and I have received no 
other accounts, than what have come in that channel. But 
taking up the most favorable of these, gloomy indeed appears 
the situation of France at this juncture. But it is hardly 
probable that even you, who are on the spot, can say with any 
precision how these things will terminate ; much less can we, 
at this distance, pretend to augur the event. We can only 
repeat the sincere wish, that much happiness may arise to the 
French nation, and to mankind in general, out of the severe 
evils which are inseparable from so important a revolution. 
</p><p>
In the present state of things we cannot expect, that any 
commercial treaty can now be formed with France ; but I 
have no doubt of your embracing the proper moment of arrangement, and of doing whatever may be in your power for 
the substantial interest of our country. 
</p><p>
The affairs of the United States go on well. There are 
some few clouds in our political hemisphere, but I trust that 
the bright sun of our prosperity will disperse them. 
</p><p>
The Indians on our western and southern frontiers are still 
troublesome, but such measures are taken as will, I presume, 
prevent any serious mischief from them ; I confess, however, 
that I do not believe these tribes will ever be brought to a 
quiescent state, so long as they may be under an influence 
which is hostile to the rising greatness of these states. 
</p><p>
From the complexion of some of our newspapers, foreigners would be led to believe, that inveterate political dissensions 
exist among us, . and that we are on the very verge of disunion ; but the fact is otherwise. The great body of the 
people now feel the advantages of the general government, 
and would not, I am persuaded, do anything that should destroy it ; but this kind of representations is an evil, which 
must be placed in opposition to the infinite benefits resulting 
from a free press ; and I am sure you need not be told, that in 
this country a personal difference in political sentiments is 
often made to take the garb of general dissensions. 
From the Department of State you are, I am informed, 
furnished with such papers and documents from time to 
time, as will keep you more particularly informed of the state 
of our affairs. I shall therefore add nothing further to this 
letter, than assurances of being always and sincerely yours, &c.

My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
It was not till the middle of February, that I had the pleasure to receive your letter of the 23d of October. 
</p><p>
If you, who are at the fountain head of those great and important transactions, which have lately engrossed the attention 
of Europe and America, cannot pretend to say what will be 
their event, surely we, in this distant quarter, should be presumptuous indeed in venturing to predict it. And unwise should 
we be in the extreme, to involve ourselves in the contests of 
European nations, where our weight could be but small, 
though the loss to ourselves would be certain. lean however 
with truth aver, that this country is not guided by such a narrow 
and mistaken policy, as will lead it to wish the destruction of 
any nation, under an idea that our importance will be increased in proportion as that of others is lessened. We should 
rejoice to see every nation enjoying all the advantages, that 
nature and its circumstances would admit, consistent with civil 
liberty and the rights of other nations. Upon this ground the 
prosperity of this country would unfold itself everyday, and 
every day it would be growing in political importance. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr Jefferson</a> will communicate to you such official information as we have to give, and will transmit the laws, public 
papers, &;c. 
</p><p>
I have thought it best, my dear Sir, not to let slip this opportunity of acknowledging the receipt of your letter, lest no other 
should occur to me very soon, as I am called to <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a> 
by the death of my nephew, Major Washington, and am on 
the point of setting out for that place tomorrow. I need not 
tell you that this is of course a very busy moment with me. 
It will therefore account for the conciseness of this letter, by 
which however you must not measure my regard. 
</p><p>
You see me again entering upon the arduous duties of an 
important office. It is done so contrary to my intention, that 
it would require more time, than I have allowed myself, to as 
sign the reasons ; and therefore I shall leave them to your 
own suggestion, aided by the publications which you will find 
in the gazettes. I am your sincere friend and affectionate 
servant,

My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The difficulty, under existing circumstances, of knowing 
what to write to you, had determined me to write nothing, but 
to let the matter rest altogether upon the public communications from the Secretary of State. 
</p><p>
Coming to this place, however, on a flying visit to Mount 
Vernon, and finding the vessel, of which <a href='/results.php?tla=jam' rel='co-worker met'>Mr Monroe</a> is on 
board, had not left the river, I have so far departed from my 
determination, as to be seated in order to assure you that my 
confidence in, and friendship and regard for you, remain undiminished. 
</p><p>
To time, and your own observations, if you should return 
immediately to this country, I commit the rest ; and it will be 
nothing new to assure you, that I am always and very sincerely yours, affectionately,

</p><p>
My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The sole object of the enclosed letter was to evince to you, 
that, notwithstanding your recall, you held the same place in 
my estimation that you did before it happened. I expected to 
have got the letter into Colonel Monroe s hands, before the vessel in which he sailed, had left Patapsco river ; but a fresh 
fair wind coming up, prevented its reaching him. 
</p><p>
Since my arrival at this place, I have been favored with your 
private letter of the 12th of March, enclosing the duplicate of 
the 5th of February. For both I thank you. To common 
accidents, or to the interception of letters for purposes that 
may be guessed, are to be ascribed those disappointments of 
which you complain ; for I am almost certain, that information 
of what was going forward in this country was regularly transmitted to you ; possibly, and probably, not by duplicates, 
which ought to have been the case, for the greater certainty of getting it to you. 
</p><p>
The uncertainty, when letters are not entrusted to confidential persons, or sent by special messengers, of their coming to 
hand, will restrain me from going into detail at this time. I 
shall only add, therefore, to the acknowledgment of the receipt of the above letters, that I am entirely ignorant of the 
source from whence, or the foundation on which, Major Jackson has erected the fabrics of your recall, and of your successor. Neither directly nor indirectly could he have derived them 
from me, for the best of all reasons, viz. that not until some 
considerable time after M. Fauchet had arrived in this country, did I entertain an idea of the former, or contemplate the 
latter; for until then, I had supposed you stood well with the 
persons in power. Sure I am, nothing short of evidence 
to the contrary, with the request that accompanied it, would 
have induced the measure. To Major Jackson I have never 
written a line since he left this country, nor received one from him. 
</p><p>
The prospective you have drawn is not very pleasing ; but it serves to make one more anxious for a nearer view. 
</p><p>
The affairs of this country cannot go amiss. There are so many watchful guardians of them, and such infallible guides, 
that one is at no loss for a director at every turn. But of these matters I shall say little ; if you are disposed to re 
turn to it, I will leave you to judge of them from your own observation. My primary objects, and to which I have steadily 
adhered, have been to preserve the country in peace if I can, and to be prepared for war if I cannot ; to effect the first, 
upon terms consistent with the respect which is due to our selves, and with honor, justice, and good faith to all the world. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='co-worker met friend'>Mr Jay</a>, and not <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr Jefferson</a>, as has been suggested to you, embarked as Envoy Extraordinary for England, about the

Dear Sir,

This letter will be short ; the intention of it being little more 
than to acknowledge the receipt of your several favors from 
London, dated the 7th and 13th of April, and 1st and 2d of May, 
on the business which had been entrusted to you of a public nature ; and of your other letters of the 12th of April, and the

Permit me to thank you, my good sir, for the attention you 
have given to the latter ; and, as far as your communications 
with the British Government had gone, to assure you of my 
entire approbation of your conduct respecting the former. I 
shall await the answer, which your address of the 30th of April
