Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
It has long since been observed, that, of the three millions of livres given by the court of France to aid us in the commencement of our revolution, one million was unaccounted for by the 
hands into which it was paid. The date of the payment is 
fixed to have been the 10th of June, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. But to whom it 
was paid has never been known. Suspicions are, that it was 
to Beaumarchais ; and that with this very money he purchased 
the supplies furnished us by him, for which large sums have 
been paid him already, and a farther large sum. is lately certified to b6 due to him as the balance of that account. I enclose 
you a letter from the Secretary of the Treasury on this subject, 
with all the papers relative to the same, which his office can 
furnish ; and as you are on the spot, I must beg the favor of 
you to make an immediate and thorough investigation of it. 
No reasons of State can now exist for covering the transaction 
longer under mystery. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem, dear 
Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The letter of the 16th instant, with its documents accompanying this, will sufficiently inform you of the transactions which 
have taken place between M. Genet, the Minister of France, 
and the government here, and of the painful necessity they 
have brought on, of desiring his recall. The letter has been 
prepared in the view of being itself, with its documents, laid 
before the Executive of the French government.* You will, 
therefore, be pleased to lay it before them, doing everything 
which can be done on your part, to procure it a friendly and 
dispassionate reception and consideration. The President 
would, indeed, think it greatly unfortunate, were they to take 
it in any other light ; and therefore charges you very particularly with the care of presenting this proceeding in the most 
soothing view, and as the result of an unavoidable necessity on 
his part. 
</p><p>
M. Genet, soon after his arrival, communicated the decree 
of the National Convention of February 15th, <a href='/results.php?year=1793'>1793</a>, authorising 
their Executive to propose a treaty with us on liberal principles, such as might strengthen the bonds of good will, which 
unite the two nations ; and informed us in a letter of May 23d, 
that he was authorised to treat accordingly. The Senate being then in recess, and not to meet again till the fall, I apprised 
M. Genet that the participation in matters of treaty, given by 
the constitution to that branch of our government, would of 
course delay any definitive answer to his friendly proposition. 
As he was sensible of this circumstance, the matter has been 
understood to lie over till the meeting of the Senate. You will 
be pleased, therefore, to explain to the Executive of France this 
delay, which has prevented as yet our formal accession to their 
proposition to treat, to assure them that the President will 
meet them with the most friendly dispositions, on the grounds 
of treaty proposed by the National Convention, as soon as he 
can do it in the forms of the constitution, and you will of 
course suggest for this purpose, that the powers of M. Genet 
be renewed to his successor. I have the honor to be, &ic.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to inform you, that I have resigned the office of Secretary of State, and that Mr Randolph, late Attorney General of the United States, is appointed by the President, and approved by the Senate, as Secretary of State. He 
will be so good as to acknowledge the receipt of your several 
letters not yet acknowledged by me, and will answer in detail 
such parts of them as may require special answer. I beg 
leave to conclude this last of public correspondence with you, 
with very sincere assurances of the great esteem and respect, 
with which I have the honor to be, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your letter of May the 29th to the President of the United 
States has been duly received. You have placed their proposition of exchanging a minister on proper ground. It must 
certainly come from them, and come in unequivocal form. 
With those who respect their own dignity so much, ours must 
not be counted at nought. On their own proposal, formerly, 
to exchange a minister, we sent them one. They have taken 
no notice of that, and talk of agreeing to exchange one now, 
as if the idea were new. Besides, what they are saying to 
you, they are talking to us through <a href='/results.php?city=quebec' rel='city'>Quebec</a> ; but so informally, that they may disavow it when they please. It would 
only oblige them to make the fortune of the poor Major, whom 
they would pretend to sacrifice. Through him, they talk of a 
minister, a treaty of commerce, and alliance. If the object of 
the latter be honorable, it is useless ; if dishonorable, inadmissible. These tamperings prove, that they view a war as very 
possible ; and some symptoms indicate designs against the Spanish possessions adjoining us. The consequences of their 
acquiring all the country on our frontier, from the St Croix to 
the St Mary s, are too obvious to you, to need developement. 
You will readily see the dangers which would then environ us. 
</p><p>
We wish you, therefore, to intimate to them, that we cannot 
be indifferent to enterprises of this kind. That we should 
contemplate a change of neighbors with extreme uneasiness ; 
and that a due balance on our borders is not less desirable to 
us, than a balance of power in Europe has always appeared to 
them. We wish to be neutral, and we will be S6, if they will 
execute the treaty fairly, and attempt no conquests adjoining 
us. The first condition is just ; the second imposes no hard 
ship on them. They cannnot complain, that the other dominions of Spain would be so narrow as not to leave them room 
enough for conquest. If the war takes place, we would really 
wish to be quieted on these two points, offering in return an 
honorable neutrality. More than this, they are not to expect. 
It will be proper that these ideas be conveyed, in delicate and 
friendly terms ; but that they be conveyed, if the war takes 
place ; for it is in that case alone, and not till it be begun, that 
we would wish our dispositions to be known. But in no case, 
need they think of our accepting any equivalent for the posts. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with great respect and esteem. 
Dear Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
