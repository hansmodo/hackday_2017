Sir, 
</p><p>
My predecessor has sent me a letter, which you wrote to him on the nineteenth instant, demanding reparation for an 
outrage committed on board the American ship, Little Cherub. The report made on this subject has been transmitted to you. 
</p><p>
The numerous occupations of the Comite de Salut Public 
not having yet allowed them to pursue the matter, I have 
thought it my duty to press a decision by a letter, of which I 
send you a copy, and I hope to announce to you in a short 
time the reparation you demand in the name of your constituents. 
</p><p>
I seize with eagerness this occasion to assure you, that 
the change of the chief in the department of Foreign Affairs 
will, in no degree, influence the amicable dispositions, which 
have hitherto existed in your political relations with this department. These dispositions are those of the whole nation, 
and every agent of the French people should be obliged to 
conform himself thereto, even if he had not, as in my case, 
the highest esteem, and fraternal attachment for the United 
States. 
</p><p>
I trust, Sir, that events more propitious, than those now in 
question, will become the subject of our correspondence, and 
that, instead of reparations, I shall have to announce to you 
only the spontaneous testimonies of the friendship of all my 
fellow citizens for their allies. I have the honor to be, &c.

Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received the letter, which you did me the honor to 
write on the 27th of last month. 
</p><p>
It is unfortunate, that the administration of St Domingo did 
not make arrangement with the French Minister in Philadelphia, to provide the means for paying their drafts. I have 
given to citizen Genet the necessary instructions for meeting 
them. The government of the Republic has already charged 
that Minister to testify to the President of the United States, 
its just estimate of the efforts made by our compatriots to succor the inhabitants of St Domingo. This act has confirmed 
the opinion, which we have always entertained of their attachment to the French Republic. 
</p><p>
The National Convention, justly indignant at the violences 
committed on board the Little Cherub, have passed the decree, of which I enclose a copy. I hope the reparations ordered by the Representatives of the people will appear to 
you satisfactory. 
</p><p>
I send likewise a copy of a decree, which exempts American ships from the dispositions of the decree of May 9th. I 
am happy to have it in my power to give this new proof of the 
fraternal sentiments of the French people for their allies, and 
of their firm determination to use every means in their power 
to maintain the treaties, which subsist between the two Republics. I have the honor to be,

Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received the letter, which you did me the honor to 
write to me on the 8th instant, as also the papers accompanying it. 
</p><p>
I shall give the Council an account of the punishable (punissable) conduct of their agent in the United States, and I 
can assure you, beforehand, that they will regard the strange 
abuse of their confidence by this agent, as I do, with the liveliest indignation. The President of the United States has 
done justice to our sentiments, in attributing the deviations of 
the citizen Genet to causes entirely foreign from his instructions ; and we hope that the measures, which are to be taken, 
will more and more convince the head and the members of 
your government, that so far from having authorised the proceedings and criminal manoeuvres (les demarches et les man&ucrlminelles) of citizen Genet, our only aim has been 
to maintain between the two nations the most perfect harmony. 
</p><p>
I shall avail myself, Sir, of the medium of the packet boat, 
which brought to you the despatches of <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel=''>Mr Jefferson</a>, and I 
pray you to give me notice of the day which you have fixed 
for its departure. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
You have complained of the fraud committed by the captors 
of the ship Peggy, in taking away the papers, which proved her 
cargo to be American. The lawyer, who informed you of 
this fact, proposes to collect the necessary proofs. It is deter 
mined, as soon as your correspondent at Morlaix shall transmit these proofs, to punish the guilty according to the utmost 
rigor of the law. 
</p><p>
You observe that it is to be feared, that the judges may be 
interested in the cases submitted to them. To avoid such an 
inconvenience, the law grants to the injured party the resource 
of an appeal, and in the last resort a direct intervention of the 
administration, and legislative body. 
</p><p>
The extreme rigor, with which the English and the other belligerent powers treat all the neutral vessels destined for 
France, has put the Republic to the painful necessity of ar 
resting, by way of reprisal, in such vessels the provisions be 
longing to its enemies. This severe measure, clearly explained in the decree of the ninth of May, of which I enclose you 
a copy, is the result of the most imperious circumstances. It 
will continue only as long as our enemies employ against us 
means disapproved of by the laws of humanity, and by those 
of war. In casting your eye on this law, you can hardly, Sir, 
avoid the conviction, that it was necessary and just ; that the 
Republic could no longer, without inattention to itself, preserve 
tolerable decency towards its implacable and ferocious enemies, 
and that the system of depriving them of foreign produce was 
also to dissipate its means of offence. 
</p><p>
In comparing this law with the declaration made by the 
British government, at Stockholm, Copenhagen, Florence, and 
probably at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, you will observe an extreme difference between our manner of thinking and that of our enemies. 
 
You will see on the one hand, the firm determination of destroying several millions of victims, merely to satisfy a spirit 
of vengeance or of ambition, and on the other, the desire of 
repelling unjust aggressions by severe laws, and a regret at being reduced to that extremity. 
</p><p>
Here then, Sir, in two words is the situation in which the 
Republic stands. Its enemies have openly usurped the right 
of seizing all the provisions, which are destined to it, and even 
all the Frenchmen found on board of neutral vessels. But 
it seems that France, attacked on all sides, abandoned to its 
own strength, without allies, without foreign succor, should 
confine herself scrupulously to the maxims of the law of nations, so cruelly violated by her enemies. Hence it would 
result, that the neutrality of several powers would be partial, 
that it would operate only in favor of our enemies, whose 
commerce would be peaceably carried on under the shelter of 
a borrowed flag, while ours could not under any flag what 
ever. 
</p><p>
The law of the ninth of May is conditional, whilst the declarations of the combined powers are positive. It is in their 
power to put a period to the execution of this law, by permit 
ting neutral vessels to communicate freely with France. 
</p><p>
These observations, Sir, which you are too just not to appreciate, apply to the greater part of the claims, which you have 
addressed to me for some time. I have done, with respect to 
several of them, all that depended on me, in order to obtain in 
favor of your countrymen an exception of the general measures, adopted with regard to neutral nations. I have used, 
among others, all the means with which your letters furnished 
me, to have restored the ship Laurens ; but I have met with 
insurmountable obstacles, in the established laws, and in the 
opinion of the commercial tribunal of Havre. The tribunal 
has neglected nothing to render justice to the owners of this 
vessel. It has consented among other things, to have translated two hundred and sixty-one letters, merely to prove in the 
most authentic manner the property of the cargo. The interested have besides avowed themselves, that they had neglected an essential formality required by our laws. 
</p><p>
You must be satisfied, Sir, with the manner in which the re 
quest, presented by the American captains from Bordeaux, 
has been received. This fact&gt; and several others of the same 
kind, which could not escape your attention, must have convinced you, that when the particular circumstances of the Re 
public permitted the administration to favor your countrymen, 
it was eager to give to them testimonies of the desire, which it 
always has had, of bringing nearer and nearer the citizens and 
the interests of the two countries. 
</p><p>
We hope, that the government of the United States will 
attribute to their true cause, the abuses of which you complain, 
as well as other violations of which our cruisers may render 
themselves guilty, in the course of the present war. It must 
perceive how difficult it is, to contain within just limits the indignation of our marines, and in general of all the French patriots, against a people who speak the same language, and 
have the same habits, as the free Americans. The difficulty of distinguishing our allies from our enemies, has often been 
the cause of offences committed on board your vessels ; all 
that the administration could do, is to order indemnification to 
those who have suffered, and to punish the guilty. 
</p><p>
I enclose herein several copies of the navigation act, de 
creed by the representatives of the people. I request you to 
make the dispositions of them known to the government of the 
United States. It will there find the basis of a system connecting more and more the interests of the two nations. 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=fad" rel="me">DEFORGUES</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I enclose herein, Sir, an arret of the Committee of 
Public Safety, which fulfils in part the object proposed in 
your letter of the 13th of this month. I shall have the honor 
of communicating to you the measures, which shall be taken 
in the sequel.
