PREFACE. 



THE materials for this work have been derived from various 
sources, but chiefly from the manuscripts left by Gouverneur 
Morris at Morrisania, and furnished by his widow, Mrs Anne 
C. Morris. I have been indebted, for several interesting par- 
ticulars in the memoir, to the politeness of General Morgan 
Lewis, Dr David Hosack, and M. Leray de Chaifmont, who 
were intimately acquainted with Mr Morris at different periods 
of his life. Acknowledgments are due, also, to the Secreta- 
ry of the State of New York, who very obligingly opened to 
my inspection the archives in his office, from which some im- 
portant facts were obtained respecting Mr Morris's early po- 
litical services. 

In its general arrangement the work is divided into two 
parts, the first containing a biographical sketch, and the other 
a selection of letters and miscellaneous articles. During the 
American Revolution, and indeed down to the time of his de- 
parture for Europe, he gave little attention to his papers, but 
from that date to the end of his life they were preserved with 
remarkable care. It would seem, that every important letter 
was copied into his letter books. Within this space, his pub- 
lished correspondence affords so complete an account of his 
life and opinions, that it has been thought best to allot a large 
portion of the memoir to earlier events. Previous researches 
had furnished me with copious materials, from which collater-

VI PREFACE. 

al facts have occasionally been drawn, with the view of sup- 
plying the deficiencies in his papers, and illustrating some of 
the less familiar parts of our revolutionary history, in which 
he was a prominent actor. 

While Mr Morris resided in Europe he kept a Diary,- 
which affords much curious matter, particularly respecting the 
Revolution in France, and extracts from which have been 
woven into the narrative in such proportions, as the limits of 
the work would admit. 

The letters and other papers, selected for publication in 
these volumes, have been transcribed from the original manu- 
scripts, none of them having before been printed, except the 
speeches in. the Senate of the United States, the Essay on the 
Bank of North America, and perhaps half a dozen letters. 
The correspondence with Washington, which was continued 
for many years, is probably the most valuable part of the col- 
lection. Washington's own letters are printed from the orig- 
inals, which, in every instance, exist in the handwriting of 
the author. 

It has not been my aim to write a panegyric, to conceal de- 
fects, or emblazon good qualities, but rather to present traits 
of character, acts, and opinions, in their genuine light and just 
bearings, and leave them to make their proper impressions. 
Such is doubtless the legitimate purpose of biography. Indis- 
criminate eulogy is seldom sincere, never true, contributing 
little to accurate history, or to the stock of valuable know- 
ledge either of men or things.

CHAPTER I. 

THE MORRIS FAMILY IN AMERICA. BIRTH AND EDUCATION OF GOUVER- 
NEUR MORIS HIS COLLEGE ORATIONS. STUDIES LAW WITH WILLIAM 

SMITH, THE HISTORIAN OF NEW YORK. WRITES ON THE FINANCE OF 

THE COLONY. PRACTISES LAW. MEDITATES A VISIT TO EUROPE. 

FIRST MOVEMENTS IN NEW YORK CONCERNING THE AGGRESSIONS OF EN- 
GLAND. MR MORRIS'S VIEWS OF THAT SUBJECT. 

RICHARD MORRIS was the original stock of a family, which, 
for more than a century, through the popular and command- 
ing talents of some of its members, exercised a controlling 
influence in the political events of New York and New 
Jersey. His descendants have now become numerous in both 
those States, and have spread into other parts of the Union. 
Wearied with the unsettled condition of affairs in England, 
brought about by the wars of Cromwell, in whose armies he 
is said to have been a distinguished leader, he turned his 
views to America, and came over first to the West Indies, 
and shortly afterwards to New York. Here he purchased 
an estate near Haerlem, ten miles from the city, containing 
more than three thousand acres of land. By the Governor's 
original grant this domain was invested with manorial privi-

leges, and called Morrisania. The first proprietor of the 
Manor of Morrisania died in 1673, leaving an only son, 
named Lewis, an infant and an orphan, his mother having 
died a few months before. 

Being thus left, when he was not yet a year old, without 
parents or any other natural protectors, the government of the 
colony appointed guardians to take care of him and the prop- 
erty left by his father. Not long afterwards his uncle came 
to America and settled at Morrisania.* He took his young 
nephew under his charge, and finally made him heir to his 
fortune. 

The early years of Lewis Morris, the nephew, were wild 
and erratic. On one occasion, having committed some of- 
fence of youthful extravagance or folly, which he knew would 
displease his uncle, he strolled away to the southern colonies, 
and thence to the West Indies, where he supported himself for 
some time as a scrivener. Soon satisfied with the pleasures 
of wandering, and tired of a life of dependance and privation, 
he returned again to his uncle's roof, where he was received 
with kindness. Endowed with strong natural powers, and 
fond of distinction, he entered at an early age upon a public 
career. He was one of the Council of New Jersey, and a 
judge of the Supreme Court of that colony, and also for sev- 
eral years member of the Assembly, and Chief Justice of 
New York. In this latter colony he was at one period a 
popular leader in the party of the Assembly and people, in 
opposition to the Governors, who, as in most of the other 
colonies, generally continued to keep up a quarrel with the 
people, by their arbitrary abuse of power and exactions of 



* This uncle's name was Lewis Morris. There is a contract on 
record dated the tenth of August, ](>rO, in which Richard 3Iorris is 
a merchant of New York, and his brother Lewis a merchant 
of Barliadues. By this contract Lewis Morris agreed to come and 
settle on his brother's lands at IMorrisania, but he seems not to have 
arrived for that purpose till after the death of the latter.

money. During the last eight years of his life, Mr Morris 
was Governor of New Jersey. 

He had twelve children, four sons and eight daughters. 
Of these sons the two eldest, Lewis and Robert Hunter, walk- 
ed in the steps of their father, and became emulous of public 
service and notoriety. Lewis resided at Morrisania, and at 
an early age was a member of the New York Legislature, 
supporting, as his father had done before him, the rights and 
privileges of that body, and the interests of the people. Dur- 
ing the latter years of his life he was Judge of Vice Admiralty 
for New York, having jurisdiction also by his commission over 
all maritime affairs in Connecticut and New Jersey., Robert 
Hunter Morris was for more than twenty years one of the 
Council, and Chief Justice of New Jersey. He visited Eng- 
land and obtained the appointment of Deputy Governor of 
Pennsylvania, which post he held about two years in one of 
the most boisterous and troublesome periods recorded in the 
history of that province. The inroads of the French and In- 
dians on the frontiers, and the disastrous effects of Braddock's 
defeat, were among the evils that beset his administration ; to 
which may be added his unceasing and stormy contest with 
the Assembly, in endeavoring to maintain the proprietary pre- 
rogatives against the determined opposition of the legislative 
body, the general voice of their constituents, and above all the 
powerful weight of the talents and influence of Franklin. 

Lewis Morris last mentioned, son of the Governor of New 
Jersey, had eight children, of whom four were sons, Lewis, 
Staats Long, Richard, and Gouverneur, and four daughters, 
Mary, Sarah, Euphemia, and Catherine. The eldest son, 
Lewis, was a graduate of Yale College. He took an early and 
decided part with the advocates for freedom at the beginning 
of the Revolution, was a member of the Old Congress from 
New York, and a signer of the declaration of independence. 
Staats Long Morris was an officer in the British army, and 
married the Dutchess of Gordon. He was at one time a 
member of Parliament, and lived and died in England. Rich- 



LIFE OF 



;inl Morris was Judge of Vice Admiralty, and afterwards 
Chief Justice of New York. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS, the subject ofthe present memoir, was 
the youngest,son by a second marriage, and born at Morrisania 
January thirty-first, 1752. Very little is known of his early 
years, and whether as a boy he was remarkable for precocity, or 
dulness, or mischief, there is neither record nor tradition to in- 
form us. Rumor speaks of his fondness for rural sports, and 
the delights he enjoyed in rambling over his paternal domains 
in that species of exercise and amusement. When quite a 
child he was put to live in the family of a French teacher, 
M. Tetar, at New Rochelle, where lie acquired the basis 
of the French language, which in after life he wrote and spoke 
with nearly as much fluency and correctness as his native 
tongue. His father died before he was twelve years old, 
leaving him to the care of his mother. 

Tlie second marriage of his father seems not to have been 
well received by the family, and especially by the elder chil- 
dren. Hence a breach was made in the bonds of family union 
and sympathy, which was not healed for many years, and 
which contributed to estrange the second wife and her young 
charge from the interests of the other branches of the family. 
But as she was left with ample provisions by her husband, 
neither she nor her children experienced any other inconven- 
ience from these dissentions, than the privation of those en- 
dearments, which are the result of reciprocal good feeling and 
kindness between those, who are bound together by the ties of 
consanguinity. She applied herself to the management of her 
ailairs, and the education of her son.* 



* Tin- following is ;m extract from his father's will, which is dated 
November nineteenth. ITliO. It is my desire that my son Gouveniem 
Munis may have tin: hest education, that is to be had in England or 
America.' 

There is a whimsical claiiso in this will, which may perhaps be 
characteristic of its author. 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 5 

After the usual preparation at the subordinate schools, he 
was entered at the college in the city of New York, where he 
graduated in May, 1768, at the age of sixteen. While at 
college he was more distinguished for quickness of parts and 
facility of acquisition, than for industry, a passion for learning, 
or general scholarship. Latin and the mathematics were his 
favorite studies, and though he began to read Shakspeare and 
make rhymes at an early period, and notwithstanding a lively 
imagination was a predominant quality of his mind, yet it 
may be doubted whether his taste was ever decidedly bent 
in the direction of elegant letters, or the flowery regions of or- 
namental literature. The eminent men of his family had all 
been remarkable for their acuteness, their skill in discussion, 



'My actions have been so inconsiderable in the world, that the most 
durable monument will but perpetuate my folly while it lasts. My de- 
sire is, that nothing be mentioned about me, not so much as a line in a 
newspaper to tell the world I am dead. That I have lived to very little 
purpose, my children will remember with concern when they see the 
small pittance I have left them, for children judge of the goodness and 
aifection of their parents by the largeness of the sums coming to 
them. But what I have left them is honestly acquired, which gives 
me a satisfaction that ill got thousands cannot bestow.' 

Excentricity in the construction and wording of wills would seem 
to have been a hereditary foible in the family. The following is an 
extract from the will of Lewis Morris, the Governor of New Jersey. 

' I forbid any rings or any scarfs to be given at my funeral, or any 
man to be paid for preaching a funeral sermon over me. Those who 
survive me will commend or blame my conduct in life as they think fit, 
and I arn not for paying of any man for doing of either ; but if any man 
whether churchman or dissenter, in or not in priest's orders, is inclined 
to say anything on that occasion, he may, if my executors think fit to 
admit him to it. I would not have any mourning worn for me by any 
of my decsendants, for I shall die in a good old age ; and when the 
Divine Providence calls me hence, I die when I should die, and no 
relation of mine ought to mourn because I do so, but may perhaps 
mourn to pay the shopkeeper for his goods, should they comply 
with what I think the common folly of such an expense.' Smith's 
History of New Jersey, p. 434.

LIFE OF 



and power of argument. In these respects he resembled and 
equalled them, possessing at the same time more genius, 
more eloquence, and a greater versatility of character, than any 
of his predecessors. His mathematical propensity adhered to 
him through life, and was of much service, particularly in his 
financial and mercantile operations. He would amuse him- 
self with rapid calculations in his mind, and the solution of 
arithmetical difficulties, unassisted by figures, and sometimes 
he found occasion for his higher skill in solving practical prob- 
lems in physical science, such as relate to the velocity and 
power of running water, and the motion of machinery. 

When he graduated as bachelor of arts, it fell to his lot to 
pronounce an oration before an audience assembled to wit- 
ness the ceremonies of the day. The city of New York be- 
ing at that time the residence of the Governor and other 
officers of government, as well as of many of the principal 
families of the colony, a college commencement was likely to 
draw together as enlightened and polished an assemblage of 
hearers, as could be collected in any other part of the conti- 
nent, and especially at a time x when public amusements were 
few, and when the college had grown to be an object of con- 
siderable interest, on account of the conflicts of political par- 
ties in which the affairs of that institution had been made to 
mingle. 

In selecting for the exercise of his unfledged powers the 
theme of ' Wit and Beauty,' our youthful orator was actuated 
more perhaps by a spirit of adventurous exeriment common at 
his age, than by the dictates of a mature judgment. Be this 
as it may, he acquitted himself with credit, and won the ap- 
plause of his auditory, both grave and gay, who saw, or imag- 
ined they saw, the fairest promise of the rich fruits of man- 
hood in these buds and blossoms of young fancy and aspiring 
genius in a boy of sixteen. A copy of this performance is 
preserved among his papers. Amidst an exuberance of met- 
aphors and rheto rical flourishes, which usually make so large 
an ingredient in commencement orations, there are not want- 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 7 

ing ideas arid modes of thought, that would have graced a 
maturer intellect. 

The exordium contains an apology for his subject, and is 
adroitly constructed. ' Long had I debated with myself,' he 
begins, ' on what subject to address so learned and polite an 
audience. Pedantically to discuss some knotty point of the 
schools would be, if not disagreeable, at least dry, insipid, and 
uninteresting ; it would be the retailing of other men's opinions, 
and endeavoring to explain what I am little acquainted with to 
those who are well informed. For certainly at a time where 
law shines forth in its meridian glory, and divinity sprouts up 
promiscuously on all sides, no sophisms can darken the light 
of natural equity, nor will our moral duties be obscured or 
unpractised. Endeavoring therefore to place them in a fairer 
light, would be to cast a veil over their perfections. A lighter 
subject may indeed be acceptable to those, who, like myself, 
are in the early spring of life, but with those in whom sober 
autumn has repressed the understanding, blunted the passions, 
and refined the taste, it may not perhaps be so well received. 
Yet when I consider that the lenity and candor of those, to 
whom 1 have the honor of addressing myself, are equal to 
their learning and judgment, I am the more easily incited to 
submit this performance to their mild consideration, and to 
descant upon wit and beauty.' 

Having thus begun, he proceeds to the thread of his dis- 
course, and first of all speaks of the characteristics, power, and 
advantages of wit. This choice gift, is one of Heaven's best 
boons to social man ; it makes the charm of an agreeable com- 
panion, it enlivens conversation, promotes innocent mirth, and 
banishes that sable fiend, melancholy, the restless haunter of 
our inmost thoughts. It is the two-edged sword of the poet 
and moralist. 'It gilds the bitter pill of satire, it entices us to 
read, and compels us to reform. Faults, which escape the 
grasp of justice, and hide behind the bulwarks of the law, 
which, like Proteus, change into a thousand shapes and baffle 
the researches of wisdom, these it strips of their borrowed 



8 LIFE OF 

plumes, and shows in their native deformity. Whilst the 
understanding, in teaching and enforcing the duties of morality, 
fetters vice in a chain of reason, wit boldly rushes on, plies the 
lash, and goads the monster from her den.' But wit is said to 
be capricious, and its darts to be thrown without discrimination 
or mercy. This is a mistake. The instrument is confounded 
with the agent. Wit is harmless, but like every other strong 
weapon, it may be wielded to mischievous ends. Wit is a 
soothing balm, but a malignant temper may convert it into a 
deadly poison. Wit is cheerful, sunny, and serene, but a 
morose spirit may enshroud it in a mantle of darkness, and 
make it an object of terror, and even a source of suffering. 
Such are the abuses of wit, but not its aims and character. 

In touching upon beauty, the second topic of his discourse, 
the young orator is more flightly and less pointed. His pre- 
vailing idea, however, is a good one, that the forms of beauty, 
as they exist in^he physical and moral world, have been the 
chief means of civilizing the human race, and bringing man in- 
to a state of social order and happiness. He is not satisfied 
with the notions of certain theorists on this subject. ' Philo- 
sophers, who find themselves already living in society, say, 
that mankind first entered into it from a sense of their mutual 
wants. But the passions of barbarians must have had too 
great an influence over their understandings to render this pro- 
bable. They, who were in the prime of life, would never 
have been persuaded to labor for such as were passed, or had 
not arrived at that state ; and even if they consented to do it, 
yet the love of liberty, so natural to all, must have prevented 
both old and young from giving up the right of acting as they 
pleased, and from suffering themselves to be controlled by the 
will of another. Besides, reason, unassisted by beauty, would 
never have smoothed away that savage ferocity, which must 
have been an inseparable bar to their union.' 

This doctrine of the power of beauty to subdue the savage 
nature of man admits of wide illustration. In the material 
world all beautiful forms are suited to move the kinder feel-

ings and softer emotions. The heavens with their splendid 
garniture of celestial orbs, the earth clad in -its robe of verdure 
ever varied in the colors and shapes it assumes, the wide blue 
sea reflecting from its tranquil bosom the images of the hea- 
venly hosts, that keep watch over its midnight slumbers, these 
and the myriads of animated semblances of beauty that people 
air, earth, and ocean, are so many sources of enjoyment, and 
so many calls on the gratitude and devotion of man. These 
are the objects of his contemplative thoughts, the themes of 
his musing hours, and where contemplation dwells the pas- 
sions are silent, and the social principle is most easily diffused 
and cultivated. 

As in the theatre of natural existences, so in the world of 
art, the forms of beauty are at once the indications and the 
causes of melioration, refinement, and the social progress. 
What are the fine arts, what are the arts of life, but proofs of 
this position ? What are sculpture, architecture, painting, 
what the thousand varied combinations of taste and elegance, 
which serve for the ornaments and convenience of the social 
state, but so many demonstrations of the same fact ? They 
divest man of his savage attributes, and bring him under the 
influence of his milder nature. Moral beauty comes to the 
same result. Virtue is beautiful, vice deformed ; the one re- 
fines, purifies, expands, elevates ; the other debases and de- 
grades ; the one promotes good faith, order, and tranquillity in 
society ; the other perfidy, misrule, and confusion ; the one is a 
cheerful attendant on happiness, the other is leagued with mis- 
ery. Such is the power of beauty in nature, in art, and the 
soul of man. The speaker does not forget to enlarge on fe- 
male beauty and its all conquering influence, and here he 
draws upon his classical erudition, and the records of history, 
and talks of heroes, and conquerors, and the downfall of em- 
pires, the youthful king of Macedon, and of others, who ' laid 
the spoils of a captive world at beauty's feet.' But enough 
has been said to give some idea of this first effort in the de- 
partments of composition and eloquence, in which he after- 
wards became so successful and eminent. 



10 LIFE OF 

When he left college he lost no time in deliberating on the 
choice of a profession, for he seems to have destined himself 
for the law from the time of his first reflections on the subject. 
His ancestors had gained renown in this career, and it was 
natural, that his inclination should lead him in the same direc- 
tion. He knew, moreover, that his success in life, his fortune 
and fame, his future usefulness and consideration, depended 
on his own efforts. A legacy of two thousand pounds, to be 
paid after his mother's death, was all he had to expect from 
his father's estate. 

Naturally active, sanguine in his temperament, conscious of 
his powers, and not wanting in ambition, he had an early and 
continued confidence in himself, which enabled him to com- 
mand all the resources of his mind, and to convert them on 
any given occasion to the best account. In fact, this self con- 
fidence was one of the remarkable features of his character 
through life, and perhaps its tendency was rather to err on the 
side of boldness and presumption, than on that of timidity and 
reserve. But there are few more enviable qualities of the un- 
derstanding, than the power of ascertaining its own bias and 
strength, and of causing these to unite and co-operate in the 
attainment of a definite object. No man had this power in a 
greater degree than Gouverneur Morris, nor exercised it with 
more skill and effect. He has often been heard to say, that 
in his intercourse with men he never knew the sensation of 
fear or inferiority, of embarrassment or awkwardness. Al- 
though this almost daring self-possession, which never forsook 
him, may at times have deprived his manners of the charm, 
which a becoming diffidence and gentleness of demeanor are 
apt to infuse, yet as a means of advancement in the world, it 
must be allowed, when properly regulated, to take prece- 
dence of every other quality. 

lit; commenced the study of the law soon after he graduat- 
ed as bachelor of arts, and applied himself with assiduity, be- 
coming more and more pleased with his new pursuit as 
he advanced. With a mind naturally given to method, and 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 11 

patient in research, he was not discouraged by the technicali- 
ties, dry details, and multitude of forms, which block up the 
entrance to the temple of legal fame, and which appear so 
formidable to the uninitiated ; on the contrary, he set himself 
resolutely at work to make his way through them by dint of 
perseverance and labor ; and if we may put any faith in tradi- 
tion, and in such evidences as remain on record, as well as the 
declaration of some of his living associates, his success was 
adequate to his determination and industry. He prosecuted 
his studies of the law under the direction of William Smith, 
the historian of New York, at that time an eminent lawyer, 
and afterwards Chief Justice of the province. A close inti- 
macy had subsisted for many years between Mr Smith and his 
family, and the effects of this friendship the young student 
seems fully to have participated. 

While yet a novitiate in the studies of his adopted profes- 
sion, he took his master's degree in the college, and the task 
again devolved upon him to make a new exhibition of his 
talents in another oration. The character of this performance 
is much like that of the first, tinged with youthful extrava- 
gance, dealing in superlatives, breathing soft strains of senti- 
ment, and scattering flowers and fragrance with a prodigal 
liberality, yet there is at bottom a sound basis of thought, and 
throughout the piece a texture of just conceptions and good 
sense, which raises it above the ordinary exercises of a youth 
not yet twenty. His subject was ' Love,' a very good theme, 
one might say, for a sonnet, or a few stanzas from a despairing 
swain, but an odd one for an oration before a grave and learn- 
ed audience, assembled to witness a literary exhibition in a 
university. 

Let it not be imagined, however, that he confines himself to 
any narrow technical sense of that rnagic word. He speaks 
of love as a principle, which pervades all things, separating 
the good from the evil, the bond of social union, the soul of 
friendship, the magnet of sympathy, and the bright and steady 
polestar of the moral world. Within this compass there is no 



12 LIFE OF 

barrenness of topics. The orator treats of the objects and 
uses of love. He descants on love as a religious feeling, on 
benevolence and patriotism, on parental, filial, and connubial 
love, and traces the consequences of this all pervading princi- 
ple on the order of nature and condition of men. 

Let his own words speak for him on one point, the love of 
country. ' It is not a mere something we are unacquainted 
with, that renders our natal soil so peculiarly agreeable, it is 
our friends, our relations, parents, children, laws, religion. 
Aided by the force of these considerations, reason impresses a 
love of country upon the heart of every social being. Nay, 
there is some secret principle within us, some innate tenderness 
for that spot where we first drew our breath, first saw the light, 
the scene of our infant joys, some gentle effusion of divinity 
congenial with the soul, which enforces it far beyond the pow- 
er of reason. This is a universal principle of patriotism con- 
fined by no bounds. It rules in all countries, and in all 
nations. The sons of tyranny acknowledge it; the meanest 
slave has through this, an affection for his country. What 
then must be his love, who has tasted liberty at the fountain, 
who lives under a Constitution dispensing the joys of freedom 
wherever it prevails, who possesses the sacred rights of a 
British subject, rights torn from the heart of tyranny, nourished 
with the best blood of his ancestors, and transmitted to him on 
the point of their swords? A Britain's love of country is fixed 
on the solid basis of freedom. Liberty ! Nurse of heroes ! 
Parent of worth ! Best blessing of society ! Long continue to 
smile upon this happy soil. Grant that my countrymen may 
feel the fulness of thy influence, that they may nobly advance 
under the shadow of thy wings in the pursuit of true glory, rise 
virtuously superior to the ills of fortune, and attain to that 
perfection in attempting to acquire which the Romans failed. 
May they ever be loyal, may they ever be free.' 

We here discover the germs, which grew into strength and 
maturity, as the young orator advanced in years, and particu- 
larly when he was called not long afterwards to put in practice 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 13 

his doctrines at the beginning of the great revolutionary strug- 
gle, throughout which it will appear that he acted a bold, con- 
sistent, and distinguished part. His love of liberty and of 
country remained as ardent as ever, and his loyalty as firm, 
though devoted to a different object. 

Towards the close of the year 1769 the Assembly of New 
York had a project for raising money by issuing bills of credit, 
to be put out on a loan, with the view of appropriating the in- 
terest to the payment of the debts of the colony, and for other 
public exigences. It was understood, that the government in 
England would approve such a bill, if it should pass the colo- 
nial legislature. It was a measure highly acceptable to the 
people, because it would make money more plenty, and they 
looked no farther. Some of the sensible men of the province, 
however, took up the other side of the question, and were op- 
posed to the issuing of a new paper currency, foreseeing no ab- 
solute relief in the scheme, and an increase of embarrassment in 
the end. It would encourage farmers to borrow beyond their 
necessities, and merchants to contract new debts on an artificial 
credit, and the last scene of the drama, whenever it came, 
must be wound up with renewed instances of bankruptcy and 
distress. 

In the midst of the general excitement produced by these 
discussions, young Morris found himself drawn into the cur- 
rent, and though at that time but barely eighteen, he resolved 
to try his hand at the generous task of conveying light to the 
public mind. He wrote anonymously against the bill, and 
deprecated the evil of a paper currency, as no other than a 
mischievous pretence for putting off a day of payment, which 
must come at some time, and which ought to be met prompt- 
ly by substantial funds collected -from the resources of the 
province. 

He went into an elaborate calculation, founded on the exist- 
ing debt of the colony, and the annual amount of exports and im- 
ports, to show the ill effects such a measure would have on trade, 
VOL. i. 2 



14 LirE OF 

and the actual loss that must eventually be sustained, by 
throwing into circulation a paper currency in the manner con- 
templated by the bill. The first fruits of his financial abilities, 
afterwards so eminently developed, are clearly seen in these 
juvenile essays. Among his closing remarks are the following. 
'It is said, that the imported foreign manufactures into 
this colony exceed the exports. If so, what will be our 
situation twenty years hence, should this paper currency take 
effect ? A question may naturally arise here, why are the in- 
habitants of the colony so desirous of having it, if it be so per- 
nicious in its consequences ? The answer is ready, because 
they know not those consequences, because they will not 
know them, because they are in debt, and because, from a 
selfishness they ought to be ashamed of, they would pay their 
debts at the expense of the province. The farmer owes 
money to the merchant, and will be able, if this takes place, 
to pay it by taking up money at interest two per cent cheaper 
than he can now. The merchant, if the farmer pays him, 
can buy bills at an exorbitant price to pay part of his debts 
in Great Britain, and can gain credit to run himself further 
in debt. To make up his loss in sterling bills, he will of 
course raise the price of his sterling manufactures ; and thus, 
that the debtors in this province may clear two per cent on 
the money they owe, the province is to be ruined ; and, that 
the present generation may live in ease, posterity is to be 
involved beyond the probability of redemption. Before this 
happens, may you, my countrymen, be convinced of your 
own interests and steadily pursue them ; may you be induced 
with patience to bear present small evils in preference to 
great ones yet to come ; and may you have the fortitude to 
resist the importunities, and arguments to refute the fallacies, 
of those schemer?, who with specious appearances decoy us 
into ruin ; for however they may gild the pill they persuade 
us to swallow, and whatever show of reason drawn from our 
necessities they may produce to make us swallow it, still 
truths stand uncontroverted, that a multiplied paper currency 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 15 

is a never failing source of national debt, and that there are 
no bounds to national debt but national ruin.' 

In regard to this last remark, it must be remembered, that it 
does not necessarily apply to all kinds of ' paper currency,' 
Itut only to the particular kind which he has been considering, 
that is, certificates of loans issued by the government on the 
strength of its own credit, merely for the purpose of obtaining 
a temporary relief, and on such terms as to afford an undue 
temptation to adventurous borrowers. 

In another paper our young financier takes on himself 
the paftofa legislator, and criticises the forms of the bill, 
and points out with a good deal of acuteness various defects 
and unsound principles, which he conceives it to contain. 
The following extract may serve as a specimen. ' Whether 
former acts,' says he, ' authorize such a method of proceeding 
I cannot tell, but by this the jurisdiction of the supreme court, 
which is according to the rules of the common law, and the 
dictates of common sense, confined within the bounds of the 
colony, is nevertheless by a legislature, whose jurisdiction is 
the same, extended to the trial of felonies therein named, 
though committed in a different province ; which is indeed 
giving, to others what does not belong to themselves ; like that 
little Prince of Italy, who gave away the whole continent of 
America and the richest provinces of Asia to the Kings of 
Spain and Portugal-' 

In October, 1771, Mr Morris was licensed to practise as 
an attorney at law, full three months before he was twenty 
years of age. His financial discussions, and some other 
proofs of his abilities, had made him known to the principal men 
of the province ; and a volunteer address to a jury about the 
time of his being licensed, on some occasion in which the com- 
munity took a deep interest, was represented by the hearers 
as an extraordinary display of eloquence and skilful reasoning 
in so young a man. With the advantages of his family name, 
a fine person, an agreeable elocution, active and industrious 
habits, talents, and ambition, no young man in the province 



16 LIFE OF 

was thought to exhibit a fairer promise of rapid advancement, 
and ultimate eminence in his profession. But Providence 
had destined him to another and a wider sphere. It was his 
fortune to come upon the theatre of action at a time, when 
events of the greatest moment both to his country and to the 
civilized world at large were ripening into maturity, and it was 
likewise his fortune to take a conspicuous part in the accom- 
plishment of those events. For the present, however, his views 
reached no farther than to the limited distinction of a colonial 
lawyer, and his chief aims were to attain an elevated rank in 
the profession of his choice. Bent steadily on this purpose? 
neither his ambition nor his active spirit would allow him to 
neglect any means of qualifying himself for the fullest expan* 
sion and best use of his powers. 

Like most young men he indulged early dreams of foreign 
travel, and scarcely had he completed his professional studies, 
when he began seriously to think of a voyage across the Atlan- 
tic. Curiosity was not his only motive, for his ambition aim- 
ed at higher things than mere amusement or pleasure ; he 
hoped to gather such fruits of experience and knowledge, as 
would be of solid advantage to him in his future career, being 
satisfied that, 

' He cannot be a perfect man, 

Not being tried and tutored in the world.' 

While deliberating on this subject he wrote the follow- 
ing letter to his friend, Mr William Sr ;h, in whom, by 
the free and unreserved manner in which he lays open his 
mind and asks advice, he seems to have had much confi- 
dence. 

February 20th, 1772. 

1 Dear Sir, 

'I have thoughts of sailing for London in the Miller, and I 
beg your sentiments with the same candor, that I deliver my 
own. I shall pay most regard to your advice, because I 
believe it will be dictated by friendship, and founded on a 
more intimate knowledge of me than I possess. 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 17 

' The advantages I expect from a twelve months' sojourn- 
ing in England are shortly these. I hope to form some ac- 
quaintances, that may hereafter be of service to me, to model 
myself after some persons, who cut a figure in the profession 
of the law, to form my manners and address by the example of 
the truly polite, to rub off in the gay circle a few of those ma- 
ny barbarisms, which characterize a provincial education, and 
to curb that vain self sufficiency, which arises from comparing 
ourselves with companions who are inferior to us. As this 
last is the most agreeable, so it is the most dangerous kind of 
flattery, the surest source of vanity, a disease which can be 
cured only by conversing with our superiors in understanding. 

'There are many dangers, which it is alleged attend a 
young man thrown from under his parents' wings upon the 
gay stage of pleasure and dissipation, where a wanton circle 
of delusive joys courts his acquaintance, and an endless varie- 
ty ~.f objects prevents satiety and removes disgust ; and to all 
the trite observations that may be made on this subject in the 
present instance, perhaps it may be added, that I have natur- 
ally a taste for pleasure, and, if it be allowed that I iiave a 
taste for pleasure, it may naturally follow that I shall avoid 
those low pleasures, which abound in as great an exuberance 
on this as on the other side of the Atlantic. As for those 
poignant joys, which are the lot of the affluent, like Tantalus 
I may grasp at them, but they will certainly be out of my 
reach. I might go farther and make my observations more 
particular, but as Lord Bacon told the Commons, with respect 
to his Majesty's power and prerogative, these things are better 
to be imagined by you than expressed by me. 

' I desire, however, that you will consider how much bet- 
ter my time may now be spared than hereafter. I have some- 
how or other been so hurried through the different scenes of 
childhood and youth, that I have still some time left to pause 
before I tread the great stage of life, and you know how much 
our conduct there depends upon the mode of our education. 
After what I have said, it will be needless to add, that my in-

clinatrons have taken part in this debate. However, believe 
me, my doubts and hopes have agreed to make you their ar- 
biter, and there is a rule of submission entered in the court of 
conscience. I am, dear Sir, your friend and servant, 

* GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.' 

To this letter his friend replied as follows. 

'New York, February 25th, 1772. 
' IVly Dear Gouverneur, 

'I take your letter very kindly, and so am bribed on the side 
of your inclination. I could write a long letter in favor of 
your voyage. There are volumes upon the benefits of travel- 
ling. But all the world cannot have these pleasures. To 
some it would be useless to visit distant countries, others it 
would ruin. 

'If you mean to adorn your character, I say, go. But 
considering your time of life, and the country you go to, I 
tremble at every step you are to take. Much depends upon 
your fortune. I have at times repented my confinement to 
these shores. I correct myself again upon reflecting, that if 
my industry had not been incessant, I might have been a beg- 
gar, or compelled to drudge, which is the same thing, in an 
evening hour, while those I sat out with are singing a requiem 
to their souls. 

' Our end is happiness. Without flattery (for I a,n :-crious) 
you can support a reputation in your own country, sufficient to 
add to what you have, both by business, marriage, &,c. Your 
travels will affect the funds you possess, and if they increase 
your knowledge, perhaps they will proportionably abate your 
industry. I foresee it is ;< or never. It o r ' happens that 
we are driven to the choice of one of two tiii. . , when we 
desire both. I dare say you want both a v\ife and an estate. 
You have at least lu-d desires for both. Some take a wife and 
trust to fortune for future prosperity, and they have not been 
disappointed. But how many otherb are in misery, by ventur- 
ing upon this leap ? 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 19 

'Your reason for travelling to make friends puts me in mind 
of what I have said. I suppose you are to return, for what 
American stands a chance on the other side of the water ? 
And what is there on this side worth your acceptance, until 
age has made you indolent, and ostentatious pride gets ti.e 
better of active, and generous, and noble ambition ? 

' I wish you had already shot the Gulph. I fear to persuade 
you to the attempt. Remember your uncle Robin.* He 
saw England thrice. No man had better advantages, either 
from nature or education. He began to figure with 30,000. 
He did not leave 5000. I know others that never saw the 
east side of the great lake, who had no other friends than 
their own heads and their hands, to whom your uncle was 
in bonds. What! Virtus post nummos? Curse on inglori- 
ous wealth. Spare jour indignation. I too detest the igno- 
rant miser. But both virtue and ambition abhor poverty, or 
they are mad. Rather imitate your grandfather,! than your 
uncle. The first sought preferment here, and built upon his 
American stock. The other there, and died the moment 
before the shipwreck. Is it not an Apostle, who warns us 
against the sin that easily besets us ? If this is not inspiration, 
it is good sense. Find out yours. 

' Upon the whole, I must refer you to your mother. She 
must spare a great deal before you can resolve with prudence. 
And when the guineas lay at your feet, think ! think ! think ! 
I love you with great sincerity, or I should not be so much 
puzzled. 

'WILLIAM SMITH.' 

From the tenor of his friend's hints in this letter, (for ad- 
vice it can hardly be called) it is evident that serious obstacles 
stood in the way of his contemplated voyage. Further reflec- 
tion doubtless brought them in a stronger light to his own mind,

and made him contented to abandon his plans, or at least to 
defer the execution of them to a better opportunity. We hear 
no more about them, but find him for the three next years 
closely devoted to his profession, not sitting idly in his office 
wailing for the tide of accident or the special favor of friends 
to bring employment within his doors, but in the steady labor 
of an active and respectable practice. 

One of the important causes in which he was engaged was 
that of a contested election, in Westchester county, where he 
had Mr Jay for an opponent. It involved principles of evi- 
dence, questions about the right of suffrage as then exercised, 
and a complication of facts, local and general, which gave full 
scope for the display of legal knowledge and forensic skill. 
He was also licensed as an attorney in New Jersey. But the 
records of a young lawyer's practice afford slender materials 
for biography. I shall forbear to analyze, as I hav forborne 
to peruse, the bundles of briefs, notes, references, forms, skel- 
etons of arguments, and fragments of opinions, which afford a 
monument of his industry and toil, during this period, as no 
doubt they do of his learning and talents. The following let- 
ter to Mr Penn, of Philadelphia, and his lady, contains matter 
of a different cast, and shows that his mind occasionally made 
excursions beyond the rigid purlieus of the law.

' I am confident you will not attribute my silence to a want 
of respect or regard, for I am sure you have a better opin- 
ion of me than to imagine I should fail in either towards you. 
In good truth, I know of nothing worth your attention. News 
we have not any, at least not more than the gazettes will pro-

many is made the gain of so few, exclaiming with poor Ham- 
let, " What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba?" Religion the 

very word demands respect, and, as B says of his wife, 

" 1 speak of her with reverence." Love as dull as a tale 
twice told. Friendship gone to pay Astraea a visit : her vo- 
taries so few that the world knows them not. Business i 1 
lias so transformed, and transmigrated, and almost transubstan- 
tiated me, as hardly to leave the memory of what I was. But 
you are not a son of care ; smoothly then may your minutes 
flow. May the table of life be spread before you with uncloy- 
ing variety ; and chiefly may you be free from that listless 
vacuity of mind, which admonishes us that man was intended 
for an active being. Pray how does that honest man of ftie 
heroic age, General Lee ? I suppose he gave a loud plaudit 
to the Boston wights. Here follows a word to Mrs Penn. 

' Dear Madam, 

' What a terrible life do I lead. Worse than at Philadel- 
phia. There I was all night up it is true, but it was in com- 
pany, making merry. Here up all night writing, and like his 
grace the Duke of C. " nobody with me but myself." Pity 
it is you are not here balls, concerts, assemblies all of us 
mad in the pursuit of pleasure. Not a pause. Grave phizes 
are grinned out of countenance, prudence kicked out of doors, 
and your sober, solid, sedate friend, (myself meaning) is be- 
come the butt of unfledged witlings. Mr Griffin is here. 
How does your neighbor's family ? Bless us, what a foolish 
question. You live at too great a distance to know. Lady 
Dunmore is here a very elegant woman. She looks, and 
speaks, and moves, and is, a lady. Her daughters are fine, 
sprightly, sweet girls. Goodness of heart flushes from them 
in every look. How is it possible, said that honest soul our 
Governor to me, how is it possible my Lord Dunmore could so 
long deprive himself of those pleasures he must enjoy in such 
a family.? When you see them you will feel the full force of 
this observation.

1 GOUVERNEUR MoRRIS.' 

When the news of the act of Parliament for shutting up the 
port of Boston reached New York from England, it created a 
strong sensation there, as it did throughout America, for al- 
though the bill was intended only to operate against the town of 
Boston, yet it was designed as a punishment to the inhabitants 
of that place, on account of the spirited resistance they had 
made to the oppressive acts of the British government, the prin- 
ciples of which were equally dangerous to the liberties of all 
the colonies. A letter was forthwith despatched by express to 
the Committee of Correspondence in Boston, assuring them 
of the general indignation against this measure, and that a 
meeting of the citizens would be immediately called to give a 
public testimony of their sentiments, and of their determination 
to make common cause with the people of Boston.* The 
meeting was summoned by a public notice, and a large con- 
course assembled. The tories, as the adherents of the Minis- 
try were called, and the moderate men of wealth and charac- 
ter, came to the meeting with the view of counteracting the 
efforts of the warm partizans of opposition, and having pre- 
viously concerted matters together, they expected to give a 
turn to the proceedings suited to their purpose. They had 
even gone so far as to make out the list of a committee, 
who should be appointed to consider the affair of the Boston 
Port Bill, the immediate cause of this commotion. But this 
was discovered by Sears in time to thwart their plans. 
He proposed that no lists should be presented, but that the 
committee should be appointed by nominations on the spot. 
This was carried, and the committee consisted of a nearly

equal number of both parties, but with a preponderance on 
the liberal side.* 

Mr Morris was present at this meeting, and on the next day 
he wrote an account of it to his friend Mr Penn, together with 
some of his own opinions on the political aspect of the times. 

' New York, May 20th, 1774. 

'Dear Sir, 

; You have heard, and you will hear, a great deal about 
politics, and in the heap of chaff you may find some grains of 
good sense. Believe me, Sir, freedom and religion are only 
watch words. We have appointed a Committee, or rather we 
have nominated one. Let me give you the history of it. It 
is needless to premise, that the lower orders of mankind are 
more easily led by specious appearances, than those of a 
more exalted station. This and many similar propositions you 
know better than your humble servant. 

' The troubles in America during Grenville's administration 
put our gentry upon this finesse. They stimulated some dar- 
ing coxcombs to rouse the mob into an attack upon the bounds 
of order and decency. These fellows became the Jack Cades 
of the day, the leadernrin all riots, the belwethers of the flock. 
The reason of the manoeuvre in those, who wished to keep fair 
with government, and at the same time to receive the incense 
of popular applause, you will readily perceive. On the whole, 
the shepherds were not much to blame in a politic point of 
view. The belwethers jingled merrily, and roared out liberty, 
and property, and religion, and a multitude of cant terms, 



* The idea of a general Congress of delegates from all the colonies 
was also brought forward and insisted on. The multitude fell in with 
it, and the ministerialists, finding it in vain to resist the torrent, signi- 
fied their acquiescence. A letter was accordingly written to the Com- 
mittee of Boston on the subject. Although the proposal for a general 
Congress had begun to be talked of by individuals, it is believed that 
this was the first occasion on which it was promulgated by any pub- 
lic assemblage.

which every one thought he understood, and was egregiously 
mistaken. For you must know the shepherds kept the dic- 
tionary of the day, and like the mysteries of the ancient my- 
thology, it was not for profane eyes or ears. This answered 
many purposes ; the simple flock put themselves entirely un- 
der the protection of these most excellent shepherds. By and 
bye behold a great metamorphosis, without the help of Ovid or 
his divinities, but entirely effectuated by two modern genii, the 
god of ambition and the goddess of faction. The first of 
these prompted the shepherds to shear some of their flock, 
and then, in conjunction with the other, converted the bel- 
wethers into shepherds. That we have been in hot water 
with the British Parliament ever since, every body knows. 
Consequently these new shepherds had their hands full of em- 
ployment. The old ones kept themselves least in sight, and a 
want of confidence in each other was not the least evil which 
followed. The port of Boston has been shut up. These 
sheep, simple as they are, cannot be gulled as heretofore. In 
short, there is no ruling them ; and now, to leave the metaphor, 
the heads of the mobility grow dangerous to the gentry, and 
how to keep them down is the question^ While they corres- 
pond with the other colonies, call and dismiss popular assem- 
blies, make resolves to bind the consciences of the rest of 
mankind, bully poor printers, and exert with full force all their 
other tribunitial powers, it is impossible to curb them. 

' But art sometimes goes farther than force, and therefore to 
trick them handsomely a committee of patricians was to be 
nominated, and into their hands was to be committed [he maj- 
esty of the people, and the highest trust was to be reposed in 
them by a mandate, that they should take care, quod respub- 
lica non capiat injuriam. The tribunes, through want of a 
good legerdemain in the senatorial order, perceived the fi- 
nesse, and yesterday I was present at a grand division of the 
city, and there I beheld my fellow citizens very accurately 
counting all tru'ir chickens, not only before any of them were 
hatched, but before above one half of the eggs were laid. In

short, they fairly contended about the future forms of our gov- 
ernment, whether it should be founded upon Aristocratic or 
Democratic principles. 

' I stood in the balcony, and on my right hand were ranged 
all the people of property, with some few poor dependants, 
and on the other all the tradesmen, &c. who thought it worth 
their while to leave daily labor for the good of the country. The 
spirit of the English Constitution has yet a little influence left, 
and but a little. The remains of it, however, will give the 
wealthy people a superiority this time, but would they secure 
it, they must banish all schoolmasterSj^and confine all knowl- 
edge to themselves. This cannot be. The mob begin to 
think and to reason. Poor reptiles ! it is with them a vernal 
morning, they are struggling to cast off their winter's slough, 
they bask in the sunshine, and ere noon they will bite, depend 
upon it. The gentry begin to fear this. Their committee will 
be appointed, they will deceive the people, and again forfeit a 
share of their confidence. And if these instances of what 
with one side is policy, with the other perfidy, shall continue 
to increase, and become more frequent, farewell aristocracy. 
I see, and I see it with fear and trembling, that if the disputes 
with Britain continue, we shall be under the worst of all possi- 
ble dominions. We shall be under the domination of a riot- 
ous mob. 

' It is the interest of all men, therefore, to seek for reunion 
with the parent state. A safe compact seems in my poor 
opinion to be now tendered. Internal taxation to be left with 
ourselves. The right of regulating trade to be vested in Brit- 
ain, where alone is found the power of protecting it. I trust 
you will agree with me, that this is the only possible mode of 
union. Men by nature are free as the air. When they enter 
into society, there is, there must be, an implied compact, for 
there never yet was an express one, that a part of this freedom 
shall be given up for the security of the remainder. But. what 
part? The answer is plain. The least possible, considering 
the circumstances of the society, which constitute what may 

VOL. I. 3 



26 LIFE or 

be called its political necessity. And what does this political 
necessity require in the present instance ? Not that Britain 
should lay imposts upon us for the support of government, nor 
for its defence. Not that she should regulate our internal po- 
lice. These things affect us only. She can have no right to 
interfere. To these things we ourselves are competent. But 
can it be said, that we are competent to the regulating of 
trade ? The position is absurd, for this affects every part of 
the British Empire, every part of the habitable earth. If 
Great Britain, if Ireland, if America, if all of them, are to 
make laws of trade, there must be a collision of these different 
authorities, and then who is to decide the v is major ? To 
recur to this, if possible to be avoided, is the greatest of all 
great absurdities. 

' Political necessity therefore requires, that this power 
should be placed in the hands of one part of the empire. Is 
it a question which part ? Let me answer by asking another. 
Pray which part of the empire protects trade ? Which part 
of the empire receives almost immense sums to guard the 
rest ? And what danger is in the trust ? Some men object, 
that England will draw all the profits of our trade into her 
coffers. All that she can, undoubtedly. But unless a rea- 
sonable compensation for his trouble be left to the merchant 
here, she destroys the trade, and then she will receive no 
profit from it. 

' If I remember, in one of those kind letters with which you 
have hbnored me, you desire my thoughts on matters as they 
rise. How much pleasure I take in complying with your re- 
quests let my present letter convince you. If I am faulty in 
telling things, which you know better than I do, you must ex- 
cuse this fault, and a thousand others for which I can make no 
apology. I am, Sir, &c. 

' GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.' 

In another paper written about the same time, he under- 
takes to state on what terms he supposes a reconciliation be- 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 27 

tween the mother country and the colonies might be effected. 
He thinks ' taxation 7 the chief bar, and that in everything else 
the colonies would be willing to yield a supremacy, reserving at 
the same time to their own legislatures the disposal of the sums 
levied within them respectively for the regulation of trade, du- 
ties, and customs. ' What will the Americans accept ? To 
answer this question, let the state of the two countries be con- 
sidered. I build on three facts ; first, that reunion between the 
two is essential to both, I say essential; secondly, that in every 
state there must be of necessity one legislature, which is su- 
preme ; thirdly, that in every society the members have an 
antecedent right to the utmost liberty, which can be enjoyed 
consistent with the general safety. Is taxation an unalienable 
branch of the supreme legislature? Reason and experience 
both tell us that it is not. The King of France might invest 
his parliaments with this right, and yet be supreme in every 
other instance. In all governments there must be trust some- 
where, and there would be no temptation to tyrannize, I be- 
lieve, when the right of taxation is ceded. Nor will I men- 
tion the dernier resort, because I think government should be 
founded on stationary and not revolutionary principles.' 

He mentions also a plan of ' uniting the whole continent in 
one grand legislature,' and thinks such a scheme would be for- 
tunate, if practicable, but he looks upon it as hopeless, both 
from the opposition which would be made to it by persons al- 
ready in power on the one hand, and by the Americans on 
the other, since its tendency would be to give greater influence 
to the crown, diminish the importance of each colony, and 
restrain the democratic spirit, which the constitutions and 
local circumstances of the country had so long fostered in the 
minds of the people.

CHAPTER II. 

POLITICAL STATE OF THE AMERICAN COLONIES AT THE OPENING OF THE 

REVol.t TIO.N. ORGANIZATION OF THE FIRST FORMS OF GOVERNMENT. 

COMMITTEES OF THE PEOPLE. FIRST PROVINCIAL CONVENTION AND CON- 

- OF NEW YORK. MODES OF ELECTION. PART TAKEN BY MR MOR- 
RIS IN THE FIRST'CONGRESS. ASPECT OF POLITICAL OPINIONS IN THE 
CONGRESS AND IN THE COLONY. MEANS OF RAISING MONEY. MR 
MORRIS'S PLAN. 

WE are now coming to a period in Mr Morris's life, when 
we can begin to trace his progress with more distinctness and 
precision. The great event of a final separation between 
the British government and the colonies was now approaching, 
and lie was destined to act a commanding part in the drama 
that followed. We have found him writing to his friend, that 
he 'disliked politics,' little anticipating probably that this dis- 
like would be so soon conquered, and that a large portion of 
his future life would be passed amidst the most stirring scenes 
of political change and excitement. Whatever may have been 
the impressions of his youth, or the bias of his opinions in the 
incipient stages of the threatening storm, he betrayed no hesi- 
tancy when the crisis carne, but united promptly and cordial- 
ly with the supporters of his country's claims, and from that 
moment to the end of the contest he stood in the front ranks of 
those most distinguished for their patriotism, fortitude, and 
constancy. 

The American colonies, during the three first years of the 
revolution, presented a phenomenon in the political world, of 
which there is no example in the history of nations. Twelve 
governments, which had hitherto existed independent of each 
other, and ;iiike subordinate to a superior power, all at once 
and as if by common consent, threw off their alle giance totha 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 29 

power, and assumed to themselves the perilous task of self 
government, at the fearful hazard of distraction and anarchy 
among themselves, and of receiving on their heads the weight 
of vengeance prepared by their former masters, as a punish- 
ment of their disobedience and revolt. No condition of hu- 
man affairs could be more critical or alarming. The social 
and political compact was absolutely resolved into its first ele- 
ments, and it remained with each individual in these wide 
spread communities to determine in what manner, and on 
what terms, he would consent to renew this compact, and 
what sacrifices he would make of his private interests and 
personal independence for the general good. 

The marvellous success, which attended the experiment of 
erecting a new fabric, and the union of feeling and effort, 
which contributed to its strength and durability, can only be 
accounted for by the fact, that the sense of wrong was univer- 
sally felt, that the burden of oppression rested heavily upon all, 
and that common suffering and danger kindled a spirit of uni- 
ted resolution, which, from whatever motive it might first orig- 
inate, rose speedily to the lofty tone of self denial and patriot- 
ism. But however we may explain causes, the results will 
not be the less extraordinary, and the formation of the 
American Republics must ever be a theme of wonder to those, 
who judge of social organizations by the annals of past expe- 
rience, and in all future time it must constitute a novel chapter 
in the history of mankind. 

This is not the place to unfold the principles, or state the 
facts, by which events so remarkable were brought to pass. 
As the subject of this memoir, however, was a prominent act- 
or in the revolutionary movements, which gave rise to these 
events, I shall not be thought to wander from the province of 
biography, if I introduce such a view of particulars, and such 
a train of observations, as will conduct the reader to a just es- 
timate of the part he sustained. Mr Morris was a member of 
the first Provincial Congress of New York, which was con- 
vened in the spring of 1775, and he continued a member of 
3* 



30 MFE OF 

that body under its various names, of Congress, Convention, 
and Committee of Safety, with the exception of a short period, 
for nearly three years, till he went to the Continental Congress. 
Some preliminary remarks are requisite to explain the basis, 
on which this new representative government of New York 
was founded. 

And here it must be kept in mind, that wherever the power 
of Great Britain was thrown off or disavowed, all political con- 
trol passed by its natural course into the hands of the people. 
No man, or body of men, had authority to command any other 
body of men or individual; equality of rights produced an 
equality of condition ; and the structure of government could 
only be raised on the strength of powers delegated anew to 
certain persons, for tbis special purpose, by the willing voice of 
the people, whom circumstances had made the sole arbiters of 
their own political destiny. Hence the primary movement 
was to bring the people to understand their interests and act 
in concert, and the first means used to attain this end was the 
establishment of Committees of Correspondence in different 
parts of the country. These committees were chosen by 
the people in towns, counties, parishes, districts, or smaller 
neighborhoods. They were entrusted with certain powers, 
which enabled them to correspond with each other, and to 
represent in some sort the political views and objects of their 
constituents. So necessary was this system in itself, and so 
well adapted to promote the general welfare, that it was 
acceded to everywhere, and in a short time committees were 
so universally appointed throughout the colonies, that the 
friends of liberty had speedy and direct channels open with 
each other in every part of the continent. This increased 
their mutual intelligence, gave them confidence and encour- 
agement, harmonized their sentiments, and sowed the seeds of 
union. 

But these committees in many instances had a more impor- 
tant, trust and that was the power of electing deputies to 
meet the deputies of other committees for the purpose of 



GOUVERNEUR MOKRIS. 31 

consulting on matters, which concerned them in common. 
This power was delegated to them by the people when they 
were chosen, and in the Middle and Southern colonies it was 
exercised on numerous occasions. In the New England 
colonies the committees possessed extensive powers, hut these 
did not extend to elections, which were held by the people at 
large in towns, according to the old method.* 

The delegates to the first Continental Congress were chosen 
in different ways. In Massachusetts and some other colonies 
they were appointed by the regular Assemblies, apparently 
without any specific powers for this object from the people, 



* In Massachusetts at first there were commonly three committees 
chosen in each town; 1. A Committee of Correspondence; 2. A 
Committee of Inspection; <5. A Committee of Safety. 

It was the business of the first committee to to forward intelligence, 
apprize the community of danger, and concert measures of public 
good. The second was employed to take cognizance of the imports of 
goods into town aud country, to pi event the sale of tea, to detect and 
expose the violation of the non-importation agreement, and the 
association. The third was a kind of executive body, whose duty it 
was to watch over the safety of the community, the internal police, 
and the welfare of society, at a time when law was prostrate, and 
there was no remedy against disorder and confusion. All these 
committees were empowered to take up persons suspected of hostile 
sentiments to the liberties of the country. 

In February, 1776, the General Court of Massachusetts resolved, 
that these committees should be united into one, called the Committee 
of Correspondence, Inspection, and Safety, and chosen annually by the 
towns. This commitcee possessed all the powers of the other three, 
and was authorized in addition to execute the resolves, directions, and 
recommendations of the legislature, or rather to see that no one violat- 
ed them, giving notice to higher powers when such violation in any 
extraordinary case occurred. The charge of confiscated property 
was also entrusted to this committee. They had power to send for 
persons and papers, to call together the military force of the town, 
to take charge of prisoners of war, and carry laws against lories into 
effect. 

These committees were generally obeyed, but sometimes there was 
an appeal from their decision to the legislature. 



32 LIFE OF 

although it was well known that they acted in accordance with 
the popular voice. In other colonies the delegates were 
chosen by a convention of committees, elected by the people 
for this specified purpose. And again they were chosen by 
committees in their individual capacities, as in New York, 
where the committee of the city and county of New York 
first chose a certain number of deputies, and the same appoint- 
ments were afterwards approved by the other committees in 
the colony. 

But in every method of election, whether to offices of a 
higher or lower rank, the principle was the same. The lead- 
ers were cautious, that the power should actually and visibly 
come from the people, and it is not likely, that in a single 
elective body on the continent there was an instance of a 
member's taking his seat, without exhibiting^ a well authenti- 
cated certificate that he was duly chosen. To this careful 
attention to the rights of the people, this seeming endeavor to 
cause all the first springs of government to proceed from 
them, may be ascribed, more than to any other reason, their 
confidence in the rulers of their choice, and their invariable 
submission to their decrees. In this respect the wisdom of 
the governors and the moderation of the governed are equally 
worthy of admiration, and whoever would search for the cause 
of the singular unanimity, which prevailed in the sentiments 
and acts of the nation, when all the world, influenced by the 
example of history, was looking for discord and dissolution, 
will find it in this judicious, uniform, and systematic manage- 
ment of the elections, from the first moment that all power was 
acknowledged to have reverted to its original possessors the 
people, till a solid form of government was established. And 
we may probably go further and say, that it is to the security 
given by this form to the elective franchise, and the well bal- 
lanced principles by which it is regulated, that we owe its 
present stability and successful operation. Put this in dan- 
ger, or derange, or curtail it, and we should soon experience the 
fate of other republics, whether ancient or modern, and sink

either under the corruption of the few, or the licentiousness of 
the many, or both combined. 

The first Provincial Convention of New York assembled in 
the city of New York on the twentieth of April, 1775, and 
continued its sittings three days. It consisted of forty-three 
members, elected from the different counties, and empowered 
only to choose delegates to the second continental Congress, 
which was to convene in May. Having executed this trust 
the Convention was dissolved. The old colonial Assembly had 
been in session during the winter, and adjourned on the third 
of April, never to meet again. Several attempts were made 
in it to bring up the subject of the Continental Congress, to 
approve their proceedings, and appoint new deputies. All 
these attempts failed, for though there were several friends of 
the new order of things in the Assembly, yet the majority 
were royalists, and refused to sanction in any manner whatever 
the movements of ilie people. When this experiment had 
been fairly tried in the Assembly without success, the com- 
mittee of the city of New York sent circulars to the other 
committees, advising a deputation of delegates in Convention, 
who met as above stated. 

These delegates, or deputies, were chosen in the city of 
New York by ward meetings ; in some of the other counties 
by the committees of correspondence ; in others, by a con- 
vention of committees chosen in different parts of the county ; 
in others again the several towns chose each a delegate ; in 
Orange county they were chosen by the freeholders after the 
manner of the old elections.* Each member produced in 



* In Westchester county several gentlemen, to whom circulars had 
been sent, met at the White Plains. They there agreed to send letters 
to the principal freeholders in the county, recommending a general 
meeting of the freeholders to take the sense of the people on the expe- 
diency of sending deputies to a Convention for choosing delegates to 
the Continental Congress, requesting each person to whom a circulai 
was written to notify all the freeholders in his district to meet at the 



34 LIFE OF 

the Convention a certificate of his election. In New York 
the certificate was signed by the vestrymen of the wards ; in 
other cases by the chairmen of committees, moderators and 
clerks of town meetings, or by judges and justices. 

The day after this Convention separated, that is, on the 
twenty-third of April, the news of the battle at Lexington 
reached New York, and created there, as in every other part 
of the country, the strongest agitation in the minds of the peo- 
ple. The ensigns of war had been unfurled, the blood of 
innocent citizens shed, and indignation for so wanton an out- 
rage, mingled with alarming apprehensions for the future, 
roused the public feeling to the highest pitch of excitement. 
The committee of New York city convened, and resolved 
that a Provincial Congress ought speedily to be assembled, 
who should take into their hands the government of the colo- 
ny, prepare for defence against hostile invasion, and provide 
for the exigencies of the time. A circular letter was des- 
patched to the several committees in the colony, recommend- 
ing an election of delegates to meet in a Provincial Congress. 
to consider and execute such measures, as might be essential 
to the common safety. ' The distressed and alarming situation 
of our country,' say the committee, ' occasioned by sanguin- 
ary measures adopted by the British Ministry, to enforce 
which, the sword has been actually drawn against our breth- 



White Plains on a specified day. They met accordingly, and chose 
their deputies. But there were present at the meeting, as the records 
affirm, ' an inconsiderable number of persons, who declared that they 
would not join in the business of the day, nor have anything to do 
with deputies and congresses, but that they came there for the sole 
purpose of protesting against such illegal and unconstitutional pro- 
ceedings.' 

There were many loyalists in Westchester county, and those who 
took this mode of protesting were perhaps prompted to it, by the man- 
ner in which the circular to the freeholders was worded, in which it 
was declared, ' that they who did not appear and vote on that day 
would be presumed to acquiesce in the sentiments of the majority of 
those who should vote.' 



GOUVEKNEUR MORRIS 35 

ren in Massachusetts, threatening to involve this continent in 
all the horrors of a civil war, obliges us to call for the united 
aid and counsel of the colony at this dangerous crisis.' 

T.he committee at the same time drew up a paper in the 
form of an association, to be signed by the inhabitants at large, 
in which, after declaring themselves ' persuaded, that the sal- 
vation of the rights and liberties of America depend, under 
God, on the firm union of its inhabitants in a vigorous prose- 
cution of the measures necessary for its safety, and convinced 
of the necessity of preventing the anarchy and confusion, which 
attend a dissolution of the powers of government,' they re- 
solve ' in the most solemn manner never to become slaves, 
and to associate, under all the ties of religion, honor, and love 
to their country, to adopt and endeavor to carry into execution 
whatever measures may be recommended by the Continental 
Congress, or resolved upon by the Provincial Convention, for 
the purpose of preserving their constitution, and opposing the 
execution of the several arbitrary and oppressive acts of the 
British Parliament, until a reconciliation between Great Britain 
and America, on constitutional principles, which is most ar- 
dently desired, can be obtained.' Thus stimulated there was 
no delay with the committees in appointing delegates to the 
proposed Congress, and'they met in New York on the 22d of 
May. The mode of election was nearly the same as in the 
preceding Convention. Eighty-one members were returned, 
of whom about seventy attended. Among this number were 
Richard Montgomery of Dutchess country, afterwards the im- 
mortal hero of Quebec, and Gouverneur Morris, elected from 
the county of Westchester. Thus in three weeks from the 
time when the circular letters were written from New York, 
the elections had been completed, and the members were all 
at their post. 

The first act of the Congress, after organizing themselves, 
was to decide on their rules of proceeding. The most impor- 
tant of these was the plan of voting, which they adopted. It 
was agreed that all questions should be determined by a ma- 



36 LIFE OF 

jority of the votes of the counties represented, and that the 
votes of the city and county of New York should be consid- 
ered as four, the city and county of Albany three, and each 
of the other counties two. This scheme was adopted' on 
the principle, that each county should vote nearly in the ratio 
of its comparative importance, in regard to its populatiou 
and wealth. Had the representation been perfect, then a vote 
from each member would have produced the same result, but 
since there was no limit to the number of members from each 
county, this mode of voting was the only one, which could 
approach to an equitable standard. 

A similar method, and for similar reasons, was pursued in 
the Continental Congress, even till the new Constitution was 
adopted. The ratio there, however, was less equitable than in 
the case of New York, because each State, whether large or 
small, had but a single vote, without any reference to its con- 
sequence in the scale of the Union as estimated by extent, 
population, and property. Much was said in those days, as 
in times more recent, about state rights and state sovereign- 
ty, and this indulgence to the small States, of being on a par 
in the national councils with the large ones, was considered by 
them as a recognition of their sovereignty, and hard was their 
struggle in parting with this token of supremacy by the organ- 
ization of the House of Representatives on its present footing. 
The happy device of preserving a similitude of the same fea- 
ture in the Senate procured a tardy acquiescence, but time 
only has completed the work of reconciliation. 

When the Provincial Congress was organized, a motion was 
made, seconded by Gouverneur Morris, leading to a resolu- 
tion that implicit obedience ought to be rendered to the Conti- 
nental Congress, in all matters pertaining to the general regu- 
lation of the associated colonies. But the tone of the new as- 
sembly was more fully discovered, when it was moved to pass 
a vote approving the proceeding* of the late Continental Con- 
gress. The motion was debated, and at length deferred for 
future consideration. From this result it was evident, that 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 37 

there was a wavering spirit if not a decided tory interest in 
the Assembly. 

At this stage of affairs very few persons anywhere, and 
perhaps none in New York, contemplated a separation from 
the mother country. A redress of grievances, on such terms 
as should restore and secure the rights and liberties of Ameri- 
ca, was all that was looked for, even by the most zealous of 
those engaged in concerting measures of resistance against the 
oppressive acts of the British Parliament. A few keen sight- 
ed men, who had watched the course of events more critical- 
ly, it may be, had other views, and were prepared from the 
beginning to go all lengths, believing the hazard to be war- 
ranted by the chance of success. If there were any such, 
their number was small, and they deemed it prudent not to 
make a public display of the tokens of their presentiments and 
hopes. 

At the beginning of the revolution, and perhaps throughout 
the contest, the British had more friends in the colony of New 
York, than in any other part of the continent. This may be 
ascribed to several causes. In the first place, there was a 
large number of landed proprietors and wealthy families, who 
naturally felt a greater security for their property under an es- 
tablished order of things, than could be expected in the com- 
motions and risks of a change. Again, the Johnsons, father 
and sons, who had dwelt for many years as Indian agents on 
the fontiers, and were noted for their loyalty, possessed a strong 
influence over the inhabitants of those regions, and for some 
time after the troubles commenced, the people west of Albany 
were much infected with tory principles and tendencies. 
Long Island, Staten Island, and even the city of New York 
and the banks of the Hudson below the Highlands, were so 
much exposed to hostile attacks in case of war, and so little 
capable of defence, that the common dictates of nature would 
incline the people to the safer side, and make them tardy in 
throwing off allegiance to a power, whose effects they could 
neither resist nor escape.

But notwithstanding the tone of sentiment, which we have 
seen to prevail in this first Provincial Congress, the members 
agreed, as it would seem by a unanimous vote, to subscribe the 
Association, and they recommended the same to all the county 
committees and their constituents. They likewise instructed 
the committees to return to the Congress the names of all 
persons, who should neglect or refuse to sign the Association ; 
but at the same time they added, that no coercive steps ought 
to be used, as the propriety of the measure, the example of the 
other colonies, and the necessity of union, were presumed to 
be sufficient arguments. 

Among the first subjects of deliberation in the Congress 
was the means of raising money to defray the expense of mil- 
itary preparations, and other arrangements, for separate gov- 
ernment and defence. Mr Morris was one of the committee 
for devising a plan, and it is understood that an able and elab- 
orate report presented by them to the Congress was from his 
pen. The report sets out with the position, that the crisis of 
affairs demanded an extraordinary supply of money from 
some quarter, and that this supply could not be raised by tax- 
ation. An emission of a paper currency, therefore, opened 
the only way of meeting the difficulty, and the question to be 
settled was. in what manner this could most easily be effected. 
After a series of remarks on the pecuniary condition and re- 
sources of the colony, and the general operations of a paper 
medium, three methods are suggested in the report, by which 
sucli a currency might be put in circulation. 

' First, that every colony should strike for itself the sum ap- 
portioned by the Continental Congress. 

1 Secondly, that the Continental Congress should strike the 
whole sum necessary, and each colony become bound to sink 
its proportionable part ; or, 

' Thirdly, that the Continental Congress should strike the 
whole sum, and apportion the several shares to the different 
colonies, each colony becoming bound to discharge its own 
particular part, and all the colonies to discharge the part, which 
any particular colony shall be unable to pay.' 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 39 

These several methods were examined, their respective ad- 
vantages compared, and the committee decided in favor of 
the last, as 'giving a more certain credit to the currency, secur- 
ing a wider circulation, and presenting a new bond of union to 
the associated colonies, by creating a common interest in the 
property of the circulating medium, and a common responsi- 
bility for its final redemption. The report was throughout 
patriotic, founded on liberal views of the great cause in which 
the friends of liberty in every part of America were engaged, 
and tinged with no local partialities inconsistent with the good 
of the whole. 

When it was read and received, a day was fixed for its 
being resumed, and on motion of Mr Morris it was agreed, that 
the doors should be open on that day, and the merchants and 
others of the city and colony invited to attend and hear the 
debates. It was discussed accordingly in presence of a throng- 
ed audience, and Mr Morris's speech on that occasion was 
listened to with admiration, and looked upon as an extraordi- 
nary display of argument and eloquence in a young man of 
twenty-three. The knowledge he manifested of a most intri- 
cate subject, which is seldom mastered by years of experience, 
the force of his reasoning, the ingenuity of his illustrations, a 
manner at once dignified and persuasive, an elocution smooth 
and unembarrassed, confidence in his own powers, and a 
deep sense of the importance of his subject, all these con- 
spired to quicken his energies and strengthen his efforts, till 
he found his way to the hearts of his hearers, and carried 
captive their understandings. It was a day of glory and aus- 
picious moment to the young orator, long remembered and 
treasured up in the minds of the people, as a precursor of fu- 
ture success and eminence.* 



* Judge Benson has written a short sketch of the character of 
Gouverneur Morris, from which the following passage is taken. ' The 
subject, which more than any other occupied the Provincial Congress 
in 1775, was a paper currency, our only money sinew of war, Mr Mor-

The report was adopted without amendment or change, 
an'd ordered to be forwarded to the delegates of the colony 
in the Continental Congress, with a letter drafted by the com- 
mittee of correspondence.* It was left to the discretion of 
the delegates, who were desired to introduce such parts of it 
to the notice of Congress, as they should think advisable. It 
should moreover be kept in mind, that this discussion oc- 
curred some weeks before the subject was taken up by the 
Continental Congress, and it is but fair to presume, that 
the hints contained in the New York report, and commu- 
nicated through the delegates of that colony, operated as 
important aids in arranging the plan, which was afterwards 
adopted by the representatives of the nation, and which 
agreed in its main features with the suggestions of the report. 



ris appeared to have comprehended it throughout, and as it were by 
intuition. He advanced and maintained opinions new to all. There 
was none who did not ultimately perceive and acknowledge them to 
be just. They have since become familiar.' Judge Benson was at 
that day a contemporary with Mr Morris, and an ardent associate in 
the same general cause. He had been a member of the Convention 
then lately held for selecting delegates to the Continental Congress. 
* Soon after the meeting of the Provincial Congress, a Committee 
of Correspondence was appointed, of whom Mr Morris was chairman. 
It was their duty to take charge of letters received from other public 
bodies and individuals, and draft replies, as well as to write letters 
originating in the Congress.

HARDLY had the Provincial Congress convened, when in- 
telligence was received of threatened troubles with the Tndi- 

O 

ans on the frontiers, through the influence of Colonel Guy 
Johnson, superintendent of Indian Affairs, who resided in Try- 
on county. He wrote a letter to the mayor and corporation 
of Albany, which was forwarded to the Congress in New 
York, and in which he utters both complaints and threaten- 
ings. ' As the peace and happiness of the country,' he ob- 
serves, ' are objects that every good man should have at 
heart, I think it highly necessary to acquaint you, that for a 
few days I have been put to the great trouble and expense of 
fortifying my house, and keeping a large body of men for the 
defence of my person, having received repeated accounts that 
either the New Englanders, or some persons in or about the 
city of Albany, or town of Schenectady, are coming up to 
seize and imprison me, on a ridiculous and malicious report, 
that I intend to make the Indians destroy the inhabitants, or to 
that effect.' And then, after mentioning the absurdity of this 
report, and the pains he had taken to quiet the Indians, and 
preserve tranquillity on certain occasions, he adds; 'In dis- 
charging this duty I likewise essentially served the public, but 
should I neglect mvself, and be tamely made prisoner, it is

42 LIFE OF 

clear to all who know anything of the Indians, that they will 
not sit still and see their council fire extinguished, and their 
superintendent driven from his duty, but will come upon the 
frontiers in revenge with a power sufficient to commit horrid 
devastations.' He closes his letter by requesting, that such 
measures may be taken by the proper authorities as will re- 
move suspicions, and leave him to the honest exercise of his 
office, without the necessity of keeping armed men around 
him for his protection. 

To this letter the Congress replied as follows, on the third 
of June. 

' At a time when the American subjects on this extensive 
continent are almost with one voice and united effort nobly 
exerting themselves in the glorious cause of liberty, and en- 
deavoring to reconcile the unnatural and unhappy differences 
between the parent state and these colonies, upon permanent 
and constitutional principles, we cannot help lamenting that 
we have received disagreeable accounts from your quarter, 
that there are individuals officiously interrupting the mode and 
measures conceived necessary to bring about these salutary 
purposes. 

' On the one hand, you may depend upon it, that we shall 
discourage and discountenance every attempt against your 
person and property, and shall use our utmost endeavors to 
render them safe and eecure ; but on the other hand, we ex- 
pect you will not counteract any of the measures expedient for 
the common weal recommended by the Continental or Provin- 
cial Congress, or by the committees formed or to be formed. 
Should you take so unfriendly a part, we cannot answer for 
the consequences ; on the contrary, if you and our Indian 
brethren do not interfere in this controversy, you may promise 
yourselves all the protection that this House can afford you. 
The dispute is become so serious now, that we cannot silently 
permit our plans to be frustrated by our own countrymen.' 

It does not appear, that any attempts were made by an 
armed force to seize or molest the superintendent, and his 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 43 

fears, mingled perhaps with some slight chidings of conscience 
on his part, that he had been over zealous in what he called 
his official duty, were the only grounds of his alarm. The 
part he chose to take with the Indians, is shown in a letter 
from the Reverend Samuel Kirkland to the committee of 
Albany, dated at Cherry Valley, on the ninth of June. Mr 
Kirkland had been for many years a laborious and faithful 
missionary among the Oneida Indians, understood their lan- 
guage and character perfectly, and was greatly beloved by them. 

' I am much embarrassed,' says he, ' at present. You have 
doubtless heard that Colonel Johnson has orders from govern- 
ment to remove the dissenting missionaries from the Six Na- 
tions, till the difficulties between Great Britain and the colo- 
nies are settled ; in consequence of which he has forbidden my 
return to my people at Oneida. He has since given encour- 
agement, that I may revisit them after the Congress is closed ; 
but to be plain, I have no dependance at all on his promises 
of this kind. He appears unreasonably jealous of me, and has 
forbidden my speaking a word to the Indians, and threatened 
me with confinement if I transgress. All he has against me I 
suppose to be a suspicion, that I have interpreted to the 
Indians the doings of the Continental Congress, which has 
undeceived them, and too much opened their eyes for Colonel 
Johnson's purposes. I confess to you, gentlemen, that I 
have been guilty of this, if it be a transgression. The Indians 
found out that I had received the abstracts of said Congress, 
and insisted upon knowing the contents. I. could not deny 
them, notwithstanding my cloth, though in all other respects I 
have been extremely cautious not to meddle in matters of a 
political nature. 1 apprehend that my interpreting the doings 
of the Congress to a number of their sachems has done more 
real good to the cause of the country, or the cause of truth and 
justice, than five hundred pounds in presents would have 
effected.' 

About the same time the New York Congress received 
a letter from the Provincial Congress of South Carolina, 



44 LIFE OF 

signed by William Henry Drayton, Arthur Middleton, Charles 
Cotesworth Pinckney and others, enclosing a curious intercept- 
ed letter from General Gage to Governor Martin of North 
Carolina. ' We are to thank you,' say the above gentlemen, 
' for your intelligence of the fifth ultimo, and do most heartily 
congratulate you upon that proper spirit, which now appears 
in your colony. The apprehension of a defection in you, 
which we are happy to find was unjustly formed, occasioned 
in us, and must undoubtedly have given to all America, inex- 
pressible anxiety, and at the same time have encouraged the 
Ministry to proceed in their measures, as a proof of the confi- 
dence, which our enemies placed in you.' The intercepted let- 
ter from General Gage to Governor Martin was dated at Bos- 
ton, April twelfth, that is, six days before the affair at Lexing- 
ton, and was in the words following. 
'Sir, 

' Your letter of the IGih of March I have had the pleasure 
to receive, and am glad to hear that many of the people 
in your province are beginning to find they have been misled, 
and thai they seem inclined to disengage themselves from the 
arbitrary power of the Continental Congress, and of their 
committees. I wish I could say as much for the people of 
this province, who are more cool than they were, but their 
leaders, by their arts and artifices, still keep up that seditious 
and licentious spirit, that has led them on all occasions to op- 
pose government, and even to acts of rebellion. The late ac- 
counts from England have embarrassed their councils much. 
They have applied to the New England governments, and 
doubtless will to those at the southward, to assist them, hut I 
hope the madness of the latter is wearing off, and that they 
will set no encouragement from thence. 

'This province has some time been, and now is, in the new- 
I legislature, termed a Provincial Congress, who seem 
to have taken the government into their hands. What they 
intend to do I cannot pretend to say, but they are much puz- 
zled how to act. Fear in some, anil a want of inclination 



GOCVERNEUR MORRIS. 45 

in others, will be a great bar to their coming to extremities, 
though their leaders use every measure to bring them into the 
field. I have the honor to be, &c. 

' THOMAS GAGE.' 

There is not probably on record a more remarkable 
document than this letter, as showing to what degree the 
British rulers in this country were ignorant of the state of 
opinion among the people, and the spirit with which they 
were animated. From such sources how was it possible, 
that the nation or the Ministry in England should be cor- 
rectly informed, or have any just conceptions of the true con- 
dition of affairs in America ? By this letter we may judge 
of the tenor of General Gage's despatches to his government, 
upon which they were to found their decisions and adopt 
their measures. Almost while he was writing, ' that fear and 
want of inclination' would prevent the Americans from ' coming 
to extremities,' they met in the field a large detachment of the 
British army at Lexington and Concord, and two months af- 
terwards the battle of Bunker's Hill was fought ; and the 
' new-fangled legislature,' puzzled as they were, had assem- 
bled and organized a force sufficient to shut up the British 
commander and all his troops within the lines of Boston.* 
In addition to their correspondence with other colonies, the 



* In the public offices in London I have been favored with the pe- 
rusal of all the original despatches of General Gage to the government, 
while he had command of the British forces in Boston, and it is per- 
haps enough to say, that, in their general spirit and character, they ac- 
cord very exactly with this letter to the Governor of North Carolina. 
General Gage seems to have deceived himself at all points, and to 
have been unaccountably ignorant of the state of public feeling and 
opinion in the colonies, and of the progress that was making in the 
preparations for union and resistance. The Ministry depended on the 
information communicated by him, and laid their plans accordingly. 
After knowing the nature and substance of his communications, 
the wonder at the extraordinary measures pursued during the first 
stages of the contest is much diminished. 



46 LIFE OF 

Provincial Congress of New York steadily pursued their de- 
liberations, devising such means of defence as the time and 
circumstances would allow, and adhered promptly to all the 
recommendations of the Continental Congress. Encourage- 
ments were proposed for erecting powder mills, a bounty of 
five pounds w r as offered for every hundred pounds of powder 
manufactured in the colony, and twenty pounds for every hun- 
dred muskets over and above the regular market price of these 
articles. Resolves were passed for fortifying the Highlands, 
and the positions about Kingsbridge, and committees appoint- 
ed to examine the grounds, and report a system of operations. 
Philip Schuyler and Richard Montgomery were unanimously 
nominated, the first as a Major General, and the second as 
a Brigadier, in the army of the continent, and these nomina- 
tions were confirmed by the national Congress. 

The want of money was severely felt, and seemed to threat- 
en a stop to every movement. This afforded an opportunity for 
the members to strengthen their confidence with the people, 
by exhibiting a prool of patriotism, commonly the last that will 
bear a severe test. The Assembly in its corporate character 
had a dubious credit, which could untie few purse strings, and 
on several occasions the members pledged themselves, in their 
individual names, as security for money borrowed. Loan 
offices, or rather subscription funds, were opened by the coun- 
ty committees, and small sums were raised in this way on 
the credit of the government, but they were rather the contri- 
butions of sanguine zeal, than the aids of confident expecta- 
tion. These embarrassments were at length relieved, by the 
emission of the continental currency, and its distribution among 
the colonies. 

A subject, which occupied more than any other the atten- 
tion of the New York Congress, and which seerns to have 
been considered by them the most important that came under 
their notice, was a plan of reconciliation with England. No 
douht was expressed, none was probably entertained, that 
such a plan must at last be fallen upon, which would meet the 



GOUVEftNEUR. MORRIS. 47 

^ 

views of botli parties, and they thought it necessary to com- 
pare and mature their sentiments on a matter of such vital in- 
terest, that, when the proper time should arrive, they might 
be ready to act with decision and promptness. By a for- 
mal resolve, however, at the outset, they disavow any inten- 
tion to interfere with the General Congress in this respect, 
and declare their only purpose to be, that of ascertaining the 
united sentiments of their own body, and communicating them 
for the use of their delegates. 

After these preliminaries, a committee was appointed to 
draft and report a plan. Of this committee Mr Morris was a 
member, as he was indeed of almost every committee for gen- 
eral and weighty objects. When the report came before the 
House, it was examined minutely, and debated article by article, 
apparently in a spirit of concession and harmony. Mr Mor- 
ris took an active and leading part in the debates, and some 
important features were introduced at his instance. At last, 
on the 27th of June, when the field of discussion had been 
traversed ui every direction, numerous amendments proposed, 
some adopted and others rejected, the plan assumed its final 
shape, and the Congress of New York resolved, that they 
were prepared to settle all differences with Great Britain on 
the following terms. 

' 1. That all the statutes and parts of statutes of the 
British Parliament, which are held up for repeal by the late 
Continental Congress in their Association, dated the twentieth 
day of October, 1774, and all the statutes of the British Par- 
liament, passed since that day, restraining the trade and fishery 
of the colonies on this continent, ought to be repealed. 

( 2. That from the necessity of the case, Britain ought ' 
to regulate the trade of the whole empire for the general 
benefit of the whole, and not for the separate interest of 
any particular part, and that, from the natural right of proper- 
ty, the powers of taxation ought to be confined to the colo- 
ny legislatures respectively. 

' 3. Therefore, that the moneys raised as duties on the 



48 LIFE OF 

regulations of trade ought to be paid into the respeclive colo- 
ny treasuries, and be subject to the disposal of their deputies. 

' 4. That in those colonies, whose representatives in gen- 
eral assembly are now chosen for a greater term than three 
years, such assemblies ought in the future not to exceed that 
term. 

' 5. That the colonists are ready and willing to support 
the civil government within the respective colonies, and on 
proper requisitions to assist in a general defence of the empire, 
in as ample a manner as their respective abilities will admit. 

1 6. That if objections be made, that a resort to a vari- 
ety of colony legislatures for general aids is inconvenient, 
and that large unappropriated grants to the crown from Amer- 
ica would endanger the liberty of the empire ; then, 

' 7. The colonies are willing to assent to a continen- 
tal Congress, deputed from the several colonies to meet 
with a president appointed by the crown, for the purpose of 
raising and apportioning their general aids upon application 
made by the crown, according to the advice of the British Par- 
liament, to be judged of by the said Congress. 

'8. And as the free enjoyment of the rights of conscience 
is of all others the most valuable branch of human liberty, and 
the indulgence and establishment of popery all along the inte- 
rior confines of the old Protestant Colonies tends not only to 
obstruct their growth, but to weaken their security, that neither 
the Parliament of Great Britain, nor any other earthly legis- 
lature or tribunal, ought or can interfere or interpose in any- 
wise howsoever in the religious and ecclesiastical concerns of 
the colonies. 

' 9. That the colonies respectively are entitled to a 
free and exclusive power of legislation within themselves res- 
pectively, in all cases of internal polity whatsoever, subject 
only to the negative of their sovereign in such manner as has 
been heretofore accustomed.' 



GOUVEUNEUR MORRIS. 49 

This report was accompanied with a resolution, offered by 
Mr Morris, which provided that no one article should be con- 
sidered so essential to the others, as to exclude the idea of 
accommodation without such article, and that no part of the 
report should be obligatory on the representatives in the Con- 
tinental Congress. Hence the report was reduced to a mere 
expression of opinion, which he avows to be the design of his 
resolution, since to send such an instrument in the nature of in- 
structions would embarrass rather than aid their exertions in 
that body. There is room to believe, that Mr Morris was not 
well satisfied with the articles themselves, nor with the project 
of drawing up a series of propositions, in the nature of a creed, 
on this subject by a colonial Assembly, and that he took this 
method of neutralizing any ill effects, which might possibly 
grow out of them, if left in their original meaning and pur- 
pose. 

In the letter to their delegates, enclosing the above report, 
the Congress write ; ' We must now repeat to you the com- 
mon and just observation, that contests for liberty, fostered in 
their infancy by the virtuous and wise, become sources of 
power to wicked and designing men. Whence it follows, that 
such controversies, as we are now engaged in, frequently end 
in the demolition of those rights and privileges, which they 
were instituted to defend. We pray you, therefore, to use 
every effort for the compromising of this unnatural quarrel 
between the parent and child, and, if such terms as you may 
think best shall not be complied with, earnestly tola bor, that 
at least some terms may be held up, whereby a treaty shall be 
set on foot to restore peace and harmony to our country, and 
spare the further effusion of human blood.' 

The representatives in reply, after acknowledging the re- 
ceipt of this letter, with the enclosed plan of accommodation, 
add ; ' Deeply sensible of the calamities of a civil war, we 
have nothing more at heart than to be instrumental in com- 
promising this unnatural quarrel between the two countries, on 
the solid basis of mutual justice and constitutional liberty, and 

VOL. I. 5 



50 LIFE OF 

the most strenuous efforts on our part shall be exerted with 
unremitting ardor to accomplish this salutary purpose. We 
acknowledge, with the utmost gratitude, the deference you are 
pleased to pay to our judgment, and your delicacy in leaving 
us unrestrained in a point of all others the most essential to 
yourselves and your posterity, to the continent of America, and 
to the whole British Empire ; and happy shall we esteem our- 
selves, if, in the discharge of this difficult and arduous trust, 
we shall merit your approbation, and the confidence of the 
country.' 

A postscript is added to this letter, in the hand writing of 
Mr Jay, but signed by all the delegates, respecting the clause 
on ecclesiastical concerns. ' As the inhabitants of the colo- 
nies,' say they, ' are happily united in a political creed, we 
are of opinion that it would be highly imprudent to run the 
risk of dividing them by the introduction of disputes foreign, 
to the present controversy, especially as the discussion of them 
can be attended with no one single advantage. They are points 
about which man will forever differ, and therefore should 
always, and at least in times like these, be kept out of sight. 
We are the more confirmed in these sentiments by this circum- 
stance, that both this and the former Congress have cautiously 
avoided the least hint on subjects of this kind, all the mem- 
bers concurring in a design of burying all disputes on ecclesi- 
astical points, which have for ages had no other tendency, than 
that of banishing peace and chanty from the world.' On 
these considerations the delegates state, that they have unani- 
mously agreed to be silent as to that article. 

It may be thought strange, that any one should be alarmed 
at the idea of ' the indulgence and the establishment of pope- 
ry, all along the interior confines of the old Protestant colo- 
nies.' But this alludes to a bill, which had been recently 
passed by the British Parliament for the government of Can- 
ada, commonly called the ' Quebec Bill,' granting extraor- 
dinary privileges to the Catholic clergy, and of which the 
obvious policy was to conciliate the Canadians through the 
influence of the priests, and unite them against the other 






GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 51 

colonies. The bill caused much excitement in England, and 
its enemies affirmed, that it made the Romish church predom- 
inant by law in Canada, and allowed no more than a toleration 
to the Protestant faith. To the people of New York the bill 
seemed fraught with special danger, on account of their prox- 
imity to Canada, and the long line of frontiers by which the 
two provinces were joined. We hence perceive the reason 
why the above clause was introduced.* 

While the Congress were engaged in debating the scheme 
of accommodation, they heard that General Washington was 
on his way from Philadelphia, to take command of the conti- 
nental army at Cambridge, and that he would pass through New 
York. A committee of four was appointed, of whom were 



*In the archives of the Historical Society of New York, among 
many other valuable papers, there is a copy in manuscript of a remark- 
able x letter from Edmund Burke, on the Quebec Bill, written to the 
Assembly of New York, immediately after it had been passed by Par- 
liament. Mr Burke was then, and had been for nearly four years 
previously, agent in England for the colony of New York. He 
opposed the bill in all its stages, and this letter contains a history of its 
progress, and of his efforts to prevent its passage. 

It may here be remarked, that Mr Burke's correspondence with the 
Assembly of New York, during his agency, from the time of his 
appointment, in December, 1770, till the dissolution of the Assembly, iu 
April, 1775, has never been published. Nor indeed is any part of it 
known to exist in the United States, except the letter mentioned above. 
Could the whole now be found and brought before the public, it would 
doubtless present in a full and luminous manner the views of that able 
statesman, on all the important topics agitated at that time between 
Great Britain and the colonies, and prove a treasure of rare worth in 
the historical materials of the county. This correspondence has been 
studiously excluded from all the publications of his writings in Eng- 
land. 

Could it be ascertained what became of the papers of the old colo- 
nial Assembly, after its career was terminated, the door of hope might 
not yet be closed against the possibility of these letters being discov- 
ered, but this is a subject on which the antiquaries of New YorJt pro- 
fess to be enveloped in as dark a mystery, as those of any other part of 
the globe. It should still be kept in remembrance, however, especial- 
ly by the zealous and labor-loving members of the Historical Society.

General Montgomery and Mr Morris, to meet the commander 
in chief ut Newark, and recommend to him the place, which 
they should deem ' most prudent' for crossing the Hudson. 

At this moment the Congress was beset with a new diffi- 
culty. Governor Tryon still resided quietly in New York, 
and was considered, even by these representatives of the peo- 
ple, as the legal Governor, although they took care not to obey 
his authority, nor to show any other symptoms of allegiance, 
than outward respect, and a vigilant caution, that his person 
should not be molested. It so happened, that at the very time 
they were informed of General Washington's arrival at New- 
ark, by a letter from General Schuyler, they also heard that 
Governor Tryon was at Paulus Hook, and the alarming prob- 
ability was, that he and General Washington would come 
together at that place. To meet so ominous a crisis required 
more deliberation and forethought, than the Assembly had at 
command. But no time was to be lost, and they resorted to 
the following expedient. ' Colonel Jasper was called in, and 
requested to send en one company of the militia to Paulus 
Hook, to meet the Generals ; that he have another company 
at the side of the ferry for the same purpose ; and that he 
have the residue of his battalions ready to receive either the 
Generals or Governor Tryon, whichever shall first arrive, and 
wait on both, as well as circumstances will allow.' No other 
embarrassment seems to have occurred ; the Governor and 
the General spared themselves the awkwardness of an inter- 
view ; and on the next day Washington met the Congress, 
according to a previous arrangement with Mr Morris and Mr 
Low, when addresses of congratulation and civility were 
exchanged, in which there was nothing remarkable, except the 
pointed hint from the Congress to the commander in chief, 
that, ' when the contest should be decided by nn accommoda- 
tion with the mother county, he should resign the important 
deposit committed to his hands.' He was then escorted out 
of the city, by several companies of the militia of New York, 
and a troop of light horse, which had accompanied him from 
Philadelphia.

CITEMENT OCCASIONED BY THAT ADVENTURE. 

THE state of affairs at Ticonderoga demanded the early at- 
tention of the New York Congress. That fortress had been ta - 
ken on the tenth of May, by a small body of forces partly from 
Connecticut, partly from Massachusetts, but chiefly from the 
settlements in the New Hampshire Grants, under the com- 
mand of Ethan Allen. It is true, that Arnold had set off 
upon the same adventure, with a colonel's commission from 
the Massachusetts Committee of Safety, then sitting at Cam- 
bridge, but he overtook the party on its march, and arrived 
only in time to quarrel with Allen, by setting up pretensions 
to command over him, in virtue of the new commission, which 
he brought in his pocket, although not a soldier came with 
him, and he was beyond the limits of the power from which 
he derived his military rank. Neither Allen nor his men were 
disposed to acknowledge his authority, and he went on with 
the party as a volunteer. 

Ticonderoga being within the bounds of New York, it 
devolved on the authority of that colony to take it in custody, 
and, in compliance with a recommendation of the Continental 
Congress, they removed the cannon and stores to the south end 
of Lake George. This was easily effected, but they had no 
military force to take possession of the fort, not a man as yet

having been raised in the colony, nor any arrangements made 
for that object. Arnold and Allen took possession of Crown 
Point and St John's, and for a few days they held a sort of 
divided reign on the lake, Arnold as commander of a sloop 
and a schooner, which were converted into armed vessels, and 
Allen as a self-constituted General in chief of the land forces. 
Arnold soon grew dissatisfied, and returned to the army in 
Cambridge. Allen remained at Ticonderoga till the middle of 
June, and contrived to keep together a small force there, 
consisting of volunteers from the thinly populated regions in 
that neighborhood. 

The following extracts of a characteristic letter from Allen 
to the New York Congress will show what projects he enter- 
tained, and will probably afford some indication of the views 
of the people generally on the northern frontiers. 

' Crown Point, June 2<1, 1775. 
' Gentlemen, 

' Before this time you have undoubtedly received intelli- 
gence, not only of the taking of the fortified places on Lake 
Champlain, and also the armed sloop and boats therein, and 
the taking possession of a schooner, which is the property of 
Major Skene, which has been armed and manned, and of the 
conversion of them, with a large train of artillery, to the defence 
of the liberty and the constitutional rights of America. You 
have likewise undoubtedly been informed, that the expedition 
was undertaken at the special encouragement and request of a 
number of respectable gentlemen in the colony of Connecticut. 
The pork forwarded to subsist the army by your directions 
evinces your approbation of the procedure; and as it was a 
private expedition, and common lame reports that there is a 
number of overgrown lories in the province, you will the read- 
ier excuse me in not taking your advice in the matter, lest the 
enterprise might have been prevented by their treachery. It 
is here reported, that some of them have been converted, and 
that others have lost their influence.

1 If in those achievements there be anything honorary, the 
subjects of your government, namely, the New Hampshire set- 
tlers, are justly entitled to a large share, as they had a great 
majority of the soldiery, as well as the command, in making 
those acquisitions; and as you justify and approve the same, I 
expect you already have or soon will lay before the grand 
Continental Congress, the great disadvantage it must inevitably 
be to the colonies to evacuate Lake Champlain, and give up 
to the enemies of our country those invaluable acquisitions, 
the key either of Canada or of our own country, according to 
which party holds the same in possession, and makes a proper 
improvement of it. The key is ours as yet, and provided 
the colonies would suddenly push an army of two or three 
thousand men into Canada, they might make a conquest of all 
that would oppose them, in the extensive province of Quebec, 
unless reinforcements from England should prevent it. Such 
a division would weaken General Gage, or insure us Canada. 
[ would lay my life on it, that with fifteen hundred men I 
could take Montreal. Provided I could be thus furnished, and 
an army could take the field, it would be no insuparable diffi- 
culty to take Quebec. 

' This object should be pursued, though it should take ten 
thousand men, for England cannot spare but a certain num- 
ber of her troops ; nay, she has but a small number that are 
disciplined, and it is as long as it is broad, the more that are 
sent to Quebec, the less they can send to Boston, or any other 
part of the continent. And there will be this unspeakable ad- 
vantage, in directing the war into Canada, that instead of turn- 
ing the Canadians and Indians against us, as is wrongly sug- 
gested by many, it would unavoidably attach and connect 
them to our interest. Our friends in Canada can never help 
us, until we first help them, except in a passive or inactive 
manner. There are now about seven bunded regular troops 
in Canada. 

' It may be thought, that to push an army into Canada would 
be too premature and imprudent. If so, I propose to make a 



56 LIFE OP 

stand at the Isle Aux Noix, which the French fortified by 
entrenchments the last war, and greatly fatigued our large ar- 
my to take it. It is about fifteen miles on this side of St 
John's, and is an island in the river, on which a small artillery 
placed would command it. An establishment on a frontier, 
so far north, would not only better secure our own frontier, but 
put it in our power better to work our policy with Canadians 
and Indians, or, if need be. to make incursions into the territory 
of Canada, the same as they could into our country, provided 
they had the sovereignty of Lake Champlain, and had erect- 
ed head quarters at or near Skenesborough. Our only hav- 
ing it in our power, thus to make incursions into Canada, might 
probably be the very reason, why it would be unnecessary so 
to do, even if the Canadians should prove more refractory 
than I think for. 

' Lastly, I would propose to -you to raise a small regiment 
of rangers, which I could easily do, and that mostly in the 
counties of Albany and Charlotte, provided you should think 
it expedient to grant commissions, and thus regulate and put 
them under pay. Probably you may think this an imperti- 
nent proposal. It is truly the first favor I ever asked of the 
government, and, if granted, I shall be zealously ambitious to 
conduct for the best good of my country, and the honor of the 
government. I am, Gentlemen, &tc. 

' ETHAN ALLEN.'* 



* Two days after this letter was written, Allen sent a sort of pro- 
clamation into Canada, commencing, 'To our worthy and respecta- 
ble Friends and Countrymen, the French People of Canada, greeting.' 
The paper was signed, ' Ethan Allen and James Easton, at present the 
principal Commanders of the Army.' Easton was from Massachusetts, 
whence he had led forty-six men, who assisted at the capture of Ti- 
conderoga. 

Their proclamation was intended to be of a conciliatory nature to the 
Canadians, advising them to keep out of the quarrel. ' You are very 
sensible,' say they, ' that war has already commenced between Eng- 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 57 

The temper and sentiments of this letter were in direct oppo- 
sition to the views of the persons, to whom it was addressed. 
They had several days before passed strong resolves, disapprov- 
ing and disavowing any hostile intentions against Canada, 
and, with a warmth not usual in deliberative bodies, had 
' declared to the world, that they considered every such step 
as infamous, and highly inimical to all the American colonies, 
and they appointed a committee, of whom Gouverneur Mor- 
ns was chairman, to draw up a letter to be sent to the Canadi- 
ans, assuring them that no hostile designs were entertained 
against their persons, liberty, or property. 

The Continental Congress, also, made a similar declaration, 
and ordered it to be transmitted to Canada. It may be im- 
agined, therefore, that Ethan Allen's letter met with no wel- 
come reception. And yet, within two months and a half after 
it was written, a formidable expedition was ordered into Can- 
ada, under the command of the brave and ill-fated Mont- 
gomery, and on grounds precisely similar to those stated by 
Allen. His advice, as events turned out, although looked up- 
on at the time as wild and visionary, was the best that could 
be followed. Had such forces, as could easily have been gath- 
ered from Connecticut and Massachusetts, been marched into 
Canada immediately after the reduction of the posts on Lake 
Chain plain, they would have made an easy conquest of the 



land and the colonies. To fight the King's troops has become a 
necessary and incumbent duty. The colonies cannot avoid it. 
But pray, is it necessary that the Canadians and the inhabitants of 
the English colonies should butcher one another ? God forbid. There 
are no controversies subsisting between you and them. Nay, let old 
England and the colonies fight it out, and you Canadians stand by, 
and see what an arm of flesh can do.' They complain, also, that a 
recqnnoitering party of four men had been attacked, by about thirty 
Canadians ' and fired upon and pursued, till the reconnoitering party 
wasobliged to return the fire.' This proclamation was sent by a trusty 
messengc r to Montreal, with directions to have it circulated as widely 
possible.

whole province, and saved the country from the disastrous is- 
sues of the campaign under Montgomery and Arnold, in which 
courage and suffering, almost without parallel, served only to 
aggravate the calamities of defeat and death. But the spirit 
of the nation was not yet ripe for such a step ; the lingering 
hope of a speedy accommodation dwelt in the minds of many ; 
douhts, as to the result of a serious contest, quickened the fears 
and subdued the resolution of others; and all were satisfied, 
that a show of strong measures, without unanimity and firmness, 
would he premature, futile, or perhaps dangerous in its effects. 
The battle of Bunker's Hill produced-a change in this respect, 
nor till after that event can the nation be said to have confided 
in itself, imbibed a thorough distrust of English counsels, and 
a wavering faith in the terror of an English army. 

As no troops were raised in New York, till some time after 
the capture of Ticonderoga, the Congress requested the gov- 
ernment of Connecticut to send forces to that place. In this 
colony the governor and legislature had, from the beginning. 
acted in concert with Massachusetts. Soldiers had been 
levied, military arrangements formed, and means provided for 
defraying the expense. This request of New York, there- 
fore, was immediately complied with, and on the thirtieth of 
May, Governor Trumbull ordered one thousand men to march 
to Lake Champlain, under Colonel Hinman ; who arrived at 
Ticonderoga about the middle of June, and remained in com- 
mand, till he was superseded by General Schuyler, a month 
afterwards. Soldiers only were furnished by Connecticut, 
provisions and other supplies by New York. 

Ethan Allen, on the arrival of Colonel Hinman, found him- 
self without command or employment. In company with 
Seth Warner, an officer and associate in arms, he made a 
visit to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, for the 
double purpose of procuring pay for the soldiers, who had 
been acting under him, and authority for raising a body of 
men, on the plan of the regiment of rangers proposed in his 
letter to the New York Congress. Allen and Warner were 






GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 59 

introduced at the bar of the Continental Congress, where they 
wave information of what had been done, in taking and main- 
taining the posts on Lake Champaign. Payment of their 
demand was then ordered, and a resolution passed, recom- 
mending to the Congress of New York, on consulting with 
General Schuyler, ' to employ in the army about to be raised 
those called Green Mountain Boys, under such officers as the 
said Green Mountain Boys should choose.' With this recom- 
mendation, Allen and Warner presented themselves to the 
New York Congress. A motion to admit them to an audi- 
ence was debated, which met with a good deal of opposition, 
but was at length carried by a small majority. 

For many years Allen had acted a bold and forward part 
in the controversy, which had been carried on between New 
York, and the people settled in the New Hampshire Grants, 
concerning the title to those lands, and the right of sovereignty 
over the possessors. His zeal, energy, and talent had made 
him a leader in that affair, and the inhabitants were chiefly 
guided by his counsels. He wrote their addresses, protests, 
and appeals, which were alike remarkable for shrewdness, 
strong sense, vigor of thought, and a defiance of all the known 
rules of syntax and orthography. But anomolies in grammar, 
and errors of taste, did not diminish the effects of his unculti- 
vated and nervous eloquence on the minds of the people for 
whom he wrote. He thus acquired an influence and notorie- 
ty, which had operated much to his disadvantage in the esti- 
mation of the New Yorkers. The Congress prevailed on 
themselves to overcome this impression, so far as to sanction 
his project of raising a regiment of soldiers, and authorized 
the enlisting of five hundred men, who were to choose their 
own officers. 

Allen and Warner returned home together, but a quarrel 
arose between them, which caused dissensions among the 
people, and retarded the enlisting of the regiment. In the 
end, Allen either withdrew, or was passed over by the people, 
and the choice of a chief in command fell on Warner, with 



60 LIFE UK 

the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.* In literary attainments 
Warner was considerably below Allen, but he possessed 
strong native powers, courage, coolness, and other qualifica- 
tions for command in a subordinate sphere. He and his 
mountaineers rendered good service during the war, particu- 
larly in the battles of Hubbardton and Bennington. 

Meantime the Congress had made considerable progress in 
raising and organizing a battalion, consisting of four regiments, 
for the continental service, greatly embarrassed, however, for 
the want of money, clothing, arms, ammunition, and other 
materials for equipping an army and preparing it for the field. 
While General Schuyler was pressing for reinforcements at 
Ticonderoga, the New York Committee of Safety, then sitting 
in the recess of the Congress, replied to him as if in despair. 
' Our troops can be of no service to you ; they have no arms 
clothes, blankets, or ammunition, the officers no commissions, 
our treasury no money, and ourselves in debt.' But things 
mended daily, and before the first of October the troops were 
nearly all ready, and sent to the northward. 

It was found impossible to procure money from the Conti- 
nental Congress, in such quantities as were necessary, and on 
the second of September, an emission of one hundred and 
twelve thousand five hundred dollars was resolved upon, which 
was promised to be redeemed within the two years following, 
by taxes to be levied for the purpose. New regulations for 
the militia were also instituted, in the forming of which Mr 
Morris had taken a principal part. 

As early as the middle of June a rumor was spread, that a 
regiment of British troops from Ireland would soon be landed 



* The election was not made by the soldiers of the regiment, but 
by the committees of the several townships in the \e\v Hampshire 
Grants, on the west side nf the Green Mountains, assembled at Dorset

chosen Major. All the officers were commissioned by the New York 
Congress. 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 61 

in New York, and the Congress applied to General Wooster, 
then commanding the Connecticut forces at Greenwich, to 
inarch into New York as a security against an apprehended 
invasion. The government of Connecticut acceded to this 
requisition, and General Wooster took up his quarters near 
Haerlem, within five miles of the city, where he and his army 
remained for several weeks. At the request of the Congress, 
General Wooster went over, also, with a detachment of his men 
to the eastern part of Long Island, to protect the inhabitants 
against the incursions of the enemy, who came there to take 
off cattle and other provisions for the British army in Boston. 
A more efficient system for regulating the commerce of New 
York, was likewise adopted, and from that time a rigid in- 
spection of the entrances and clearances of vessels was kept 
up, and the navigation of the colony was subjected to the con- 
trol of the new government. Mr Morris was on a committee 
appointed to draw up regulations for this purpose. 

The New York Congress continued in session, except a re- 
cess of a few days in July, till the 2d of September, when 
they adjourned for a month, entrusting the management of af- 
fairs in the mean time to a Committee of Safety, delegated from 
their own numbers. This expedient was always adopted at 
an adjournment, so that a responsible body representing the 
people was at all times in session. The powers of the Com- 
mittee of Safety were prescribed by the Congress before they 
separated, and the mode of its organization. These varied at 
different times, but the general principles were the same. 
Three members from New York, having together two votes, 
and one member from each of the other counties, hav- 
ing each one vote, constituted this provisional government, 
called a Committee of Safety. But no members were re- 
stricted from attending the Committee and voting, the rule be- 
ing constantly observed, that however many members might be 
present, the sum of their votes should be reckoned no higher 
than the proportion assigned to the county, which they repre 
sented. It frequently happened, after an adjournment, that a 
VOL. i. 6 



62 LIFE OF 

quorum of the Congress could not be convened for several 
days, and in such cases the members present would assemble, 
and act as a Committee of Safety. Sometimes during the reg- 
ular sitting of Congress the attendance would be so thin, that 
they could not act in that capacity, and they would resolve 
themselves into a committee for the . day, or till the House 
should become full enough to permit them to go back again 
into the more dignified form of a congress. In this way no 
time was lost, and the public business was never neglected. 

The Committee of Safety were empowered to carry into ef- 
fect the previous resolves of the Congress, to open and answer 
letters, to take measures for executing the orders and recom- 
mendations of the Continental Congress, to superintend the 
military affairs of the colony, to comply with the requisitions 
of the generals of the continental army, to appropriate money 
for the public service, and to summon a meeting of the Con- 
gress, at such lime and place as they should think necessary. 
Armed with these powers, they contrived to keep the wheels 
of government in motion, and for the most part to satisfy the 
people. 

This Committee, however, which was appointed on the 
2d of September, resdrted to one measure, that proved un- 
popular, arid caused a good deal of excitement. Many of the 
soldiers, enlisted into the continental service in New York, 
were without arms, and all efforts to purchase them in a suffi- 
cient number had failed. To remedy this defect, the commit- 
tee issued an order, 'that all such arms, as are fit for the use 
of the troops raised in this colony, which shall be found in the 
hands or custody of any person, who has not signed the gene- 
ral Association, shall be impressed for the use of the said 
troops.' To carry this order into effect, persons were sent 
out with instructions to seize and collect arms, to have them 
appraised, and to give a certificate of their value to their own- 
ers, who were to be paid for them out of the treasury of the 
colony, if they should not be returned before the unhappy con- 
troversy with Great Britain was brought to a close. The per- 



GOUVERNETIR MORRIS. 63 

sons thus disarmed were, moreover, exempt from militia duty. 
The reception, which this order met with among the people, 
may be imagined by an extract from a letter to the Committee, 
dated Jamaica, Long Island, September 25th. 

'I have endeavored in the towns of Jamaica and Hampstead to 
carry the resolutions of the Congress into execution, but with- 
out the assistance of the battalion, I shall not be able to do it 
to any good purpose. The people conceal all their arms, that 
are of any value. Many declare that they know nothing about 
the Congress, nor do they care anything for the orders of the 
Congress, and say that they would sooner lose their lives than 
give up their arms, and that they would blow any man's brains 
out, who should attempt to take them away. We find that 
there is a number of arms, that belong to the county, in the 
hands of the people. Some persons are so hardy and daring, 
as to go into the houses of those that are friendly, and take 
away by force those county arms, which our friends have 
received from the clerk of the county. We are told, that the 
people have been collecting together in sundry places armed, 
and firing their muskets by way of bravado.' 

The Committee reasoned but imperfectly from the facts of 
history, and the principles of human nature, when they suppos- 
ed that people, with arms in their hands, would be tempted to 
resign them, by such motives as were held out. They must 
either be treated as friends or enemies. If friends, their safety 
and interest required that the soldiers, who were to protect their 
property, and defend their rights, should be armed, and the 
call of patriotism would be the loudest that could be made to 
them. While deaf to this call, they would made to listen 
to the orders of a committee, or the resolves of a con- 
gress. If enemies, the sense of present danger, operating on 
the first law of nature, would prompt them to keep within their 
power their only sure means of defence. In either case, the 
idea of taking away their arms, by a compulsory impressment, 
had little to recommend it, either in policy or prudence. In- 
deed, the project was soon abandoned, for when the Congress 



64 LIFE OF 

assembled again, the subject came before them, and a resolu- 
tion was passed disapproving the measure. 

Another event of some magnitude occurred, during the ad- 
journment of the Congress. The Mayor of New York attend- 
ed at the door of the Committee, and, being admitted, gave 
information that Governor Tryon had sent for him the day be- 
fore, arid told him, that he had just received a letter from Lord 
Dartmoutn, notifying him that orders had been given to the 
commanders of the King's ships in America, that, in case any 
more troops were raised, or fortifications erected, or the King's 
stores taken, they must consider such places as in a state of 
rebellion. This intelligence caused alarm, for his Majesty's 
ship of war Asia lay in the harbor, and had already been an 
object of terror to the inhabitants, from an apprehension, that 
the town would be set on fire by it. A serious affray had re- 
cently happened, between the commander of that ship, and a 
body of men sent by the Provincial Congress to withdraw the 
cannon at the battery. While engaged in this act the man-of- 
war fired upon them, and three persons were wounded. The 
Captain vindicated his conduct on the ground, that it was his 
duty to protect the property of the King ; but the inhabitants 
affirmed, that the guns at the battery belonged to the province, 
and not to the King. The people were angry at what they 
deemed a wanton outrage, and seized two of the Asia's boats, 
which came ashore at different times, and destroyed them. 
One of them the Congress ordered to be rebuilt and restored, 
but, before it could be finished, it was secretly sawed in pieces 
by persons unknown. 

But notwithstanding the exasperated state of public feel- 
ing, the Congress still allowed provisions to be carried to the 
Asia, which increased the irritation, and caused hard things to 
be said against them, for it was not easily discovered, by what 
rules of equity or policy those persons should be punished, 
who were detected in supplying the enemy's ships in Boston 
and other places, and at the same time the government it- 
self should openly abet this practice in New York. General

Washington, and all the patriots out of New York, were in- 
dignant at this singular inconsistency, to call it by no worse 
name. It arose in part from timidity, but as much, perhaps, 
with some of the principal citizens, from the belief, that the 
cause would in the end suffer less by keeping in good humor 
with the ships of war in the harbor, than by running the haz- 
ard of having the town burned down, the lives of the inhabit- 
ants endangered, and their property destroyed. This is the 
only shadow of excuse, that can be conceived, for the pusilla- 
nimity of the Congress in tolerating such a procedure, and 
acting in contradiction to themselves. * 

Captain Sears, who had been so conspicuous for his zeal 
and activity, and who was a member of the Provincial Con- 



*The affair of the Asia with the people at the battery happened on 
the twenty-third of August. The Congress, on the twenty-seventh, after 
censuring the conduct of Captain Vandeput, commander of the Asia, 
proceeded to resolve, that nobody should supply the King's ships with 
provisions, except Abraham Lott, but that he should be allowed ' to sup- 
ply all necessaries, as well fresh as salt, for the use of the said ships.' 
And yet, three days afterwards, in a set of resolutions inflicting penal- 
ties on certain decriptions of people, it is declared, that ' if any per- 
sons or persons shall be found guilty, before the Committee of any city 
or county, of attempting to furnish the ministerial arrny or navy with 
provisions, or other necessaries, contrary to the resolutions of the Con- 
tinental or of this Congress, such person or persons shall be punished 
at the discretion of the Committee, &c.' Hence, what was a crime 
everywhere else, was an allowable act in the harbor of New York. 

Gordon says, that 'many of the New York Provincial Congress, if 
not the majority, were adjudged real tories ; some, so deemed, might be 
only timid whigs.' Vol. ii. p. 175. This is too sweeping a charge. 
If there were any 'real tories 1 in the Congress, the number was ex- 
ceedingly small. It may indeed be doubted if there were any such, 
(except a very few, who seem to have withdrawn early, when they 
saw what course the Congress would take) but of 'timid whigs' there 
were not a few. It was not a time for men to conceal their sen- 
timents, and the committees, who were acting boldly and ardently 
on the side of liberty, would never have chosen a professed lory, or 
even a man of suspicious principles, to represent their interests. 



66 LIFE OF 

gress, not finding the temperament of public feeling in New 
York to rise fast enough for the warmth of his own, had re- 
tired into Connecticut, and joined himself to the more san- 
guine partisans of freedom in that colony. About this time, 
Rivington, the publisher of a newspaper in New York, ven- 
tured to make his journal the vehicle of sentiments extremely 
offensive to the liberal party, and this without receiving any 
check, or drawing down any rebukes, from the Congress, or 
any other constituted authority. Such a tame submission to 
the impudence and insult of a printer, was more than Sears 
and his Connecticut associates could brook. On the twenty- 
third of November, a company of light-horse from Connecticut, 
seventy-five in number, armed with muskets and bayonets, 
with Captain Sears at their head, marched into New York at 
noonday, proceeded to Rivington's house, broke his presses, 
and seized and carried off in triumph the guilty types, which 
had been the passive instruments of the printer's insolence, nor 
stopped with them till safely deposited within the Connecticut 
borders, where they were melted into bullets. In returning 
through Westchester county, these men seized also upon the 
clergyman of the parish, and one of the justices of the peace, 
suspected of tory principles, and made them the unwilling 
companions of their journey, during the rest of their retreat. 
This effort of the Connecticut knight-errants gave deep um- 
brage to the New York Congress, who fancied it to be not 
only a trampling upon their authority, but a reproach to their 
vigilance. Tbey addressed a letter of solemn remonstrance to 
the Governor of Connecticut, and wrote to their delegates in 
Philadelphia, requesting that the affair might be brought before 
the Continental Congress: They complain to Governor Trum- 
bull of Connecticut, ( that they cannot but consider such in- 
trusions, as an invasion of their essential rights as a distinct co- 
lony,' and add, ' that common justice obliges them to request, 
that all the types should be returned to the chairman of the 
General Committee of the city and county of New York.' 
They add again, ' we beg you will not consider this requisition 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 67 

as an attempt to justify the man, from whom the types were 
taken ; we are fully sensible of his demerits, but earnestly 
wish that the glory of the present contest may not be sullied, 
by an attempt to restrain the freedom of the press.'* 

Governor Trumbull wrote in reply, c that the proper resort 
for a private injury must be to the courts of law, which are 
the only jurisdictions that can take notice of violences of this 
kind.' If it is to be viewed in a public light at all, the Govern- 
or continued, * the head and leader of the whole transaction 
was a respectable member of your city and Congress, whom 
we consider as the proper person to whom the whole transac- 
tion is imputable, and who belongs, and is amenable to, your 
jurisdiction alone, and therefore the affair cannot be considered 
as an intrusion of our people into your province, but as a vio- 
lence or disorder happening among yourselves.' Thus the 
two colonies were at issue, but as Rivington went off to Eng- 



* And yet it would seem, that the Congress itself had not been 
wholly guiltless of this offence in the case of Rivington. Some 
months before, he had been in custody by their order, as may be con- 
firmed by an extract from their records, dated June 7th, 1775, in these 
words. 

' Whereas James Rivington of this city, printer, has signed the gene- 
ral Association, and lately published a handbill declaring his intention 
rigidly to adhere to the said Association, and also asked the pardon of 
the public, who have been offended by his ill judged publication ; resol- 
ved, therefore, that the said James Rivington be permitted to return to 
his house and family, and that this Congress do recommend to the in- 
habitants of this colony, not to molest him in his person or property.' 

After the destruction of his presses and types, Rivington went to 
England, but returned, when the British had established themselves 
in New York, and commenced his paper anew, under the title of 
' Rivingtori's Royal Gazette,' which he continued to the end of the 
war, having obtained the appointment of King's printer. He remain- 
ed in New York after the war, and endeavored to keep up his pa- 
per, changing the title to ' Rivington's Neio York Gazette." 1 Such 
was the popular odium against him, for the part he had taken, that 
his paper met with little support, and it soon came to an end.

land, and more important matters pressed upon the notice of 
the public, nothing more seems to have been done in the 
affair. 

The delegates in the Continental Congress say in reply, 'We 
highly applaud the spirited, and at the same time, respectful 
manner, in which you have supported the dignity and indepen- 
dency of our colony, and demanded reparation on the sub- 
ject of the Connecticut inroad. An interposition so rash, of- 
ficious, and violent, gave us great anxiety, as it was not only a 
high insult to your authority, but had a direct tendency to 
confirm that fatal spirit of jealousy, and distrust of our eastern 
brethren, which has done so much injury to our cause, and 
which every wise and virtuous patriot should study to sup- 
press.' They forbore, however, to bring the subject before 
Congress, as their constituents had desired, not doubting that 
justice would be rendered by Connecticut, and means be used 
to prevent similar encroachments in future.* 



* In a letter from Mr Jay to the President of the Provincial Con- 
gress, dated Philadelphia, November 26th, three days after the occur- 
rence took place, the writer says, ' The New England exploit is much 
talked of, and conjectures are numerous, as to the part ihe Convention 
will take relative to it. Some consider it as an ill compliment to the 
government of the province, and prophesy that you have too much 
Christian meekness to take any notice of it. For my own part, I do not 
approve of the fe#t, and think it neither argues much wisdom, nor 
much bravery. At any rate, if it was to have been done, I wish our 
own people, and not strangers, had taken the liberty of doing it. 

' I confess I am not a little jealous of the honor of the province, and 
I am persuaded, that its reputation cannot be maintained without some 
little spirit being mingled with its prudence.'

MUCH inconvenience was felt in some parts of the colony, for 
the want of courts of justice, and the regular modes of process 
for the recovery of debts, and the punishment of civil misde- 
meanors. The Colonial Congress did not meddle in these 
matters. Disorders of course increased, as the authority of 
the old government declined, till a new system for the admin- 
istration of justice was established, under the first constitution 
of the State. In the mean time, the old forms were allowed to 
be practised, where the officers chose to exercise their author- 
ity, and the people to obey. The laws in all civil concerns 
remained in force as heretofore, but, as many of the judges and 
other civil officers were royalists, and thereby odious to the 
inhabitants generally, they either forbore to execute the duties 
of their office, or, when they made the attempt, it was to little 
purpose. Some of the counties endeavored to remedy the 
inconvenience by local and temporary regulations, but these 
were not approved by the Congress. The only effectual 
remedy was the moderation of the people, and their acquies- 
cence in a state of things, which time and events only could 
improve. 

On the fourth of October the Congress met according to 
adjournment, but kept together only two days, when they 



70 LIFE OF 

separated, or dissolved, with the design of completing the elec- 
tions for a new Congress. The Committee of Safety contin- 
ued its sittings as usual, and on the fourteenth of November, the 
day appointed for a reunion of the Congress, several members 
appeared, but not enough to form a quorum for business. In 
some counties there had been no elections, and in others there 
was a delay, which betrayed an indifference, that threatened to 
be fatal in its results. In this dilemma, the members of the 
Congress, then assembled, wrote a circular to the committees 
of the counties, where no elections had yet been held, requesting 
them to died their delegates as speedily as possible, and send 
them forward. ' The evil consequences,' say they, ' that will 
attend the not having a Provincial Congress to determine on 
the measures, necessary to be adopted and carried into execu- 
tion at this unhappy crisis, are more easily conceived than 
expressed ; and, rest assured, gentlemen, that the neighboring 
colonies will not remain inactive spectators, if you show a dis- 
position to depart from the continental union. You must 
suppose confusion and disorder, with numberless other evils, 
will attend the want of a Congress for the government of a 
colony, until a reconciliation with the mother country can be 
obtained. We beg you will consider this matter with that 
seriousness, which the peace, good order, and liberties of your 
country require.' This appeal was listened to, and, on the 
sixth of December the Congress commenced its proceedings, 
being the second Provincial Congress of New York. 

This Congress was constructed on principles in some re- 
spects different from the former. Each county sent as many 
delegates as it pleased, and prescribed the number, that should 
make a quorum to vote. For instance, New York sent twen- 
ty-one delegates, and decided that seven should make a quo- 
rum, and when less than seven were present, no vote could be 
given for that county. The Congress settled their own rule 
of voting as heretofore, determining the number and ratio of 
votes for each county. No county had more than four votes, 
nor less than two. Tryon county chose two members, but 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 71 

authorized one to represent the county, or to constitute a quo- 
rum for voting, so that when one of the members only was 
present, he had two votes, although from New York if there 
were not more than six present, they could have no vote. 
Members were allowed to sit in Congress, an4 to speak, and 
act on committees, even when there was not a sufficient repre- 
sentation from the county, to which they belonged, to form a 
quorum for voting. A majority of the counties made a quo- 
rum for business. This Congress was chosen for six months, 
from the tenth of November. 

A question of some delicacy came up, respecting the dele- 
gation to the Continental Congress, with which the Provincial 
Congress found themselves a little perplexed. Twelve del- 
egates had been chosen, by the Convention in April, to rep- 
resent the colony of New York, of whom five were necessary 
to make a valid representation. On the 16th of October the 
delegates wrote to the New York Congress, stating that their 
number was reduced to five, so that in case of the sickness, or 
necessary absence of any one of them, the colony must remain 
unrepresented. To prevent such an accident, they suggested 
the expediency, of delegating the power to three, instead of 
five. After deliberating upon the matter, the Congress deter- 
min'ed, that they had no rigKt to make such a change, however 
much they might lament the untoward circumstance, that re- 
quired it. ' When we consider,' they say, ' that twelve were 
originally designated, of whom five were to be a quorum, we 
necessarily suppose, that the last number was particularly 
pointed out, with a general view to the several members, and 
in the confidence that every five of them would be amply suffi- 
cient for that beneficial purpose. We cannot pretend, there- 
fore, to lessen that number, unless indeed upon the most co- 
gent necessity, and perhaps not then.' 

This is another example of the extreme caution, with which 
the representatives of the people exercised their power, in all 
the gradations of the elective offices. And it may here be 
repeated, that the particularity with which elections were con- 



72 HFK OF 

ducted, from the smallest assemblages upward, and the special 
care which all men in office took not to go beyond the instruc- 
tions, or the will, of their constituents, are the features most 
strongly marked in the machinery of government, which was 
then beginning, its movements. 

The delegates to the Continental Congress had been chosen 
for an unlimited time, or at least no term of duration was spe- 
cified in their credentials. Of this omission they reminded 
the new Provincial Congress, and desired that no delicacy in 
regard to them might operate either to prevent, or influence, 
another appointment, as soon as it should be deemed proper.* 

The two counties of Queen's and Richmond refused to send 
representatives to the Provincial Congress. The freeholders 
and inhabitants of those counties were called together, for the 
purpose of expressing their sense of this subject by a vote in 



* The following letter from the New York delegates, dated Novem- 
ber 3d, 1775, is somewhat curious, as showing the pay of the members 
from the different colonies, while attending the Continental Congress. 

' We have been informed that the compensation for our expenses 
and loss of time is under your consideration, and as we presume an 
account of the provision made by the other colonies, for their respec- 
tive delegates, would be agreeable to you, we take the liberty of sub- 
joining it. 

' Georgia, 100 sterling to each delegate per month. 

'South Carolina, 300 to each for the last Congress. 

' North Carolina, 500 currency to each per year. 

' Virginia, a half Johannes per day to each. 

' Maryland, 40 shillings to each per day Proclamation money. 

' Pennsylvania, 20 shillings to each per day, besides the allow- 
ance to such of the members as come from the counties. 

' Connecticut, 3 dollars to each per day for loss of time, besides all 
expenses, allowing each delegate a servant and two horses. 

' Rhode Island, exactly the same as Maryland. 

'Massachusetts, all expense as above, and 2 dollars to each per day. 

' New Hampshire, all expense as above, and half a guinea per 
day to each.' 

It was decided to allow the New York delegates each 4 dollars pei 
day. 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 73 

the usual mode, and in each county a majority of the polls 
were against an election of deputies, alleging as a reason, that 
they had been disappointed in the hopes they entertained of 
the former Congress, and in their confident belief, that a plan 
of reconciliation with Great Britain would before that time 
have been effected. But the truth was, the inhabitants of 
these two counties had been tampered with, by the British 
men-of-war in the harbor of New York. They had been sup- 
plied with arms and ammunition from the Asia, and after Gov- 
ernor Tryon retired on board an armed ship, driven there, as 
he pretended, by the fear that his person was not. safe on shore, 
he had an easy access through his influence, and by his local 
situation, to the people in those counties. 

The Congress undertook to pass a censure upon the disaf- 
fected persons, who thus openly contemned their authority, 
and resolved that they had violated the general Association, 
that they should be put out of the protection of the Congress, 
that the names of the delinquents should be reported and pub- 
lished, and that all commercial intercourse between them and 
the other inhabitants should be cut off. This was a kind of 
brutumfulmen, which could do no harm to one party, and of 
course no good to the other. These persons neither expected 
nor desired any protection from the Congress, nor cared who 
knew their names; a commercial intercourse they wanted not, 
and the general Association they despised. The true secret 
of these imbecile proceedings is contained in the letter of the 
Congress to their delegates at Philadelphia, in which they say, 
that they have gone as far as a 'prudent regard' to the circum- 
stances of the city would permi p 

The terrific apparition of a burning town haunted them day 
and night. They nourished the vipers in (heir bosom, and 
lived in a perpetual apprehension of their bite. ' The power 
which the King's ships have of destroying the property of the 
city,' this was the pivot upon which the wheel of their poli- 
cy turned, the star of ill omen, that never ceased to linger 
with portentous aspect in their vision, the axiom on which 
VOL. i. 7 



74 LIFE OF 

were founded all their deliberations, resolves, and acts. Nor 
did it ever occur to them, that such a deed would be the great- 
est folly the British could commit, that the wanton burning of 
the town would kindle a flame of indignant feeling throughout 
the nation, which could not be quenched, and that it was not 
their purpose to multiply and exasperate enemies, but to pre- 
serve and conciliate friends. We are now arrived at a peri- 
od, in which this feeble and fallacious policy of the New York 
Congress will be seen in still bolder relief. 

In the month of December, it was discovered by certain in- 
dications in the British army at Boston, that preparations 
were making for fitting out a fleet, and sending off a detach- 
jnent of soldiers, from that place. Their destination could on- 
ly be conjectured, but as at that season it must necessarily be 
to the southward, it was supposed the most likely point was 
New York. As soon as General Washington was satisfied, 
that the embarkation would speedily take place, he resolved 
to despatch general Charles Lee 10 New York, with orders to 
take command of such forces as he could collect in Connecticut, 
and in that city, and prepare for such a defence as he should 
be able to make, against any hostile attempts of the enemy. 
Captain Sears, who had now found his way to Washing- 
ton's camp, was sent forward to explain to Governor Trurn- 
bull the nature of the enterprise, and collect volunteers in Con- 
necticut. General Lee left Cambridge on the llth of Janu- 
ary, with instructions from the commander in chief to repair to 
New York with such forces as he could rally on the way, and, 
when there, to call on the commander of the New Jersey troops 
for his aid, to put the city in the best posture of defence, which 
the season and circumstances would admit, to disarm per- 
sons on Long Island and elsewhere, known to be disaffected 
to the views of Congress, and to look into the condition of 
the fortifications on the North River. On the 16th of Janu- 
ary, General Lee wrote to General Washington from New- 
Haven. 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 75 

' Dear General, 

' We have been so baffled by the weather, that we only ar- 
rived here last night. I believe we shall find no difficulties in 
procuring a sufficient body of volunteers for the New York 
expedition. The unhappy accounts from Canada seem to an- 
imate these people, rather than depress them. We have 
now occasion for exertion and decision. I am apprehensive 
that the Congress must be inspired by you. They have just 
given a strong, and, I think, unfortunate instance of indecision. 
Colonel Waterberry had raised a regiment. The regiment 
was equipped and ready for embarcation. They were to have 
landed in Oyster Bay, and to have attacked the lories on Long 
Island. Lord Stirling was to have attacked them on the 
other side, all this by order of Congress ; when suddenly Col- 
onel Waterberry received an order to disband his regiment, and 
the tories are to remain unmolested, till they are joined by the 
King's assassins. Governor Trumbull, like a man of sense and 
spirit, has ordered this regiment to be reassembled. I believe 
it will be ready on Sunday, the day on which I shall march 
from -this town. 

'' I shall send immediately an express to the Congress, in- 
forming them of my situation, and at the same time conjuring 
them, not to suffer the accursed provincial Congress of Nevr 
York to defeat measures, so absolutely necessary to our sal- 
vation. The affairs of Canada I suppose will very soon, if not 
instantly, require a very considerable force from this province. 
Neither will the circumstances of New York admit of its be- 
ing too much stripped of men, for which reason I should think 
it advisable, immediately, to raise some additional regiments in 
Massachusetts Bay. Adieu, dear General ; God prosper you, 
and the arms of virtue. Yours most affectionately, 

1 CHARLES LEE.' 

The intelligence of General Lee's destination reached Nevr 
York, about the time of his arrival in New Haven, and it cre- 
ated a panic scarcely less agitating, than would have been 
produced by a discharge of fire rockets and hot shot from the 



76 LIFE OF 

Asia itself. Several families instantly began to remove their 
effects from the city. As soon as the Committee of Safety 
came together, they resolved, that, in consequence of the alarm 
into -which the inhabitants were thrown by the confident re- 
ports of the approach of General Lee, with a considerable 
body of troops, they were of opinion ' that it might occasion 
great difficulties and inconveniences to the residents of the 
city, should any body offerees arrive for active service, and it 
would tend to the peace and happiness of the inhabitants, for 
the Committee to obtain some information on the subject.' 
A letter was in consequence immediately written to General 
Lee, dated in Committee of Safety, January 21st, 1776, 
from which the following are extracts. 

' The inhabitants of this city are much alarmed at various 
confident advices of your destination, with a considerable body 
of forces for active service here. Confident, however, as 
those advices may appear to people without doors, we cannot 
readily credit them, as we conceive it most probable, that 
were you preparing to execute any plan of that kind, it 
would be preceded by some intimations to us on the sub- 
ject of Continental Congress,. General Washington, or your- 
self. We therefore should not have troubled you with this 
application, had it not been to procure such information from 
you, as may enable us in a prudent use of it to allay the 
fears of our inhabitants, who, at this inclement season of the 
year, will continue, as they have already begun, to remove 
their women and children, and which, if continued, may oc- 
casion hundreds to perish for want of shelter.' 

The Committee then proceed to state, that a want of pow- 
der is an inseparable bar to their making any active defence, 
that they have sent to foreign ports several adventures for 
purchasing powder, but without success, and that they are 
daily pushing similar adventures to the West Indies. 

'The ships of war give no interruption to our vessels, de- 
spatched on these adventures, a favor we cannot expect, should 
hostilities begin, and even should we be fortunate enough to 



GOTTVERNEUR MORRIS. 77 

oblige the ships of war to quit this port, by expending the lit- 
tle powder we have, an event which our most sanguine hopes 
cannot promise us, the attention of our enemies will effectual- 
ly prevent our expected importation. For these reasons we 
conceive, that a just regard to the public cause and our 
duty require us to take a prudent care of this city, and dic- 
tate the impropriety of provoking hostilities at present, and 
the necessity of saving appearances with the ships of war, till 
at least the month of March. 

' We, therefore, ardently wish to remain in peace for a little 
time, and doubt not we have assigned sufficient reasons 
for avoiding at present a dilemma, in which the present en- 
trance of a large body of troops into this city will almost 
certainly involve us. Should you have such an entrance in 
design, we beg at least that the troops may halt on the west- 
ern confines of Connecticut, till we shall have been honored 
by you, with such an explanation on this important subject, as 
you conceive your duty may permit you to enter into with us, 
the grounds of which you will easily see ought to be kept an 
entire secret.' 

To this epistle, signed by Peter V. B. Livingston, chair- 
man of the Committee of Safety, General Lee replied in 
another, dated at Stamford, January twenty-third, in which he 
expressed himself in the following manner. 

' With respect, Sir, to the alarms of the inhabitants, on the 
suspicions that my business was to commence active hostili- 
ties against the men-of-war in your harbor, I can assure you, 
that they may be perfectly easy. Such never was the inten- 
tion of the General, as I hope you will believe, that I nev- 
er entertained a thought of transgressing the letter of my in- 
structions. The motive of the General for detaching me was, 
solely to prevent the enemy from taking post in your city, or 
lodging themselves in Long Island, which we have the greatest 
reason to think, Sir, is their design. Some subordinate pur- 
poses were likewise to be executed, which 'are much more 
proper to communicate by word of mouth, than by writing ; 



78 LIFE OF 

but I give you my word, that no active service is proposed, as 
you seem to apprehend. 

' If the ships of war are quiet, I shall be quiet, hut I de- 
clare solemnly, that if they make a pretext of my presence to 
fire on the town, the first house set in flames by their guns 
shall be the funeral pile of some of their best friends. But I 
believe, Sir, the inhabitants may rest in security on this sub- 
ject. I am convinced, and every member who considers a 
moment must be convinced, that the destruction of the sea- 
port towns would, if possible, be a severer stroke to the Min- 
istry and their instruments, than to the inhabitants themselves. 
The seaport towns are the only holds they have in America ; 
they are considered as the pledges of servitude ; the menacing 
of destruction to them may indeed be of admirable use, but 
the real destruction of them must extinguish all hopes of suc- 
cess. 

' In compliance, Sir, with your request, I shall only carry 
with me into town a force just strong enough to secure it 
against any designs of the enemy, until it shall please the Con- 
tinental Congress to take measures for its permanent security. 
The main body I shall leave on the western frontiers of Con- 
necticut, according to your directions. I hope, Sir, and per- 
suade myself, that the Committee and inhabitants can have no 
objection to this plan. If Mr Try on, and the captains of the 
ships of war, are to prescribe what numbers are, and what 
numbers are not, to enter the town, they are absolute dictators 
to all intents and purposes. The condition is too humiliat- 
ing for freemen to put up with.' 

At the same time General Lee wrote to General Washing- 
ton in the following terms. 

1 It was unnecessary sooner to trouble you with my scrawl, 
as I could give you no information the least interesting. I 
find the people through this province more alert, and more 
zealous, than my most sanguine expectations. I believe I might 
have collected -ten thousand volunteers. I take only four 
companies with me, and Waterberry's regiment, which is so 



GOUVERNEUK MOKK1S. 79 

happily situated on the frontier. Ward's regiment I have order- 
ed to remain at their respective homes, until they hear further. 
These Connecticutians are, if possible, more eager to go out 
of their country, than they are to return home, wli3n they have 
been out for any considerable time. 

1 Enclosed I send you my letter to the General Congress, 
and that of the Provincial Congress of New York to me, with 
rny answer. I hope it will have your approbation. The 
whigs, I mean the stout ones, are, it is said, very desirous 
that a body of troops should march and be stationed in their 
city ; the timid ones are averse, merely from the spirit of pro- 
crastination, which is the characteristic of timidity. The let- 
ter of the Provincial Congress, you will observe, breathes the 
very essence of this spirit, it is wofully hysterical. I con- 
clude I shall receive the orders of the General Congress, before, 
or immediately on, my arrival; otherwise 1 should not venture 
to march into the province, as, by their late resolve, every 
detachment of the continental troops is to be under the direc- 
tion of the Provincial Congress, in which they are, a resolve, I 
must say, with submission to their wisdom, fraught with diffi- 
culties and evil. It is impossible, having two sovereigns, that 
any business should be carried on.' 

As soon as General Lee's letter to the Continental Congress 
enclosing a copy of the letter of the Committee of Safety to 
him, reached Philadelphia, the New York delegates proposed 
that a committee should be appointed to proceed to New York, 
and confer with General Lee, as to the immediate objects 
of his enterprise, and the mode of prosecuting it in a man- 
ner acceptable to the inhabitants. This committee con- 
sisted of Messrs Harrison, Lynch, and Allen, and they arrived 
in New York on the 30th of January, two or three days be- 
fore General Lee, who was detained on the road by indispo- 
sition. Meantime he sent forward seven hundred troops, un- 
der the command of Colonel Waterberry. A part of them 
arrived in town the day after the committee of the Continental 
Congress. 

The New York Committee of Safety here found themselves 



80 LIFE OF 

involved in a new difficulty, for they got into a debate about 
the disposition, which should be made of the troops on their 
arrival. Some were for having them slopped in their march, 
till a conference could be had with the committee of Congress, 
but this was carried in the negative ; and finally it was decid- 
ed, that the troops should be received, and lodged in the city 
barracks, on condition that they were to be under the direction 
of the Committee of Safety, till General Lee should arrive, and 
the matter should be finally arranged by a conference between 
him and the two committees. To this proposal the committee 
of the Continental Congress replied, that they could not 
undertake to put these troops under the direction of the 
Provincial Committee, or Congress, having no such power 
lodged in their hands by the Continental Congress. In the 
mean time Colonel Waterberry put an end to one part of the 
difficulty, for he informed them, that the troops were hourly 
expected, and that he should on their arrival march them 
immediately into the barracks, declaring that he had no 
authority to give up the control of the troops to the Committee, 
without orders from General Lee. It was at last agreed, that, 
by the credentials of the committee from the Continental 
Congress all the troops in New York were properly in the 
charge of the gentlemen of that committee, till General Lee's 
arrival. This event occurred on the fourth of February, when 
he wrote again to General Washington as follows. 

' I arrived here yesterday, but not without some difficulty. 
My disorder increased, rather than diminished, so that I was 
under the necessity of being carried in a litter a considerable 
part of the way. I consider it as a piece of the greatest good 
fortune that the Congress have detached a committee to this 
place, otherwise I should have made a most ridiculous figure, 
besides bringing on myself the enmity of ths whole province. 
My hands were effectually tied up, from taking any steps ne- 
cessary for the public service, by the late resolve of the Con- 
gress, putting every detachment of the continental troops un- 
der the command of the Provincial Congress, where such de- 
tachment is. 



GQUVERNEUR MORRIS. 81 

' I should apprize you, that General Clinton arrived almost 
at the same instant with myself. He has brought no troops 
with him, and pledges his honor that none are coming. He 
says he is merely on a visit to his friend Tryon. If it is real- 
ly so, it is the most whimsical piece of civility I ever heard of. 
He informs us, that his intention is for North Carolina, where 
he expects five regiments from England ; that he only brought 
two regiments of light infantry from Boston. This is certain- 
ly a droll way of proceeding. To communicate his full plan 
to the enemy is too novel to be credited. 

' The Congress committee, a certain number of the Committee 
of Safety, and your humble servant, have had two conferences. 
The result will agreeably surprise you. It is, in the first place,, 
agreed, and justly, that to fortify the town against shipping is im- 
practicable ; but we are to fortify lodgements, in some command- 
ing part of the city, for two thousand men. We are to erect en- 
closed batteries on both sides of the water near Hell Gate, which 
will answer the double purpose ofrsecuring the town against pi 
racies through the Sound, and seclfre our communication with 
Long Island, now become a more capital point than ever, as 
it is determined to form a strong fortified camp of three thou- 
sand men in that Island, immediately opposite to New York* 
The pass in the Highlands is to be made as respectable as pos- 
sible, and guarded by a battalion. In short, I think the plan 
judicious and complete. The two brass pieces, and other ar- 
ticles, will be sent down as you request. You have heard of 
the fate of the cannon near Kingsbridge.' 

After his arrival in New York, General Lee lost no time in 
entering upon measures to put the city in a state of defence, both 
by a suitable arrangement of the troops, and by selecting posi- 
tions for fortified posts. The committee of the Continental 
Congress retuned to Philadelphia, but he had frequent con- 
ferences with persons, delegated from the New York Congress, 
who manifested less reluctance than formerly at the idea of as- 
suming a defensive attitude, especially as the arrival of Clinton 
on an uncertain expedition made it more likely that an attack 
from the enemy was to be apprehended. Considering the differ- 



82 LIFE OF 

ent temperaments of the General, and the members of the Con- 
gerss, they went on together with as much harmony as could be 
expected. They agreed, and acted in unison, on all essential 
points, or at least so far, that he was able to execute his plans, 
without any embarrassing opposition. They were totally at va- 
riance, however, as to one subject, and that was the supplying 
of the ships in the harbor with provisions, which the Congress 
persisted in doing, and with which the General forbore to in- 
terfere, since it did not obstruct nor retard his schemes for 
defensive preparations. 

' The Governor, and the captain of the man-of-war,' said he, 
in a letter to General Washington, ' had threatened perdition 
to the town, if the cannon were removed from the batteries 
and wharves, but I ever considered their threats as idle me- 
naces, and even persuaded the town to be of the same way 
of thinking. We accordingly conveyed them to a place of 
safety , in thp middle of tho day, and no cannonade ensued.* 
Captain Parker publishes a pleasant reason for his past con- 
duct. He says, that it was manifestly my intention, and that 
of the New England men under my command, to bring down 
destruction on this town, so hated for their loyal principles, but 
that he was determined not to indulge us, and so remained 
quiet out of spite. The people here laugh at his nonsense, 
and begin to despise the menaces, which formerly used to throw 
them into convulsions. To do them justice, the whole show 
a wonderful alacrity, and in removing the cannon, men and 
boys of all ages worked with the greatest zeal and pleasure. 
I really believe that the generality are as well affected as any 
on the continent. 



*This was done without the consent, or previous knowledge of the 
Committee of Safety, who, although they did not interpose to prevent 
the at-t, were not well pleased with it, hoth because they looked upon 
it as an assumption of authority by the General, and because it renew- 
ed their apprehensions of the burning of the town. It had tlie good 
effect to elicit from them an order, to have the public records of tht 
colony removed from the city, to a place of greater safety.

' The Provincial Congress have ordered in fifteen hundred 
minute men. A number, equal to two battalions, is coming 
from Pennsylvania and the Jerseys. Lord Stirling's regi- 
ment is already here, but not complete. When the major 
part, or a sufficient number arrive, we shall begin our works. 
My intention is to pull down that part of the fort on the town 
side, to prevent its being converted into a citadel for the ene- 
my, and to erect a battery on a traverse in the street, to pre- 
vent a lodgement in it. A redoubt and battery, at the pass of 
Hell Gate, will prevent their ships and tenders passing and re- 
passing to and from the Sound. 

' We have fixed on a spot in Long Island for a retrenched 
camp, which I hope will render it impossible for them to get 
footing on that important Island. As this camp can always be 
reinforced, it is our intention to make it so capacious as to con- 
tain four thousand men. The batteries on the pass of Hud- 
son's River will be secured, as soon as possible. Some of the 
heavy cannon from hence must be sent up for the purpose. 
It is really a fine train we are in possession of. You shall 
have a return of the guns, as well as stores, by the post. 
Captain Smith is an excellent, intelligent, active officer, and I 
take the liberty of recommending him to your protection. 
Captain Badlam, of the artillery, is likewise a man of great 
merit in his way. 

' You must pardon me, dear General, for a liberty I have 
taken. You know that Sears was to collect our volunteers in 
Connecticut, but he thought he could not succeed, unless he 
had some nominal office and rank. I accordingly most impru- 
dently, by the virtue of the power deputed by you to me, 
(which power you never deputed) appointed him Adjutant 
General, with the rank of Lieutenant, for the expedition. It 
can have no bad consequences ; the man was much tickled, 
and it added spurs to his hat. He is a creature of much spirit 
and public virtue.'*

which he said were well enough ' to gratify the adulterated pride of

Again General Lee writes to Washington, on the 29th of Feb- 
ruary. 

' The Congress have as yet not taken the least step for the 
security of this place. The instant I leave it, I conclude the 
Provincial Congress, anti inhabitants in general, will relapse 
into their former hysterics. The men-of-war, and Mr Tryon, 
will return to their old stations at the wharves, and the first regi- 
ments, which arrive from England, will take quiet possession of 
the town and Long Island. I have written letters, till I am tired, 
on the subject to the Congress, but have received no answer. 
The committee of three, who were here to confer with me, 
agreed it was necessary that five thousand men should be in the 
place. They left us, and no notice has been taken of the affair 
since. Great and extensive works were resolved upon, and 
we have scarcely sufficient numbers to mark out the ground, 



the Magnifici in pompous aristocracies ; but, in a great, free, manly, 
equal commonwealth, it is quite abominable.' The following is an 
extract of a letter from him to Patrick Henry, then Governor of 
Virginia. 

' For my own part, I would as lief they would put ratsbane in my 
mouth, as the Excellency, with which lam daily crammed. How 
much more true dignity was there in tho simplicity of address among 
the Romans! Marcus Tullius Cicero, Decimo Bruto Imperatori, 
or Caio Marcello Consuli, than to ' : His Excellency Major General 
Noodle," or to the " Honorable John Doodle." My objections are per- 
haps trivial and whimsical ; but, for my soul, I cannot help starting 
them. If, therefore, I should sometimes address a letter to you, without 
the Excellency tacked, you must not esteem it a mark of personal or 
official disrespect, but the reverse.' See Memoirs of Charles Lee, p. 323. 

Although there was no fixed code, established by any formal conven- 
tion, for graduating those badges of distinction during the Revolution, 
yet custom and common consent gave currency to a sort of rule, which 
was generally followed. Tho President of Congress, Ministers and 
public Agents abroad, Presidents of Conventions, Governors of States, 
the Commander in Chief, and Major Generals on separate commands, 
were honored with the prefix of Excellency ; whereas, members of 
Congress, and other public bodies, and Brigadier Generals in the army, 
must forsooth be contented with Honorable. But they were all enti- 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 85 

much less to throw up the works. In short, I know not what 
to make of this apathy on so important a subject. 

' I shall now give you a detail of what we have been doing, 
and in what circumstances we are. Our force, including the 
minute men, amounts to about seventeen hundred men. 
Ward's regiment, which is the strongest, I have stationed on 
Long Island. They are employed in making fascines, and 
preparing other materials for constructing three redoubts, one 
of which will in a great measure, in correspondence with a bat- 
tery, which I have sunk opposite to it in the city, secure the 
entrance of the East River. Waterberry's and Stirling's regi- 
ments are quartered in the city; the former in the upper bar- 
racks, the latter in the lower. Two hundred minute men are 
likewise lodged in the town. Drake's regiment of minute men, 
and one more company, (in all about two hundred,) are station- 
ed at Horn's Hook, which commands the pass of Hell Gate. 
They are employed in throwing up a redoubt, to contain three 
hundred men. 



tied to another appendage, the ancient and knightly epithet of Esquire, 
which, like the tail ofa kite, was never to be omitted, whatever else might 
go before. Thus we have, His Excellency John Hancock Esquire ; His 
Excellency Benjamin Franklin Esquire; His Excellency Jonathan 
Trumbull Esquire ; but when we come to plain members of Congress, 
it is no more than The Honorable Roger Sherman Esquire, and for a 
brigadier general. The Honorable Richard Montgomery Esquire. 

Commonly, also, a Major General, when he was not on a separate 
command, had no higher title than Honorable. In such case, the final 
epithet was usually omitted, and the military one inserted, as The Hon- 
orable Major General Lee. It was only the unskilled that wrote, The 
Honorable Major General Lee Esquire, yet it would not be easy to teU 
why Sancho's title should be eliminated in this case, more than in 
me other. 

In writing letters, the uninitiated sometimes made ludicrous mistakes, 
and interlarded, Worship, Worshipful, and the like, out of all time and 
measure, and were guilty of strange transpositions and misplaciugs 
of the recognized titles. Letters to Washington frequently began, 
* Rlastrious Sir ;' and petitions were prefaced with a string of lofty 
and sonorous epithets.

'As to the town, having few hands, and the necessary duty- 
being hard, I have been able to effect little. I have, indeed, 
thrown down the side of the fort next the town, to prevent its 
being converted into a citadel for the use of the enemy. It 
was absolutely impossible to be moulded into anything, which 
could annoy their ships. I have likewise thrown a traverse, 
or barrier, across the Broad Way, two hundred yards in the rear 
of the fort, with four pieces of cannon, to prevent the enemy 
lodging themselves in the remains of the fort, and repairing it. 
It is likewise my intention to barricade all the streets leading 
into the Broad Way, both on the right and left, to secure us 
against being taken in reverse. Batteries are to be erected 
on the eminence behind Trinity Church, to keep their ships 
at so great a distance, as not to injure the town. As we are 
surrounded by navigable waters, I consider enclosed works as 
rather dangerous. It was, therefore, my intention to throw up 
a large number of large fleches, or redans, at certain distances, 
one behind another, so as to render it a disputable field of 
battle against any force. Kingsbridge being a most impor- 
tant pass, without the command of which we could have no 
communication with Connecticut, I had resolved to make it as 
strong as possible. 

' Such were my schemes, but as the Congress have not fur- 
nished the force, which I was taught to expect from Philadel- 
phia, we have not had it in our power to effect more than I 
have related. Governor Tryon, and the Asia, still continue be- 
twixt Staten and Bedlow's Islands. It has pleased his Excel- 
lency, in violation of the compact he had made, to seize sev- 
eral vessels from Jersey, laden with flour. It has, in return, 
pleased my excellency to stop all provisions from the city, and 
cut off all intercourse with him ; a measure, which has 
thrown the mayor, council, and lories into agonies. The 
propensity, or rather rage, for paying court to this great man, 
is inconceivable. They cannot be weaned from him.' 

From the tenor of General Lee's letters, it is obvious, that 
his energy and warmth outstripped the cautious prudence of 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 87 

the Provincial Congress. He conformed himself to their 
movements, with exemplary self command, for a time,, but when 
the conviction was forced upon him, that they would do noth- 
ing, it was hard for him, with the spirit of a soldier, to tread the 
line of demarkation, and not be tempted to overstep the pre- 
scribed bounds of his authority. This was particularly the 
case in seizing tories, a duty which was committed by the 
Continental Congress to the civil authority of each colony, 
and pertained in no manner to the continental military service. 
Of this fact General Lee became convinced, but not till he had 
exercised the power in some instances. And yet he was 
borne out by the advice, if not by the orders, of Washington, 
who, on the subject of disarming the tories, said, ' you can 
seize upon the persons of the principals ; they must be so no- 
toriously known, that there will be little danger of your com- 
mitting mistakes.' General Lee acted strictly within this ad- 
viqe. In fact, the (resolutions of Congress on this head are 
somewhat ambiguous.* They recommend to the Colonial 
Assemblies to disarm and seize the more dangerous tories, and 
authorize them to call to their aid, in effecting this object, the 
continental troops stationed in or near any colony, where this 
service was to be done, but there is no clause requiring the 
continental officers to abstain from the same acts. The nature 
of the case, therefore, would lead a 1 commander of continental 
troops to infer, that, when he knew a flagrant offender, it was 
his duty to apprehend him, without waiting for an order from 
the provincial authority. It was the intent of the resolutions, 
however, to give this power wholly to the respective colonies, 
and justly enough, since it was extended over all the citizens, 
any one of whom was subject to be taken up on suspicion, 
tried, and imprisoned. The most that a continental officer could 
with propriety do, in such a case, was to secure a suspected 
person, and deliver him over to the civil jurisdiction of the 
colony.

LIFE OF 



On the 6th of March, a committee of the New York Con- 
gress wailed on General Lee, with a list of regulations for 
supplying the armed ships with provisions, which they wished 
him to examine and approve. They reported, ' that General 
Lee was pleased to give for answer, that he was to resign the 
command here to Lord Stirling to night, hut that if he were to 
continue, he would not consent to supply them with any pro- 
visions, as they were at open war with us ; that he hoped Lord 
Stirling would be of the same opinion ; that his instructions 
from the Continental Congress were, to use every means in his 
power for the defence of the city.' This was the last public 
intercourse between General Lee and the Congress. The 
regulations were approved by Lord Stirling, and no change in 
regard to the ships occurred. 

Lord Stirling continued in command at New York, till Gen- 
eral Washington's arrival, at the head of the American army 
froro Boston, which was about the first of April. Satisfied 
that more efficient measures were necessary, and resolved to 
carry them into effect, he wrote in strong terms to the Con- 
gress, and at last induced them to embrace his views, and fol- 
low his counsels.

MR MORRIS'S SPEECH IN FAVOR OF INDEPENDENCE. HIS MISS1OW 
TO THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS. DECLARATION OF INDEPEND-

A CONSTITUTION. 

IN the month of April a new election took place for another 
Congress, and a quorum was formed on the 8th of May. 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 89 

The last Congress, as mentioned above, was elected only for 
six months ; the present was for a year. The powers and in- 
structions of the two were the same. It may be worthy of re- 
mark, that several of the delegates to the Continental Congress 
were likewise members of this Congress, as Jay, Philip Liv- 
ingston, Duane, Alsop. It moreover appears, that the Provin- 
cial Assembly had paramount claims on their attendance, for 
when Mr Livingston returned to the Continental Congress, on 
the 26th of June, he asked a formal permission of the House, 
which was granted, on the ground that it was necessary to 
make up a sufficient number of New York delegates, to form 
the quorum of that colony in the Continental Congress. Hence 
his name was affixed to the Declaration of Independence, but 
not those of the others, who were detained in the -Provincial 
Congress. Alsop likewise returned, but, as we shall see here- 
after, he had other reasons for not signing the declaration. 

Gouverneur Morris was a member of this new Congress, 
but whether of the last short one I am not certain, for I do not 
find his name on the journals during that space. If he was 
chosen, he probably did not attend, but he now comes forward, 
prepared to take a prominent lead in all the great measures for 
freedom and active defence.* 

In addition to military preparations, and schemes for defeat- 
ing the machinations and securing the persons of tories, which 
had thus far been the chief business of the Provincial Assem- 
blies of New York, this Congress had in 1 prospect two of the 



* Shortly after the death of Montgomery, and the disastrous occur- 
rences at Quebec, a number of gentlemen in New York formed a 
plan for raising a battalion of fifteen hundred men for nine months, 
and made the proposition to the Provincial Congress, exacting as a 
condition, that they should be allowed to appoint their own officers. 
The proposal was refused on these terms, the Congress insisting that 
all officers should be appointed by that body. To this, the gentle- 
men, who set the project on foot, would not agree, and it was aban- 
doned. Gouverneur Morris was to have been a Lieutenant Colonel 
of these forces.

most important subjects that could come under the cognizance 
of any deliberative body, the assuming of independence, and 
the formation of a new plan of government. The Continental 
Congress resolved, on the 15th of May, that it should be rec- 
ommended to the assemblies and conventions of the colonies, 
rn which no regular government had been established, to adopt 
such forms as should best suit their condition, and lead to the 
happiness of their constituents. This was virtually a recom- 
mendation to declare independence ; for there can be no high- 
er act of sovereignty or self control in a people, than to set up 
for themselves a new and separate scheme of government. 
When the subject came before the New York Congress, a 
week afterwards, it was evidently regarded in this light, and 
the debates took a turn corresponding with the same view. 

Up to this period, very few persons in New York had 
thought seriously of independence. We have seen the Con- 
gress, a year ago, endeavoring to patch up a plan of reconcilia- 
tion, and since that time extremely tender in taking any steps, 
which should implicate them in the charge of obstinate disloy- 
alty to the King of Great Britain.* In this respect, nearly all 
the other colonies, nay doubtless every other one, were in 
advance of New York. It is not easy to trace the growth of 
the spirit of independence from its first germination, through its 
gradual progress, and to decide when and where it came earli- 
est to maturity, and took the strongest hold on the public 
mind. When the war began, it is probable that circumstan- 
ces, emanating from the oppressive measures of the British 



*In regard to those, who at this time espoused the doctrine of re- 
conciliation, the; author of 'Common Sense' said, probably with equal 
justice and discriminatiop, that they consisted of the following descrip- 
tion of persons, viz. ' Interested men, who an- not to be trusted ; weak 
men, who cannot see; prejudiced men, who will not see; and a certain 
set of moderate men, who think better of die t'uropeau world than it 
deserves; and this last class, by an ill-judged deliberation, will be the 
cause of more calamities to this continent, than all the other three.' 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 91 

government, had raised this spirit to a higher tone in Massa- 
chusetts, than any where else, but the electric chain of sympa- 
thy soon conducted it to all the members of the general body, 
which were assimilated by common interests, and exposed to 
common dangers, encroachment, and suffering.* Recently, 
however, much had been said and written on the subject, 
The popular voice was becoming audible in various quarters, 
and after the wide circulation and unparallelled success of the 
tract entitled Common Sense, in the winter and spring of 1776, 
the public mind rapidly converged to a point favorable alike 
to unanimity of sentiments and concerted action. 

At this crisis the third New York Congress assembled, and, 
among their earliest proceedings, was the consideration of the 
resolution of the Continental Congress, recommending the or- 
ganization of a new form of government. Gouverneur Morris 
put himself at the head of the debates on this question, and 
opened the business by a long argument in support of the 
measure, showing by a series of facts and reasonings, that it 
was necessary, and that the proper time had arrived. This argu- 
ment embraced a wide compass, sketching a historical outline 



* In like manner, it would be difficult to tell, who, among the eminent 
individuals of the time, were the first to defend openly a separation and 
absolute independence of the American colonies. Franklin claims the 
distinction of being among the earliest and most conspicuous. Mr 
Quincy, while wilh him in England, speaks of him in the following 
manner, as early as November, 1774, in writing to a friend. ' Dr 
Franklin is an American in heart and soul. His ideas arc not contracted 
within the narrow limits of exemption from taxes, but are extended upon 
the broad scale of TOTAL EMANCIPATION. He is explicit and bold upon 
the subject.'' Again, he ' explicitly and in so many words said, that New 
England only could hold out for ages against this country, and, if they 
were firm and united, in seven years would conquer them.' See 
Memoir ofJosiah Quincy, Jr. pp. 250, 341. 

This is the more remarkable, as Dr Franklin had then lived several 
years in England, and of course out of the sphere of sympathy and ex- 
citement, which, by reaction and attrition, had warmed the feelings and 
elevated the sentiments of his countrymen at home. 



92 LIFE OF 

of the differences between England and the colonies, the grad- 
ual encroachments of the former, and the injuries and oppres- 
sions to which the latter had submitted, till their patience was 
exhausted, and submission had become an outrage upon their 
dignity as a free people, a crime against justice, and a mocke- 
ry of liberty. In short, we hear no more of reconciliation. 

It was Mr Morris's opinion, however, that the present Con- 
gress had not power to enter upon the plan of a new govern- 
ment, as such a thing was not contemplated by their constitu- 
ents, when they were chosen. At the close of his speech he 
made a motion, that a committee should be appointed to draw 
up a notice to the people, recommending a new election of 
persons, expressly authorized to assemble and form a new gov- 
ernment. This motion was opposed by Mr Scott, on the 
ground that it was doubtful whether the Congress had not the 
power desired, and he thought it was enough to appoint a 
committee to report as to that point. These preliminary dif- 
ficulties were at length got over, by an amendmeat of Mr Mor- 
ris's motion, proposed by Mr Sands, that a committee should 
be appointed to take into consideration the resolutions of the 
Continental Congress, and to report thereon with all conve- 
nient speed. Mr Morris held to hisoriginal proposition, and 
opposed the amendment in a speech, but it was carried in the 
affirmative. 

On the twenty-seventh of May the committee reported in 
substance as follows. That the right of framing or new mod- 
elling civil government belongs to the people ; that the present 
form of Congress and committees originated in the free choice 
of the inhabitants, and depends on them ; that this form was in- 
stituted while the old government subsisted, and was necessari- 
ly defective; that, by the voluntary abdication of the late Gov- 
ernor Tryon, the dissolution of the old Assembly, and the un- 
warrantable hostilities committed by the British fleets and ar- 
mies, the old form of government is ipso facto dissolved, where- 
by it is become necessary, that the people of this colony should 
institute a new and regular form of internal government, in ex- 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 93 

elusion of foreign and external power ; that doubts have arisen 
as to the authority of this Congress to form such a govern- 
ment, which doubts can of right be removed by the people 
only ; that the Congress ought to continue in the exercise of 
such powers, as are clearly delegated to them, and in the mean 
time give the people an opportunity to remove the above 
doubts, either by declaring their respective representatives in 
Congress to be invested with the necessary powers for estab- 
lishing a new government, or else to elect another body for 
the purpose ; and that an order should be issued, by the Con- 
gress, to the committees of the several counties, for calling 
the people together to express their sentiments on the subject, 
by the usual mode of elections. 

This report, by taking a middle ground between the princi- 
ples of the two motions, and compassing the objects of both, 
was approved and accepted. 

But before there was time to gain the sense of the people 
on this affair, a new topic of discussion came before the House. 
By a letter, dated June 8th, the New York representatives in 
the Continental Congress wrote as follows to the Provincial 
Congress. 

' Your delegates have expected, that the question of inde- 
pendence will very shortly be agitated in Congress. Some of 
us consider ourselves as bound by our instructions not to vote 
on that question, and all wish to have your sentiments thereon. 
The matter will admit no delay. We have, therefore, sent an 
express, who will wait your orders.' 

This letter, the journals state, was read with closed doors. 
A letter from the President of the Virginia Convention had, 
also, been very recently received, enclosing the resolves of 
that body, on the 22d of May, instructing the Virginia dele- 
gates in the Continental Congress to bring forward and sustain 
a pioposition for independence. The New York delegates 
were still acting under their original instructions, which had 
not been changed, and which empowered them only to consent 
and determine on such measures, as should be ' effectual for 



94 LIFE OF 

the re-establishment and preservation of American rights and 
privileges,' and the ' restoration of harmony ' between Great 
Britain and the colonies. With such powers, it was clear 
they could take no efficient part in the deliberations for inde- 
pendence. Hence their letter demanding further advice. 

The subject was now brought fairly before the House, and 
in a manner that made it necessary for them to act. At this 
juncture, Mr Jay presented a resolution, which was unanimously 
agreed to, and which paved* the way to the happy results that 
followed. The purport of it was, that, as the people of the 
colony had not authorized their representatives to declare the 
colony independent of Great Britain, and yet, as recent events 
required some determination on this, as well as many other 
important points, it was necessary for the powers of the 
representatives to be enlarged, and it was therefore ' resolv- 
ed, that it should be earnestly recommended to the free- 
holders and other electors, not only to invest the deputies with 
the authority heretofore required, for instituting a new form of 
government, but also ' with full power to deliberate and deter- 
mine on every question whatever, that may concern or effect 
the interest of this colony, and to conclude upon, ordain, and 
execute every act and measure, which to them shall appear 
conducive to the happiness, security, and welfare of this colo- 
ny, and that they hold and exercise the said powers, until the 
second Tuesday in May next, or until a regular form of govern- 
ment shall be established,' and, moreover, 'to instruct or other- 
wise to inform the said deputies of their sentiments, relative to 
the great question of independency, and such other points as 
they may think proper.' The latitude and comprehensive- 
ness of this resolve were calculated, as soon as it should come 
in a proper manner before the people, to put an end to all 
further doubts, as to the objects and extent of powers in the 
Congress. 

There are still existing the fragments of a speech, made by 
Mr Morris, in the course of the debates on the proposition for 
adopting a new plan of government, which he wrote out after 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 95 

it was delivered. Jts precise date I am unable to determine. 
The first half is missing, but a few extracts from the remainder 
will give some idea of his opinions, on the subjects discussed, 
as well as of his manner of writing at that time. He was now 
Twenty-four years old. 

In the exordium, and first half of his speech, the orator seems 
to have delineated to his audience the origin of the political 
difficulties, which the nation then labored under, and to have 
come to the conclusion, that old forms and old connexions 
were inevitably dissolved, and could no longer subsist ; that the 
years of childhood and vassalage were passed ; and that the time 
had come, when America was imperiously called on to assume 
the claims, and maintain the dignity, of manhood and self confi- 
dence. In despatching these preliminaries, he touches on the 
hackneyed theme of reconciliation, the phantom, which had so 
long played its illusions in the fancy of his associates in the 
New York Congress. 

' Undoubtedly, Sir,' said he, ' you will find some state car- 
penter, ready to frame this disjointed government, and warrant 
his work. And if there should be some flaws, considering the 
protection you receive from Britain, you ought to put up with 
them. I know he will tell you so. Protection, Sir, is a very 
good thing, yet a man may pay too much for diamonds. 
There is a common story of a certain juggler, who would un- 
dertake to cut off a man's head, and clap it on again so neatly, 
as to cure him without a scar. Much such a sort of juggling 
business is this protection we are to receive. Great Britain 
will not fail to bring us into a war with some of her neighbors, 
and then protect us as a lawyer defends a suit ; the client 
paying for it. This is quite in form, but a wise man would 
rather, I think, get rid of the suit and the lawyer together. 
Again, how are we to be protected ? If a descent is made 
upon our coasts, and the British navy and army are three 
thousand miles off, we cannot receive very great benefit from 
them on that occasion. If, to obviate this inconvenience, we 
have an army and navy constantly among us, who can say 



96 LIFE OP 

that we shall not need a little protection against them ? We 
may indeed put a clause in the agreement, that Britain shall 
not use them to enslave us ; and then all will be safe, for we 
cannot suppose they will break their promise. 

' Thus I find, Sir, that with the help of a little paper and 
ink, we may draw out a long treaty, filled with cautious items, 
and wise et ceteras. Then the whole affair is settled. Amer- 
ica is quite independent of Great Britain, except that they 
have the same King ; for although the British Parliament is 
allowed to possess, under the name of supremacy, an immense 
train of legislative powers, there are contained in the agree- 
ment strict inhibitions from using any one of them. Thus it 
is settled, I say, for seven years. Not a day further. The 
very next Parliament, not being bound by the acts of the 
former, the whole is in law as to them a nullity. Our ac- 
knowledgment of supremacy binds us as subjects, and our 
most exquisite restrictions, being contrary to the very nature 
of civil society, are merely void. Remember, too, that no 
faith is to be kept with rebels. 

' In this case, or in any other case, if we fancy ourselves 
hardly dealt with, 1 maintain there is no redress but by arms. 
For it never yet was known, that, when men assume power, 
they will part with it again unless by compulsion. Now the 
bond of continental union once broken, a vast load of debt ac- 
cumulated, many lives lost, and nothing got, I wonder wheth- 
er the people of this country would again choose to put them- 
selves into the hands of a Congress, even if a general attack 
were made upon their liberties. But undoubtedly the whole 
continent would not run to arms immediately, upon an attempt 
against one of the colonies, and thus, one after another, we 
should infallibly be subjugated to that power, which we know 
would destroy even the shadow of liberty among us.' * 



* The idea of a combined union of movement in the colonies, and 
of its necessity in accomplishing a desired end, is beautifully expressed 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 97 

Having thus closed the first part of his discourse, he pro- 
ceeded to the subject of independence, showing first what it is, 
and next, that in all its essential characteristics it then existed in 
reality, though not in name, even in the colony of New York. 

' These, and ten thousand other reasons, Sir, all serve to 
convince me, that, to make a solid and lasting peace, with lib- 
erty and security, is utterly impracticable. My argurnent } 
therefore, stands thus. As a connexion with Great Britain 
cannot again exist, without enslaving America, an indepen- 
dence is absolutely necessary. I cannot balance between the 
two. We run a hazard in one path, I confess, but then, we 
are infallibly ruined if we pursue the other. 

' Let us, however, act fairly. Let us candidly examine this 
Independence. Let us look back, for much of the journey is 
past ; and forward, for much is yet to come. Many objects 
are hideous, only from the distance at which they are viewed. 
Strict scrutiny may sometimes give us the demonstration of 
sense, that things frightful at the first appearance, are never- 
theless of great utility. It is the perfection of man to be guid- 
ed by reason. And above all men, those, who are entrusted 
with public concerns, should as much as possible divest them- 
selves of every prejudice and passion. Without passion or 
prejudice, therefore, let us coolly go round this subject and ex- 
amine it on every side. 



by John Dickinson, in a letter to Josiah Quincy, dated June 20th, 1774. 
' Doubt not that everything bears a most favorable aspect. Nothing 
can throw us into a pernicious confusion, but one colony's breaking the 
line of opposition, by advancing too hastily before the rest. The one 
which dares to betray the common cause by rushing forward, contrary 
to the maxims of discipline established by common sense, and the ex- 
perience of ages, will inevitably and utterly perish.' Memoir of Josiah 
Quino/, Jr. p. 169. It is possible this was meant as a gentle hint to Mr 
Quincy, and his friends in Massachusetts, who, if they had not broken 
the line, were at least in the van of the column, and pressing forward 
with an eagerness not exactly relished, by many of their more prudent 
compatriots at that time.

' Here it will be necessary to determine in what it consists, 
which will naturally open our attention to what further steps 
are necessary to the completion of it. Sir, I believe no such 
thing as perfect independence ever yet existed in any State. 
The wants and weaknesses of cities, kingdoms, and empires, 
like the wants and weaknesses of the miserable people who 
inhabit them, form mutual connexions, relations, and depen- 
dencies, necessarily adapted to various purposes. Indepen- 
dence then, applied to communities, can mean nothing more than 
the powers which separate societies exercise among them- 
selves. These relate to the society, compared either with its 
component parts, or with other societies. As to the first, it 
comprehends legislation, and distributive justice. The second 
consists in coining money, raising armies, regulating com- 
merce, peace, war, and treaties. These, Sir, I take to be the 
grand lineaments and characteristics, which mark out indepen- 
dence. Go farther, and you will degenerate into quibbling 
logicians. To them and dictionary makers let us leave all 
nicer distinctions ; and see how far America may, or may not, 
be termed an independent State. 

' First, as to legislation. I do candidly confess, that I meet 
with no laws, which you have passed in the usual style of be it 
enacted ; but your cogent recommendations, with the penalties 
of disobedience affixed, are far from unfrequent. Secondly, 
as to distributive justice. At the first view, indeed, it seems 
not to have been your object, because writs run and judges sit as 
they were wont to do, and the King of England is (by fiction 
of law) present at every court on the continent. Sir, when 
this system was first organized, we found a very good code of 
civil laws in being. The wisdom of ages has been collected 
for their perfection, and we must have been losers by a 
change. But if you should think proper to shut up the shop 
of justice, not wantonly, but from evident necessity, will any 
man pretend to deny, that the law would from that single breath 
become a dead letter ? And if any other government should 
take a step of this kind, without evident necessity, the subjects 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 99 

of that government would revolt at least as readily, as the in- 
habitants of this country. We do not find, that there was any 
immediate and personal act of the prince necessary for the ex- 
ercise of the law, unless perhaps the affixing a piece of wax 
now and then to a piece of paper or parchment. And I be- 
lieve we may find men in this country, quite as well skilled in 
that manufacture, as any English workmen. If not, I am con- 
fident we may import as many workmen as we please. But, 
Sir, what says the law to the present resistance ? We have 
lawyers enough among us, to tell what the law books say. 
Many hard names are there stored up for such occasions, of 
which I believe the very gentlest and smoothest kind are ri- 
otously and routously. Yet from the general silence of judges 
and juries, I cannot but think that the people consider this 
House as the sovereign power, a resistance of whose com- 
mands is that resistance, which all these hard words are lev- 
elled at. Let us consider the matter a little further. Pray, 
if we had found the people of this country without any law 
whatever, or (what amounts to the same thing,) if his Majesty 
should send a frigate to bring over his governors, counsellors, 
judges, great seal, and the like, in such case should we hesitate 
a moment to provide proper laws and proper tribunals ? Did 
we, in such instances as the law was deficient in, did we there 
hesitate ? Or rather, have we not a strict tribunal for the laws 
of Congress in every committee ? To affirm then, that the 
distribution of justice is not in the hands of this House, argues 
great want of attention, and ignorance of our public proceedings. 
To make short of this part of my argument, I take Massachu- 
setts Bay as an instance in point, which renders further rea- 
soning unnecessary. 

' We find, therefore, the characteristic marks and insignia of 
independence in this society, considered in itself, and com- 
pared with other societies. The enumeration is cdnviction. 
Coining money, raising armies, regulating commerce, peace, 
war, all these things you are not only adepts in, but masters of. 
Treaties alone remain, and even those you have dabbled at.

Georgia you put under the ban of the empire, and received 
her upon repentance as a member of the flock. Canada you 
are now treating with France and Spain you ought to treat 
with, and the rest is but a name. I believe, Sir, the Romans 
were as much governed, or rather oppressed, by their empe- 
rors, as ever any people were by their king. But emperor 
was more agreeable to their ears, than king. Some, nay ma- 
ny persons in America, dislike the word independence. For 
my own part, I see no reason why Congress is not full as good 
a word as States- General, or Parliament, and it is a mighty 
easy matter to please people, when a single sound will effect 
it. 

' From these remarks on the nature of Independence, and on 
the fact that it already exists in everything but in name, the 
speaker turns to a consideration of the advantages of a sepa- 
ration from England, or of sliding into what he calls the ' un- 
avoidable situation' of an independent government. These 
advantages he ranks under three heads, peace, liberty, security. 

' Whether a State shall enjoy peace or suffer war, depends 
upon two great leading circumstances ; the probability of at- 
tack, and the means of defence. As to the probability of at- 
tack, we must consider by whom it is to be made, in what 
manner, and for what purpose. It is quite a hackneyed top- 
ic, boldly insisted on, though very lightly assumed, that the 
instant an American independence is declared, we shall have 
all the powers of Europe on our backs, as by a general con- 
sent, to share out this country amongst them. 

' Experience, Sir, has taught those powers, and will teach 
them more clearly every day, that an American war is tedious, 
expensive, uncertain, and ruinous. Three thousand miles of 
a boisterous ocean are to be passed over, and the vengeful 
tempests, which whirl along our coasts, are daily to be encoun- 
tered in such expeditions. At least three months' expense 
must be incurred, before one gun can be fired against an Amer- 
ican village ; and three months more, before each shattered ar- 
mament can find an asylum for repose. A hardy, brave peo- 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 101 

pie, or else a destructive climate, must be subdued, while the 
troops, exhausted by fatigue, find at every step that desertion 
and happiness are synonymous terms. Grant, that with a 
wasteful dissipation of blood and treasure, some little portion 
of this vast country may be conquered. Fortresses remain to 
be built, magazines provided, and garrisons established, for the 
defence of a broad desolation, not worth one shilling to the 
possessors. Or should it better please a maritime power, (and 
we have none but these to fear) should it please them to carry 
on a naval war, pray where is the American property, which 
will pay the expenses of a European armament ? 

' Nations do not make war without some view. Should 
they be able to conquer America, it would cost them more to 
maintain such conquest, than the fee simple of the country is 
worth. They could gain nothing but our commerce, and that 
they may have without striking a blow. Thus, Sir, it appears 
to my poor discernment an incontrovertible truth, that no 
nation whatever would incline to attack us. For after all, this 
consideration must arise amongst them, that the surest conse- 
quence of the most splendid votaries would be a bloody war 
with each other about sharing the spoils. 

' But I cannot think it will ever come to this. For when I 
turn my eyes to the means of defence, I find them amply 
sufficient. We have all heard, that in the last war America 
was conquered in Germany. 1 hold the converse of this pro- 
position to be true, namely, that in, and by America, his 
Majesty's German dominions were secured. The last, and 
every other war for more than a century, have been determin- 
ed more by the wealth, than the arms of contending nations: 
and the great source of that wealth is in the western world, 
It rises here, flourishes in Europe, and is buried in India. 
The situation of this continent formerly did, and still does en- 
able us in a very great degree to check that flood of property, 
which thus glides along to the eastward. The rapacity of ad- 
venturers will greedily seize the opportunity of becoming rich, 
by pressing upon the merchandize of other people. And large

convoys for merchant ships are equally expensive and ineffi- 
cacious. I appeal to experience. As to the project of shut- 
ting up all the creeks and harbors along this extensive coast, 
this is calculated only for the meridian of St James's, and be- 
comes daily an object of ridicule, even to our women and chil- 
dren. I know the objection, that as we ourselves are a 
trading people, we may suffer equal loss with our foes. Al- 
though I cannot admit this in its fullest latitude, yet it has 
some weight. But it leads to a very obvious consequence, 
that is to say, an American navy. Gentlemen may either 
start or smile at this idea, as it chances to raise their contempt 
or admiration. Let us consider it. Would a fleet consist- 
ing of ten sixty, ten fifty, and ten forty gun ships, with ten 
sloops of twenty, and thirty of ten guns, would such a fleet, Sir, 
make a respectable figure in the defence of our coasts ? Some 
persons will say, yes, but where are you to get them ? Why, 
Sir, the materials are amongst us, and five millions dollars will fit 
them all out for a six months' voyage. I shall be told, that is 
very pretty scheming, and asked perhaps how the expense of 
this fleet is to be maintained. I would not lay heavy imposts 
upon trade. I am sure five per cent, upon all commodities 
imported into this continent, would be a very trivial tax, and 
there certainly are not less than twenty millions of dollars in 
value, annually imported. This would yield one million, and 
that is sufficient to keep your navy afloat. And with such a 
navy it would be still more inconvenient to attack this country. 
See what effects have followed from fitting out a few little in- 
significant vessels, under the name of privateers. The last 
mode of defence consists in having a respectable army. I do 
not mean an armed banditti, to become our masters. The 
officers of your standing army should be regularly paid, and 
the profession by that means cultivated. But the soldiers 
should never be enlisted, except when actual service required 
it ; and, lest we should then be at a loss for good ones, it 
should be provided by wholesome militia laws, that every man 
in the country should know the duties of a soldier. 



GOUVERNEUR MORHIS. 103 

{ Thus, Sir, by means of that great gulph which rolls its 
waves between Europe and America, by the situation of these 
colonies, always adapted to hinder or interrupt all communica- 
tion between the two, by the productions of our soil, which 
the Almighty has filled with every necessary to make us a 
great maritime people, by the extent of our coasts and those 
immense rivers, which serve at once to open a communication 
with our interior country, and teach us the arts of navigation, 
by those vast fisheries, which, affording an inexhaustible mine 
of wealth and a cradle of industry, breed hardy mariners, inur- 
ed to danger and fatigue, finally by the unconquerable spirit 
of freemen, deeply interested in the preservation of a govern- 
ment, which secures to them the blessings of liberty, and exalts 
the dignity of mankind ; by all these, I expect a full and last- 
ing defence against any and every part of the earth ; while 
the great advantages to be derived from a friendly intercourse 
with this country almost render the means of defence unne- 
cessary, from the great improbability of being attacked. So 
far peace seems to smile upon our future independence. 
But that this fair goddess will equally crown our union with 
Great Britain, my fondest hopes cannot lead me even to sup- 
pose. Every war, in which she is engaged, must necessarily 
involve us in its detestable consequences ; whilst weak and 
unarmed, we have no shield of defence, unless such as she 
may please (for her own sake) to afford, or else the pity of her 
enemies, and the insignificance of slaves, beneath the attention 
of a generous foe. 

' Let us next turn our attention to a question of infinitely 
greater importance, namely, the liberty of this country. I 
speak here only of political liberty, and this may, I believe, 
be secured by the simplest contrivance imaginable. If Ame- 
rica is divided into small districts, and the election of members 
into Congress annual, and every member incapacitated from 
serving more than one year out of three, I cannot conceive the 
least temptation to an abuse of power, in the legislative and 
executive parts of government. And as long as those foun- 



LIFE OF 

tains are pure, the streams of justice will flow clear and whole- 
some. But shall we pretend to say, that we have political lib- 
erty, while subject to the legislative control of Great Britain ? 
Even freed from that, will not the silent efforts of influence 
undermine any constitution we can possibly devise ? And of 
what importance is it to the subject, whether a love of pow- 
er or a love of money, whether avarice or ambition, are the 
causes of his unhappiness ? If I were to choose a master, 
it should be a single tyrant, because I had infinitely rather be 
torn by a lion, than eaten by vermin. 

' The last consideration, Sir, is security, and so long as the 
system of laws by which we are now governed shall prevail, 
it is amply provided for in every separate colony. There 
may indeed arise an objection, because some gentlemen sup- 
pose, that the different colonies will carry on a sort of land 
piracy against each other. But how this can possibly happen, 
when the idea of separate colonies no longer exists, I cannot 
for my soul comprehend. That something very like this has 
already been done, I shall not deny, but the reason is as evi- 
dent as the fact. We never yet had a government in this 
country, of sufficient energy to restrain the lawless and indi- 
gent. Whenever a form of government is established, which 
deserves the name, these insurrections must cease. But who 
is the man so hardy as to affirm, that they will not grow with 
our growth, while on every occasion we must resort to an 
English judicature to terminate differences, which the max- 
ims of policy will teach them to leave undetermined ? By de- 
grees we are getting beyond the utmost pale of English gov- 
ernment. Settlements are forming to the westward 'of us, 
whose inhabitants acknowledge no authority but their own, 
and of consequence no umpire but the sword. The King of 
England will make no new grants, the settlers will ask none. 
We occupy but a small strip of land along the sea coasts, and 
in less than fifty years those western settlements will endeav- 
or to carve out for themselves a passage to the ocean. Are 
we then to build a huge wall against them ? Are we to solicit 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 105 

assistance from Britain ? Vain thought ! Britain, already- 
sinking under a vast load of debt, and hastening to ruin by the 
loss of freedom, without which even the interest of that debt 
cannot be paid, Britain will have enemies enough of her 
own. If we seize the present opportunity, we shall have 
no such causes of apprehensiou. Those settlements, sensible 
of their present weakness and our power, will all be made un- 
der the authority of that body, which is the legislature of the 
continent. They will constantly look up to it for laws and 
protection.' 

He hints at several other advantages of independence, be- 
sides the three broad and extensive ones already enumeraed, 
particularly a flourishing commerce, augmentation of wealth, 
increase of population, and diffusion of knowledge, which 
would ' cause all nations to resort hither as an asylum from 
oppression ;' and adds, 

1 Nothing more remains but to say a word on the inconve- 
niences, to which an independent form of government would 
subject us. And what are they ? A war with Great Britain. 
And in that very war are we already engaged. Perhaps some 
gentlemen may be apprehensive of losing a little conse- 
quence, and importance, by living in a country where all are 
on an equal footing. Virtue in such'a country will always be 
esteemed, and that alone should be respected in any country. 
If these gentlemen would reflect, that free republican states 
are always most thickly inhabited, perhaps they may be of 
opinion with me, that the indulgence of a few in luxurious 
ease, to the prejudice of their fellow creatures, is at best not 
laudable ; but when it tends to thin the ranks of mankind, and 
to encourage a general profligacy of manners, it is then crim- 
inal in the highest degree. 

' I do not scruple to affirm, that all dangers to be appre- 
hended from an independency, may well be obviated by this 
Assembly. If we so regulate our own power, as to give per- 
fect freedom in our Constitution, there is but little danger of 
intestine broils. For mankind, however chargeable with levi- 



106 LIFE OF 

ty on other accounts, are by no means prone to change their 
form of government, so long as it is merely tolerable. And 
this leads me, Sir, to consider the last objection to indepen- 
dence, which I shall take on me to mention. It is, the re- 
luctance which many Americans feel for this measure. 

' The reluctance, Sir, is laudable for the greater part. It 
is a pratriotic emotion. Tn some cases, religion has a share 
in the sentiment. It is said, what check have we upon the 
members of Congress ? If they abuse their power and estab- 
lish an oligarchy, where are the means of redress ? How 
shall we know, that they will return willingly into the ranks 
of citizens, after so great elevation ? Is there not great rea- 
son to fear, that the American army may choose a different 
kind of government, from the rest of the people ? And, say 
they, although Providence has kindly interfered so far for our 
preservation, how dare we expect his future assistance, when 
canceling the oaths of our allegiance, or staining the cause 
with perjury? 

' To most of these questions we may make a satisfactory an- 
swer, without seeming to know that they were ever asked. 
As to danger arising from the love of power among ourselves, 
I cannot believe there is any. Nor do I think it quite proper 
for us all to abandon the Senate House, and leave the busi- 
ness to entire new men, while the country continues in its pre- 
sent dangerous situation. But the instant we are determined 
to cut off the small connexion, which remains with Great Brit- 
ain, we ought by our conduct to convince our countrymen, that 
a fondness for power does not possess the smallest corner 
of our hearts. And we should from this moment take care, 
that the gift of all commissions be reserved to this House. 
This will cure the inquietudes of the patriotic breast. 

' Now let me earnestly ask, why should we hesitate ? Have 
you the least hope in treaty ? Will you even think of it, be- 
fore certain acts of Parliament are repealed ? Have you 
heard of any such repeal ? Will you trust these commission- 
ers? Is there any act of parliament passed to ratify what 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 107 

they shall do ? No, they come from the King. We have no 
business with the King. We did not quarrel with the King. 
He has officiously made himself a party in the dispute against 
us. And now he pretends to be the umpire. Trust croco- 
diles, trust the hungry wolf in your flock, or a rattlesnak nei 
your bosom, you may yet be something wise. But trust the 
King, his Ministers, his Commissioners, it is madness in the 
extreme ! Remember, I conjure you to remember ! You 
have no legal check upon that legislature. They are not 
bound in interest, duty, or affection to watch over your preser- 
vation, as over that of their constituents ; and those constitu- 
ents are daily betrayed. What can you expect? You are 
not quite mad. Why will you trust them ? Why force your- 
selves to make a daily resort to arms ? Shall we never again 
see peace ! Is this miserable country to be plunged in an 
endless war? Must each revolving year come heavy laden 
with those dismal scenes, which we have already witnessed ? 
If so, farewell liberty, farewell virtue, farewell happiness !' 

Immediately after making this speech, Mr Morris was sent 
on a special mission to the Continental Congress at Philadel- 
phia. For some reason not explained, the New England 
troops during the last campaign had been receiving higher 
wages, than those of New York and the other middle colonies. 
This discrimination of course created uneasiness, and produc- 
ed an early remonstrance from the New York Congress, 
which seems not to have met with due attention. At all 
events, the evil was not corrected, and when levies of militia in 
the middle and eastern colonies were requested by the conti- 
nental Congress for the defences of New York, and to strength- 
en the army, and this without any new provisions for regulat- 
ing the amount of payment, the New York Congress thought 
it necessary to come to an immediate and explicit under- 
standing on the subject. 

Accordingly a letter was written to the Continental Con- 
gress, setting forth the grounds of complaint, and referring to 
Mr Morris as their authorized agent to make further explana- 



108 LIFE OF 

tions, and to unite in devising any proper means of redress. 
The letter states, that a due regard to the honor of the colony 
would no longer permit a silent acquiescence in so odious a 
discrimination, which, if not resisted, might lead posterity to 
suppose, that it was founded on some just principles ; for al- 
though the merit of the eastern forces was readily conceded, 
yet no one could pretend, that it was higher than that of the 
troops in the other colonies, or that justice did not demand 
them all to be put on the same footing. ' And it would nei- 
ther be wise nor honest,' continues the letter, ' to conceal from 
the Congress the discontents, that have arisen from the con- 
tinuance of this invidious distinction ; they are too great and 
too general not to injure the service, and therefore merit the 
notice and attention of those, who alone can remove them.' 
The evil was further increased by the custom, which had be- 
come common with the inhabitants of New York, of leaving 
that colony and joining the New England regiments, because 
they received higher pay. 

Armed with this letter, and with private instructions, Mr Morris 
appeared in Philadelphia, and laid the matter before the Conti- 
nental Congress. In so plain a case, to be sure, it could hard- 
ly require much force of reasoning, or of eloquence, to convince 
the members of that assembly of the justice and necessity of 
his demands. The business was soon settled in accordance 
with his wishes, and a vote was passed, making the pay of all 
the troops in the middle and eastern colonies equal. This was 
done by raising the former to a level with the latter. The con- 
verse mode of reducing the higher to the lower, though better 
suited to the financial condition of the country, would probably 
have been a dangerous experiment. Having effected the pur- 
pose of his mission, Mr Morris returned, and after a week's 
absence resumed his post in the New York Congress. 

The crisis of affairs was now becoming too critical and dan- 
gerous, to allow the New York Congress to deliberate or act 
upon any other concerns, than such as pertained to the imme- 
diate defence of the Colonv. Sir William Howe arrived at 



GOUVERNEUR MORKIS. 109 

Sandy Hook on the 25th of June, and three days afterwards he 
was joined by the whole British fleet and forces from Halifax. 
An immediate attack was expected. The Congress at once 
invested General Washington with a kind of dictatorial power 
over the military strength of the colony, authorizing him to call 
out such portions of the militia, as he should think proper for 
defence, and march them at his discretion to any place within 
the limits of the colony, and also to apprehend disaffected per- 
sons, whom he thought dangerous to the security of the colony, 
and the liberties of America. Having entrusted this power to 
the commander in chief, the Congress had little to do hut to 
second his views, and aid in executing his orders. Indeed, 
they retired from the city of New York on the 30th of June, 
and assembled at the White Plains three days afterwards. A 
few members only met at that lime, nor was there a full num- 
ber for business, till the 8th of July, the day appointed for the 
opening of the new Congress, to whom the people by a recent 
election had granted the powers of forming a plan of govern- 
ment, and deciding on the subject of independence. 

In the mean time, a letter was received from the New York 
delegates in the Continental Congress, enclosing a draft of the 
Declaration of Independence, which had been reported on the 
28th of June. This came to hand three days after its date, and, 
together with the draft, was leferred to a committee, of whom 
Mr Jay was chairman. Another letter was also received, 
bearing date the second of July, in which the delegates stated 
the great embarrassments under which they labored, for want of 
instructions. The subject of independence had been agitated 
in Congress the day before, and was to be again brought for- 
ward on that day, and the proposition would certainly be 
adopted, as every other colony except New York had either 
sent their delegates positive instructions to that effect, or left 
them free to act according to their own judgment. As for 
themselves, their hands were tied, and they could neither 
vote one way nor the other. 

What then should be done, after the resolution was final- 

VOL. I. 10 



110 LIFE or 

ly adopted ? They had no authority from their constituents 
to take part in an independent government, and yet the condi- 
tion of things was so peculiar in New York, while threatened 
by an overwhelming military invasion, that their votes in the 
Congress might be of the utmost importance to the interests of 
the colony, which they represented. Under these circumstan- 
ces, what should they do ? Should they retire from the Con- 
gress, or remain there ? And when there, should they vote or 
not? 'Our situation,' say they, 'is singular and delicate, no 
other colony being similarly situated, with whom we can con- 
sult. We wait then for your earliest advice and instructions, 
whether we are to consider our colony bound by the vote of the 
majority in favor of independency, and vote at large on such 
questions as may arise in consequence thereof,'or only concur 
in such measures, as may be absolutely necessary for the com- 
mon safety and defence of America,, exclusive of the idea of 
independency. We fear it will be difficult to draw the line; 
but once possessed of your instructions, we will use our best 
endeavors to follow them.'* 

From these perplexities they were soon relieved. Inde- 
pendence was declared on the fourth of July, and the intelli- 
gence was communicated to the New York Assembly, by the 
following letter from the President of Congress. 

' Philadelphia, July 6th, 1776.

human actions, yet it is nevertheless a duty we owe to our-

from New York declared they were for it themselves, and were assur- 
ed their constitutenls were for it,' but, as they had no authority by 
their instructions, ' they thought themselves not justifiable in voting on 
either side, and asked leave to withdraw from the question, which 
was granted.' Jefferson's Memoir, Correspondence, &c. Vol. i. p. 15.

the best manner we are able, and to trust the event to that Be- 
ing, who controls both causes and events, so as to bring about 
his own determinations. 

' Impressed with this sentiment, and at the same time fully 
convinced, that our affairs may take a more favorable turn, the 
Congress have judged it necessary to dissolve all connexion 
between Great Britain and the American Colonies, and to de- 
clare them free and independent States, as you will perceive 
by the enclosed Declaration, which I am directed to transmit 
to you, and to request that you will have it proclaimed in your 
colony, in the way you shall think most proper. 

' The important consequences to the American States of 
this Declaration of Independence, considered as the ground and 
foundation of a future government, will naturally suggest the 
propriety of having it proclaimed in such a manner, as that the 
people may be universally informed of it. I have the honor 
to be, &c. 

'JoHN HANCOCK.' 

This letter reached the new Congress, at the moment of its 
meeting at the White Plains, fully authorized and prepared to 
act on its contents, the draft of the Declaration having already 
been seven days in the hands of the committee. It came be- 
fore the House immediately, (July 9th,) and the resolution 
was unanimously passed, ' That the reasons assigned by the 
Continental Congress, for declaring the united Colonies free 
and independent States, are cogent and conclusive, and that, 
while we lament the cruel necessity, which has rendered that 
measure unavoidable, we approve the same, and will, at the 
risk of our lives and fortunes, join with the other colonies in 
supporting it, and that the delegates of this State in the Con- 
tinental Congress be, and they are hereby, authorized to con- 
sult and adopt all such measures, as they may deem condu- 
cive to the happiness and welfare of the United States of Ame- 
rica.' 

Thus was the finishing stroke put to the Declaration of In- 
dependence. Every other colony had assented to it by their 



112 LIFE OP 

delegates in the general Congress. It is curious to observe 
the rapid change in the tone of public feeling on this head 
in New York within a few weeks. The example of the other 
colonies, and the threatening and determined attitude of the 
Briiish fleet and army, may be considered the primary causes. 
The moderate men, whether such from timidity or caution, 
were now convinced, that the enemy was in earnest, and that 
they must either go with their country or against it. No 
neutral ground remained. In this extremity they could not 
hesitate, though they would willingly have lingered on the 
outskirts of uncertainty, while they could see any door of 
hope open before them. By the union of this class with the 
resolute and zealous friends of the cause, a sudden and pre- 
ponderating influence was gained, not only over their own ac- 
tions, but over the minds of the people. When the subjects of a 
new plan of government and independence were referred to the 
voters, they were not requested simply to give instructions on 
these points to the members of the Congress then existing, but 
to elect other members and leave out old ones, if they should 
see (it, so that in fact the delegates to this last Congress were 
actually chosen anew. The consequence was, that the elec- 
tion turned upon the pivot of government and independence, 
and the voice of the electors may be understood by the 
Unanimous vote of the Congress, in adopting the Declaration. 
A fortnight before, it would doubtless have met with many 
cold friends, and a few decided foes. 

The next step was to publish the Declaration, and the no- 
tice of its recognition, throughout the state. This was or- 
dered to be done in the several counties by beat of drum, 
and by such other modes of publicity, as the county commit- 
tees might devise. Five hundred copies were printed and cir- 
culated in handbills. The House resolved and ordered, on the 
same day, that its own tide should be changed, from that of the 
' Provincial Congress of the Colony of New York,' which it 
had hitherto borne, to that of the ' Convention of the Repre- 
sentatives of the State of New YorkS 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 113 

A few days subsequently, a letter was received by the Con- 
vention from John Alsop, one of the New York delegates in 
Congress. 

' Philadelphia, July 16th, 1776. 
' Gentlemen, 

' Yesterday our President read in Congress a resolve of 
your honorable body, dated the ninth instant, in which you 
declare New York a free and independent state. I can- 
not help saying, that I was much surprised to find it come 
through that channel. The usual method hitherto practised 
has been, for the Convention of each colony to give their dele- 
gates instructions to act and vote upon all and any important 
questions. And in the last letter we were favored with 
from your body, you told us that you were not competent, or 
authorized, to give us instructions on that grand question; nor 
have you been pleased to answer our letter of the second in- 
stant, any otherwise than by your said resolve, transmitted to 
the President. I think we were entitled to an answer. 

' 1 am compelled therefore to declare, that it is against my ^ 
judgment and inclination. As long as a door was left open 
for a reconciliation with Great Britain, upon honorable and 
just terms, I was willing and ready to render my country all 
the service in my power, and for which purpose I was ap- 
pointed and sent to this Congress ; but as you have, I presume, 
by that Declaration, closed the door of reconciliation, I must 
beg leave to resign my seat as a delegate from New York, 
and that I may be favored with an answer and my dismission. 
I have the honor to be, &c. 

'JonN ALSOP.' 

Upon reading this letter, it was ' resolved unanimously, that 
this Convention do cheerfully accept Mr Alsop's resignation,' 
and a committee was appointed to draft a letter to the dele- 
gates in Congress, enclosing a copy of this resolve. The 
draft was made by Gouverneur Morris, and signed by the 
President of the Convention. 

This was the last proceeding of the Ntvv York -Convention 
10* 



114 LIFE OF 

in the affair of independence. Considering the obstacles, 
which had impeded the progress ofliheral opinions and decid- 
ed measures in that colony, the result was, on the whole, more 
prompt and fortunate, than could have been expected. It 
came early enough to prevent the evil consequences of coun- 
teracting motives, distracted councils, or divided action, and 
to combine the several parts of the Union into one solid 
phalanx of opposition, to meet the shafts and repel the attacks 
of an invading foe. It may be regarded as a lucky circum- 
stance, that Mr Jay returned when he did to the Provincial 
Congress. His eminent talents, the perfect integrity of his 
character, his knowledge of business, and above all his patriot- 
ism and zeal, must have contributed at the same time to com- 
municate a salutary impulse to the people, and inspire his 
associates with a confidence in the strength of their cause. 

The scene of confusion, which now prevailed and continu- 
ed through the season, from the invasion of the enemy, the 
battle of Long Island, the surrender of New York, the capture 
of Fort Washington, the rencounters between the armies at 
White Plains, and other military disasters, deranged the pro- 
ceedings of the Convention, and prevented any deliberations, 
except upon subjects of the most pressing necessity. That 
body was obliged to assume a migratory character, sitting first 
at the White Plains, afterwards successively at Haerlem, Kings- 
bridge, Odell's house in Phillips's Manor, Croton River, and 
lastly at Fishkill, a position in the interior beyond the incur- 
sions of the enemy. Here, by a vote of the Convention, the 
members supplied themselves with arms and ammunition, to pre- 
vent a surprise, in case any hostile bands should intrude upon 
their retirement, thus* prepared to reverse the first part of 
Pliny's maxim, cedant arma toga, whatever might be the fate 
of the other part, concedat laurea lingua. They were often 
reduced to a very small number, organizing themselves one 
day in a Committee of Safety, and the next in Convention, as 
the case might be. The further consideration of a new form of 
government was suspended, but on the first of August a com- 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 115 

mittee of thirteen was appointed, with instructions to draft and 
report a plan. John Jay, Gouverneur Morris, and Robert R. 
Livingston, were members of this committee. Another impor- 
tant committee was also instituted, about the same time, for 
devising means to establish a state fund. Mr Morris was 
chairman ; and, indeed, he was usually made the leader in all 
financial concerns. 



CHAPTER VII. 

REGULATIONS RESPECTING TORIES. DRAFT OF A CONSTITUTION REPORTED 

TO THE CONVENTION. DEBATED IN CONVENTION. COUNCIL OF AP- 
POINTMENT. VIEWS OF JAY, MORRIS, AND LIVINGSTON. COUNCIL OF 

REVISION. TOLERATION. SLAVERY. CONSTITUTION ADOPTED. 

AMONG the most perplexing topics, which came from time 
to time under the notice of the New York Congress and Con- 
vention, was the case of the tories. So large a portion of 
the inhabitants, and many of them sustaining the first rank in 
society, were infected with principles deemed hostile to the in- 
terests of the country, that the manner in which they were to 
be dealt with, became a question of peculiar delicacy. When 
is was found, however, that these disaffected persons held cor- 
respondence with the enemy, refused to send delegates to the 
Congress, and were secretly arming themselves, prudence 
would not permit further delay, and resolves were passed au- 
thorizing the county committees to apprehend persons of this 
character, examine them, and decide on their guilt. The 
committees were likewise empowered to call on the militia, to 
aid in executing these resolves ; but they were to sit in judg- 
ment under oath, and the witnesses were also to be sworn. 
The punishment was left to the discretion of the judges, pro- 
vided it did not exceed three months' imprisonment at the ex- 
pense of the offender. In some cases it was a banishment of 
seven years from the colony. 



116 LIFE OF 

This system was pursued with vigilance, and some decree of 
success, till the British fleet arrived at New York, and the 
lories began to take new courage. A conspiracy was detected, 
in which there was reason to believe, that a plot was forming 
to seize Genenl Washington, and betray him and his army in- 
to the hands of the enemy. This and other symptoms caused 
a new alarm, and the Provincial Congress resorted to another set 
of resolutions, and appointed a special committee, of their own 
numbers, with Gouverneur Morris at its head, to take this mat- 
ter in charge. In these resolutions were inserted the names 
of certain persons, scattered throughout the colony, whom the 
committee were authorized to arrest and bring before them by 
a military force. Such persons as should be found guilty of 
affording aid or sustenance to the British fleets or armies, of 
decrying the continental currency, or of abetting any schemes 
to retard or oppose the measures taken by the colonies in their 
defence, were to be committed to safe custody. Under cer- 
tain conditions, and according to the complexion of the offence, 
and character of the person, they were allowed to go at large 
on parole, after giving due security for their good conduct. 
Suspicious persons, whose influence was considered dangerous 
over the minds of the people in their neighborhood, were to 
be removed out of the colony. The power of military arrests 
was extended to the committees of towns and smaller districts, 
but the persons arrested had a right to appeal to the county 
committees for trial. A standing force, of one hundred and 
fifty men, was for 1 some time kept up in Dulchess and West- 
chester counties, expressly for the purpose of apprehending 
tories. 

The consequence of these regulations was, that the prisons 
soon became thronged. As no constitution of government 
had yet been formed, nor courts of justice established, the 
prisoners could not be tried by law, and these examinations 
by committees were only considered temporary, and the pen- 
alty rather a provision for security, than a punishment. Con- 
fiscations had not yet begun. To prevent the mischiefs of 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 117 

crowded prisons, and the chance of the prisoners being rescu- 
ed by their friends, several of the most conspicuous were con- 
signed to the jails in Connecticut, where they were received 
and secured by the approbation of that government. Thirteen 
were at one time sent to Litchfield, among whom was the 
Mayor of New York, ' accused of treasonable practices,' al- 
though ' not of so black a die as those of the other conspira- 
tors.' The President of the Convention solicited in his favor, 
from the committee of Litchfield, ' every indulgence consist- 
ent with safe confinement.' He was charged with being con- 
cerned in the ways and doings of Governor Tryon. 

A partial systern of confiscations was put in practice, before 
the new form of government was completed. The person- 
al property of all such inhabitants of the State, as had joined 
the enemy, or were then with the enemy, was ordered to be 
sold at public vendue, and the proceeds deposited in the trea- 
sury of the state, to be afterwards disposed of at the discre- 
tion of the legislature. 

On the records of the Convention there is a resolve, which 
declares, that every person living in the State of New York, 
and deriving protection from the laws, owes allegiance to the 
State, that whoever among these gives aid or comfort to its 
enemies is ' guilty of treason against the State, and, being 
thereof convicted, shall suffer the pains and penalties of death? 
I know not whether any one was ever condemned under this 
resolve. It was meant rather as a declaration, than a law. 
In fact, neither the Provincial Congress, nor the Convention, 
assumed the power of making laws, nor of meddling with 
courts of justice. Their resolutions and recommendations 
were considered as temporary, urged by the necessity of the 
case, designed to preserve as much order and security as pos- 
sible, during the suspension of civil government, and to cease 
when that should again be raised on a regular and durable basis. 

There is a curious clause in a letter from the Convention to 
President Hancock, which was drafted by Gouverneur Morris, 
and dated the eleventh of July, two days after the recognition 



118 LIFE OF 

of independence by that House. ' We take the liberty,' say 
they in this letter, * of suggesting to your consideration the pro- 
priety of taking some measures, for expunging from the Book 
of Common Prayer such parts, and discontinuing in the con- 
gregations of all other denominations all such prayers, as in- 
terfere with the interests of the American cause. It is a sub- 
ject we are afraid to meddle with. The enemies of America 
have taken great pains to insinuate into the minds of the Epis- 
copalians, that the Church is in danger. We could wish the 
Congress would pass some resolve to quiet their fears, and we 
are confident it would do essential service to the cause of 
America, at least in this State.' The Convention would seem 
to have forgotten the epistle from their delegates in Congress, 
written some months before, in which Congress is said to have 
cautiously avoided everything, that could possibly bear on any 
religious dispute. To erase words from a book, or to exact 
a penalty for reading them in public, is, to be sure, a possible 
thing ; but what power, despotic or liberal, in a country 
where every individual is allowed to worship in his own way, 
could expect to take cognizance of the extemporaneous 
prayers of all the congregations, and prescribe the words 
which should be used or omitted ? Such an attempt, serious- 
ly entered upon at that time by the national legislature, would 
have been a greater bar to union and independence, than all 
the deep plots of tories, combined with the power of the En- 
glish fleets and armies.* 



* The tories were not the only people, who gave trouble to the 
New York patriots. If we may believe their records, the women were 
chargeable with some share in their legislative embarrassments. In the 
journals of the Convention for August twenty-sixth, is the following 
sentence. 'A letter from John Slight, chairman of the committee of 
Kingston, was received and read, stating that the women surround the 
committee chamber, and say, if they cannot have tea, their husbands 
and sons shall figkt no more.' 

The President replied, that it was in contemplation to pass a gene- 
ral resolve about tea, and that the business was before a committee. 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 119 

A letter from Mr Morris to his mother, written while the 
Convention was sitting at Fishkill, may properly be intro- 
duced in this place. It is alike honorable to his patriotism, 
and to his feelings as a son and a man. 

Fishkill, December 19th, 1776. 

* Dear Madam, 

' It is with inexpressible concern, that I am this day inform- 
ed of the death of my sister. We all sustain in her a great 
loss, but you in particular, who are thus bereft of the compan- 
ion of your age, must feel it most severely. Would to God it 
were in my power to alleviate the pangs of a sorrowing parent. 
But this is not my lot. My friend Wilkins will, I am sure, on 
this occasion do the duties of a child and a friend. There is 
one comforter, who weighs our minutes, and numbers out our 
days. It is He, who has inflicted upon us the weight of pub- 
lic and private calamities, and He best knows when to re- 
move the burthen. I am sorry it is not in my power to see 
you at present. I know it is your wish, that I were removed 
from public affairs ; indeed, as far as relates to my own ease 
and enjoyments, I wish so too. But I know it is the duty of 
every good citizen or man to preserve that post, in which by a 
superior order he is placed. Where the happiness of a con- 
siderable part of our fellow creatures is deeply concerned, we 
soon feel the insignificancy of an individual. And whatever lot 
that individual shall experience, while a conscious rectitude of 
conduct inspires and supports him, though he may be unfor- 
tunate, he cannot be miserable. 

' What may be the event of the present war, it is not in man 
to determine. Great revolutions of empire are seldom achiev- 
ed without much human calamity ; but the worst, which can 



who had been hitherto prevented from reporting.' I am therefore di- 
rected,' he adds, 'to acquaint you, that the Convention expect you 
will use your utmost endeavors to keep peace and good order amongst 
you, in the manner you best can, till such resolution shall be passed.'

happen, is to fall on the last bleak mountain of America, and 
he who dies there, in defence of the injured rights of mankind, 
is happier than his conqueror, more beloved by mankind, more 
applauded by his own heart. 

' The death of my sister has incapacitated me for mirth ; my 
letter, therefore, is of an improper complexion to one already 
afflicted. My love to my sisters, to Wilkins, whose integrity 
I love and respect, to the good natured Counsellor of Ber- 
muda, and such others as deserve it. The number is not 
great. 

' Pray believe me most sincerely your affectionate son. 

' GOUVERNEUR MoRRIS.' 

The Convention, or rather the Committee of Safety, for such 
was the character of the House at this time, adjourned from 
Fishkill on the fourteenth. of February, 1777, and met at Kings- 
ton five days afterwards. The constitution had been lingering 
for two months in the hands of the committee, nor indeed was 
it reported to the Convention till a month later. There was a 
party, who thought this movement for a constitution premature, 
that it would be safer to wait for a period of more tranquillity, 
and a fairer prospect of calm reflection and deliberation among 
the members, and when the people 1 kewise would be in a bet- 
ter condition to understand and receive the results of their la- 
bors. Of this opinion was Mr Jay, and as he was the first 
on the list of the committee for drafting the constitution, it is 
probable that his views of the salutary tendency of delay, may 
have retarded the progress of the work. He adopted the 
poet's motto, festinare nocet, and considered caution as the 
garland of wisdom, in a movement of so high a bearing on the 
destinies of the republic. 

Tempore quaeque suo qui facit, i!le sapit. 

At last, however, on the twelfth of March, the committee 
presented their report to the Convention, and the field of re- 
vision and discussion was opened to the House. It must be 
borne in mind, that the Convention was not assembled for the 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 121 

express purpose of forming a constitution. All the usual bu- 
siness of that body was in progress at the same time. After 
the report was made, the constitution became the order of the 
day, and was called up and examined by paragraphs, from day 
to day, on such occasions as the other more pressing concerns 
of the House would permit. In this way it was five weeks un- 
der deliberation. 

But after all, the instrument passed through the ordeal with 
very few amendments, and it is probable that Mr Jay's tardy 
speed, in preparing it, may have saved time in the end, by ma- 
turing the views of the committee, enabling them to get the 
sense of the most enlightened members, and thus to bring it in 
a more finished shape before the Convention. Two or three 
points only were debated with much warmth, or were essen- 
tially amended. The greatest difficulty was experienced, in 
determining where to lodge the power of appointing officers, 
both civil and military, and by what mode this power should be 
exercised. No wonder that this should be a perplexing topic 
to new beginners in the art of government-making, and espe- 
cially when a plan embracing many original and untried fea- 
tures was to be contrived. It was easy to form a practical 
system, for regulating the powers and proceedings of the exe- 
cutive, legislature, and judiciary, as far as the specific duties 
of each were concerned, and also the electoral franchise, be- 
cause there were very good jnodels in several of the old colo- 
nial governments, and experience afforded all necessary light ; 
but, in what hands to place the power of selecting officers of 
various ranks, how far this should be entrusted to the people 
in the form of elections, and how far confined within the nar- 
rower limits of executive control, these were questions full of 
difficulties and shrouded in doubts. After many schemes and 
suggestions, the Convention at last hit upon the memorable 
Council of Appointment, which afterwards figured so conspicu- 
ously in the politics of New York, and which by degrees 
brought down upon its head such a load of unpopularity, that, in 

VOL. I. 11 



122 LIFE OF 

the Convention for amending the constitution in 1821, not a 
voice was raised to rescue it from utter perdition. 

In the first draft that was presented to the Convention, the 
power of nominating officers to the legislature was vested in 
the governor. This clause was not liked by Mr Jay, nor by 
some other members of the committee, and when debated 
in the House, it was generally disapproved. The next thing 
was to find a substitute. Some proposed giving the whole 
power to the legislature ; others, the nominating power to the 
legislature, and the appointing power to the governor ; others 
were for uniting the"governor and judges of the supreme court 
into a council for the purpose. In this state of fluctuating opin- 
ions, and after a day's fruitless debate on the last scheme, Mr 
Jay spent the evening at Robert R. Livingston's rooms, in com- 
pany with Gouverneur Morris. Here they discussed the matter 
anew between themselves, and the result was a proposition by 
Mr Jay, fixing the clause as it was finally established in the 
constitution, by which the appointing power was vested in the 
hands of one senator from each district, making four in all, and 
the governor, who was to have only a casting vote, in case of 
an equal division between the other councillors. Morris and 
Livingston accorded to this project, and agreed to support it in 
Convention. Hence it was adopted, and such was the origin of 
that famous political anomaly, the Council of Appointment of 
New York. Mr Jay's idea was, likewise, that the speaker of 
the Assembly should make a sixth member of the council, to 
prevent the too frequent opportunities of the governor to give 
a casting vote, but, for what reason is not known, this feature 
was omitted in the ultimate project of the constitution. 

In the event, moreover, Mr Jay's views were followed only 
in part. The appointment of the registers and clerks of courts, 
making in the whole a numerous list, was assigned by a sepa- 
rate article to the judges. This he thought a defect. By 
another clause the attorneys, solicitors, and counsellors at law 
were to be licensed by the judges of every court, in 
which they should respectively practise. This power he 



GOUVERNEUB MORRIS. 123 

would have vested wholly in the supreme court, which con- 
trolled all the courts in the state. A vast deal of trouble 
would thus be saved, and a greater respectability secured to 
the profession. A letter, which he wrote to Robert R. 
Livingston and Mr Morris, conjointly, a-few days after the 
final adoption of the constitution, contains some pointed re- 
marks on these subjects.* 

Another article, which became by experiment scarcely less 
unpopular and impracticable, than. the one just noticed, was that 
instituting a Council of Revision, or a body consisting of the 
governor, the chancellor, and the judges of the supreme 
court, by whom all acts of the legislature were to be revised, 
before they could become laws. Mr Morris was originally op- 
posed to this article, and suggested an alteration, giving the 
governor alone a qualified veto, nearly the same in principle 
as has been since introduced into the new constitution of New 
York, as well as into those of other States, but the current set 
against him. 

The reluctance to confide in the ability or integrity of the 
chief magistrate, both in this latter feature, and in that of the 
Council of Appointment, is indicative of the impressions com- 



* In a letter from Mr Jay to Mr Morris, dated April 14th, 1778, after 
the constitution had gone into operation, he says ; ' I wish you would 
write and publish a few more thing's on our constitution ; censuring, 
however, an omission in not restraining the Council of Appointment 
from granting offices to themselves, with remarks on the danger of 
that practice.' 

When the Convention assembled for amending the constitution, in 
September, 1821, the number of civil appointments under the control of 
the Council of Appointment amounted to 6,603 ; and the number of mil- 
itary appointments, to 8,287, making an aggregate of 14,950. Such an 
accumulation could hardly have been anticipated by the framers of the 
first constitution. 

At the same time, the ' annual patronage' of the appointing power 
amounted to about two millions of dollars. See Carter and Stone's 
Debates of the New York Convention, p. 162 ; Introduc. p. vi. 



124 LIFE or 

municated by the examples of the colonial governors. The 
mistake was in not duly reflecting on the different origin of 
their authority. A governor, depending on the King of Gieat 
Britain for his office, would of course have different views of 
his duty, and different motives for discharging it, from the one, 
who derived his consequence and his power from the people, 
and who held the tenure of his office by their will. Few checks 
are necessary to curb the ambition, or countervail the selfish 
ends of a man thus situated ; and, as confidence must rest 
somewhere, and power must be exercised by somebody, there 
can hardly be a safer depository than that, on which the eyes 
of all the people are fixed, which they have chosen themselves, 
and which they can change the moment they discover an 
abuse. 

The mode of electing delegates to Congress, as pointed out 
by the constituiion, originated with Mr Morris. Each House 
of Assembly was to nominate the full number of delegates, 
and the persons named in both lists were to be considered as 
chosen ; and 'in cases where the lists differed, the additional 
number was to be chosen by joint ballot, out of the two lists. 
The same principle is retained in some of the elections pre- 
scribed in the new constitution of New York. 

During the discussions, Mr Jay brought forward a somewhat 
singular paragraph, intended as the closing part of an article, 
designed for securing toleration, and granting ' to all man- 
kind the free exercise of religious profession and worship.' 
To this Mr Jay proposed to add ; l except the professors 
of the religion of the cliurch of Rome, who ought not to hold 
lands in, or be admitted to a participation of the civil rights en- 
joyed by the members of this State, until such time as the 
said professors shall appear in the supreme court of the State, 
and there most solemnly swear, that they verily believe in 
their consciences, that no pope, priest, or foreign author- 
ity on earth, has power to absolve the subjects of this State 
from their allegiance to the same. And farther, that they re- 
nounce, and believe to be false and wicked, the dangerous and 



GOUVERNETJR MORRIS. 125 

damnable doctrine, that the pope, or any other earthly authority, 
has power to absolve men from sins described in, and prohib- 
ited by, the Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ ; and, particularly, 
that no pope, priest, or foreign authority on earth, has power 
to absolve them from the obligation of this oath.' This clause 
was warmly debated, and when the question was put, it 
was carried in the negative, there being nineteen votes against 
it, and ten for it, and one county divided. 

The next day Mr Jay renewed his proposition in the fol- 
lowing modified shape ; ' provided that the liberty of con- 
science hereby granted shall not be construed to encourage 
licentiousness, nor be used in such manner as to disturb or en- 
danger the safety of the State.' This passed in the affirmative, 
but was afterwards amended on the motion of Mr Morris, so 
as to read in the closing part thus ; ' or justify practices in- 
consistent with the peace and safety of this state.' This lan- 
guage is retained in the new constitution, and is the legal ba- 
sis of toleration in the State of New York. 

Mr Morris struggled hard to introduce another article, in 
which he had the hearty co-operation of Mr Jay ^and some 
others, and the purport of which was, that it should be earnest- 
ly recommended to the future legislature of New York, to take 
effectual measures for abolishing domestic slavery, as soon 
as it could be done consistently with public safety, and the 
rights of private property, ' so that in future ages every human 
being, who breathes the air of this State, shall enjoy the priv- 
ileges of a freeman.' His idea was, to make a declaration to 
this effect an article in the constitution, but, although it met 
with favor, it did not succeed. 

After all parts of the constitution had been critically can- 
vassed, and agreed to in their order, the whole was read, 
(April 20th,) and adopted by every person present, with the 
exception of a single member, who desired his dissent might 
be entered on the minutes. 

With this act, the instrument became binding on the State,

the people for their acquiescence or rejection, as has been the 
uniform custom in more recent and tranquil times. This prac- 
tice seems essential, indeed, to the validity of a constitution in 
a free government, which is no other than the voice of the 
people, dictating to themselves and to each other the terms, 
on which they agree to associate, and submit to the restraints 
and regulations of a civil compact. No doubt they have a 
right to prescribe the mode, by which the governing system 
shall be formed, and to delegate to a few the power of erect- 
'ing it, and to consent beforehand to yield obedience to the 
skill and wisdom of these few, as much as in the case of a 
legislative act, or judicial decision; yet such a prodigal conces- 
sion of power, without reserving any check upon its use, or 
control over its influence, is neither safe, nor judicious, nor 
consistent with the fundamental principles of political liberty 
in a democratic state. A constitution is in its nature a per- 
petual bond, unsusceptible of change, unyielding in the obli- 
gations it enjoins. A despot may frame it at his will, and make 
it what he pleases ; custom may weave into its web many ab- 
surdities and impositions, which cannot be removed without 
marring its texture, or perhaps destroying its fabric altogether; 
but a constitution, emanating from the volition of a free peo- 
ple, is essentially their own workmanship, and should pass in 
all its details under their strict scrutiny, before it is set up as 
the imperious guardian of their liberties, and arbiter of their 
civil and social destiny. 

The closing lines of Mr Jay's letter to Mr Morris and Mr 
Livingston, alluded to above, contain a few hints equally 
creditable to himself, and interesting, as the index of some of 
his opinions. 

' The difficulty of getting any government at all,' says he, 
'you know has long been an apprehension of little influence 
on my mind ; and always appeared to be founded less in fact, 
than in a design of quickening the pace of the House. The 
other parts of the constitution I approve ; and only regret that, 
like a harvest cut before it was ripe, the grain has shrunk. 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 127 

Exclusive of the clauses, which I have mentioned, and which 
I wisli had been added, another material one has been omitted 
viz. a direction that all persons holding offices under govern- 
ment should take an oath of allegiance to it, and renounce all 
allegiance and subjection to foreign kings, princes and states, 
in all matters ecclesiastical as well as civil. I should also have 
been for a clause against the continuation of domestic slavery, 
and the support and encouragement of literature, as well as 
some other matters, though perhaps of less consequence. 

' Though the birth of the constitution was in my judgment 
premature, I shall nevertheless do all in my power to nurse 
and keep it alive ; being far from approving the Spartan law, 
which encouraged parents to destroy such of their children, as, 
perhaps by some gross accident, might come into the world 
defective or misshapen.'

SCHUYLER. MR MORRIS'S CORRESPONDENCE WITH HIM. 

THE first act of the Convention, after the finishing hand had 
been put to the constitution, was to appoint a committee to 
prepare a plan for organizing the new government. Livings- 
ton, Scott, Morris, Yates, Jay, and Hobart were the members 
of this committee, and their plan consisted in providing for the 
elections, by the people, and the temporary appointments of a 
chancellor and judges, that the courts of justice might go 
speedily into operation.* They also advised a Council of 
Safety, consisting of fifteen members, vested with all the pow- 
ers necessary for preserving the safety of the State, till the 
constitutional legislature should be convened. Mr Morris was 
likewise one of this Council. Its duties are but imperfectly de- 
fined. The Convention fixed and published the time of elec- 
tions, and returns were ordered to be made to the Council of 
Safety. It was their business to examine the votes, and de- 



* Robert R. Livingston was elected chancellor ; John Jay, Chief 
Justice ; Egbert Benson, Attorney General. These appointments, to- 
gether with those of the judges in the several counties, were made by 
the Convention, to continue in force till the legislature should meet, 
and the constitutional power of appointments should be organized. 






GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 129 

clare who were chosen, and also to administer the oaths of 
office. 

On the ninth of July all the returns had been made, and it 
was ascertained that George Clinton was chosen governor. 
He was sworn into office on the thirtieth of the same month, 
at Kingston, but he was then in the active command of the 
New York militia, and did not quit the field till after the de- 
feat of Burgoyne, although he was at the same time in cor- 
respondence with the Council of Safety, and discharged through 
them all the necessary civil functions of his station. The Con- 
vention adjourned, or dissolved, and left affairs in the hands 
of the Council till the legislature convened, according to the 
provisions of the constitution. 

While these things were going on in the heart of the state, a 
new alarm broke out on the northern frontiers. The evacua- 
tion of Ticonderoga by St Clair spread the greater panic and 
surprise, as it was unexpected, and least of all imagined, that 
he would make a precipitate abandonment and retreat, with- 
out a single faint effort to maintain his post, and hold the en- 
emy in check for a time, if not to present a formidable barrier 
to his progress. The actual force and condition of St Glair's 
army had been overrated by the public. Hopes were raised 
high, the eyes of the nation were turned upon Ticonderoga, and 
when the news of the retreat went abroad, the disappointment 
was extreme, and the loud voice of complaint and censure, 
against the unfortunate general, was reiterated from one end of 
the continent to the other. Time proved that he had acted 
the part of a judicious and skilful officer ; but the excitement of 
the moment was so great, caused by chagrin on the one hand, 
and alarm on the other, that all eyes were blind, and all ears 
deaf, to the true reasons of the case, and even to the palliating 
circumstances. It was enough, that this great frontier barrier 
was lost, and that the enemy was marching rapidly onward. 
The terror of his approach was particularly felt in the State 
of New York, which threatened to become the theatre of his 
ravages, his success, his triumph ;,and, as ill luck seldom comes 



130 LIFE OF 

single handed, at this crisis the Indians began to break into 
the western borders, and carry dismay among the inhabitants 
of that region. 

All these weighty concerns pressed heavily upon the Coun- 
cil of Safety, and called, or seemed to call, for speedy and effi- 
cient measures of government, which neither their power nor 
experience qualified them to concert or pursue. As a first 
step they appointed a committee to proceed to the head quar- 
ters of the northern department, with instructions to confer 
with General Schuyler on the means to be used by the State, 
in aid of his plans of defence or resistance. Mr Morris and 
Mr Yates were selected for this committee, on the tenth of 
July, and the former proceeded immediately to General 
Schuyler's head quarters, then at Fort Edward. His first 
letter to the President of the Council of Safety was dated at 
Albany, filled with the floating rumors of disasters at the north, 
and depredations at the west, without conveying any very 
definite information of either. Two days afterwards, on the 
sixteenth of July, he wrote from Fort Edward. 
'Sir, 

' I arrived here yesterday noon, and last evening had some 
little conversation with the General and others upon the state 
of our affairs. They are far from being such as could be wished. 
General Nixon's brigade, which ought to have consisted of at 
least fifteen hundred men. has four regiments, the whole of 
which do not contain six hundred. In short, not to enter into 
a tedious detail, two thousand six hundred continental troops, 
and two thousand militia, of which about one thousand are 
from this State, make the whole force in this quarter. To 
the westward there are about five hundred. If the enemy 
would follow, I know not when we should stop, as matters now 
stand. We have only two old iron field pieces. We can get 
no more, General Washington having ordered them all to the 
southern department. Fort Anne is abandoned, and Fort 
George will be so by tomorrow, if it be not sooner taken. 
Everything is moved away from this place, as fast as it can be 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 131 

down to Moses Creek, a post five miles from hence, where 
the General proposes to assemble his army. If the enemy 
give us some time, I imagine the roads will be so obstructed, 
that, with the help of a few brave fellows in the woods, we 
should be able so to annoy General Burgoyne, as to prevent him 
from penetrating far into the country. A body of troops are 
to be formed to the eastward of this, in order to cover the 
Grants (Vermont) and harrass the rear of the enemy, if they 
come down Hudson's river. By the bye, I imagine the inhab- 
itants of that country will join Burgoyne, who has issued a 
proclamation calling them in to confer with Colonel Skene. 
He has issued another well written proclamation, which has 
been freely circulated. It is dated at camp, near Ticonderoga, 
from which circumstance, as well as from the matter of it, I 
am led to believe he expects much aid from the tories. Upon 
the whole, I think we shall do very well, but this opinion is 
founded merely upon the barriers, which nature has raised 
against all access from the northward. I just now mentioned 
to the General the calling out of the militia of Tryon county. 
He says we may call, but we shall not get them. This is by 
no means a comfortable idea. I have the honor to be, 

'GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.' 

Again the next day he writes from Saratoga. 

'Sir, 

' I left Fort Edward with General Schuyler at noon, and 
shall return thither some time tomorrow morning. Fort 
George was destroyed yesterday afternoon, previous to which 
the provisions, stores, and batteaux, were removed, and this 
morning about ten o'clock the last of them passed us about 
three miles to the northward of Fort Edward, at which place 
all the troops from the Lake are arrived, and they, together 
with some others, form an advanced post towards Fort George. 
About twelve hundred, perhaps more, are somewhat farther 
advanced upon the road to Fort Anne. 

' The enemy have not yet made any motion that we know 



132 LIFE OF 

of, nor indeed can they make any of consequence, until they 
shall have procured carriages, and then they may find it rather 
difficult to come this way, if proper care be taken to prevent 
them from procuring forage. For this purpose I shall give it 
as my opinion to the General, whenever he asks it, to break 
up all the settlements. upon our northern frontier, to drive off 
the cattle, secure or destroy the forage, and also to destroy the 
sawmills. These measures, harsh as they may seem, are I 
am confident absolutely necessary. They ought undoubted- 
ly to be taken with prudence, and temperately carried into 
execution : but I will venture to say, that if we lay it down as 
a maxim, never to contend for ground but in the last necessity, 
and to leave nothing but a wilderness to the enemy, their pro- 
gress must be impeded by obstacles, which it is not in human 
nature to surmount ; and then, unless we have, with our usual 
good nature, built posts for their defence, they must at the ap- 
proach of winter retire to the place, from whence they first set 
out. The militia from the eastward come in by degrees, and 
I expect we shall soon be in force to carry on the petite guerre 
to advantage, provided always Burgoyne attempts to annoy us, 
for it is pretty clear that we cannot get at him. I am, &,c.

JOHN JAY TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

' Kingston, July 21st, 1777. 

' Dear Morris, 

1 The situation of Tryon county is both shameful and alarm- 
ing. Such abject dejection and despondency, as mark the let 
ters we have received from thence, disgrace human nature. 
God knows what to do with or for them. Were they alone 
interested in their fate, I should be for leaving their cart in the 
slough, till they would put their shoulders to the wheel. 

' Schuyler has his enemies here, and they use these things 
to his disadvantage. Suspicions of his having been privy to 
the evacuation of Ticonderoga spread wide ; and twenty little 
circumstances, which perhaps are false, are trumped up to give 



GOUVEHNEUR MORRIS. 133 

color to the conjecture. We could wish that your letters 
might contain paragraphs for the public. We are silent, be- 
cause we have nothing to say ; and the people suspect the 
worst, because we say nothing. Their curiosity must be con- 
stantly gratified, or they will be uneasy. Indeed, I do not 
wonder at their impatience, the late northern events having been 
such, as to have occasioned alarm and suspicion. I have not 
leisure to add anything more, than that I am very sincerely 

yours, &tc. 

{ JOHN JAY.' 

The Council of Safety were not well satisfied with the let- 
ters of the committee from camp, or rather of Mr Morris, for 
his associate did not join him till quite at the close of their 
mission. The clamors of the people stimulated the impa- 
tience of the Council, for more full and precise information, as 
may be seen by Mr Jay's letter, and it was expected, that the 
despatches of this committee would contribute, at least, to ap- 
pease the former and tranquillize the latter. Mr Morris was a 
little piqued at the suggestion, that he was desired to write 
paragraphs for the newspapers, to amuse the curiosity of the 
public, and he took care to give a broad hint to this effect, in 
one of his letters to the Council. They wrote him in return 
a letter, which was drafted by his friend Robert R. Livingston, 
couched in terms of complaint and disapprobation^ for neglecting 
certain points deemed essential, as objects for the inquiries of 
the committee. These preliminaries will explain the allusions 
in the first part of the following letter. 

TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF SAFETY. 

Moses Creek, July 23d, 1777. 
'Sir, 

' We have received yours of the 19th, which has afforded 
us great pleasure, since we are enabled in some measure to 
collect from it our errand to the northward, " one of the most 
important objects of our journey " being, in the opinion of your 
honorable board, to write the news. Could we have conceiv- 

VOL. I, 12 



134 LIFE OF 

ed, that this was your intention in appointing us a committee 
" to confer with Major General Schuylerupon such measures, 
as might from time to time appear necessary to be pursued by 
this State, for the aid and support of the northern department," 
we should have endeavored so to correspond with the Council, 
as to have informed them, as far as lay in our power, of the 
'manner of the retreat from Ticonderoga, the number of the 
men that came off, whether any or how many were taken, whether 
the sick came away, whether the troops brought off their arms" 
and the like. It is not in our power, Sir, to answer these im- 
portant objects of our journey, because we are much in the 
dark about those matters, which attract the attention and strict 
scrutiny of your honorable board, and about which the Gene- 
ral can give us no information ; but we shall leave this place 
tomorrow morning, to wait upon you, and answer such ques- 
tions as you shall be pleased to put to us. 

' It was determined upon to leave the ground occupied by 
our advanced posts, upon the road to Fort Anne and Fort 
George, and retire to Fort Edward in the way to this place, 
having previously removed everything. About noon the pic- 
quet guard of the party, upon the Fort Anne road, was attack- 
ed by savages and British troops. It is not, we suppose, of 
great importance minutely to describe this engagement. We 
will therefore record nothing more upon your minutes, than 
that we drove off the enemy, and in so doing had one man kill- 
ed and scalped, twelve more killed, and twelve wounded, 
five of them mortally. This evening the retreat was com- 
pleted to this place, where the General would be strongly 
posted, if he had men. Three hundred of the militia of Mas- 
sachusetts Bay went off this morning, in spite of the opposition, 
we should have said entreaties, of their officers. All the mili- 
tia on the ground are so heartily tired, and so extremely de- 
sirous of getting home, that it is more than probable none of 
them will remain ten days longer. One half was discharged 
two days ago, to silence, if possible, their clamor ; and the re- 
mainder, officers excepted, will soon discharge themselves, at 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 135 

which time the army in the northern department will consist 
of about twenty-seven hundred continental troops, sick and 
well. We make no comments. 

' But, Sir, Burgoyne cannot flee. If a body of three thou- 
sand men can be formed from the militia of Connecticut, Mas- 
sachusetts, and New Hampshire, somewhere upon the New 
Hampshire Grants ; if General Washington can spare a rein- 
forcement of fifteen hundred good troops to this army ; if, 
discharging all the militia in the Forts and passes of the High- 
lands, the governor is put at the head of one third of the mili- 
tia of the state, and two hundred good riflemen, and sent into 
Tryon county ; we may laugh at Mr Howe and Mr Bur- 
goyne. We are too ignorant of the situation of affairs to the 
southward, to say whether these things are practicable, and, 
therefore, give our sentiments on matters as they appear. We 

have the honor to be, Sic. 

' GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

' ABRAHAM YATES, JR.' 

Thus ended the mission to the northern army, the commit- 
tee having returned shortly after inditing the above epistle. 
They had made such inquiries, and such arrangements with Gen- 
eral Schuyler, as circumstances would admit, and were pre- 
pared to give all requisite information to the Council of Safe- 
ty, on their arrival at Kingston. 

Meantime, during Mr Morris's absence, he had been ap- 
pointed on a committee with Mr Hobart, to attend, on the part 
of New York, a convention of delegates from all the New 
England States, about to assemble at Springfield, in Massachu- 
setts. The object of this convention was, to consult on the 
mutual interests of the States there represented, particularly 
in regard to the condition of the currency and prices. From 
the beginning of the war, much perplexity and much distress 
had been produced by the spirit of monopoly, and the exor- 
bitant prices demanded for the necessaries of life. The de- 
preciation of the currency increased the evil, since the price 
of articles would not be in proportion only to their quantity in 



136 LIFE OF 

market, and to the wants of the community, but also to the un- 
questionable value of the money, or substitute for money, 
which was to be received for them. Certain persons, who be- 
came dealers and speculators, and whose patriotism was meas- 
ured by the scale of their pecuniary gains, took advantage of 
the disorders of the times, and, by purchasing in large quanti- 
ties, and selling at such times, places, and rates as they chose, 
imposed an intolerable burden on that portion of the people, 
who could only buy in small amounts, and as their wants dic- 
tated. The soldiers and their families were sufferers in a ve- 
ry peculiar degree, because the wages of a soldier were fixed, 
and not subject to fluctuate with the changing value of the cur- 
rency in which he was paid, whereas labor in other pursuits, 
like every other commodity of exchange, rose in nominal val- 
ue as the money declined. At least, such was the view gen- 
erally taken of these mailers, though some persons regarded 
the monopolizing system, as rather an advantage than an inju- 
ry, for reasons, which need not be examined in this place. 

The mischievous effects of these practices, treacherous, as it 
was believed, alike to the cause of liberty and the claims of hu- 
manity, were severely felt in the New England States. Plans 
had been devised, and laws passed, to discourage, defeat, and 
punish them, but with little effect. The motives of avarice, 
the allurements of gain, had a stronger influence than the pow- 
er of government, the love of country, or the voice of con- 
science. Almost every article of sale passed through the 
hands of forestallers and monopolizers, who either disregarded 
ihe laws, or contrived to evade them. Among other restric- 
tions, an embargo law was passed in Massachusetts, prohibiting 
the exportation out of that State of certain articles, embracing 
all the necessaries of life and military supplies. This law ex- 
tended also to importations. Hence it caused great complaints 
in the neighboring States, particularly in New York, as many 
of the citizens of that State, who were engaged in commercial 
enterprises, found it convenient to enter their ships in some of 
the ports of New England, and thence transport their goods 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 137 

over land. The embargo law of Massachusetts was a bar to 
this transportation, arid compelled the importers to sell their 
goods on the spot. This operated not only as a loss to the 
owners, but an injury to the State of New York, where the 
goods were wanted to supply the needs of the people. 

To regulate matters of this sort, a convention of delegates 
from the New England States had already been held in Provi- 
dence the year before, who favored their consiluents with a 
set of resolves, recommendations, and a scale of prices, but. 
with whatever wisdom their deliberations may have been con- 
ducted, or whatever new light was struck out on the occasion, 
things did not mend afterwards, the people perceived no change, 
and felt no relief. To seek a further remedy, therefore, Massa- 
chusetts proposed another convention, to meet at Springfield, 
on the thirtieth of July, and invited New York to take a part. 
Mr Morris was selected on account of his knowledge of finance, 
and the principles of commercial intercourse, which had been 
among his favorite studies, but, for reasons that will soon ap- 
pear, he did not attend the convention. His associate at- 
tended, and the business was conducted on the grounds of the 
original proposition. 

Indeed, the case was a very simple one. The root of the 
whole difficulty lay in the deranged state of the currency, or, 
in other words, the want of money. The country was deluged 
with paper ; each State had thrown out its share, and more 
than its share ; the Continental Congress had contributed its 
millions; depreciation ensued, rapid, inevitable, irremediable, 
till every person found to his astonishment, that the more mo- 
ney he possessed, the more obvious was his progress in the 
way to poverty and ruin. The convention recommended 
taxation, and a redemption of the paper ; a very natural meth- 
od of getting out of the difficulty, but not so easy of execution, 
where the means of paying taxes did not exist. They rec- 
ommended borrowing money, a process not less dubious, where 
there are no lenders, and where the borrowers are without 
credit. On the whole, the convention left this part of the 
12* 



138 LIFE or 

subject just where they had found it. They proposed, how- 
ever, that the laws regulating prices, and those prohibiting in- 
ternal transportation, should be repealed. 

Mr Morris, as we have seen, did not go to the convention. 
For some purpose connected with the northern army, it was 
deemed important that he should visit General Washington's 
head-quarters, and the Congress at Philadelphia. Meantime, 
great dissatisfaction began to prevail in the public mind, and 
particularly with the people of New England, respecting Gen- 
eral Schuyler, and his command of the northern army. The 
unfortunate events of Ticonderoga were charged upon him, 
and even broad hints were circulated, that he had a better 
understanding with the enemy, than was consistent with his 
station or his integrity. On the day after Mr Morris left the 
camp at Moses Creek, General Schuyler wrote to him ; ' I 
am extremely sorry, that you are obliged to go to Springfield 
without seeing the Council of Safety. I find by a letter from 
a friend there, that my reputation suffers much, and that peo- 
ple suggest the Fort was evacuated by my order, and that I 
had made such a disposition whilst I was there, as indicated 
an intention to deliver it to the enemy. I wish you would 
write the Council of Safety a line on the subject, and inform 
them of what you know.' Such was the impression, and for 
the moment it could not be removed, although General Schuy- 
ler had no knowledge of an intended evacuation of Ticonde- 
roga, till after it occurred, and was as much surprised at the 
catastrophe, as any member of the Council of Safety. The 
clamor spread widely ar.cl rapidly, and the occasion was seized 
upon with eagerness by General Schuyler's enemies in Con- 
gress, who, by sounding an alarm, and insisting that the New 
England troops would not join the army while under his com- 
mand, were successful in causing him to be superseded by a 
resolve of Congress, and General Gates to be appointed in his 
stead. 

The following curious extract of a letter from a member of 
Congress, dated June, nineteenth, 1777, will give a clue to 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 139 

some of the secret causes of this event, as well as a little in- 
sight into the slate of feeling and party, which then prevailed 
among the members. It is only necessary to premise, that, 
after the retreat of the American army from Canada the year 
before, General Gates had commanded in that quarter till the 
month of May, when his command by an order of Congress 
was embraced within that of General Schuyler. At this 
step General^Gates was displeased, and Gordon intimates, (who, 
by the way, is often too much of a partizan to be a just histo- 
rian,) that it was brought about by a manoeuvre of certain per- 
sons in Congress. Be this as it may, the General allowed 
his temper to be much ruffled on the occasion, as will appear 
by the extract now to be quoted. 

' Yesterday,' writes the member of Congress, ' Major Gen- 
eral Gates arrived in town, and about twelve o'clock at noon, 
Mr Roger Sherman informed Congress, that he was waiting 
at the door, and wished admittance. Mr Paca desired to 
know for what purpose. Mr Sherman replied, to communicate 
intelligence of importance. He was accordingly ushered in, 
and, after some awkward ceremony, he sat himself in a very 
easy cavalier posture in an elbow chair, and began to open his 
budget. 

' The intelligence he communicated was, that the Indians 
were extremely friendly, much delighted with seeing French 
officers in our service, and other common place matters, which 
at present I cannot recollect. Having thus gone through the 
ostensible part of the plan, he took out of his pocket some 
scraps of papers, containing a narrative of his birth, parentage, 
education, life, character, and behavior. He informed the 
House, that he # had quitted an easy, happy life, to enter into 
their service, from a pure zeal for the liberties of America, 
that he had strenuously exerted himself for its defence, that 
some time in March, last year, he was appointed to a command 
in the northern department, and that a few days since, with- 
out having given any cause of offence, without accusation, 
without trial, without a hearing, without notice, he had receiv- 



140 LIFE OF 

ed a resolution, by which he was, in a most disgraceful man- 
ner, superseded in his command. Here his oration became 
warm, and contained many reflections against Congress, and 
many insinuations against Mr Duane, whose name he mention- 
ed, and related some conversation, which he said had passed 
between him and that gentleman on his way to Albany. Here 
Mr Duane arose, and, addressing himself to the President, 
hoped the General would observe order, and cease from per- 
sonal applications, as he could not in Congress enter into any 
controversy with him, on the subject of any former conver- 
sation. 

' Mr Paca caught the fire, and immediately moved, that the 
General might be ordered to withdraw. I seconded the mo- 
tion, observing that the conduct of the General was unbecom- 
ing the House to endure, and himself to be guilty of. JMr Dy- 
er, Mr Sherman, and some others of his eastern friends, arose 
and endeavored to palliate his conduct, and to oppose his 
withdrawing. On this, Mr Middleton, Mr Burke, Colonel 
Harrison, and two or three others arose, and there was a 
general clamor in the House, that he should immediately with- 
draw. All this while the General stood upon the floor, and 
interposed several times in the debates ; however, the clamor 
increasing, he withdrew. A debate then ensued, concerning 
the propriety of the General's conduct, and that of the mem- 
bers, who, contrary to parliamentary rules, contended for his 
staying after a motion had been made and seconded, that he 
should withdraw. The want of candor in Mr Sherman, who 
asked his admittance on pretence of his giving the House intel- 
ligence, was much inveighed against. Congress at length 
came to the determination, that General Gatts should not 
be again admitted on the floor, but should be informed, that 
Congress were ready and willing to hear, by way of memorial, 
any grievances, which he had to complain of. Here the 
matter ended, not, as you will observe, to his credit or advan- 
tage.' 

This occurred about six weeks before General Gate's reap- 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 141 

pointment to supersede Genera) Schuyler in the northern de- 
partment, and it may well be imagined, that this latter meas- 
ure was adopted with but little unanimity of feeling in the 
House, however much the dictates of policy might induce 
to a concert of action. Mr Jay accompanied Mr Morris 
to Philadelphia, but they were probably too late to effect all the 
beneficial objects, which they had in view. Washington's 
army was then on its march through Pennsylvania to meet 
General Howe. The following correspondence between Mr 
Morris and General Schuyler will afford some additional ex- 
planations of this subject. 

TO MAJOR GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

' Kingston, August 27th, 1777. 

' Dear Sir, 

' Upon my return from Albany, it was at my request deter- 
mined, that, instead \>f going to Springfield, 1 should repair to 
Head-Quarters. In consequence, with Mr Jay, I went thither. 
Unfortunately we did not arrive at Philadelphia, until the day 
it had been determined to send Gates to take the command of 
the northern department. You will readily believe, that we 
were not pleased at this resolution, and I assure you for my 
own part, I felt exceedingly distressed at your removal, just 
when changing fortune began to declare in our favor. Con- 
gress, I hope, will perceive, that our successes have been owing 
to the judicious plans adopted previous to your removal. 

'Our representations of your situation have obtained, as by 
this time you must be sensible, such reinforcement for the 
northern armies, as will enable Gates to act with eclat, if he 
has spirit and understanding sufficient for that purpose. His 
situation is certainly an eligible one. As his friend, I am pleased 
at the opportunity he has of acquiring honor, while I sincerely 
lament his possessing this opportunity at your expense. How- 
ever, it was become necessary, for the eastern folks declared, 
that their people would not march while you had the com- 
mand. In misfortunes, great minds rise superior to adversity, 
end this too, whether they are of a public or private nature.

' With that incautiousness natural to me, and of which 1 scorn 
to divest myself among iny friends, let me say, that I think you 
will find it for your honor to resign, but in this, festina lente, 
the hour is not yet come. I wish you would direct the plan 
you think best for the northern armies, pointing out the posts 
necessary to he taken, the manosuvres to be made, and the like, 
which your intimate knowledge of the country enables you to 
do better than most men. It seems to me we should contrive 
to possess the height to the northward of Fort Edward, if it be 
practicable to maintain it, and then, by keeping parties around 
Burgoyne's army, intercept his supplies, and force him to quit 
his post at Batten Kill. This is a reverie, but clearly something 
capital may be done ; perhaps he may be attacked with success 
in his lines. I am inclined to believe, that the unexpected sight 
of our troops, advancing with fixed bayonets without firing a shot, 
would so intimidate his soldiers, that they would not stand. 
But to the purpose. I could wish that having digested your 
plan, you would send it to Gates, as the continuation of what 
you intended, if successful loathe eastward and westward, which, 
thank God, you have been. Introduce it to him under the idea, 
that you think it your duty to contribute to the success of the 
American arms, as well out of as in power, and send a copy of 
the whole to Congress, in which you may also, with great pro- 
priety, mention as a reason why you have not obeyed their or- 
der, that General Gates was so long ou his journey, that the at- 
tention, which you were obliged to pay to the northern arrny, 
would not permit you to provide for yours. This, and Indian 
affairs, are good causes for your stay. I am, yours, 

' GOUVERNEUR MoRRIS.' 

GENERAL SCHUYLER TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

' Albany, September 7th, 1777. 

' Dear Sir, 

' The day before yesterday I was favored with yours of the 
27th of August. I thank you for sympathizing with me, on 
my removal from the command in this department, at a time 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 143 

when our affairs were at the worst, and when no change could 
happen, but what must be for the better. Congress, I find, 
complain of me for painting in strong colors the situation we 
were in ; and yet, I dare say, if I had not done it, and any 
capital misfortune had happened, they would have asked why 
they had not been truly informed. But my crime consists in 
not being a New England man in principle ; and, unless they 
alter theirs, I hope I never shall be. General Gates is their 
idol, becuase he is at their direction. 

'If an inquiry into my couduct had not been ordered, I 
should have resigned, the moment when Gates relieved me ; 
but, as soon as the former has taken place, I shall certainly 
quit. Of this I have advised Congress. I believe a certain 
set will wish, that they had not urged for an inquiry. I shall 
make my defence in such a manner, as that the public may 
see what has been my conduct, and what that of others ; and 
then they may judge for themselves ; and I trust they will 
easily discern, that the cause of our misfortunes in this de- 
partment has originate^, where they perhaps little expect it. 

' When General Gates took the command, I informed him, 
that I had advised Congress of my intention to remain some 
time in the department, to afford him any assistance in my 
power, and entreated he would call upon me whenever he 
thought proper. He has, however, not done it. He sent 
for General Ten Broeck from town, to a council of war, but 
not for me. After that, I could not with propriety give him 
my opinion of what ground he ought to possess, if Burgoyne 
should retreat. What I intended to have done, had I remain- 
ed in the command, and been reinforced, I fully communicat- 
ed to him, and showed the orders I had given Generals Lin- 
coln and Arnold. Hitherto he has not, as I am informed, 
made any other disposition of his force, which daily increases. 
He may certainly oblige General Burgoyne to retire immedi- 
ately, or compel him to fight at a great disadvantage ; but Gates 
is totally ignorant of the country, and, although he may get peo- 
ple that can give him the best information, yet it falls vastly

short of being personally well acquainted with the passes and 
defiles, which every country has more or less. From ihis de- 
fect 1 fear every advantage will not be taken that might. 

'I am just now informed that Burgoyne has drawn all his 
troops from Skenesborough and Fort Anne. This, with the 
bridge he has thrown Over Hudson's river, indicates that he 
means to attack our army. If Lincoln is within a day's 
march of Saratoga, and is ordered that way, I wish Burgoyne 
may advance, and Gates too. If the latter takes post at Still- 
water, Lincoln might be in the rear of Burgoyne before he 
could attack Gates ; in which case the British army must be 
totally ruined. Nor need ours apprehend a want of provi- 
sions, should Burgoyne be so posted as to render it imprudent 
to attack him ; for there are means of sending on the supplies, 
and if they escape the attention of Gates, I will point them 
out. I am, &c.

' Kingston, September 18th, 1777. 
' Dear Sir, 

' The receipt of your favor of the seventh, last night, gave 
me great pleasure. I am happy for the sake of America, that 
your sentiments so perfectly coincided with my own. The 
commander in chief of the northern department may, if he 
pleases, neglect to ask, or disdain to receive advice, but those 
who know him will, I am sure, be convinced that he wants it. 
Fortune may make him a great man, in the estimation of the 
vulgar, who will fix their estimation at their own price, let the 
intrinsic value be what it will, but it is not in the power of for- 
tune to bestow those talents, which are necessary to render a 
person superior to her malice. This being the case, it is but 
equal, that, between competitors, she should take the weaker 
side to preserve the natural equality of mankind. 

' I am confident that the proper advantages will not be taken 
of Burgoyne's situation. We have no chance, I fear, in that

quarter from management. The only resource, therefore, will 
be a hattle, and I doubt our skill to manage that. At any 
rate, the season closes fast, and if Burgoyne cannot get to Al- 
bany, he must at least retire to Ticonderoga. I learn that 
Gates's army is eleven, and Lincoln's five thousand. Tant 
mieux sed quare de hoc. I am also told that the Indians are 
determined to take up the hatchet for us. If this be true, it 
would be infinitely better to wear away the enemy's army, by 
a scrupulous and polite attention, than to violate the rules of 
decorum and the laws of hospitality, by making an attack upon 
strangers in our own country. 

' From Peekskill we have intelligence, that the enemy 
have marched into New Jersey with five thousand men, and 
from their motions seem determined to attempt the western 
pass of the mountains. Either their numbers are exaggerated 
greatly, or they mean some capital diversion. I rather think 
the former, and that their object is merely to return the com- 
pliment, which Sullivan paid them on Staten Island. 

' General Washington, as you will have heard before this 
reaches you, has had a severe conflict with Howe. He was 
obliged to retire. Our loss is far from inconsiderable. Howe, 
I imagine, will get Philadelphia. This will be determined at 
Swede's Ford on the Schuykill. If we can beat him, he 
will be, if not mined, yet as near it as any man need be. If 
the contrary happens, we must, to say the best of it, have an- 
other winter's campaign. 

' The Chief Justice (Jay) is gone to fetch his wife. The 
Chancellor (Livingston) is solacing himself with his wife, his 
farm, and his imagination. Our Senate is doing, I know not 
what. In Assembly we wrangle long to little purpose. You 
will think so, when 1 tell you, that from nine in the morning 
till dusk in the evening, we were employed in appointing Scott, 
Pawling, Yates, and Webster to be the council of appointment. 
I tremble for the consequences, but I smile, and shall continue

to think of a Militia Law, and I should be happy to be inform- 
ed of your sentiments, or rather plans, upon that subject. It 
is doubtless of importance, and the mode now to be adopted, 
whether good or evil, will have a very distant operation. It 
will become a principal part of the jurisprudence of the State, 
and, as such, shed an influence upon the Constitution. I am

< Dear Sir, 

'If Arnold's advice had been pursued, the enemy would have 
been routed on the twentieth of last month, and the fortifica- 
tion below would, in all probability, not have been attacked. 
The same want of vigor has taken place, after the action of the 
seventh instant. Burgoyne retreated on the eighth, at night ; 
was followed by an inferior body on the afternoon of the ninth ; 
and now occupies the heights between the barracks at Sarato- 
ga and Fishkill, with a dispirited army of less than five thou- 
sand ; whilst General Gates's army of fifteen thousand are look- 
ing at him ; for the General, by all accounts, has never yet 
been within ken of the enemy. This may be prudent, it is 
not very gallant. He knows Burgoyne cannot retreat, and 
will, therefore, not risk an engagement. But if Clinton should 
be able to push up to this place, the tables may be turned up- 
on him. I hope that, however, will not be the case.

It is the province of the historian to collect facts, combine 
circumstances, and weigh events with an impartial hand, be- 
fore he pronounces a judgment on the actions of a man, in a 
prominent and responsible station; and whoever will do this, 
in regard to General Schuyler, will come to a very different 
decision from that, to which he might naturally be led by the 
treatment he received from Congress. Whatever causes or 
motives may have operated at the time, to bring about his re- 
moval, there can be but one opinion now, as to the necessity 
or justice of that measure. It was the effect of a temporary 
excitement founded on false impressions, of a prejudice for 
which no good reason could be assigned, and of a bitter par- 
ty spirit, ready to immolate character and hazard the nation's 
best interests, to gratify its own narrow and perverted aims. 

' Your enemies,' says a member writing to General Schuyler 
from Congress, ' your enemies, relentless, and bent on your 
destruction, would willingly involve you in the odium of losing 
Ticonderoga. The change of command was not, however, 
founded on that principle, but merely on the representation of 
the Eastern States, that their militia, suspicious of your milita- 
ry character, would not turn out in defence of New York, 
while you presided in the northern department. So confi- 
dent were they in these assertions, and such, from your own 
representations, was the gloomy aspect of our affairs there, 
that the southern members were alarmed, and we thought it 
prudent not to attempt to stem the torrent. It was, however, 
agreed and declared, as I before hinted, that the eastern pre- 
judices against you were the only motives for your recall. 
The application of eastern generals for your continuance in 
the department, arid the respectable reinforcement from New 
Hampshire, which so palpably contradict the assertions that 
were the basis of your removal, are no small occasion of tri- 
umph to some of us, and will not speedily be forgotten. We 



148 LIFE or 

have much to expect from the northward. Give us the earfi- 
est intelligence. Every mouth is full of the praises of Her- 
kimer, Stark, Gansevoort, and Willet.' 

The foundation of this prejudice of the Eastern States 
against General Schuyler cannot, perhaps, fit this day, be easi- 
ly ascertained. As a gentleman of a strong and cultivated 
mind, integrity, honor, and public spirit, none stood higher in 
his own State, or possessed more entirely the confidence of 
his copatriots. In his correspondence, he was sometimes be- 
trayed into expressions not well suited to win by their suavity, 
or subdue by their forbearance, and now and then he incau- 
tiously disturbed the nerves of Congress, by the tenor of his 
letters. A friend writes to him from that body ; ' You know 
Congress, like a hysteric woman, wants cordials. Write 
truths, without making any reflections of your own.' Some of 
his letters to the legislature of Massachusetts assumed a tone, 
but little calculated to allay jealousies, or gain friends. This 
was impolitic, but it could in no degree justify the ill treat- 
ment he received as a public man, and especially so abrupt 
a dismissal from a command, which he had up to that mo- 
ment conducted with all the energy, address, and ability, that 
it was possible for any officer to exercise under the same cir- 
cumstances. His plans were well laid, and the crown of vic- 
tory was clearly within his reach, when another stepped into 
his place, who, to secure the prize, had only to stand still and 
wait the onward tide of events. General Gates was success- 
ful, where it would have been impossible for any man, with a 
particle of prudence, to fail. Fortune was his friend, and to 
her caprices, more than to all other causes combined, he was 
indebted for the glory he acquired in gathering the laurels of 
Saratoga.* 



* A just and well written tribute to the character of General Schuy- 
ler, may be found in Chancellor Kent's late Discourse before the Histo- 
rical Society of New York.

VALLEY FORGE ON A COMMITTEE FROM CONGRESS. HIS INTIMACY 
WITH WASHINGTON. ARRANGEMENTS OF THE ARMY. HE DRAWS

DEBATES IN CONGRESS ON A PROVISION FOR HALF PAY TO THE 

OFFICERS. CORRESPONDENCE WITH MR JAY AND GENERAL WASH- 
INGTON. CONWAY'S INTRIGUES. GENERAL GREENE. 

ON the thirteenth of May the Convention, which formed 
and adopted the Constitution of New York, dissolved itself, 
as we have seen, and left the affairs of government in the 
hands of a Council of Safety. Before the dissolution, a 
provisionary appointment was made of five delegates to rep- 
resent the State in Congress, till the Assembly should convene 
under the new Constitution. Gouverneur Morris was one of 
these delegates, but the critical posture of affairs in New York, 
and the demand for his presence in the councils of his own 
State, prevented his joining Congress, till the time had expired 
for which he was chosen. On the third of October, when the 
legislature was convened, a new appointment of delegates 
took place, in the mode prescribed by the Constitution. Mr 
Morris was re-elected, but it does not appear by the journals 
of Congress, that he took his seat till the twentieth of January 
following. 

He had now been nearly three years in public life, and he 
entered Congress with a reputation for talents, general intel- 
ligence, zeal, and activity in business, probably not surpassed 
by that of any other person of his age in the country, being 
not yet twenty six years old. Congress manifested at an ear- 
13* 



150 LIFE OF 

ly hour the estimation in which they held his abilities and 
character, by appointing him, the very day he presented his 
credentials, on a committee of great importance and responsi- 
bility. It will be recollected, that this was the memorable 
winter, in which the American army was at Valley Forge, 
enduring unparalleled sufferings from the effects of a harassing 
and protracted campaign, from want of clothing, want of food, 
exposure to the inclemency of the season, and all the cata- 
logue of ills incident to a condition so deplorable. Add to 
this, that the various departments of the army had become 
much deranged ; plans and regulations, the result of inexperi- 
ence, had been unskilfully contrived in its organization, and im- 
perfectly executed by officers and agents, unacquainted with 
their duty, and unpractised in the military art. In short, the 
general system had grown up by additions, changes, and mod- 
ifications, from time to time, as the exigences of the case de- 
manded, with little reference to the relations and symmetry 
of the whole. The commander in chief called loudly on 
Congress for a reform, and, as soon as he was established in 
his winter's encampment, he urged them to take the matter 
speedily in hand, that he might be prepared to commence the 
next campaign with a force better regulated, more efficient, 
increased in numbers, and improved in military skill. 

To aid these designs, a committee of five members was ap- 
pointed, with instructions to proceed to head-quarters at Val- 
ley Forge, and enter into a full investigation of the subject 
with the commander in chief, and report such measures as 
should be deemed expedient. Mr Morris was placed on this 
committee, and he and his associates repaired to Valley Forge 
without delay, Congress being then at York Town. Soon 
after their arrival, General Washington laid before them, in 
writing, an elaborate exposition of the existing state of the ar- 
my, pointing out the disorders and deficiencies, together with 
their causes, and suggesting in detail such reforms and im- 
provements, as he considered essential to put the military es- 
tablishment on a respectable footing. This communication 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 151 

served as the basis of the committee's proceedings, and in fact 
its principles and provisions were in the end adopted by them. 
It extended not only to the military arrangement, but to the 
entire economy of the army, embracing a plan for completing 
the defective regiments, regulating rank and promotion, new 
modeling the quartermaster general's, commissary's, clothing, 
hospital, and paymaster's departments, and for augmenting 
those of the artillery and engineers. The committee remained 
in camp nearly three months. Mr Morris returned to 
York Town about the middle of April. The new plan for the 
army was reported to Congress, and approved. 

There was another subject in which Mr Morris took a live- 
ly concern, and which was largely discussed in camp, namely, 
some permanent provision for the officers, on the part of the 
nation. General Washington had repeatedly expressed the 
strongest solicitude on this subject. In writing to Congress 
he say? ; ' If my opinion be asked, with respect to the neces- 
sity of making this provision for the. officers, I am ready to 
declare, that I do most religiously believe the salvation of 
the cause depends on it ; and, without it, your officers will 
moulder to nothing, or be composed of low and illiterate men, 
void of capacity for this or any other business. To prove this, 
I can with truth aver, that scarce a day passes without the 
offer of two or three commissions ; and my advices from the 
eastward and southward are, that numbers, who had gone 
home on furlough, mean not to return, but are establishing 
themselves in more lucrative employments. Let Congress 
determine what will be the consequence of this spirit. Per- 
sonally, as an officer, I have no interest in their decision, be- 
cause I have declared, and now repeat it, that I never will 
receive the smallest benefit from the half pay establishment ; 
but as a man, who rights under the weight of a proscription, 
and as a citizen, who wishes to see the liberty of his country 
established upon a permanent foundation, and whose property 
depends upon the success of our arms, I am deeply inter- 
ested.' 



152 LIFE OF 

On other occasions General Washington, with renewed ear- 
nestness, urged these considerations and others equally power- 
ful on Congress, and suggested as a provision, not more just 
than politic, an establishment of half pay after the war. The 
views of the commander in chief were entered into very hear- 
tily by Mr Morris, but they met with a cool reception from 
some of the members of Congress. 

Upon what ground a scheme, manifestly so necessary and 
equitable, was deemed inadmissible by any person, as we have 
no knowledge of the debates of the old Congress, it might 
now be fruitless to inquire. When this subject was brought 
forward, however, it encountered opposition. On the minds 
of some there would seem to have been doubts, as to the pow- 
er of Congress to make such a provision. It was moved to 
send certain propositions to the States, for the purpose of as- 
certaining the general opinion, before they should be acted 
on by Congress. The motion was lost, though supported by 
several individuals, including all the New England members 
except two. It is probable, that no one of the representatives 
was decidedly opposed to some sort of remuneration to the 
officers, but they differed in regard to the amount and mode 
of payment. Some were for fixing on a definite amount, to be 
paid after the conclusion of the war, according to the rank of 
the officers; others were for an establishment of half pay for 
life ; -others for a term of years. The plan of half pay for life, 
as proposed by General Washington, and strenuously support- 
ed by Mr Morris, passed in the affirmative by a small majori- 
ty, at one stage of the debates. All the New England mem- 
bers, and three out of four from South Carolina, voted against 
it ; and the resolution was afterwards modified, by reserving 
to the United States the power of redeeming at any time the 
claims of an officer, on payment of a sum equal to the half 
pay of six years. 

A motion was again subsequently made to refer the matter 
to the consideration of the legislatures of the seven! States. 
Every New England member, except one, voted for this mo- 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 153 

tion, but it was lost. After a protracted discussion, it was 
finally resolved, that the half pay to officers should continue 
only seven years, and that each non-commissioned officer and 
soldier, who remained in the army till the end of ihe war, 
should receive a reward of eighty dollars. 

Shortly after returning from camp, Mr Morris was appointed 
on several committees, that required his assiduous attention, 
and much lahor. Among others were those for drafting in- 
structions to General* Gates, who had just been directed to 
take command on the North River ; for an examination into 
the medical department of the army, concerning which loud 
complaints had been forwarded to Congress; for considering 
and reporting the terms to be offered to British officers and 
soldiers, who might choose to become citizens of the United 
States ; for arranging the plan of a cartel for the exchange of 
prisoners ; and for reporting on the affair of Ticonderoga.* 

His opinions and acts at this time will be further elucidated, 
by the following letter to Mr Jay, dated Valley Forge, Feb- 
ruary 1 st, 1778, and of course written a very short time after 
his arrival in camp. 
' Dear Jay, 

* Congress have sent me to 7 this place, in conjunction with 
some other gentlemen, to regulate their army, and in truth not 
a little regulation has become necessary. Our quartermaster 
and commissary departments are in the most lamentable situ- 
ation. Opportunities have beejp neglected the last campaign, 
which were truly golden ones, but omnipotent fatality had, 
it seems, determined that the American capital should fall. 
Our sentiments on this occasion are so perfectly coincident, 
that I will not enlarge. 

'The mighty Senate of America is not what you have 



* In a letter to him on this subject, Genernl Schuyler writes ; ' Let

dient, I trust the resolutions will be such, as to make amends for the 
injuries I bare sustained.'

known it. The Continental Congress and currency have both 
depreciated, but, in the hands x of the Almighty architect of 
empires, the stone, which the builders have rejected, may ea- 
sily become head of the corner. The free, open, and undis- 
turbed communication with the city of Philadelphia, debauches 
the minds of those in its vicinage, with astonishing rapidity. 
This State is sick even unto the death. Just before the reduc- 
tion of the forts, the enemy balanced exactly upon the point of 
quitting the city, and a straw would h'ave turned in either 
scale. 

' Our troops, Heu miserors ! The skeleton of an army 
presents itself to our eyes in a naked, starring, condition, out 
of health, out of spirits. But I have seen Fort George 
in the summer of 1777. Next campaign I believe we shall 
banish these troublesome fellows.* For Heaven's sake, my 
dear friend, exert yourself strenuously in the great leading bu- 
siness of taxation. To that great wheel, "a thousand petty 
spokes and small annexments are mortised and adjoined." I 
earnestly entreat you, and my other friend, ^fortia opponerepec- 
tora to that fatal system of limitation, which, if carried into 
execution, would be downright ruin, and in the ineffectual at- 
tempt will carry us to the brink of it. York Town and its 
neighborhood, although near ninety miles from Philadelphia, 
already consider our moneyj almost as waste paper.

portunity, if I can find time to send a long letter, which in- 
deed I owe him. Remember me to Mrs Jay, and believe

As an introduction to an interesting letter from Mr Morris 
to his mother, written the day after his arrival in Congress 
from camp, it is essential to observe, that he had not visited

his paternal home, nor seen any of his relatives at Morrisania, 
since the British had taken possession of New York. His 
mother's residence was within the enemy's lines, and contin- 
ued so during the whole war. Under these circumstances, 
her concern for her only son, who had adopted principles not 
congenial with her own, as well as his anxiety on her account, 
may easily be imagined. A large portion of his- family con- 
nexions, and some of his intimate friends, among whom was his 
early patron and adviser, William Smith the historian, adher- 
ed to the royal cause. The decided part, which he took at 
the outset of the contest, in the ranks of opposition and of 
the advocates for liberty, entering a path thickened with per- 
ils and darkened with doubts, was looked upon as an act of 
rashness by many, whom his interest would have prompted 
him to conciliate, and his affections to indulge, but his patriot- 
ism overruled every motive of this sort, and the voice of duty 
was to him more imperious than the claims of consanguinity, 
more seductive than the tempting prospects of personal ease 
and ultimate security. Neither the strong ties of the one, nor 
the flattering allurements of the other, drew him for a moment 
from his purpose. 

This state of things was a source of a good deal of incon- 
venience and anxiety, and subjected him to suspicions, which 
certain persons took care to foster and circulate. Mr Jay 
wrote to him on one occasion j ' Your enemies talk much of 
your tory connexions in Philadelphia. Take care. Some 
people of importance in your city apprehend ill consequences 
from it to yourself, as well as to the State, and wish you to be 
more circumspect. They have informed me of this in a 
friendly manner, that I might hint it to you. Do not unne- 
cessarily expose yourself to calumny, and perhaps indignity.' 
In referring to the same subject, in a letter to Mr Jay, he ob- 
serves, ' as to the malevolence of individuals, it is what I have 
to expect. It is by no means a matter of surprise, that I 
should be hated by some men. But I will have my revenge. 
By laboring in the public service, so as to gain the applause 
of those whose applause is worth gaining, I will punish them

severely.' As his letters to his mother were obliged to be 
passed through the enemy's hands, it was insinuated that they 
contained other particulars, than those intended for her, and 
that the Britieh in New York were profited by his correspon- 
dence. So gross a suspicion, mumured against a man, whose 
zeal and labor, in the cause he had chosen, afforded every day 
conspicuous proofs of its falsity, was not likely to be listened to 
by many, whose opinion was worth regarding, yet it was turn- 
ed to account by the malicious and meddlesome, and whisper- 
ed abroad to his disadvantage. 

An incident occurred, which may be cited as a curious illus- 
tration of this fact. In the year 1775, a gentleman who had 
married his sister, and for whom he had great personal regard, 
a loyalist in principle, and at that time in London, wrote 
him a letter containing the following paragraph. ' Your letter 
gave me inexpressible pleasure, but the accounts I have of 
you from others give me still more. Every increase of your 
reputation is a source of heartfelt satisfaction to me. Go on 
and deserve well of your country. Endeavor to keep peace 
and good order, and to moderate the madness of the people. 
The most vigorous preparations are making for carrying on 
the war. Trade and manufactures are, contrary to the 
expectations of America, in the most flourishing state. The 
nation is united, and although their pulse does not beat so 
high, as if they were waging war against a foreign enemy, yet 
they are firm and determined. Suffer not yourself to be de- 
ceived, by the anecdotes and accounts in the English news- 
papers. They will lead you into fatal errors. They only 
exhibit the devices and express the wishes of a few obscure, 
desperate, and otherwise insignificant people, who have nei- 
ther the good of this country nor of America at heart, and of 
consequence are enemies to boih.' 

The fate of the letter conveying these sentiments was sin- 
gular. When it arrived in New Yor'< it was detained, as 
ing directed ton rebel. Thence it went toHaliiax. From Hal 
ifax it was returning to New York again on board a large ship, 
which was stranded on the shore of New Jersey. The mail 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 157 

drifted to land, where it was found, and thence transported into 
the interior, to Burlington or Trenton. A delegate in Con- 
gress from New Jersey told Mr Morris, that there was a letter 
for him in this mail, and when Mr Morris desired him to pro- 
cure it, the delegate expressed doubts, saying he thought he 
might procure him a sight of it, but could not promise to ob- 
tain the letter itself ; and this he said with an air of mystery 
and suspicion, at which Mr Morris felt somewhat indignant, 
and solicited him no further, nor took any more notice of the 
affair. Soon afterwards, however, he received it enclosed in 
another letter from Mr Reed, President of Pennsylvania, to 
whom it had been sent, and on whose mind, as well as on 
some others, it had produced an unfavorable influence, al- 
though it came to hand more than three years after it was 
written, and Mr Morris had all that time filled important public 
stations, among the foremost in principle, spirit, and activity, 
in resisting the aggressions of Britain, asserting independence, 
and setting up new forms of government. 

That he might avoid every ground of reproach, his letters 
to his mother, and other relations within the enemy's lines, 
were unfrequent and short, and confined for the most part to 
the common-place topics of his health and situation. The 
ona alluded to above, however, is an exception from this 
character, and bears a strong testimony to the goodness of his 
heart and the strength of his filial affection, as well as to the 
sacrifice of feeling, which he had made in separating himself 
from his friends, and pursuing a course which they did not 
approve. 

' York Town, Pennsylvania, April 17lh, 1778. 
' Dear Madam, 

' I sit down to let you know, that I am in this world, 
though in a remote part of it. I have heard of yon. but not 
form you, since I left Morrisania ; neither have I had the sat- 
isfaction to learn, that, of the many letters I have written, 
you have ever received one. It would give me infinite

since it is my lot to know no more than the burthen of general 
report, I must be contented. 

' I received great pain from being informed, that you are 
distressed on my account. Be of good cheer, I pray you. I 
have all that happiness, which flows from conscious rectitude. 
I am blessed with as great a portion of health, as usually belongs 
to the share of mankind. Content with what I have, and with 
what I am, I look forward serenely to the course of events, con- 
fident that the Fountain of supreme wisdom and virtue will pro- 
vide for the happiness of his creatures. It gives me pain, that 
I am separated from those I love, but comparing this with 
what thousands suffer, I dare not repine. Let me earnestly 
recommend to you so much of religion, as to bear inevitable 
evils with resignation. I would that it were in my power to 
solace and comfort your declining age. The duty I owe to 
a tender parent demands this of me, but a higher duty has 
bound me to the service of my fellow creatures. The natur- 
al indolence of my disposition has unfitted me for the paths of 
ambition, and the early possession of power taught me how 
little it deserves to be prized. Whenever the present storm 
subsides, I shall rush with eagerness into the bosom of private 
life, but while it continues, and while my country calls for the 
exertion of that little share of abilities, which it has pleased 
God to bestow on me, I hold it my indispensable duty to give 
myself to her. 

1 1 know that for such sentiments I am called a rebel, anc 
that such sentiments are not fashionable among the folks yc 
see. It is possible, though I hope not, that your maternj 
tenderness may lead you to wish, that I would resign these 
sentiments. Let me, however, entreat, that you be not con- 
cerned on my account. I shall again see you, perhaps the 
time is not far off. I am much distressed for . I sincere- 
ly love him, and I fear that we are separated for a long season. 
Pray remember me to him most affectionately, and to my sister. 
She too has been much wounded. The loss of her infai 
must have greatly distressed her ; but perhaps her own expe- 
dience may have led her to prize life at its just value, and if 



GODVERNEUR MORRIS. 159 

so, it is a blessing she may not think so estimable, as to wish it 
for her child. Remember me most tenderly to all her little 
infants, to Isaac particularly, who, I am told, has not forgot- 
ten me. Poor child, I hope it may be in my power to return his 
attention by the protection of a parent. God forbid that he 
should need it, or any of them. Remember me to Mrs Ash- 
field and her children, for I think she has more than one. 
I wish her husband had acted more consistently ; but enough 
of this. And now, my dear Madam, let me again entreat 
you to make yourself happy. Discard the gloomy ideas, 
which are too apt to crowd into the mind in your situation 
and time of life. There is enough of sorrow in this world, 
without looking into futurity for it. Hope the best. If it hap- 
pens, well; if not, it will then be time enough to be afflicted, 
and at any rate the intermediate space will be well filled. 
Adieu. Yours, most affectionately. 

* GOUVERNEUR MoRRIS.' 

About three years after the date of this letter, his mother 
being dangerously ill, he formed a design to visit her, and ob- 
tained permission for that purpose, through the usual channel, 
from the British cammander in New York. As soon as this 
was known, the public journals took it up, and appealed to 
him not only with the strong language of persuasion, but with 
some severity of remark. The contemplated visit was censur- 
ed as improper for a person, who had been in offices of high 
and responsible trusts, and although his fidelity might not be 
doubted, yet it was a temptation to which no one ought to 
expose himself, and an, example of pernicious tendency. To 
go into the enemy's lines, invested with a public character, 
or charged with a public commission, would give him claims 
to support the dignity of his station, and maintain in his own 
person the rights of independence and equality, but to enter 
there as a private individual, admitted only by the permission 
or sufferance of the enemy, and for no other than a personal 
and private object, might expose him to accidents that would 
be mortifying to himself, and cause regret to his countrymen. 



160 LIFE OF 

It would, moreover, in any event, redound to his injury after 
his return, for it would afford a pretence for malicious persons 
to refer any future political course, which he might pursue, to 
some supposed connexion with his transactions in New York. 
These considerations, urged equally by friends and foes, he 
thought had weight, and he resolved to forego the visit. That 
his motives might be known to the public, who had chosen to 
view the matter in so grave an aspect, he published the fol- 
lowing statement. 

' The address in the Freeman's Journal of this day, compels 
me to trouble my fellow citizens with a detail of those circum- 
stances, to which it alludes. I hope they will excuse me 
for calling their attention to the insignificancy of domestic con- 
nexions. From the early moments of the present contest, 
my political sentiments and conduct have been clear and de- 
cided. In the year 1 776, I left all for the sake of those prin- 
ciples, which have justified and supported the revolution. 
This sacrifice was made without hesitation or regret, but it 
gave me real concern to leave an aged parent at the mercy of 
the enemy. It is true, I was for some time honored by my 
countrymen, much beyond my desert, and beyond my ambi- 
tion. When our prospects were very gloomy, I was deeply 
engaged in public business of an intricate nature, and placed 
in a variety of arduous and critical situations. I have thought 
much, labored much, suffered much. In return, I have been 
censured, reproached, slandered; goaded by abuse, blackened 
by calumny, and oppressed by popular opinion. All this has 
been borne without complaining, and avenged only by for- 
giveness. My defence was left to time, and that candor 
which generally prevails when the gusts of passion have sub- 
sided. 

' I received many pressing solicitations to visit my moth( 
within the enemy's lines. I declined it. At length a violent 
disease endangered her life, and I learnt from some of 
friends her anxiety to see me, before her eyes were closed 
forever. I promised to go. Application was made to the 



GOOVERNEUR MORRIS. 161 

British General, and his passport was obtained. She had by 
that time in some degree recovered ; but still laboring under 
the pressure of sickness and age, she solicits the performance 
of my promise. I have applied to the President and Coun- 
cil of Pennsylvania. Their permission has not been obtained. 
This is my situation. I have not listened to the solicitations 
of interest, but have yielded to the voice of nature and affec- 
tion, in the moment of extreme sensibility. These, my coun- 
trymen, were the motives of my conduct. I did not think that 
conduct reprehensible ; but since my intentions are disagree- 
able to you, I shall persist no longer. Having already devoted 
the better part of my life to your service, I will now sacrifice 
my feelings to your inclination.' 

Not many weeks after his return to Congress from Valley 
Forge, he drew up a very long paper, exhibiting a detailed ac- 
count of the actual state of public affairs, and designed for the 
use of Congress. It is a remarkable evidence of his industry, 
close observation, and the minute knowledge he had acquired 
of the proceedings in all the civil and military branches of the 
government. The first takes up the finances, his favorite 
theme, and treats largely of the causes of depreciation, and its 
consequences. He next suggests a remedy, and proposes a 
method for restoring the value of the money, and procuring 
solid funds adequate to the public demands. One of his chief 
expedients is economy in expenditures ; and when he comes 
to the army, as he does afterwards, and exposes the enormous 
abuses in that department, with which his enquiries had made 
him acquainted, arising from a bad system, mismanagement, 
waste, perquisites, and frauds in purchases and issues, it is not 
surprising, that he should place this item in the foremost list. 
He sketches out a plan of reform, by which the money con- 
cerns of the army should be kept under a more rigid inspec- 
tion, and entrusted to more responsible hands. 

Great evils he conceives to have grown out of the loose 
manner, in which the national expenditures generally had been 
made, and the little absolute knowledge that Congress, by its 
14* 



162 LIFE OF 

present mode of doing business, could possibly have of this 
subject. He recommends a treasury board in due form, with 
its apparatus of treasurer, auditors, comptroller, and clerks, 
shows in what manner its machinery should move, and con- 
tends that nothing short of such a system, carried thoroughly 
into effect, would secure the funds of the nation from the end- 
less waste, peculation, and fraud of the multiplied agents, 
whose hands they must necessarily pass through. He pro- 
poses, also, a navy board, and a board of commerce ; and 
above all, he insists on the necessity of an Executive Committee, 
whose office it should be to see that the resolves and plans of 
Congress were carried into execution, receive reports from 
the several boards, memorials from other bodies, and put all 
business of this sort into a proper form to come before the 
House. He enters still more largely into the affairs of the ar- 
my, speaks of each department separately, enumerates its de- 
fects, in some cases its outrageous abuses, and presents a 
scheme of changes and reforms on a systematic scale through- 
out the whole. 

How far this paper had an influence on Congress cannot 
now be known, but it is an able performance, marking not 
more the laborious industry of the author, than his public 
spirit, the wide compass of his views, and the justness of his 
conceptions. 

The zeal with which he devoted himself to the improve- 
ment of the medical department of the army, and the reliance 
placed on his activity and influence, may be inferred from the 
following extract of a letter, written by Dr Shippen, at that 
time Director General of the Hospitals of all the American Ar- 
mies, dated at Moor Hall, June 17th, 1778. 

' I am importuned by all the sons of JEsculapius to apply to 
you on their behalf, and entreat you to finish the new arrange 
mcnt of the medical department, and to put them on the es 
tabiishment. Much good will arise to the public, and mm 
expense be saved, by making only one system, and that in the 
manner you have before you. A great many useless and ig- 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 163 

norant officers will be discharged, men of science will be 
enlisted, and no more be employed than are necessary. Many 
offer now for places. I put them all off, till the examination, 
which should be held immediately. Any particular duties of 
the subordinate officers must be pointed out by the medical 
triumviate, as necessity requires. Dr Jones is now at Tren- 
ton, and I hear will be in camp in a few days. 

' I expect in a day or two to send you my general return. 
I have been very busy here these ten days in removing the 
sick from the army, and instituting new hospitals in its rear. 
Cochran, Hutchiason, and others, conjure you, as their patron 
and protector, to use your great influence in our behalf.' 



CHAPTER X. 

MR MORRIS'S CORRESPONDENCE WITH GENERAL WASHINGTON. CONWAY'S 

INTRIGUES. GENERAL LAFAYETTE. FOREIGN OFFICERS IN THE SER- 
VICE OF THE UNITED STATES. PETITION OF THE AMERICAN OFFICERS. 

GENERAL GREENE. 

A correspondence commenced between Mr Morris and Gen- 
eral Washington on public affairs, which continued with little 
interruption while the former was in Congress. And here let 
me add, that the friendship between these two patriots, which 
had its beginning at the time of their first interview at Newark, 
as heretofore related, on the day previous to General Wash- 
ington's entry into New York, in his way to take the command 
of the army at Cambridge, became more strongly cemented 
by time, was never diminished, and ceased only with death. 
While the war lasted, Mr Morris adhered firmly to the inter- 
ests of the commander in chief, discountenanced the plots set 
on foot against him by the ambitious, the envious, and factious 
in the army, and more than approved by a few wayward spirits 
in Congress, and on all occasions he was not a more zealous 



164 LIFE OF 

defender of the liberty and rights of his country, than of the 
purity, ability, and exalted character of the chief, in whose 
hands its destinies were mainly placed. Washington did not 
undervalue nor forget these early proofs of regard ; he return- 
ed them with warmth and sincerity at that time, and continued 
them with unabated confidence to the end of his life. 

Mr Morris's first letter to General Washington was dated at 
York Town, April 18th, 1778. 

< Dear Sir, 

' I expected before this time to have written to you, that 
provision is made for the American officers, but that thief of 
time, procrastination, has kept it off from time to time. The 
question is now the order of the day, and, as such, takes 
place of every other business. When it will be determined, 
I know not, but this I know, that it shall be finished one way 
or the other before anything else, let what will happen. I 
am confident it will go right, if something very extraordinary 
does not occur. In the interim nothing is done. I feel as 
severely on this occasion as you can do. All will yet go well. 

' We have determined to send Gates to Hudson River, 
where he is to command very largely. But he is to receive 
instructions, which shall be proper. You are directed to call 
a council of major generals, in which the chief engineer is offi- 
cially to be a member, and to which, by a subsequent resolu- 
tion, Generals Gates and Mifflin were ordered to repair. 
As these gentlemen ought not to receive orders immediately 
from Congress, they are, as you will see, permitted to leave 
the board of war upon your order. This amendment was 
therefore acquiesced in unanimously.* Colonel Harrison will, 



* There is an allusion here to the differences, which existed between 
General Washington and General Gates, springing out of Conway's 
affair. Mr Moms desired Washington to understand, that, by this 
mode of appointing a council of war, and putting Gates and Mifflin 
under his order, by an open vote, Congress had expressed decidedly 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 165 

I believe, be again appointed a member of the Board of War. 
This I mention by the bye. I add my wish, that your busi- 
ness and your inclinations may be so ordered, as to allow him 
to accept of it. For this I have many reasons. Every man 
of business knows, that words are of great weight, and we re- 
ceive reports from the Board of War every day. I need say 
no more, except that it is not always possible to weigh sen- 
tences with that accuracy in a public assembly, which is prac- 
ticable in the closet.* It is astonishing that Congress, who 
certainly are not without sufficient apprehension, should at 
so critical a moment as the present be so supine, but this is 
human nature, and we must bear it. I have a remedy in con- 
templation. If you were an unconcerned spectator, it would 
divert you to see, that although a majority of our House have 
been agreed in a certain point, ever since Mr Dana arrived 
here, yet nothing is done. 

' Apropos, of your council of war. Should you determine 
on anything, which, considering the course of human affairs, 
is, I confess, rather improbable, let Congress know nothing 
about it. A secret should never be trusted to many bosoms. 
I will forfeit anything, except reputation, that it will not be 
well kept, even by those necessarily confided in. I am, &LC. 

( GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.' 

In replying to this letter, Washington observes, ' you say, 
all will yet be well. I wish it heartily, but I am much mistak- 
en if there are not some secret and retrograde springs in mo- 



their views of the merits of the case, and their determination to sus- 
tain him against the intrigues and cabals of his enemies. Gates 
was now at the head of the Board of War, and sending him to the sta- 
tion on Hudson River, where he would be under the immediate com- 
mand of Washington, was also another indication of the general senti- 
ments of Congress on this subject. 

* Colonel Harrison was Washington's secretary, a gentleman of 
ability, intelligence, and of great readiness in transacting affairs.

tion to prevent it.' His next letter is an answer to one of 
Mr Morris's that has been lost. 

1 Valley Forge, May 18th, 1778. 
1 My Dear Sir, 

' As the council held at this place was by order of Congress, 
and the members constituting it were pointed out by them, it 
was determined, out of respect to that body, to treat the new 
members with civility. Indeed the wish of all here, that no 
private differences should interrupt that harmony, which is so 
essential in public councils, had no small share in the amity 
that appeared. Contrary, I own, to my expectation, the same 
sentiments, respecting the measures to be pursued, pervaded 
the whole. Our resolutions of consequence were unanim- 
ous. 

* I was not a little surprised to find a gentleman, who, some- 
time ago, when a cloud of darkness hung heavy over us, and 
ouf offairs looked gloomy, was desirous of resigning, to be 
now stepping forward in the line of the army. But, if he can 
reconcile such conduct to his feelings, as an officer and man of 
honor, and Congress have no objections to his leaving his seat in 
another department, 1 have nothing personally to oppose to it. 
Yet I must think, that gentlemen stepping in and out, as the 
sun happens to beam forth or be obscured, is not quite the 
thing, nor quite just with respect to those officers, who take 
the bitter with the sweet. 

' I am told that Conway, from whom I have received an- 
other impertinent letter, dated the 23d ultimo, demanding the 
command of a division of the continental army, is, through the 
medium of his friends, soliciting his commission again. Can 
this be ? And if so, will it be granted ? I am very sincerely 
and affectionately, 

'.GEORGE WASHINGTON.' 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 167 

MR MORRISES REPLY. 

< York Town, May 21st, 1778. 
' Dear General, 

' We are going on with the regimental arrangements as fast 
as possible, and I think the day begins to appear with respect to 
that business. Had our Saviour addressed a chapter to the ru- 
lers of mankind, as he did many to the subjects, I am persuad- 
ed his good sense would have dictated this text ; Be not wse 
overmuch. Had the several members, who compose our 
multifarious body, been only wise enough, our business would 
long since have been completed. But our superior abilities, 
or the desire of appearing to possess them, lead us to such 
exquisite tediousness of debate, that the most precious mo- 
ments pass unheeded away like vulgar things. 

' As to what you mention of the extraordinary demeanor 
of some gentlemen, I cannot but agree with you, that such 
conduct is not the most honorable. But, on the other hand, 
you must allow that it is the most safe, and certainly you are 
not to learn, that, however ignorant of that happy art in your 
own person, the bulk of us bipeds know well how to balance 
solid pudding against empty praise. There are other things, 
my dear Sir, besides virtue, which are their own reward. 
And the feelings of others will, unless I mistake, sooner or 
later break out into a retribution of those acts and neglects, 
which at present pass away unnoticed by the herd of observ- 
ers, or rather lookers on. 

' As to your friend, who has thought proper to demand of 
you a command, I did believe from the first, that his resig- 
nation was, like some former ones from the same quarter, 
merely calculated to gain either promotion, or favor, or re- 
venge. I was therefore led to expect, that his merits and 
our misfortune in losing him would become the topic of 
declamation, and took the earliest opportunity to express in the 
very strongest terms my satisfaction, my joy, at the receipt of 
the letter from him, and of consequence to assign the reasons 



168 LfFE or 

why this event gave me so much pleasure. This gave a very 
different turn to affairs. Panegyric dwindled to apology, 
and no opposition was made to the main point of accepting 
his resignation. The next day I was informed, that he did not 
intend to resign, that his letter was quite misunderstood. &tc. 
The gentleman, however, had been so unlucky, as to use the 
most pointed terms, and therefore his aid, from whom the 
information came, was told that the observations he made came 
too late. I am persuaded, that he will attempt to get reinstated, 
if the least probability of success appears, but L am equal- 
ly persuaded, that his attempts will fail. I believe his friends 
are hitherto of the same opinion, and therefore we have 
as yet had no attempts made in Congress, and possibly we 
never shall. lam, &c, 

' GOUVERNEUR MoRRIS.' 

The issue proved in some degree different from Mr Morris's 
expectations. Other attempts were made, and strenuously 
urged by Conway's friends, to induce Congress to restore the 
commission, which he had proffered in a freak of ill humor, 
and which was by a large number, at least, joyfully accepted. 
Conway, it seems, was much chagrined to find himself taken 
at his word, having too high an opinion of his importance in 
the army, to dream for a moment, that his services could be 
dispensed with ; and his success in gaining an appointment 
from Congress, after the hostile disposition he had shown to- 
wards Washington, doubtless contributed to encourage his ex- 
travagant self estimation and demands. 

It was in October, shortly after the affair at Germantown, 
that Conway began to intrigue against the commander in chief, 
and in the January following he was sent to Albany, as an offi- 
cer in the wild expedition to Canada, planned by General 
Gates, and at the head of which he contrived to place the 
Marquis de Lafayette, much to the subsequent regret and 
mortification of that gallant general. The expedition failed, 
or rather it never existed, except in name, and Conway staid 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 169 

in Albany till the middle of May, having in the mean time 
made a show of resigning his commission, and received the 
unwelcome intelligence, that he was taken, in earnest, and re- 
lieved from the burden of his official responsibilities. Then 
it was, as Mr Morris says, that there came apologies, and ex- 
planations, and complaints of being misunderstood, but all 
without avail. Conway at length resolved to go in person to 
Congress, not doubling that he should be able on the spot to 
soften the obdurate hearts or subdue the sturdy resolution of 
his -opponents. The result will be seen in the following letter 
to his friend Gates, who was then at his head-quarters in 
Fishkill, on the North River, and whom Conway had visited 
on his way from Albany. 

' York Town, June 7th 1778. 

Dear General, 

' I never had a sufficient idea of cabals until I reached this 
place. My reception, you may imagine, was not a warm one. 
I must except Mr Samuel Adams, Colonel Richard Henry 
Lee, and a few others, who are attached to you, but who can- 
not oppose the torrent. Before my arrival General Mifflin 
had joined General Washington's army, where he commands 
a division. One Mr Carroll from Maryland, upon whose 
friendship I depended, is one of the hottest of the cabal. He 
told me a few days ago almost literally, that anybody, who 
displeased or did not admire the commander in chief, ought 
not to be kept in the army. Mr Carroll may be a good pa- 
pist, but I am sure the sentiments he expresses are neither 
Roman nor Catholic. I expect to depart from this court in a 
very few days. If there is any attempt from the enemy upon 
your post, I will ask your leave to serve in the quality of a 
volunteer. I am with true esteem, &cc. 

' THOMAS CONWAY.' 

This was the end of General Conway's military career in 
the United States. He had no opportunity to join his friend, 
as a volunteer in active service. A few months afterwards he 

VOL. 1. 15 



170 LIFE OF 

sailed for France, a melancholy example, in his disappoint- 
ments and regrets, of the just retribution which awaits pre- 
sumptuous vanity, secret intrigues, and uncurbed ambition. 

MR MORRIS TO GENERAL WASHINGTON. 

' In Congress, May 27th, 1778. 

'Dear General 

' I have a word to say to you on the subject of promotion, 
which we have just now finished, or rather unfinished, at least 
if that matter was before in an unfinished situation. That fa- 
mous incomprehensible Baltimore resolution, introduced, un- 
luckily perhaps, a very tedious debate, which terminated at 
lenght by rejecting the whole of what the committee reported, 
with relation to the promoting of officers. You may be a 
little surprised, when I tell you, that upon the whole matter I 
believe this is best. But how ? It is true, I confess, that 
much ground of heart-burning is left, under the Baltimore 
resolution governing these matters by the mysterious trinity of 
seniority, merit, and quota. 

1 Let me, however, on the other hand observe, that to tie up 
the hands of the republic as to the officers, whom they are to 
appoint, is utterly inconsistent with the republican principles of 
government, which ought to prevail among us. No danger, 
it .is true, can arise at present ; but, my dear Sir, we are laying 
foundations, and how posterity in future wars may build on 
the foundations laid by ancestors, whom they will certainly 
reverence, no man can be hardy enough to assert. What 
then, you will say, is the effect of the new rule? Tn my 
poor opinion it is no rule. What then is the use of the 
resolution ? Nothing more, than an apology for officers, whom 
it may be found necessary to supersede. 

' Congress, in effect, seem to have pledged themselves to 
their constitutents, that they will pay a due attention in the 
quota of troops furnished by the States respectively to the sen- 
.iority of the several officers, and to that degree of military abil- 
ities, which nature or industry may have conferred upon de- 
serving individuals. You ask me what is to be the rule of pro- 
motion below the degree of a general officer. I answer, that 






GOUVERNEUB MORRIS. 171 

Congress could not with propriety make any rule. They 
have given to the States the power of appointing the officers 
in their own regiments; consequently it would be idle to re- 
strict them, as to the persons whom they shall appoint. It will, 
therefore, be necessary to make application to the several 
States on the occasion. They have already, I believe, in 
most instances given you the necessary power, and if so, then 
to fix the order of promotion will only be a limitation of such 
power. I am, dear General, most sincerely yours, 

1 GOUVERNEUR MoRRIS.' 

The following letter will perhaps sufficiently explain itself, 
and yet it may be thought somewhat harsh, in reference to the 
foreign officers, who came to this country for the apparently 
generous purpose of fighting against its enemies. But the 
truth is, that both Congress and the commander in chief were 
extremely annoyed and embarrassed with persons of this sort, 
many of whom had very slender claims to notice, either on 
account of their military rank at home, or their general char- 
acter. Washington was the chief sufferer, for when, by their 
own forwardness or by the importunity of friends, they had 
gained admission into the service through the channel of 
Congress, they were turned over to him to be provided with 
stations in the army, suitable to their newly acquired rank. 
This could rarely be done, except at the expense of native of- 
ficers ; and when done, the new incumbents were frequently 
found to be more distinguished, by their absurd pretensions and 
overweening conceit than by any solid qualifications for the 
posts they filled. Here was then a double evil, the discon- 
tent of American officers, whose promotion was thus interfered 
with, and the incapacity and troublesome demands of their 
substitutes. 

It is no wonder, that, with such a system of operations, 
Washington's patience should at length have become exhaust- 
ed. The subject was not one, which he could bring publicly 
before Congress. Delicacy forbad such a step, for among the 
foreign officers were a few, whose character and designs made 



172 LIFE OF 

them honorable exceptions to the general rule, and whose 
feelings were to be regarded. His only chance of remedy was, 
therefore, to express himself freely to his confidential friends in 
Congress, and endeavor through them to effect a change in 
the principles adopted by that assembly, in their appointment 
of foreigners to military rank. 

GENERAL WASHINGTON TO MR MORRIS. 

' White Plains, July 24th, 1778. 
' Dear Sir, 

' Whether you are indebted to me, or I to you, for a letter, I 
know not, nor is it a matter of much moment. The design of 
this is to touch, cursorily, upon a subject of very great import- 
ance to the well-being of these States ; much more so than 
will appear at first view. I mean the appointment of so many 
foreigners to offices of high rank and trust in our service. 

' The lavish manner, in which rank has hitherto been be- 
stowed on these gentlemen, will certainly be productive of 
one or the other of these two evils, either to make it despica- 
ble in the eyes of Europe, or become a means of pouring 
them in upon you like a torrent, and adding to your present 
burden. But it is neither the expense nor trouble of them 
that I most dread. There is an evil more extensive in its na- 
ture, and fatal in its consequences, to be apprehended, and that 
is, the driving of all your own officers out of the service, and 
throwing not only your army, but your military councils, en- 
tirely into the hands of foreigners. 

' The officers, my dear Sir, on whom you must depend for 
the defence of this cause, and who, from length of service, their 
connexions, property, and, in behalf of many, I may add, mili- 
tary merit, will not submit much if any longer to the unnatural 
promotion of men over them, who have nothing more than a 
little plausibility, unbounded pride and ambition, and a perse- 
verance in application not to be resisted but by uncommon 
firmness, to support their pretensions ; men, who, in the first 
instance, tell you they wish for nothing more than the honor 
of serving in so glorious a cause as volunteers, the next day 






GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 173 

solicit rank without pay, the day following want money ad- 
vanced to them, and in the course of a week want further pro- 
motion, and are not satisfied with anything you can do for 
them. 

' When I speak of officers not submitting to these appoint- 
ments, let me be understood to mean, that they have no more 
doubt of their right to resign, when they think themselves ag- 
grieved, than they have of a power in Congress to appoint. 
Both being granted, then, the expediency and the policy of the 
measure remain to be considered, and whether it is consistent 
with justice or prudence to promote these military fortune- 
hunters, at the hazard of your army. They maybe divided into 
throe classes, viz. mere adventurers without recommendation, 
or recommended by persons, who do not know how else to dis- 
pose of or provide for them ; men of great ambition, who 
would sacrifice everything to promote their own personal glory ; 
or mere spies, who are sent here to obtain a thorough know- 
ledge of our situation and circumstances, in the execution of 
which, I am persuaded, some of them are faithful emissaries, 
as I do not believe a single matter escapes unnoticed, or un- 
advised at a foreign court. 

' I could say a great deal on this subject, but will add no 
more at present. I am led to give you this trouble at this time, 
by a very handsome certificate showed me yesterday in favor 
of M. Neuville, written (I believe) by himself, and subscribed 
by General Parsons, designed, as I am informed, for a founda- 
tion of the superstructure of a brigadiership. 

' Baron Steuben, I now find, is also wanting to quit his in- 
spectorship for a, command in the line. This will be pro- 
ductive of much discontent to the brigadiers. In a word, al- 
though I think the Baron an excellent officer, I do most de- 
voutly wish, that we had not a single foreigner among us, ex- 
cept the Marquis de Lafayette, who acts upon very different 
principles from those which govern the rest. Adieu. I 
am most sincerely yours, 

'GEORGE WASHINGTON.'

LIFE OF 

MR MORRIS TO GENERAL WASHINGTON. 

' Philadelphia, August 2d, 1778. 

' Dear General, 

' I was in your debt. It is my fate always to be so with 
my friends. But, believe me, my heart owes nothing. Let 
me add, that you can do me no favor so great, as to comply 
with your wishes, except an opportunity to serve the public, 
which indeed is your highest wish, as you have evinced fully 
to all the world, and particularly to your friends. 

' I feel the full force of your reasoning. The faith of Con- 
gress is in some measure plighted to M. de la Neuville, but 
it is not their interest that his brevet shall give command. I 
will take care to get this expressed by a particular resolution. 
The Baron has a claim, from his merit, to be noticed, but I 
never will consent to grant what I am told he requests, and 
I think Congress will not. At least they will not if I can 
help it. 

' I this instant was informed of the opportunity of an ex- 
press for camp, which goes immediately. Let me, however, 
congratulate you on the affair at Monmouth, on the whole af- 
fair. It might have been better, it is said. 1 think not, for 
you have, even from your enemies, the honor of that day. 
You have enemies. It is happy for you that you have. A 
man of sentiment has not so much honor, as the vulgar sup- 
pose, in resigning life and fortune for the service of his coun- 
try. He does not value them as highly as the vulgar do. 
Would he give the highest evidence, let him sacrifice his feel- 
ings. In the history of last winter, posterity will do you jus- 
tice. Adieu, believe me sincerely yours, 

' GOUVERNEUR MoRRIS.' 

TO GENERAL WASHINGTON. 

< Philadelphia, October 26th, 1778. 

' Dear General, 

' The conduct, which the enemy may pursue, with relation 
to us, is not quite decided. But I have not a doubt, that their 




GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. * 175 

efforts during the next campaign will be chiefly towards our 
frontiers, vviih a view to weary us into submission. At the 
same time they will perhaps endeavor to keep such posts in 
our country, as to render the communications tedious, difficult, 
and expensive. My ideas as to our power of carrying on the 
war differ in some respects from those, whose opinions 1 re- ' 
spect. The .resources of the country may be drawn forth by 
our paper, at the same time it must be confessed, that this pa- 
per will thereby be less valuable. After all, the debt does not 
increase, for a certain sterling sum, which would have paid it 
one year ago, will pay it now. The depreciation in the inte- 
rim has operated as a tax. 

' I very sincerely lament, that this tax has fallen heavy on 
those, who have served and continue to serve their country. 
It is a peculiar hardship upon us, that fully to relieve the evils 
they labor under is not in our power. This leads me to the 
petition you mention, or representation, which I have not yet 
seen, and never wish to see.* I cannot easily express to you 
how much I was hurt at being informed of it. Not indeed as 
to the matter, for that I really am a stranger to, but as to the 



* A letter, which he had received from Washington a few days be- 
fore, contained the following passage. 

' The high prices of every necessary ; the little, indeed, no benefit 
which officers have derived from the intended bounty of Congress in 
the article of clothing ; the change in the establishment, by which so 
many of them are discontinued ; the unfortunate delay of this business, 
which kept them too long in suspence, and set a number of evil spirits 
at work ; the unsettled rank and contradictory modes of adjusting it ; 
these, with other causes which might be enumerated, have conspired to 
sour the temper of the army exceedingly. They have, I am told, been 
productive of a Memorial, or representation of some kind, to Con 
gress, which neither directly nor indirectly did I know, or even hear, 
was in agitation, till some days after it was despatched. This was 
owing, as I apprehend, to the secrecy with which it was conducted, 
in order to keep it from my knowledge, as I had in a similar instance 
last Spring discountenanced and stifled a project of this sort in its 
birth.' 



176 LIFE OF 

manner in which it was procured. For, in the first place, it 
gave my enemies, (who were such in some degree for my 
earnest support of the claims of the army heretofore,) no small 
cause of triumph. This, say they, is the consequence of your 
zeal for an establishment. Besides this, I considered myself 
in some measure as an advocate for the army. I loved them, 
from my acquaintance with some individuals, and for the suf- 
ferings which as a body they had bravely and patiently endur- 
ed ; and, therefore, I could not but suffer when I found them 
taking steps, which in my opinion cannot do them honor, and 
which incapacitated me from urging, as I otherwise should 
have done, every redress in our power of their grievances. 

' But what chiefly affected v me was, that this meeting ofdel- 
egates from brigades, in a mixture of civil and militaiy capa- 
city, carries with it the air of deeper design, than I believe to 
be in the bosoms of those, who were immediately concerned. 
It was by procedures such as these, that the good Fair- 
fax made way for a crafty Cromwell, and that he dismissed a 
tedious wrangling Parliament, and established a military des- 
potism. It is a melancholy truth, that when one faction takes 
possession of the human heart, men are hurried into extremes, 
which make considerate people tremble. I will not do your 
army the injustice even to permit a thought, that they wish to 
get rid of their General. But, Sir, their, and your, and our 
enemies, do not want the confidence to say so, and indeed to 
say that they can prove it, and to attempt that proof from the 
manner of procuring (agitating as they term it) the petition 
in question. Certainly could such ideas be inculcated, it 
would answer their views. It would also answer their views 
to instil into the army a distrust of Congress, and therefore I 
doubt not but the enemies of both are assiduous in this busi- 
ness. I find also the British commissioners are so bare faced, 
as to hold out the bait of promotion in the royal army to such, 
as will fall in with their designs, and doubtless a peculiar por- 
tion of their bounty will be dispensed to those, who shall sow 
the seeds of dissensions in an army, which, as they cannot 
conquer it, it is their only resource to divide. 



GOUVERNEUR MOURIS. 177 

' Thinking on this subject as I do, it did and does ap- 
pear to me my duty, as a good citizen, thoroughly to discoun- 
tenance every measure of this kind, particularly when it is 
ushered forth, as the first mention of this affair was to me, by 
an observation that the army had it in their power to do 
themselves justice. It makes me unhappy to learn, that such 
discourse prevails I arn certain that they who use it have 
no design ; but they should consider that it affords matter for 
the designs of others to work upon. It has not made any se- 
rious impression, I believe, on the minds of those, whose opin- 
ions have real weight, because it is considered as one of those 
light expressions, which flow from the luxuriance of the imag^ 
ination. Little do those, who say such things, know the diffi- 
culties of subsisting an army. 

' The Marquis will hand you a plan, on which I shall say 
nothing, because I have already had a great deal of trouble 
with it, and he could say more than I can write in a week, 
and you know more of the subject than all of us together. 

' We have no news. Let me then tell you what has the 
merit of truth, if not the charms of novelty, that I am, dear 
General, very sincerely yours, 

'GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.' 

' P. S. General Lee's affair hangs by the eyelids. We 
spent one day upon it without even touching upon its merits. 
The debate Was, in what manner to proceed to a decision. 
Some contended for the propriety of resolving simply to ap- 
prove or disapprove of the sentence. Others were for enter- 
ing into the considerations of the charges, and the evidence 
on them separately, without however making any entry on the 
minutes. A third for doing this, and making the entries. 
This, as the most systematic method, I supported, for truly I 
know not how to determine in the lump. Granting him 
guilty of all the charges, it is too light a punishment. And 
if he is not guilty, in the opinion of Congress, of any one, 
there would be an injustice in not declaring their opinion. 

' Conway has again applied for a certificate of his good ser- 



178 LIFE OF 

vices, and I have again opposed the grant of it. This letter 
lies on the table. Again, my friend, adieu.'* 

He wrote to Washington on the 26th of April, 1779. 
' You must permit me most heartily to congratulate you upon 
the very important intelligence, which Monsieur Gerard will 
confidentially communicate to you. It is, and indeed ought to 
be, a secret even from Congress, for which I need give you 
no reasons, as you are but too well acquainted with them. 
Measures have already been taken for obtaining the necessary 
supplies, which the Minister will detail to you. These you 
will undoubtedly assist, as far as may fall within your line.' 
This intelligence related to the intended return of Count 
d'Estaing, with the French squadron from the West Indies, 
and had been secretly communicated to M. Gerard, the 
French Minister in the United States. M. Gerard visited 



* In a letter from Conway to his friend General Gates, dated at Phila- 
delphia on the twenty-eighth of October, he writes as follows. 

' I waited with impatience for a Safe opportunity of conveying a let- 
ter to you. I communicated the one written to me by my honest 
friend, Colonel Troup, to several worthy people here, who discovered 
a just indignation at the ungenerous attempt made upon the favor of this 
country. This affair, in reflecting honor upon you, has covered with 
shame the authors of the infamous plot. 

' I am now in perfect health. I shail take the first opportunity of 
returning to France, and expect to sail towards the latter end of next 
month, or the beginning of December. Congress makes some diffi- 
culty in granting me such a certificate, as I have never seen refused 
to a private soldier when discharged. This difficulty, by what I hear 
from some members, is owing to the dread of disobliging a certain 
person. 

'I will take it as a particular favor, if you are so kind as to trans- 
mit to me, by a safe hand, the copy of the letter you Inn e written to 
General Washington from York Town, in January last, concerning 
the paragraph imputed to me. I should be happy to receive it as 
soon as possible.' 

The ' certain person,' mentioned above, was of course General Wash- 
ington. Wliat he means by the ' infamous plot ' must be left to the con- 
jecture, or better knowledge of the reader. 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 179 

Washington's camp to consult with him, as to the best mode of 
co-operation between Count d'Estaing and the American 
forces. 

Two plans were proposed. The first, to make a combined 
attack upon the enemy in New York ; or, secondly, for Count 
d'Estaing to act in conjunction with the American troops in 
Georgia. Washington agreed to unite in executing the first plan, 
provided the French Minister would give him positive assur- 
ances, that the French navel force in America would be supe- 
rior to that of the British, otherwise he considered an attack 
upon New York unadvisable. The Minister could not give 
such assurances, and the project was abandoned. The se- 
cond plan was pursued, and accordingly Count d'Estaing 
brought his fleet to act in concert with General Lincoln in 
Georgia. 

While in the camp at Valley Forge, Mr Morris contracted an 
intimacy with General Greene, which was matured into a warm 
and enduring friendship. At this critical juncture of public 
affairs, the views of these two ardent patriots were in unison 
upon the topics of general interest, particularly in regard to 
the arrangements of the army, and the necessity of some 
speedy and efficient plan for bringing into action, on a larger 
scale, the military energies of the nation. The lofty, and gen- 
erous', and disinterested spirit of Greene found in Morris senti- 
ments as elevated, motives as pure, and designs as resolute 
and unbiassed, as those which he was conscious animated his 
own breast. They were also bound together by another tie, 
their devoted regard for the commander in chief, whose ene- 
mies at this time were beginning to assume a bolder attitude. 
Already the bane of their influence was seen to tinge some of 
the open resolves of Congress, and the effects of their secret 
machinations, and dark intrigues, were producing the ominous 
fruit of discord and divided counsels among the civil rulers of 
the nation. Under these circumstances it was the more nat- 
ural, that the friends of order, the true lovers of justice and of 
their country's cause, should be drawn closely together by the 



180 LIFE OF 

strong bonds of mutual attachment and a common pur- 
pose. 

During the last campaign, the quartermaster general's de- 
partment, either by mismanagement, or neglect, or a vicious 
system, had run into strange confusion, and caused much disor- 
der in the army, and suffering to the soldiers, for the want of 
timely aid and sufficient supplies of every kind. The voice of 
the whole army cried out for a reform. This subject came 
under the notice of the committee from Congress, and a plan 
was set on foot for new modeling the department. The im- 
portant question then was, who should be placed at its head. 
The post was so arduous, the business so complicated, the 
pecuniary responsibility so great, that none but an officer of the 
first rank, of commanding talents, untiring industry, and tried 
integrity, was adequate to the trust. Washington fixed his 
mind upon Greene, who, after much persuasion, was induced, 
though reluctantly, to accept the appointment. Friendship for 
the commander in chief, and a deep sense of the deplorable 
condition of the army, were the only motives that could 
prevail upon him to assume a charge, which he foresaw 
would bring him into many difficulties, and expose him to the 
clamorous obloquy and unmerited reproach of enmity and ig- 
norance. As a member of the committee for arranging the 
quartermaster's department, Mr Morris became his corres- 
pondent, and both by his influence in Congress, and by his 
private counsels, aided and sustained the efforts of his friend. 
The subjoined letter from General Greene to him is dated at 
Valley Forge, June 1st, 1778. 

'I received your favor of the fifth of May, upon the sub- 
ject of the quartermaster's department, and intend to fol- 
low your advice, in order to my own justification, and to 
silence the faction. I have represented the substance of what 
I wrote you, (only more fully,) in a letter to the General, 
requesting his advice and direction, which he has given much 
in the same terms as you did. But I am frightened at the 
expense; t have drawn on the treasury already for upwards 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 181 

of four millions of dollars, and it seems to be but a breakfast 
for the department, and hardly that. The land carriage is 
so extensive and costly, the wants of the army so numerous, 
and everything selling at such enormous prices, that our dis- 
bursements will be very great. I dare say they will far ex- 
ceed your expectation. 

' I have written to Congress for their sense and direction, 
upon several matters respecting the department. I beg you 
will endeavor to bring the matter to issue as soon as possi- 
ble, as I am much at a loss to know how to proceed. 

' The enemy appear from every piece of intelligence to be 
making all necessary preparation to evacuate Philadelphia. 
I should be glad of your opinion respecting their future op- 
erations. Some of the officers think they are going to the 
West Indies ; others are of opinion that they are going up the 
North River. There is one objection to this scheme. There 
is not a sufficient force to co-operate with Sir Henry from 
Canada. 1 should think, that if Great Britain meant to be se- 
rious in her propositions for a reconciliation with America, her 
forces would be collected together at some secure place, and 
there wait to see the issue of the Commissioners' negotiations. 

* Sir Henry Clinton sent out a letter to his Excellency a few 
days ago, respecting certain acts of Parliament lately passed 
in favor of America, as he terms it. This letter I suppose 
has been before Congress before this time. 

' General Me Dougall is not well pleased at the manner of 
his being superseded in the command on the North River. 
He thinks the public will form some unfavorable sentiments 
respecting it. General Gates will not meet with the most cor- 
dial reception there. However, he will undoubtedly be treat- 
ed politely. Governor Clinton showed me several letters, re- 
specting the operations of last campaign, which will do him 
much credit in history. 

'Pray how came General Mifflin to be ordered to join this 
army ? This is a phenomenon in politics. General Con way is 
at last caught in his own trap, and I am most heartily glad of

it. I wish every such intriguing spirit may meet with the 
like disappointment in his ambitious designs. He is a most 
worthless officer as ever served in our army. 

'I suppose you go on pretty much in the old style, puzzling 
one another with doubts and difficulties ; each striving to 
display the greatest wisdom and ingenuity. What progress 
have you made in the establishment of the army ? The half 
pay you have fixed at seven years. Most of the officers are 
discontented with it, and I am sorry for it.'

THE most essential service rendered by Mr Morris, during 
his career in Congress, was the part he took in the intercourse 
with the British Commissioners, who had been sent over with 
what were called Lord North's conciliatory propositions, or 
bills. After the disastrous failure of the Canada expedition 
under Burgoyne, the fruitless adventure of Sir Henry Clinton 
up the North River, and the empty victories of Howe in Penn- 
sylvania, the British ministry began to havo misgivings, as to 
the ultimate success of their armies in America. The third 
year of the war had terminated, without any visible progress 
in the road of conquest, and, so far from subduing the rebel- 
lious spirit, or diminishing the military resources of the Amen 
cans, their antipathies were daily gaining vigor from fres 
resentments, the offspring of renewed provocation, and their 
power of resistance was growing more consolidated and formi-

dable, from the experience of their officers and soldiers in the 
habitudes of war, the gradual institutions of civil government, 
and the universal obedience rendered by the people to the 
resolves and recommendations of Congress. Add to this 
discouraging aspect of affairs in America, the symptoms that 
could be no longer mistaken in France, of an approaching alli- 
ance between that country and the revolted colonies, and it 
will not appear strange, that the eyes of the ministers should 
be opened, arid that they should begin to think of some new 
plan of operation. 

They clearly foresaw that the high tone, which pride on the 
one hand, and the popular feeling on the other, had hitherto 
induced them to assume, could not be sustained, nor the prom- 
ises they had held out to the nation be realized. Prudence for 
once gained admittance into their councils, and spoke to them 
in the voice of wisdom, feebly it is true, but yet so loud as to 
be heard and listened to. From that moment they began to 
talk of concession and conciliation, and made all haste to 
bring before Parliament the drafts of two bills, one giving up 
the point of taxation, which had been the old root of bitterness, 
if not the sole cause of contention, and the other enabling the 

* O 

King to appoint and send out Commissioners to treat with the 
Americans, on all the questions in dispute. So eager were the 
Ministers to anticipate any connexions, which might be in 
progress with France, that they despatched these bills as soon 
as they were reported, and before they had been acted on by 
Parliament. They reached New York,' were immediately 
printed there, and circulated in the country, as widely as could 
be done by the agency of the British. Copies were sent to 
Washington at Valley Forge, which were transmitted by him 
to Congress with severe animadversions upon their character, 
and the means taken to spread them abroad. These bills 
were read in Congress as soon as they arrived, and then 
referred to a committee, of which" Morris was chairman. His 
associates were Drayton and Dana. 



184 LIFE OF 

On the 22d of April, two days after the bills arrived, the 
committee made a report, which was drawn up by Morris, and 
unanimously adopted by Congress. So far from a conciliatory 
purpose and tendency, the committee found in the bills only 
an insidious design to operate on the hopes and fears of the 
people, and to create among them divisions and disaffection to 
the common cause ; and, after enumerating sundry objection- 
able particulars, they declared it as their opinion, that the Uni- 
ted States could not with propriety treat with any Commission- 
ers sent on the part of Great Britain, with whatever powers 
invested, unless, as a preliminary, the British fleets and armies 
should be withdrawn, and the independence of the United States 
acknowledged in express and positive terms. The report con- 
cluded with a recommendation to the several Stales, to make 
strenuous exertions in getting together, as speedily as possi- 
ble, their respective quotas of troops for the approaching cam- 
paign, and have their militia in readiness for any exigency.* 

Just ten days after Congress had passed their decision on 
these bills, a messenger arrived at York Town, bearing copies 
of the treaties with France, by which that nation had become 
an ally to the United States in the war. This intelligence dif- 
fused universal joy ; and it was a reflection, which contributed 
not a little to elevate the self respect of the people, that Con- 
gress had taken so decided a stand in rejecting the advances of 
England, before they had any knowledge of this new alliance. 
The treaties were ratified, and a committee appointed to bring 
forward an address to the people of America, on this occasion 
of a new and most propitious crisis in their affairs. 

This task again devolved on Mr Morris. f The perform- 



* Mr Jay wrote to his friend on the 20th of May, as follows.

too strikingly marked with Morris, not to be known by his friends to

ance is somewhat florid and rhetorical in its style, but admira- 
bly suited to the object in view, that of awakening the atten- 
tion of tlie people, and impressing strongly upon them a just 
understanding of their actual condition and prospects. A pic- 
tu>'e is drawn of the troubles, difficulties, and sufferings, which 
they had gone through, the patience with which they had 
endured them, their constancy in adhering to their first de- 
terminations, and the resoluie perseverance and chivalrous 
courage, with which they had foiled the schemes and met the 
force of their adversaries. And, that the picture might lose 
nothing for the want of due contrasts, the motives, aims, and 
conduct of the enemy are exhibited in a relief, and with a col- 
oring, that could not fail to have an imposing effect on the least 
practised observers, and minds the least prone to excitement. 
The success thus far in sustaining the contest is put forth as an 
earnest of the future, a source of renewed hope, and a mo- 
tive of cheerful effort and unwavering confidence. Nothing 
was wanting, but that the people should be true to them- 
selves and faithful to their early pledges. 

Considering these preliminary movements, it was not likely 
that the British Commissioners would find Congress in a hu- 
mor to treat with them, or to receive with much show of 'com- 
plaisance their advances. It happened unluckily, moreover, 
that in the first letter they wrote to Congress, alter their 
arrival in New York, enclosing the conciliatory bills as ap- 
proved by Parliament, they ventured reflections on the con- 
duct of France in joining the United States, which proved 
extremely offensive to the assembled representatives of her 
new ally. So much were they exasperated when this part of 
the letter was read, that the reading was suspended by a vote, 



Morris's papers, in his own handwriting. In one of Mr Jays' letters 
to Mr Morris, he says; 'The JMdrcss of Congress is much liked, and 
has its use. I have not yet met with a single whig in this Sfite (New 
York) willing to accept peace on Lonl North's terms.' Mr Jay appar- 
ently did not know who was the author of the Address when he wrote.

The reply to the letter by the President of Congress was 
much in the tone of the report noticed above, seasoned with 
the declaration, that nothing but the desire of saving the fur- 
ther effusion of blood could have prevailed upon them to read 
a paper, treating with so much disrespect his most Christian 
Majesty, and containing propositions so derogatory to the hon- 
or of an independent nation ; professing at the same time a 



* The following is part of a letter from Robert Moms to Gouver- 
neur Morris, dated Valley Forge, June 16th, 1778. 

'I came down here about ten days ago, expecting to go into Phila- 
delphia immediately, and should certainly have done so, had not the 
Commissioners arrived at the critical time they did. Since then I 
have been prevailed on to stay, day after day, until Congress give 
them their answer, which, it is expected here, will be such, as will 
send them off immediately. After that answer is given, I should like 
to hold an hour or two's conversation with my friend, Governor John- 
stone, but have not yet determined on doing so. I think he will be 
much mortified at his disappointed embassy, and I could wish to con- 
vince him, that Great Britain may still be happy and continue rich, 
by forming a commercial alliance with us, on the same broad basis 
that other nations do. It will be no difficult matter to convince any 
reasonable man, that Great Britain would still enjoy under such trea- 
ties the greatest share and most valuable parts of our trade ; but the 
best and most liberal of the British subjects feel themselves humbled, 
in the idea of quitting their sovereignty over us; and this with many 
will preclude all reasoning on the subject. Whether Governor John- 
stone is of this number or not, I cannot tell ; but we know he is 
strongly opposed to our independence, although unbounded in offers 
of everything else. No offers must tempt us; they ought not to 
have a hearing of one. moment, unless preceded by acknowledgment 
of our independence, because we can never be a lumpy people under 
their domination. 

' I have frequently ventured to assert here, that Congress will nc 
give ii]) one iota of their former resolves on this subject, nor do a 
thing in the least degree inrtuisistt lit \\ith their public faith, plighted

readiness to make peace, when the King of Great Britain 
should provide the way for it, by acknowledging the indepen- 
dence of the United States, or withdrawing his fleets and armies. 
The affair was also now encumbered with a new condition, since 
the alliance with France rendered the assent of that nation 
necessary, before a treaty of peace could he confirmed. 

But these things are matters of history, and this is no place to 
dwell upon them any farther, than to show the active and res- 
ponsible agency taken in them by Mr Morris. It is known that 
the Commissioners m j t with a total failure, by reason of the in- 
admissible, and in some respects offensive propositions, which 
they were authorized to hold out, their indiscreet mode of pre- 
senting them, and the adventurous experiment of one of their 
number, who had the effrontery to tamper with the integrity of 
some of the most distinguished individuals in Congress, vain- 
ly supposing, that the lure of British gold would effect what 
was unattainable by the power of British arms, and the arts 
of negotiation. In short, the result of this mission was every 
way unpropitious. to the interests of those by whom it was 
planned, as it left a settled disgust on the minds of the Ameri- 
cans, rather than respect for the motives, or faith in the pro- 
fessions of their enemy. 

In the management of the business in Congress, and in the 
views of the subject which went abroad, and made impressions 
on the public, Mr Morris must be considered as having a chief 
share. He penned the reports and resolves, that were from 
time to time issued, and when the matter was brought to a 
close, he drew up, as one of a committee appointed for the 
purpose, a sketch of the whole proceedings, which was pub- 
lished. This performance was entitled, ' Observations on the 
American Revolution,'' and extended to a hundred and twenty 
two closely printed pages. In addition to an account of the 
doings of Congress, in regard to the Commissioners, there is a 
condensed and well written introduction, containing an outline 
of the causes of the war, the means used by the Americans to 
avert it, their unavailing efforts to secure a recognition of their 



188 LIFE OF 

rights, and the chief events that had hitherto occured. The 
whole was executed with address and ability, manifesting a 
deep knowledge of the principles and reasons on which the 
contest was founded, and an ardor of patriotism not surpassed 
in any writings of the day. As soon as the pamphlet reached 
London, it was reprinted entire in Almon's Remembrancer.* 

In the monih of October, 1778, the instructions were pre- 
pared to be sent from Congress to Dr Franklin, as Minister 
Plenipotentiary at the Court of Versailles. 

It is an honorable testimony to the high standing of Mi- 
Morris in Congress, that the task of drafting these instructions 
was assigned to him, and the more so, as they were the first, 
which had ever been sent to an American Minister Plenipo- 
tentiary at a foreign court. To show the confidence reposed 
by Congress in their new ally, his most Christian Majesty, Mr 
Morris had an interview with the French Minister, M. Gerard, 
and read to him the instructions before they were submitted 
for the decision of Congress. These gentlemen entered into 
a free and amicable discussion of their several parts. 

One important feature was struck out at the suggestion of 
M. Gerard. Jt was among the favorite schemes of a party in 
Congiess to drive the British from the seaports, and thus 
multiply the means and conveniences of building up an Amer- 
ican navy. An article to this effect was introduced into the 
insi ructions to Dr Franklin, enjoining him to use his efforts to 
persuade the French Ministry to send out an augmented naval 
armament, which, in conjunction with the American land for- 
ces, should be adequate to such an object. M. Gerard had 
doubts of the scheme, deeming it neither practicable nor expe- 
dient. He did not believe the British could be driven from 



* In the Remembrancer for the year 1778, page 300, there is along 
letter addressed to the Commissioners, <u,d signed l J3n Jlmericun,' to 
which the following note is appended. 'This letter is ascribed to

the seaports, in which their force was concentrated, and where 
they had peculiar advantages for defending themselves. Be- 
sides, if such a thing were feasible, they would settle down in 
some other quarter, where they would command equal facili- 
ties for doing mischief. To compel them to change their 
attitude was not necessarily to weaken their power. And as 
for the pleasing vision of an American navy, two or three years 
at least must be consumed in such an undertaking, before it 
could arrive at the dignity of usefulness, even if it should 
escape the attacks of the enemy in its nascent state, and this 
with a great expenditure and the tendency of protracting the 
war beyond its probable duration. The good sense of these 
hints was too cogent to be overlooked, and the article on this 
head was left out of the instructions. 

The project for attacking Canada came likewise into the 
discussion with the French Minister, but he discouraged it, as 
in truth he was directed to do before he left France, it having 
been the settled policy of that court from the beginning to let 
Canada remain in the hands of the British, although it has 
generally -been supposed a part of the French King's intention 
in joining the United States to recover that province, which 
had been lost in a way not calculated to flatter the pride of his 
nation, in the preceding war with England. Jt is certain, how- 
ever, that the positive instructions to both of his Ministers in 
America prove his views to have been the reverse of this sup- 
position. He was resolved neither to take possession of Can- 
ada himself, nor assist the United States in such an enterprise, 
although if actually attacked, or even taken by the Americans, 
no interference was to be attempted, nor obstacles thrown in 
their way. 

This was the policy of France, steadily and secretly pur- 
sued, both in regard to Canada and Nova Scotia. 1 say 
secretly, because neither the American government, nor Dr 
Franklin in Paris, was acquainted with it. The grounds of 
this policy may not be easily discovered, but the reason for 
keeping it secret is manifest. Everybody in America, from 



190 LIFE OF 

the leaders in Congress and the army downward, looked upon 
the conquest of Canada as the glorious achievement, which of 
all others would most signalize their arms, and promote the 
ends of the war. The time, the manner, and the means, were 
always matters of perplexing uncertainty, but the great object 
itself no one ever regarded in any other light, than as an acqui- 
sition of momentous weight in the broad scale of American 
affairs. The French government were well informed of this 
state of feeling ; they well understood the consequence of 
uttering aloud sftntiments of a different complexion. It was 
clear, that their aims would be misinterpreted, their motives 
suspected. Hence the instructions to their ministers, not to 
second any proposals of this kind, with encouragement of aid 
from France, nor to show a hostility to the measure by taking 
an open and decided stand in opposing it. 

In fact the French always had fears of the American lovs of 
conquest. They had pledged themselves to support the inde- 
pendence of the United States to the last, but not to go abroad 
to the north, and the west, and the south, seeking foreign 
adventures, and extent of dominion. If this spirit were allowed 
to predominate, there would be no end to the war, till the 
whole continent and the islands were forced to come under the 
banners of freedom, and receive, willingly or not, the proffered 
bounty of independence. Whatever glory or advantage might 
have redounded to the United States, from such an extent of 
territory and power, if achieved by their own prowess, it was 
certainly no part of the contract with France, that she should 
go out with them, on crusades of this sort, paying her own 
charges, and loaning money to her allies to pay theirs. It was 
the express stipulation of France, that she would continue the 
war at all hazards till the independence of the United States, 
in their original extent, should be secured. This pledge she 
redeemed faithfully, generously, to the very letter, and in the 
very spirit of the contract. 

The conversation on the other parts of the instructions to Dr 
Franklin took a discursive range, touching upon various inter- 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 191 

ests of the two parlies to the alliance. Mr Morris observed, 
thnt fears were entertained of the influence of Spain over 
France, hy reason of the close relations that existed between 
the royal families ol the two nations, and that preposessions im- 
bibed from this quarter might lead the latter to adopt a false 
policy in regard to" the western frontier ; it being even suspect- 
ed by some, that France was willing Canada should be held 
by England, out of complaisance to her ancient friend, with 
the view of diverting the attention of the Americans on that 
side, in which case they would be less likely to turn their 
thoughts towards the Spanish territories in the regions of the 
Mississippi. Should such a fancy dwell in the heads of the 
French Cabinet, he considered it delusive and unwise, for the 
English would bo masters of the Lakes, and naturally friends of 
the Americans, from a similarity of habits and a reciprocity of 
wants and benefits. For the same reason, they would be mu- 
tually hostile to the Spaniards, who would thus gain two 
troublesome neighbors. Whereas, in the other state of the 
case, the worst that could happen to them would be to have 
one. 

M. Gerard replied, that he was ignorant of the disposition 
and policy of Spain, but he knew that power was jealous of 
the spirit of enterprise shown by many of the American 
people 5 that he had himself been informed from credible 
sources, that since the beginning of the war, four or five 
thousand persons from New England had planted themselves 
on the banks of the Mississippi in the Natchez country ; that 
such a force on a frontier sp little known, joined to the views 
entertained by the American government in regard to St 
Augustine, Pcnsacola, and Mobile, was calculated to excite 
distrust in Spain ; that it seemed to him important for the 
United States to give some surety to that power, by fixing cer- 
tain limits which should not be passed. In answer to Mi- 
Morris's question, as to the nature and extent of this surety, 
M. Gerard said, that the renunciation of any design upon Pen- 
sacola, Mobile, and St Augustine, and even of the navigation 
of the Mississippi, would perhaps be necessary to accomplish 



192 LIFE OF 

an object so important to both parties, and ensure the confi- 
dence and friendship of Spain. Mr JM orris replied, that many 
pf his colleagues thought it was time to pass a law de coercendo 
imperio, that to extend the territory of the United States farther 
to the south and west would be rather to weaken than con- 
firm the union, and that the poverty and vigor of the north 
were the best safeguards of the Republic. He said these 
$ame persons considered it for the interest of the Confedera- 
tion, that the navigation of the Mississippi, as high up as the 
mouth of the Ohio, should appertain exclusively to his Catho- 
lic Majesty, because it would be the only means of retaining 
under dependance to the Republic the mass of population, 
which would spring up between the Ohio and the Lakes, and 
in the eastern settlements of Virginia ; that the inhabitants of 
these immense regions, whether English or Americans, having 
an outlet down the St Lawrence on one side, and the Mis- 
sissippi on the other, would be in a condition to domineer 
over the power of the United States, and even of Spain, and 
would in the end render themselves independent. 

M. Gerard asked if this was the general sense of Congress, 
for he knew several members, who thought the navigation of 
the Mississippi should belong equally to the English and 
Americans. Mr Morris answered, that these topics had not 
been agitated in such a manner, as to come to any positive 
result, but the prevalent feeling was, that it would not be expe- 
dient to extend dominion to the south, and he belisved the 
persons, who wished to take possession of the Floridas, had a 
scheme of ceding them to Spain for a. pecuniary consideration ; 
and that some of those at least, who were bent on securing 
the navigation of the Mississippi, were interested in the new 
establishments in that quarter.* 



* It is proper to state, perhaj)s, that the substance of this conversation 
has been drawn from a despatch of M. Gerard to the Count do \er- 
gennes, dated at Philadelphia, Octolrer twentieth, 1778, and nowdepos- 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 193 

The most essential article in the instructions to Dr Franklin was 
that, which enjoined on him the necessity of procuring pecuni- 
ary aid from the French Court, and of representing in their 
strong and true features the distresses of the country, on ac- 
count of the deranged state of the finances, and the impossibili- 
ty of prosecuting the war to any good effect, unless supplies of 
money from some quarter could be obtained. To put Dr 
Franklin in possession of facts and arguments on this subject of 
vital importance, Mr Morris wrote Observations on the Finances 
of America, designed to illustrate and accompany the article in 
question, and which Dr Franklin was ordered by a letter from 
the President of Congress to lay before the French Ministry. 



ited among the 'American Papers,'' which I examined in the Archives 
of Foreign Affairs in Paris. 

The concluding paragraph of this same despatch, although on anoth- 
er subject, will not be the less interesting to every American reader. 
It was written at the end of the second campaign, in which General 
Lafayette had been engaged in America. Eighteen months before, it 
must be remembered, he escaped from France in defiance of the 
authority of the King, and entreaties of his friends, with a determina- 
tion to fight the battles of liberty in the new world. He was now 
about to return to his native country, honored with the confidence and 
marked approbation of Congress, and the hearty applause of the 
whole American people. 

'I ought not to terminate this long despatch,' says M. Gerard to the 
Count de Vergennes, 'without rendering to the wisdom and dexterity 
of the Marquis de Lafayette, in the part he has taken in these discus- 
sions, the justice which is due to his merits. He has given most salu- 
tary counsels, authorized by his friendship and experience. The 
Americans have strongly solicited his return with the troops, which 
the King will send. He has replied with a due sensibility, but with 
an entire resignation to the will of the King. 

'I cannot forbear saying, that the conduct equally prudent, cour- 
ageous, and amiable of the Marquis de Lafayette, has made him the 
idol of the Congress, the army, and the people of America. A high 
opinion is entertained of his military talents. You know how little I 
am inclined to adulation, but I should be wanting in justice, if I did 
not transmit to you these testimonials, which are here in the mouth of 
the whole world.'

It was the purpose of these Observations, to show the causes 
of the financial difficulties in the United States, and to suggest 
remedies. The history of the paper currency was touched 
upon, and also the reasons of its depreciation, its effects in pro- 
ducing monopolies, deranging prices, creating distrust, and thus 
gradually destroying its own value. Although the disease was 
radical and complicated, the remedies were simple. Taxa- 
tion, subsidies, and loans were the three prescriptions, each of 
which, if duly applied, would work a cure. The first was im- 
possible in the existing state of things, because the absolute 
amount of money in the country was not adequate to the pay- 
ment of taxes, and new emissions of paper would only in- 
crease the evil. Domestic loans were equally fallacious, because 
they must be paid in the defective currency, subject to fluctua- 
tion, which would not tempt money holders to risk atransaction 
of this sort. The only remaining resource was in foreign loans 
or subsidies, and, after coming to this point, the business was 
turned over as usual to Dr Franklin, to be managed by such 
address, ingenuity, and force of argument, as he should find 
at his command. 

Notwithstanding the coldness of M. Gerard, Congress could 
not forego their splendid scheme of attacking Canada in con- 
cert with France, and it accordingly found its way into the 
instructions to Dr Franklin, explained at large by a copy of 
the plan proposed for conducting the attack. Meantime the 
scheme was submitted to General Washington, whose letter in 
reply, pointing out many objections and discouragements, was 
referred to a committee, of which Mr Morris was chairman. 
The committee concurred in the views of Washington, and 
reported to that effect, at no small sacrifice of their own bright 
anticipations. The Canada project was thus laid aside, not 
seasonably enough to keep it out of the instructions to Dr 
Franklin, but in time to transmit to France by General Lafay- 
ette the ultimate decision of Congress, and prevent any steps 
being taken in the affair under those instructions. 

During the winter General Washington visited Philadelphia,

in compliance with a request from Congress, for the purpose 
of consulting and agreeing on the operations of the next cam- 
paign. Mr Morris's long residence in the camp at Valley 
Forge, and his intimate knowledge of the arrangement and 
concerns of the army, indicated him as a suitable member to 
be one of the committee, for holding conferences with the com- 
mander in chief on the present occasion. The interminable 
Canada plan came up again, underwent a new investigation, 
and was dismissed without grace. Various modes of operation 
were then examined, future contingences weighed, means 
estimated, chances balapced, the probable force of the enemy 
discussed, as well as that which Congress could bring into the 
field, the most feasible points of attack considered, and at last 
a general system was struck out, which was to serve as the 
prominent aim both of Congress and the commander in chief, 
and to guide them into the same train of design and action.

DEBATES IN CONGRESS ON THE TERMS OF PEACE. MR MORRIS DRAFTS 

THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THIS SUBJECT. SILAS DEANE. THOMAS PAINF. 

MR MORRIS'S SPEECH IN THE AFFAIR OF PAINE. TREATIES WITH 

FOREIGN POWERS. 

ALTHOUGH we have hitherto seen Mr Morris in Congress 
mainly devoted to the interests of the army, and other matters 
of domestic concern, yet he was not less vigilant in becoming 
acquainted with the foreign relations, nor less active and labo- 
rious in giving his services to that department. As a proof of 
this, it needs only be mentioned, that in February, 1779, when 
a committee of five was appointed to consider certain impor- 
tant despatches from the American Commissioners abroad, and 
communications from the French Minister in the United 
States, Mr Morris was placed at its head. The report of 



196 LIFE OF 

this committee, in its character and consequences, was perhaps 
the most important that was brought forward during the war. 
It was the basis of the peace, which ultimately ensued, and 
embraced all the points then deemed essential or advisable to 
be urged in a treaty with England, when the time for such an 
arrangement should arrive. The question of boundaries, evac- 
uation of the posts within the territory of the United States, the 
fisheries, navigation of the Mississippi, and other topics of 
moment, were introduced under distinct heads, and in a form 
to be examined and discussed in Congress. 

This report was speedily called up, and kept under debate 
from time to time, as other business would allow, for the space 
of six months, that is, till the middle of August, during which 
period all the weighty principles of the expected treaty of 
peace were thoroughly canvassed, and the sentiments of each 
member clearly ascertained and openly expressed. Much 
unanimity prevailed, respecting the points in which the minis- 
ters for concluding a treaty were to be positively instructed, 
and wisely such points only were brought into serious discus- 
sion, or to a decisive issue. There would doubtless have been 
differences and contending opinions, had the inquiry come up, 
how far modifications or concessions should be made, under 
supposable circumstances, as the price of peace. Questions 
of this sort were prudently kept out of sight, and the attention 
of Congress fixed upon the principles considered fundamental, 
leaving a due latitude for contingences to the discretion of the 
negotiators. Mr Morris took a large share and a prominent 
lead in this long debate. When it came to an end, its results 
were to be embodied into a form of instructions to the Minis- 
ters, afterwards to be appointed for making peace. The drafts 
of these instructions were from the pen of Mr Morris, and 
unanimously adopted by Congress without change. 

An affair, in which he got deeply concerned, in common with 
nearly all the members of Congress on one side or the other, 
was the controversy emanating from Silas Deane's agency and 
negotiations in Europe. Owing to particular circumstances, 






GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 197 



this thing made a great noise at the time, being puffed into a 
consequence wholly disproportioned to its merits, or its true 
bearing on other events. Silas Deane went to France as an 
agent for certain mercantile and political purposes, on account 
of Congress. After being there five or six months, he was 
joined by Franklin and Arthur Lee, who, together with him- 
self, were appointed Commissioners, to obtain military or pe- 
cuniary aids from France, and negotiate a treaty of alliance, 
whenever that power should be ready for such a measure. 
At the end of a year and a half Deane was recalled, ostensi- 
bly to give Congress intelligence of their foreign affairs, but in 
reality through the machinations of his enemies. It was urg- 
ed, that he had transcended his powers in 'engaging French 
officers to come to Jthe United States, with promises of milita- 
ry rank and pay in the army. From the facts of the case, 
this seems probable, but surely this was a pardonable error of 
judgment, since he could have no other motive in the transac- 
tion, than that of advancing the interests of his country. Con- 
gress were much perplexed, however, with his engagements, 
and lost their patience when it was too late for their agent to 
remedy his mistakes. It should be remembered, nevertheless, 
that the services of Lafayette and the Baron de Kalb were se- 
cured to the United States, by one of these unauthorized stip- 
ulations of Deane. 

Long before the arrival of this Commissioner in Philadel- 
phia, there began to spring up divisions and personal antipa- 
thies in Congress, connected with the management of their 
foreign affairs, and the coals of discord were kept alive, and 
almost blown into a flame, by the ill advised and intemperate 
letters, which some of their agents abroad wrote home, not 
only to individuals in thnt Assembly, but under the guise of 
public despatches. In short, there was already a party in 
Congress, who had unconsciously prejudged his case, and 
whose opinions were embittered by the bold insinuations and 
acrimonious censure, that had proceeded with an unmeasured 
bounty from his enemies on the other side of the water. 
17* 



193 LIFE OF 

Hence, when Deane requested Congress to examine his official 
conduct, while acting as a Commissioner, and to pass a reso- 
lution either of approval or disapproval, he met with delays, 
and was put off from time to time with a partial hearing. 
Kept in this state of suspense for more than four months, 
he at last resolved on the unwise step of publishing an Ad- 
dress to the People, bringing his complaints before them, and 
detailing incidents in which he showed a plentiful lack of dis- 
cretion, and not the highest purity of motive. He attacked 
the character of men, to be sure, who he knew had injured 
him deeply and intentionally, but these were men in public 
stations, and the facts sustaining his charges were not of a kind 
to be brought forward in such a manner, and under such cir- 
cumstances, without the hazard of putting in jeopardy the pub- 
lic tranquillity, and the best interests of his country. * 

At this time Thomas Paine was a clerk in the office of the 
Committee of Foreign Affairs, or, as he was sometimes called, 
the secretary to that committee. Of course he had access 
to all the foreign despatches, being bound by his oath of office 
however, as well as by the laws of honor, not to reveal or ex- 
pose anything they contained. When Deane's Address came 
out, Paine entered the lists in the opposition, and filled the 
newspapers with columns of criticisms and confutations, du- 
ly seasoned with that cool, but irritating kind of invective, 
which he knew well how to use. 

In one of those pieces, alluding to Beaumarchais' supplies, 
he had the imprudence to affirm, that they were a gift from the 
French Government, and the more than folly to add, that, if 



* In writing to Mr Jay on the sixteenth of August, 1778, Mr Morris

know, are very liberal of iliibcrality. Your friend Deane, who lias 
rendered most essential servi<v>. stands as one accused. The storm 
increases, and I think some of the tall trees must be torn up by the 
roots.'

any person would come to his office, he would produce the ori- 
ginal documents verifying his assertion. The French Minis- 
ter deemed it necessary to take notice of such a declaration, 
in which the King was charged with openly sending aids to 
the colonies, while he was yet in alliance with England. As 
the charge came from a person known to be connected with 
the public offices, M. Gerard regarded it as claiming the at- 
tention of Congress, and presented a memorial to that effect. 
Paine was arraigned in presence of the House, and confessed 
himself to be the author of the offensive communications. 
After he retired, various resolutions were offered and discussed, 
the purport of which was, that the declaration in' regard to 
France was false, and that the secretary of the Foreign Com- 
mittee ought to be immediately dismissed, not only on this 
ground, but for violating his oath and misusing his trust, in 
publishing selections from the secret correspondence in his 
office. 

Strange as it may seem, this business gave rise to a heat- 
ed debate, and no decision was had respecting it at the end 
of the second day. On the morning of the third, Paine sent 
in his resignation. It is to be presumed, that the broad field 
of Deane's case, and the foreign affairs generally, came un- 
der discussion, otherwise it cannot be imagined that there 
should have been a difference of opinion. Mr Morris had 
early ranged himself on the side of Deane, and sustained the 
cause of that Commissioner, whenever il came before Con- 
gress, for such was the attitude in which it was presented at 
the beginning, that it was necessary for the members to take 
sides and act in some sort as partiz^ns, whether willingly or 
not. On the present occasion it is safe to presume, that 
Deane's friends were Paine's enemies, and vice versa. 

Among Mr Morris's papers, there is the copy of a speech 
delivered by him during the second day's debate, on the 
back of which he has entered this memorandum ; ' taken 
down from memory, to obviate misrepresentation.' This hint 
would imply, that it was a warm contest. It is the only in- 



200 LIFE OF 

stance, which 1 have discovered, of his writing out a speech 
pronounced in the old Congress. From the nature of its con" 
tents, and as indicating the temper of Congress at that time, 
the performance is worth preserving. 
'Mr President, 

' As the several motions on your table appear to be founded 
upon the same principle, 1 shall make some few observations 
which relate to them all, without balancing their respective 
merits, or taking notice of the many inaccuracies with which 
they abound. It gave me great pain, Sir, to hear in the de- 
bates, both of yesterday and this morning, the word party made 
use of. This is a word which can do no good, but may pro- 
duce much evil. If there be a party among us, the name is 
unnecessary. If there be not, it is unjust. And, certainly, 
there is not. There is indeed in this House a chosen band of 
patriots, who have a proper respect for each other's opinion, 
a proper sense of each other's feelings, and whose bosoms 
glow with equal ardor in the common cause, but no party. 

' Gentlemen mean nothing but the public good, though some- 
times they mistake their object. But I would warn them 
against indulging too far this tenderness for each other. When 
one has in view a favorite object, or has adopted a favorite 
opinion, others hastily catch the idea. The warm effusion 
flies from breast to breast, and reason lags in the pursuit. 
Hence arises a prepossession, which reason combats in 
vain. 

'1 hope for indulgence, whilst I state the case before us as 
it really exists. I know that a gentleman stands in a disagree- 
able attitude, whilst combatting principles, which appear to flow 
from a regard to the privileges of a citizen, and respect for the 
rights of mankind. Yesterday we were told by an honorable 
member, that these rights and privileges would be drawn into v 
question. This he ventured to prophesy and warned us to be- 
ware. On this occasion the honorable member was in capa- 
city to be an excellent prophet; a very excellent prophet, Mr- 
President. But I am not to be terrified by these shadows. I 




GOUVERNEUB MORRIS. 201 

trust I shall be able to show, that the rights of a citizen are 
novvioc concerned in the determination on the matter be- 
fore us. 

'Gentlemen exclaim, " do not deprive Mr Paine of his of- 
fice, without giving him a copy of the charge ; do not punish a 
citizen unheard !" I ask on what tenure he holds that office. 
Is it during good behavior .? If it be, he must be convicted of 
malconduct, before he can be removed. But we are not 
the proper court to take cognizance of such causes. We 
have no criminal jurisdiction clearly ; then, he ought not to 
be heard before us. But he does not hold his office during 
good behavior ; it is during pleasure. And what are we ? 
The sovereign power, who appointed, and who, when he no 
longer pleases us, may remove him. Nothing more is desired. 
We do not wish to punish him. 

' What then do we ask ? To turn a man out of office, who 
ought never to have been in it. Let us examine the cir- 
cumstances. Mr Paine, Secretary to the Committee of Foreign 
Affairs, styling himself Secretary of Foreign Affairs, acknow- 
ledges himself to be the author of a publication highly dishon- 
orable to his most Christian Majesty, and very injurious to him 
and us. Dishonorable to the King of France, because it is in 
direct contradiction to repeated assurances given to the British 
court. Injurious to our mutual interests, because it enables 
the Ministers of Great Britain to charge France with a breach 
of the treaties, and call upon other courts for the performance 
of engagements entered into, upon a view to that contingency. 
Gentlemen, who know Mr Paine, may be unwilling to believe 
this. It deserves consideration. The* Secretary of Foreign 
Affairs is the person, who, of all others, must from the nature 
of his office be best acquainted with such transactions. His 
assertions, therefore, contain the fullest weight, which know- 
ledge can give. And not only so, but from the importance of 
that office, none but the most approved and exalted character 
would be, by a wise people, entrusted to fill it. And, therefore, 
the ideas annexed to such a character will serve to authenti- 
cate his assertions. 



202 LIFE OP 

' Foreigners, Sir, have not an adequate idea of the manner, 
in which business is conducted in this House, nor the difficul- 
ties we have labored under. They are led to compare every- 
thing on the scale of their own experience. And what would 
be the idea of a gentleman in Europe of this Mr Paine ? 
Would lie ot suppose im to be a man of the most affluent 
fortune, born in this country of a respectable family, with wide 
and great connexions, and endued with the nicest sense of 
honor ? Certainly he would suppose, that all these pledges of 
fidelity were necessary to a people in our critical circumstances. 
But, alas, what would he think, should he accidentally be in- 
formed, that this, our Secretary of Foreign Affairs, was a 
mere adventurer/rom England, without fortune, without fam- 
ily or connexions, ignorant even of grammar? Could he be- 
lieve this ? And if assured of the fact, and if possessed of 
common sense, would he not think that we were devoid of it? 
And yet, Sir, this is the man whom we would remove from 
office, and this is the man, who has been just now puffed as of 
great importance. 

* Considering the case as it stands before us, there are three 
objects which require our attention. The first is, to obviate 
the ill effects of his publication. The second, to remove him 
from office. And the third, to assign proper reasons for that 
conduct, so as to connect the two first propositions together, 
and give a greater weight to all our measures. 

' In order to obviate the ill consequences of his mad asser- 
tions, we must pointedly contradict them. I say we must con- 
tradict them, for to such a deplorable situation has this man 
reduced us, that, although many gentlemen in the House 
might be of a different opinion, they would find themselves 
urged by irresistible motives of policy to contradict his asser- 
tions. Happily, we have on our table the fullest evidence to 
ground a declaration, that what he has published is untrue. 

' We must then proceed to assign our reasons for removing 
him from his office. These cannot be wanting. For, in the 
first place, he never was fit for it ; and, in the second place, he 







GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 203 



has abused it in the instance before us most flagrantly, and 
therefore is utterly undeserving of any farther confidence. 

' Lastly, we must remove him, 'or without this, in contra- 
dicting him, we shall not be believed. Nor is this the worst 
of the matter. The presumption is, that he would not have 
written these things without our consent, and therefore a disa- 
vowal of the person becomes necessary, not only to give credit 
to a disavowal of the thing, but to convince our allies, that we 
ourselves are not the authors of this infamous falsehood. And 
here gentlemen step in and tell us of Mr Paine's importance. 
Sir, were he really of importance, nay, more, were his asser- 
tions really true, I should not hesitate a moment to dismiss 
him from our service. Duty to our ally requires it. Duty to 
ourselves requires it. Look at his threatening letter on your 
table. What ! are we reduced to such a situation, that our 
servants shall abuse the confidence reposed in them, shall 
beard us with insolent menaces, and we shall fear to dismiss 
them without granting a trial forsooth ? And what are we to 
try ? Has he not acknowledged himself to be the author of 
those exceptionable paragraphs ? Are we not able to judge 
of them, and to determine what they mean ? Do we not 
know, that they contain a falsehood ? Suppose Mr Paine to 
be now standing at our bar, what would you do? Would you 
confess an ignorance of language, and ask what those para- 
graphs mean ? Surely you would not. Would you ask him 
whether the idea contained in them is true or false ? It is ut- 
terly unnecessary. His answer is ready ; that they are true. 
But we know them to be false, and we can hardly be so 
weak as to balance in our judgment between Mr Paine's opin- 
ion, and the full evidence on our table. 

* What then remains, unless it be to ask his advice as to our 
future conduct ! Sir, he will tell us that he is Thomas Paine, 
author of all the writings under the signature of COMMON SENSE, 
and Secretary of Foreign Affairs ; that he is a man of infinite im- 
portance, far more entitled to our respect, than the most Chris- 
tian King, and that we must not dare to dismiss him from our 



204 LIFE OF 

service, because to his other titles he adds that of a ' CITIZEN 
OF PENNSYLVANIA.' And should we take his advice ? And 
shall we be moved by his threats ? And shall we be amused 
by paltry tales of this person's importance ? T hope not. I 
am confident we should not have wasted so much time, and 
had so many motions on this subject, but that some gentlemen 
feel themselves interested in supporting the rights of a citizen ; 
and but for that mutual confidence, and good opinion, and re- 
ciprocal sentiment, which are too apt to mislead those, who 
are not constantly under the guard of reason.' 

It may not be amiss to state, that, for some time previous to 
this occurrence, there had been a good deal of skirmishing in 
the newspapers between Morris and Paine. The articles of 
the latter were known by his usual signature, Common Sense. 
He had attacked Morris, as he did other people, with an in- 
delicacy of censure amounting to a coarseness, little becoming 
a gentleman, or an honorable disputant. In the affair of the 
British Commissioners, and on other subjects, Morris had writ- 
ten under the signature of AN AMERICAN. At length there 
appeared a series of papers signed AMERICANUS, which, from 
their ability, and the resemblance of the adopted names, were 
supposed to come from Mr Morris. They were seized upon 
by Paine with his accustomed acrimony, and treated as con- 
taining principles at variance with the political interests of 
America. Among other charges, the author was accused of 
having a design to exclude the United States from the fisheries, 
and this charge was pressed in such a manner, not only by 
Paine, bnt also by another writter following in his track, and 
calling himself Tiberius Gracchus, that Mr Morris felt bound 
to come out with an anonymous disavowal, signed CATO, in 
which he denied that he was the author of the articles in ques- 
tion, or had any knowledge of them till they were published. 
But Paine was not silenced so easily, and he continued to 
write and affirm whatever pleased his fancy, or suited his pur- 
pose. ^ 

How far this little warfare of the quill might have operated 




GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 205 

the mind of Mr Morris, and inclined him to see the dark 
shades in Paine's character and conduct, the reader can judge. 
It is evident enough, however, that the offence merited, as its 
least punishment, a suspension from office, and nothing more 
was urged. Thirty years afterwards, when Paine, in the midst 
of his poverty and voluntary wretchedness, applied to Congress 
for a reward of his services during the revolution, he remem- 
bered the above speech, and took his revenge by calling the 
author, in his letter of application, ' prating Gouverneur Mor- 
ris.' He professed also to have another provocation, as will 
be seen when we meet him hereafter in the prisons of Paris. 

There was a difference of opinion at this time in Congress, 
as to the expediency of seeking foreign alliances, and formal 
recognitions of independence. Mr Morris was with the party, 
who were for maintaining a little reserve in this respect, and, 
as he expresses it, ' he opposed what seemed to him a 
rage for treaties.' Like the shield of the contending knights, 
the question had fairly two sides, each of which appeared of 
a different hue and quality, according to the position from 
which it was viewed, whilst the body and substance of the 
thing itself remained the same. In the first place, the digni- 
ty and respectability, which would attach to the United States, 
by being admitted into the family of nations, gave a tempting 
aspect to one side, which was made still more attractive by 
the possibility, (a very slender ground it must be confessed) 
that those, who should have the good nature to admit us 
as equals, would also have the fellow feeling to aid our neces- 
sities. The ardent, the aspiring, the statesmen of sanguineous 
temperament, and those who were dazzled with the kindling 
prospect of national glory, took this view of the subject, and 
urged it as an essential act oY respect for ourselves, to press 
foreign courts to take us by the hand, and bid us even a re- 
luctant welcome into their circle. However shy and cautious 
at first, it was affirmed, that they would like us better the 
more they knew us, and that in the end we should be gainers 
by the connexion. 

VOL. i. 18 



206 LIFE OF 

But the other party saw these things in a different light, 
As for national dignity, they could not think it was promoted 
by going about soliciting alliances, begging the great powers 
to take us under their wings, cover us from our enemies, and 
consent to call us an independent people j for, after all, such a 
recognition implied no more than the name, since we were al- 
ready de facto, dejure divino,znd de haute lutte,an independent 
sovereignty, let the monarchs of Europe think, say, or do what 
they would in regard to us. Our true dignity, therefore, re- 
quired that our alliance should be sought by those, whom it 
would benefit, and whose advances would be a proof of their 
willingness to meet us on terms of equality. 

Among our ministers abroad, Dr Franklin looked at this 
side of the shield, whilst Mr John Adams was as intent in ga- 
zing on the opposite. The latter said, give us treaties with 
all the world ; the former, let us wait. It was moreover 
doubtful, whether as a general principle treaties in any case 
were expedient. They would draw us into the whirlpool of 
European politics, and involve us in contests with which we 
should really have no concern ; fetter us with engagements, 
that would essentially mar our interests in the time of wars 
between foreign powers ; and finally take away from us the 
advantages, which we might derive from a state of neutrality. 
A treaty implies a mutual privilege, which each party to the 
contract is bound to concede or bestow. The ever recurring 
wars of Europe derange the healthful order of international 
compacts, and the belligerents, in retaliating upon each other, 
never fail to encroach on the rights of neutrals, and seldom 
refrain from violating the treaties with their friends. This is 
the necessary consequence of war, and must continue so, till 
the code of neutral commerce is better defined by the consent 
and practice of civilized nations, than it ever yet has been, or 
perhaps will be, unless the passion for gain and adventures 
shall be released, in some degree, from its strong hold in the 
human breast. Hence, separated as we are by a wide ocean 
from the scenes and causes of turmoil, we are admonished 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



207 



equally by reason and sound policy to avoid, as much as pos- 
sible, connexions, subject to be perpetually interrupted by 
events never under our control, and which entail upon us the 
inevitable fatality of being the injured party. If we receive 
no benefits from treaties, it is a sufficient consolation that we 
grant none. The laws of nations afford to commerce all the 
protection it requires, and governments are too much interest- 
ed in the profits and convenience of an interchange of com- 
modities, to encroach upon these laws in the times of peace. 

Such is the spirit of the doctrines held by some members in 
the old Congress. Experience has proved, that they were not 
without wisdom. Has a treaty yet been made, which has 
been respected by a European power at war ? Our first trea- 
ty with France was violated, as soon as the hostile designs 
of that power made it her interest to crarnp the com- 
merce, and diminish the resources of England. The first 
treaty of peace with Great Britain, it is true, was originally in- 
fringed without such a cause, but suffered equally afterwards in 
'the retaliatory proceedings against France. Of other treaties 
it is not necessary to speak. It will be found, that in every 
European war, since our independence was declared, they 
have shared the same fate. But the above remarks, in regard 
to treaties, do not necessarily apply to conventions for specific 
purposes, nor to arrangements for colonial trade.

RIS RETIRES FROM CONGRESS. VALUABLE PAPERS WRITTEN BT 

HIM ON AMERICAN CURRENCY AND FINANCE. ACCIDENT OCCA- 
SIONING THE LOSS OF HIS LEG. SPAIN AND THE UNITED STATES. 

BESIDES the affairs of a national bearing, which claimed the 
attention of all the members of Congress in common, there 
was one of special consideration devolving chiefly on the del- 
egates from New York. This was the controversy between 
that State and Vermont, respecting the independence and ju- 
risdiction of the people inhabiting that territory. 

For nearly thirty years before the Revolution, there had 
been heart-burnings and disputes between the colonies of New 
Hampshire and New York, concerning the tract of country 
included between the Connecticut River and Lake Champlain, 
then called the New Hampshire Grants. These first arose from 
the circumstance, of the Governor of New Hampshire assuming 
and exercising the power of granting lands in that territory. 
Many settlers from different parts of New England purchased 
lands, and established themselves there, under the authority of 
his warrants. The government of New York considered this 
an encroachment upon their limits and rights, and remonstrated 
with New Hampshire against such a proceeding. The contro- 
versy grew warm, and was at length referred to the King. 
After much delay before that tribunal, a decision was finally 
given in favor of New York, confirming to that colony a juris- 
diction over the whole country, as far east as the Connecticut 
River. 

This result was far from putting the question to rest, or 




GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 209 

quieting disorders. The New Yorkers not only claimed juris- 
diction under this decision, but a title to the lands, thus annull- 
ing all the contracts of the Governor of New Hampshire, and 
requiring the settlers to pay for their lands a second time, or 
leave them. Warrants were issued, and purchases made, 
covering tracts already held under the New Hampshire title, 
which had been paid for, and in some instances cleared of 
their timber and cultivated as farms. It is no wonder, that the 
people, who had now increased to a respectable number, 
should be indignant at such a measure, and put themselves in 
an attitude of self defence and resistance. In short, there 
sprang up in the hearts of these borderers a rancor and enmi- 
ty against New York, not to be soothed by legislative enact- 
ments, nor quelled by the civil arm. They took into their own 
hands the task of governing themselves, and protecting their 
lives and property, heedless of the menaces of their powerful 
and grasping neighbors. They insisted, and certainly with 
more than the show of reason, that, by conferring jurisdiction, 
the King's Council could never intend to destroy the titles of 
the inhabitants to the lands, which they had honestly bought 
and paid for ; and if it were possible that so gross a piece of 
injustice should have been designed, their first duty to them- 
selves required that they should regard it neither with respect 
nor obedience.* 



* The feeling-s of the people, in regard to the New Yorkers, were 
sometimes displayed by a rather ludicrous exhibition. In the town of 
Bennington there was an inn, called the ' Green Mountain Tavern,' 
which had for its sign the skin of a catamount, stuffed and raised on a 
post twenty-five feet from the ground, with its head turned towards 
New York, and its teeth grinning defiance to all intruders from that 
quarter. 

In this tavern the Committee, or board of government, acting in the 
triple capacity of a legislative, judicial, and executive body, used to sit 
for the trial of persons suspected of being hostile to the sovereignty of 
the ruling powers, or partiasns of. New York. Such persons were 
regarded much as the lories were during the war. One mode of 
18* 



210 

At this juncture the revolutionary war broke out, and the 
attention of all parties was drawn to topics of weightier mo- 
ment. But the successive governments of New York look 
care not to let the pretensions of their predecessors become 
dormant, and even during the shortlived and unsettled dynas- 
ties of Conventions and Provincial Congresses, they looked 
with jealousy upon the forms of independence, which the 
Green Mountain Boys were assuming, and received it in no 
good part, that the Continental Congress should sanction the 
raising of a regiment of troops among them, who were to act 
in some degree distinct from the authority of New York. As 
soon as the constitution was established, and the wheels of the 
new machine began to move, this business of Vermont was 
again taken up in earnest. It was referred to Congress, and 
strong appeals were made against the doings and claims of 
these refractory citizens. The mountaineers also sent on 
their agents to Congress, and demanded to be made a State, 
and to be taken into the fraternity, as an integral part of the 
Union. 

Meantime Ethan Allen, being exchanged and released from 
captivity, returned Irome. He had been the champion of this 
cause from its origin, and now resumed it with his accustomed 
ardor and energy. He penned a vindication of the people of 
Vermont, and of their right to become an independent State. 
Mr Jay wrote to Morris, in allusion to this performance ; 
4 Ethan Allen has commenced author and orator. A Philippic 
of his against New York is handed about. There is quaint - 
ness, impudence, and art in it.' But Ethan Allen did not 
confine himself to his pen. He talked, and harangued, and 



punishing an offender of this sort was to tie him in an armed-chair, 
hoist him by a rope up the signpost, and cause him to be suspended 
there for two hours under the catamount's claws, in the sight of the 
-people. See Vermont State Papers, p. 36. This was more conve- 
nient, more expeditious, and probably quite as effectual, as the tar and 
feathers of a later time. 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 211 

made himself busy among the people, and kept the tone of 
popular sentiment up to the pitch he desired. 

The legislature of New York seemed resolved on carrying 
their point, and ministered fuel to the flame by their discus- 
sions and resolves. Governor Clinton, prompted by his for- 
mer impressions, his private feelings, and his official djuty, 
wrote repeatedly and in pressing terms to the President of 
Congress and the New York delegates, calling their attention 
to this subject as one vitally important to the State. 

It is to be presumed, that the New England members 
generally, for wise political reasons, preferred that Vermont 
should become an independent State ; but from the sketch of 
a debate on the subject, preserved in Mr Morris's handwriting, 
it appears that they did not avow this ground openly. Roger 
Sherman, who was thought secretly to encourage the Vermont 
party, declared in this debate that Congress had no right to de- 
cide the controversy, that the confederation was not complete, 
and if it were, they could do no more than act as meditators, 
that Vermont ought to be heard in the case as well as New 
York, that if both parties left it to the decision of Congress, 
after a full hearing, it might then be taken up with propriety, 
that the people of the Grants were never subject to New York 
by their own consent, that when independence was declared 
they were as much included in the declaration, as any other 
persons in the United States, and if they now had any differ- 
ences to settle with their neighbors, it did not belong to Con- 
gress to interfere. Mr Gerry maintained nearly the same doc- 
trine, denied the power of Congress to intermeddle, regarded 
the inhabitants of Vermont as extra provincial, who, as such, 
might set up for themselves, and believed an arbitrary decis- 
ion by Congress would give fresh discontent and increase the 
difficulty. Some of the southern members accorded with 
these sentiments, and argued that nothing could be done at 
any rate, without definite instructions from the several States. 
From some circumstances it may be inferred, that Mr Mor- 
ris's views did not differ widely from those just enumerated. 






212 LIFE OF 

He wrote to Mr Jay ; Vermont is yet Vermont, and I 
think no wise man will pretend to say when it will cease to be 
so. The local situation of that country is critical, and there 
are in it some ardent spirits, whose termigant quality has been 
too little attended to. Strange that men, in the very act of 
revolting, should so little consider the temper of revolters. 
But this is eternally the case. We can reason well in our 
closets about past events ; we come out into the world and act 
blindly ; we look towards the future and are bewildered.' To 
Governor Clinton he also wrote ; ' I wish the business of Ver- 
mont were settled. I fear we are pursuing a shadow, with re- 
spect to that matter, and every day I live, and everything f 
see, give to my fears the 'consistence of opinion. It is a 
mighty arduous business to compel the submission of men to a 
political or religious government. It appears to me very 
doubtful whether Vermont, if independent, would not be more 
useful to New York, than as the Eastern District.' He ad- 
ded his belief, moreover, that the government of the State 
would be more manageable, and greater benefits derived to 
the people, from a less extent of territory ; that the security 
of a republic is the diffusion of knowledge, and the vigor 
and spirit of a common sentiment, which may persuade and 
animate every heart ; that ' the attempt would be more virtu- 
ous, and more honorable, to force cultivation through the bar- 
rier of a land monopoly, and to spread its influence over a 
hoarded wilderness, than vainly to subdue or acquire, or more 
vainly to covet, a wide dominion extensively useless.' These 
opinions were not relished by his friend, the Governor, nor 
by the other prominent characters in his own State. At a 
later period, in writing to Governor Clinton, he recurred to 
the same topics as follows. 

' If I differ with you in sentiment on any occasion, it must 
be because we have a different view of the subject. Neither 
of us can be influenced by improper motives, especially on the 
present occasion. You speak of submitting cheerfully (o the 
decision of Congress. Two questions arise here. Will Con- 




GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 213 

gress decide? Will the disaffected submit? I doubt, both as 
to the one and the other. When I had the honor of a seat in 
Congress, I knew tolerably well the sentiments and dispositions 
on those subjects. Depend on it, time has not given you any 
strength there. You certainly cannot dictate to them. When 
I say yew, I mean the State, or if you please its delegates. 
Whether you have not even less influence is a problem, which 
T will not resolve. 

' Again, the revolt has daily less in it of novelty, and man- 
kind have a reluctance at shaking what looks like establish- 
ment. We contemplate effects, and seldom concern ourselves 
about causes. In a hundred years not above one American in 
a hundred will care about the tea act, or stamp act, or examine 
whether the declaration of independence was justifiable or un- 
justifiable. Further, the Congress have daily less weight and 
more embarrassments. It is needless to ask why, supposing 
the fact. The Congress, therefore, will not, I believe, make 
any decision. Indeed, if all other obstacles were removed, 
still a great question will remain. Can Congress interfere 
between a State and its subjects ? Admitting, however, their 
decision in all its force, would it be obeyed ? No more nor 
sooner than the pope's bull. What then remains? Just what 
is now before us, either compulsion or neglect. Either let 
these people alone, or conquer them. 1 prefer the latter, but 
I doubt the means. If we have the means, let them be used, 
and let Congress deliberate and decide, or deliberate without 
deciding, it is of no consequence. Success will sanctify every 
operation. Forty victims to public justice or wrath, and sub- 
mission from the rest of the people, will convince everybody. 
These are arguments, which are perfectly irresistible. 

' If we have not the means of conquering these people, we 
must let them quite alone. We must continue our impotent 
threats, or we must make a treaty. If we let them alone, they 
become independent de facto at least. Hundreds will resort 
to them for different reasons. They will receive lands from 



214 LIFE or 

them, and cultivate them under of the powers which are. When 
the dispute is again renewed, these cultivators will I believe 
be better soldiers than logicians, and more inclined to defend 
their possessions, than examine their titles. If we continue 
our threats, they will either hate or despise us, and perhaps 
both. We shall thoroughly alienate their affections. They 
will become, in the unphilosophic language of politicians, our 
natural enemies, and always prove a most troublesome and 
disagreeable neighbor. On the whole, then, my conclusion is 
here, as on most other human affairs, act decisively, fight or 
submit conquer or treat.' 

Here the idea of a power in Congress to decide the contro- 
versy is abandoned. Indeed this idea gradually lost ground 
on all hands, and the New Yorkers began to talk of force, and 
compulsory measures. But the prudent were willing to pause 
at the threshold of such a design. When Hamilton was in 
Congress from New York, as late as July, 1783, he said, in 
writing to the Governor about the Vermont affair, < it is a bu- 
siness in which nobodv cares to act with decision. As intima- 

f 

fed before, I much doubt the perseverance of Congress, if mil- 
itary coercion should become necessary. I am clear that the on- 
ly chance the legislature have for receiving any part of the re- 
volted territory, is by a compromise with New Hampshire, 
and this compromise must originate between the States them- 
selves. I hope the legislature will revise the late act for con- 
firming the possessions of those, who hold lands in that coun- 
try. I am certain there are doubts upon the subject, and it 
were much to be wished such doubts did not exist. The 
present dissatisfaction of the army is much opposed to any ex- 
periment of force in a service, where scruples of intere 
or prejudice may operate.' 

What is here meant, by ' scruples of interest,' may be ex- 
plained by the fact, that a chief cause of the deep hostility of 
a party in New York towards their neighbors of the Green 
Mountains, originated in the purchase of lands, which the for- 




GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 215 

mer had made, in consequence of the decision of the King's 
Council against the claims of New Hampshire. It was of 
course the interest of these proprietors to keep the contest 
alive, and if possible to subdue the refractory inhabitants, who 
had the hardihood to cling to the soil by the right of previous 
purchase and long possession. Things remained in the same 
unsettled state, after the war was closed ; nor was anything 
decisive effected, till the constitution of the United States had 
been adopted by New York, when the difficulties with Ver- 
mont were at length amicably adjusted between the two par- 
ties ; Vermont agreeing to pay thirty thousand dollars, as a full 
indemnity to persons in New York holding titles to lands with- 
in its boundaries. 

The time at length approached, when the term for which 
Mr Morris had been elected to Congress was to expire. The 
members from New York were chosen annually by the legis- 
lature, and he had been twice returned. Meantime his duties 
in the national councils had confined him so closely, that he 
had not found leisure to visit his native State, nor scarcely to 
be absent for a day from 'active service, during a period of 
nearly two years. Rumors reached him, that his enemies 
were busy in framing a scheme to defeat his re-election, and 
some of his friends, among whom were Duer and Livingston, 
advised him to make a jaunt to the State of New York, while 
the legislature was in session, and attend to his interests in that 
quarter before the new election came round. He listened to 
their advice, and obtained leave of absence from Congress. 
His visit was too late, however, to counteract the aims and 
arts of his opponents, and he was superseded by another can- 
didate. 

The reason of this change, in the favorable opinion of the 
electors, is not manifest from any documents or records now 
remaining. The tradition is, that he was charged with neg- 
lecting the concerns of his State, and giving himself too much 
to the business and politics of the nation. Considering that 
there was commonly two or three other members present from 



2J6 LIFE OF 

New York, who were not accused of any such deficiency, and 
in whose hands the comparatively subordinate affairs of the 
State might be presumed to receive their due share of notice, 
this must appear, as it really was, a very frivolous pretext. It 
redounded rather to his credit than reproach, and should have 
been an irresistible argument, in the estimation of all true pat- 
riots, for his being continued in a post, which his talents and 
habits rendered him so peculiarly well qualified to fill. 

The policy of turning out an able representative, because he 
is better suited to manage the affairs of the whole nation, than 
those of a fragment, is like saving the mast, but letting the ship 
sink. 

This pretext was a convenient handle to be laid hold of, 
however, by the ambitious and intriguing, to work upon narrow 
minds and politicians of the village stamp. To gain the men 
of this cast, in a contested election, is not unfrequently to gain 
the point at issue. Morris's lukewarmness about Vermont, and 
his heretical doctrines on that head, were doubtless numbered 
among his sins of neglect, if not of absolute malfeasance. A 
report also went about, that he was looking to a foreign mis- 
sion, and was disposed to accept the place of Secretary of 
Legation under Dr Franklin in Paris. This was true at one 
time, though he afterwards changed his views, and declined 
being considered a candidate. 

All these offences, and perhaps a much longer catalogue of 
a similar complexion, would seem to have been put forward 
by his zealous adversaries, as proofs of his indifference to the 
interests of his constituents, and of his unsuitableness to repre- 
sent the State of New York in Congress. 

The very imperfect sketch of his career in that Assembly, 
which has been given above, will show with what extreme in- 
justice he could be charged with neglect of duty, and any one 
who will take the trouble of examining, even the meagre jour- 
nals of Congress within that space, will find his conviction of 
this truth doubly enforced. He will be satisfied, that nothing 
but a prodigious industry, firm health of body, and a wide 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

grasp of mental powers, could have enabled him to endure 
and perform so much. If he was fond of society and relaxa- 
tion, gayety and amusements, as is generally reported and 
believed, this is only another testimony to the remarkable 
energy of his character, the quickness of his conceptions, the 
fertility of his resources, his patience and self command. He 
never shrunk from any task ; he never commenced one, which 
he left unfinished. 

Not many years before his death, a person applied to him 
for written materials, respecting events of the revolution in 
which he had been personally engaged. His reply will add 
light to this subject. ' I have no notes,' said he, ' or memo- 
randums of what passed during the war. I led then the most 
laborious life, which can be imagined. This you will readily 
suppose to have been the case, when I was engaged with my 
departed friend, Robert Morris, in the office of finance. But 
what you will not so readily suppose is, that I was still more 
harassed while a member of Congress. Not to mention tiie 
attendance from eleven to four in the House, which was com- 
mon to all, and the appointment to special committees, of 
which I had a full share, I was at the same time chairman, and 
of course did the business, of tiiree standing committees, viz. 
on the commissary's, quartermaster's, and medical depart- 
ments. You must not imagine, that the members of these 
committees took any charge or burden of the affairs. Neces- 
sity, preserving the democratical forms, assumed the monarch- 
ical substance of business. The chairman received and an- 
swered all letters and other applications, took every step 
which he deemed essential, prepared reports, gave orders, and 
the like, and merely took the members of a committee into a 
chamber, and for the form's sake made the needful communi- 
cations, and received their approbation, which was given of 
course. I was moreover obliged to labor occasionally in my 
profession, as my wages were insufficient for my support. 1 
would not trouble you with this abstract of my situation, if it 
did not appear necessary to show you why 1 kept no notes of

my services, and why I arn perhaps the most ignorant man 
alive of what concerns them.' All the papers he has left per- 
taining to that period, as well as the printed records, confirm 
the accuracy of this picture of his life in Congress. 

Being no longer in a public station, he became a citizen of 
Pennsylvania, and established himself as a lawyer in Philadel- 
phia, where he had already gained a respectable standing in 
his profession. During the five years of service, however, 
which he had rendered to the great cause of the country at 
that trying period, his mind had become so much imbued with 
the spirit of the time, and so deeply interested in national affairs, 
that the mere change from an official to a private situation 
was not enough to turn his thoughts from their accustomed 
channel, nor to weaken his efforts for the general good. On 
the contrary, it was at this crisis, that he exhibited a most 
creditable proof of his patriotism and talents. 

At no time during the war did the finances of the country 
put on so gloomy an aspect, and its fiscal energies seem so 
completely prostrate, as in the year 1780. The machinery of 
credit, paper circulation, and forced certificates, had run its 
rounds, till it could move no longer, and the whole fabric 
threatened speedily to tumble in pieces, and involve the ex- 
istence of the nation in its ruins. The impending danger was 
manifest to all, but how to avert it was a problem, which none 
ventured to solve. To submit to the fatality of circumstances, 
and be carried along with the train of events, encouraged on- 
ly by the feeble taper of expiring hope, was all that was left to 
the bravest, the wisest, and the best. In a righteous cause, 
the justice of Heaven, and a calm endurance, were their con- 
fidence and strength. 

During the months of February and March, of the year 
above named, Mr Morris wrote a series of essays on the con- 
tinental currency and finance, which were published in the 
Pennsylvania Packet, and signed AN AMERICAN. In these pa- 
pers he takes a wide view of the subject, and at the same 
time in a manner so methodical and condensed, as to be iniel- 



I 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 219 

ligible to all readers. He begins by discussing, with great 
clearness and precision, the nature of money as a medium of 
exchange, the origin and utility of a paper substitute for specie, 
the mutual dependence of money and credit, the sources and 
foundation of credit, the causes of its decline, and the conse- 
quent depreciation of that sign of wealth, which relies exclu- 
sively on opinion for its support. 

One of the devices of Congress to keep up a falling curren- 
cy, or rather of the States upon the recommendation of Con- 
gress, was to bring it under the control of legislation, and, by 
compulsory enactments, to make it a legal tender at a specified 
value in payment of debts, thus adopting the principle, which 
has been at the bottom of all the knavery in the dealings 
among men since the world began, namely, an attempt to 
get something for nothing. Laws of this sort Mr Morris at- 
tacks with keen severity, showing them to be useless and, un- 
just. Before the paper depreciates they are useless, because 
it will then pass without them ; afterwards they are unjust, for 
it defrauds the creditor of the whole amount of the deprecia- 
tion, from the time the credit was given. Not only so, but the 
necessary effect of these laws is to destroy, and not to sustain, 
the value of the declining currency. If a square dollar 6f pa- 
per is as good as a round one of silver, why compel the holder 
of the latter to exchange it for the former ? The plea of ne- 
cessity will not stop the clamorous mouth of inquiry, nor soft- 
en the iniquity of injustice. It will destroy the confidence of 
the people in the integrity, as well as the wisdom, of the gov- 
ernment. 

Another phantom, which haunted the dreams of the states- 
men of that day, was the regulation of prices by law. We 
have heretofore seen what was done to that effect in New 
England. This scheme Mr Morris classes with the tender 
laws, in its futility and unjustifiableness, and combats it upon 
the same principles. He discards the idea, that depreciation 
is a proper tax on the community, or a fit mode of collectirv; 
a tax, and shows that it falls chiefly on those, who, from their 



220 LIFE OF 

attachment to the government, or confidence in it, receive the 
paper, and are thus ruined by the patriotic spirit, which it 
should be the aim of government to excite and cherish. 

He next considers a tax on money, and argues against it as 
impolitic and iniquitous. It tends to drive money from circu- 
lation, or from the country, thus rendering it more difficult to 
collect a certain amount of it in the shape of a tax, and it in- 
duces the necessity of selling a greater quantity of commodi- 
ties to produce that amount. ' Add to this,' he says, ' that the 
tax can never be rendered effectual. Money is of too subtle 
and spiritual a nature to be caught by the rude hand of the 
law. How will you find a man's money ? I know there is a 
trite reply very ready with some folks. But what should we 
think of a government, that would offer to every one of its 
subjects a reward for perjury, exactly proportioned to his 
wealth ? And what difference is there, except in name, be- 
tween such an offer and laying a tax, the quantum of which is 
to be determined by the oath of the party. It must be admit- 
ted, that some men would by perjury elude the law, and this 
being admitted, it follows that the law would be a tax upon 
honesty and not upon money. A tax then on specie is unjust 
and unwise ; a tax on paper is more unwise and more unjust ; 
and of all modes, in which it can be laid or collected', depre- 
ciation is the worst.' 

After thus discussing the topics of money, paper circulation, 
and taxes, he proceeds to that of monopoly, or the purchasing 
of articles in large quantities, with the view of speculating on 
an advance in the price, a practice much followed during the 
war, and against which the people had taken up strong preju- 
dices, regarding it as one of the chief causes of calamity and 
distress. Mr Morris entertained an opposite opinion, and 
pursued the subject through an ingenious train of reasoning 
and facts. Putting out of the question the motives of monop- 
olizers, which were like the motives of all other dealers, 
namely, to make money by selling at a higher price than the 
one at which they bought, he shows with great clearness that. 



UOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 221 

under the peculiar circumstances of the times, this method was 
productive of advantages to the community, which could have 
arisen in no other way, such as economy gradually introduced 
in consumption, the activity imparted to commerce, and the 
comparative steadiness of prices. Monopoly, to any dangerous 
extent, was moreover impossible^ and as far as it could be 
practised was useful. To the people generally, who suffered 
without looking deeply into causes, this was a new doctrine, 
but it was set forth with an ability, which, if it did not in all 
cases produce a conviction, must have awakened reflection, 
and made them more contented with the necessary state of 
things. 

Having explained and defended these principles, he applies 
them to the plans adopted and course pursued by Congress 
and the States, and exhibits the errors into which he con- 
ceives they had fallen in matters of finance, especially by 
obstructions thrown in the way of trade, and by futile at- 
tempts to regulate by law the business of barter and ex- 
change, in the common articles of necessity and convenience, 
which no human power can control. 

Difficulties having been thus stated and discussed, he next 
proceeds to suggest a remedy, and to show how public credit 
may be re-established, the whole amount of debt funded, and 
taxes raised for its payment. As this last point was the basis 
of the whole structure, he draws out a scheme of taxation, 
very ingeniously and plausibly framed, and we may believe, in 
the main, practicable, had anything been practicable in over- 
coming the obstacles, which pressed so heavily against every 
project for raising money, or taking out of the people's pockets 
what nobody was willing to spare, and what few had to give. 
But the truth is, the powers of Congress were so limited and 
feeble, that no plan, however sagaciously devised, or well ma- 
tured, could be carried into effect. The people thought their 
work done, when they had suffered, murmured, and com- 
plained. Loud calls to duty that were not heard, recommen- 
dations not heeded, and reproaches not felt, were the only and 
19* 



222 LIFE or 

the unavailing resort of the patriot statesmen, whose task it 
was in the midst of peril and uncertainty to establish the exist- 
ence, and wield the destinies, of the nascent empire. 

Jn one of ihe essays is a passage, which suggests reflections 
at all times important, and which may frequently be presented 
with advantage to the public men of the United States. 

c The last object I shall mention,' he observes, ' is the pre- 
servation of our federal union, which, in my poor opinion, will 
greatly depend on the management of our revenue. The arti- 
cles of confederation were formed, when the attachment to 
Congress was great and warm. The framers of it, therefore, 
seem to have been only solicitous how to provide against the 
power of that body, which, by means of their foresight and care, 
now exists by mere courtesy and sufferance. This is an evil, 
which cannot at present be remedied, but if, in addition to 
this, a number of long accounts, and quotas, and proportions be 
left for settlement, until the enemy be removed at a distance, 
and the fear of them also removed, these will afford so much 
matter for litigation, and occasion such heart-burnings, and give 
such room for the intrigues, which Great Britain has already 
attempted, and which will doubtless be carried on by her or 
some other foreign power, that our union will become, what 
cur enemies long since declared it was, a mere rope of sand. 
Congress then, like the traveller's coat in the fable, after hav- 
ing been hugged close through the stormy hour of danger, will 
be cast aside as a useless burden, in the calm and sunshine of 
peace and victory. Surely the consequences of such a meas- 
ure, the struggles, the convulsions, the miseries, need not be 
pictured to a sensible and discerning people.' 

Throughout these papers there is a tone of disinterested 
public spirit, a vein of profound and sagacious reflection, a 
practical wisdom, and a high moral feeling, which give a most 
favorable impression of the author's talents and good sense, 
and entitle him, even at that early period of his life, to an hon- 
orable rn.uk among the distinguished men of the day. Indeed 
it is ndt likely, that there can anywhere else be found a view,

so complete and comprehensive, of the financial proceedings of 
the old Congress, the nature, operations, and effects of the 
paper currency, as in these essays. . 

In the month of May, 1780, an accident happened to Mi- 
Morris, the severe effects of which continued through his life. 
While driving his phaeton in the streets of Philadelphia, the 
horses took fright and ran off, and, in endeavoring to control 
them, he was thrown with such violence upon the pavement, as 
to dislocate the ankle joint and fracture the bones of his left 
leg. His friend and favorite physician Dr Jones was out of 
town, but two others were called, who recommended an imme- 
diate amputation, as affording the best prospect of saving his 
life. This operation was accordingly performed, and the leg 
was taken off below the knee. He was confined three or four 
months, before he gained strength to go abroad, but he was in 
the family of Mr Plater, a member of Congress from Maryland 
then residing in Philadelphia, where he received every atten- 
tion, which kindness and sympathy could dictate, and for 
which he ever after manifested the strongest sense of grati- 
tude. 

It has been affirmed, that Dr Jones was never satisfied with 
the precipitancy of the attending physicians, in advising an 
amputation, believing the fracture was not such as to render 
that extreme process necessary, and it is said the case has 
been commonly cited by surgical lecturers, acquainted with 
the particulars, as a proof of unskilful management and the 
rashness of hasty decision. Be this as it may, he submitted 
without remonstrance to an immediate operation. A gentle- 
man present, who informed his mother of the event by letter, 
on the day it happened, wrote thus ; ' Your son, with that 
firmness of mind, which accompanies him on all occasions, 
convinced of the necessity there was for it, consented to the 
amputation being instantly performed.' It is remarked, that 
his elasticity of spirits and cheerfulness of temper did not 
desert him, even in times of acute pain. An anecdote is 
related illustrative of this fact, and somewhat characteristic of 



224 LIFE OF 

the man. The day after the accident occurred, a friend called 
to see him, who thought it his duty to offer as much consola- 
tion as he could, on an event so melancholy. He dwelt upon 
the good effects, which such a trial would produce on his 
character and moral temperament, and the diminished induce- 
ments it would leave for seeking the pleasures and dissipations 
of life, into which young men are too apt to be led. ' My 
good Sir,' replied Mr Morris, 'you argue the matter so hand- 
somely, and point out so clearly the advantages of being with- 
out legs, that I am almost tempted to part with the other.' 

To another person, who visited him on the same occasion, 
and gave utterance to his feelings of sympathy and regret, he 
replied ; ' O, Sir, the loss is much Jess than you imagine ; I 
shall doubtless be a steadier man with one leg than with two.' 

A plain wooden leg, or what was scarcely more than a 
rough stick properly fitted to the limb, was the remedy for 
this loss, and he soon acquired such a facility in its use, that 
it gave him little trouble, either in walking or in other move- 
ments of his body. After he arrived in Europe, he saw peo- 
ple walking about with cork legs, and making a figure as he 
conceived so much more graceful than his limb of oak, that 
he resolved to try the experiment. A leg maker was sent 
for, and various contrivances fabricated, but he found fault 
with them all, and, after a short trial, he dismissed the artist 
and his cork inventions, and returned to the simplicity of his 
original substitute, which he never again laid aside. On one 
occasion he asked a favor for his wooden leg, which was 
readily granted, although a serious encroachment on court eti- 
quette ; and this was, that when he should be introduced to 
the King of France, as Minister from the United Slates, he 
should be allowed to appear without a sword. 

The following extracts from a letter to Mr Jay, who was 
then at Madrid as Minister from the United States to Spain, 
contain opinions respecting the navigation of the Mississippi. 
Congress were much divided on that subject, but the majority 
were not inclined to insist on the right of navigation, provided 




HJVERNEUR MORRIS. 

such a demnnd should be a decided bar against any treaty or 
arrangement with Spain, by which that power should be led to 
aid the United States in the war. Mr Morris was among that 
number. 

' We stand in need of assistance, and you must procure it. 1 
am very sensible that Spain, under her present circumstances, 
cannot advance money at Madrid. She wants there the pow- 
er, and everywhere the will. The difference between us ap- 
pears to me absurd, in every point of view, at least on our part. 
Two persons contend together about the property and posses- 
sions of a third. This, under any civil or municipal law, would 
be absurd; surely, it is as absurd under the law of nations, un- 
less there is a clause in that law, which declares that red men 
are not entitled to the same rights as white men. We ask a 
territory and a navigation. The territory we cannot occupy, 
the navigation we cannot enjoy. We cannot occupy the terri- 
tory at present, or in future ; at present, because we have not 
men ; in future, because we cannot govern it. The most we 
can expect is, that an emigration from the whole world, where- 
of one hundredth or perhaps not so much shall be our descen- 
dants, will claim title under us to a part of the soil, and then set 
up independence. It is impossible to monopolize theorems and 
corollaries. The principles, which caused and which justify 
the present revolution, will cause and justify as many more, as 
time and circumstances may furnish occasion for. The ques- 
tion then resolves itself into this ; shall we be bounded by a 
wilderness, or a rival nation ? Reason says the former, and 
bids us pursue the path which leads to it. The blind avarice 
of dominion may propel us into another road, but it leads to 
ruin. 

; As to the navigation of the Mississippi, everybody knows 
that the rapidity of the current will forever prevent ships from 
sailing up, however easily they may float down. Now, unless 
some new dragon shall be found, whose teeth, sown on the 
banks of the Ohio, will produce seamen, I know not where 
else they will be obtained to navigate ships abroad, which can 



226 LIFE OF 

never return home. But if this navigation were as easy, and 
advantageous, as it is useless and impracticable, its effect 
would be only the soonei to dissever the ultramontane coun- 
try, the sooner to dissolve all commercial connexion between 
us, and the sooner to produce every unhappy consequence of 
it. The foregoing arguments are brought to operate in a very 
oblique line, for the conclusion is admitted, and then comes 
the question, is not Spain sensible of this, and being sensible 
of it, why will she refuse us a right, which it is demonstrated 
we can never exercise ? Is not this to take advantage of our 
distress, and to treat on principles of inequality ? I may be 
mistaken, but I find something very futile in this question. I 
do not see the right, on which the whole matter turns. I dis- 
cover it neither by my own reasoning, nor by those of any 
good writers, nor in the history of human affairs. 

' We must lament, that some circumstances in our finance 
and policy have given colorable ground to inculpate us. What 
then must be the effect of our requisition on that jealous pow- 
er, who has more to hope and to fear from us, than all the 
world besides ? The faithful guarantee of our union would in- 
sure to Spain her American dominions, and our ambition or 
avarice would tear them away from her, and ruin us by the 
possession. We are poor, and Spain can serve us now ; we 
can serve her always ; our mutual interests are therefore unit- 
ed; they are indeed the same. Embarked in the same cause 
we are brethren, and the precept, "take heed that ye fall not 
out by the way," should be read, understood, and felt by both. 
The present difference is madness. Great caution on her 
part, and great pride on ours, which I conscientionsly believe 
to be mistaken pride, these impede us both in the prosecution 
of a common object. Let me add, on the whole, that a near 
neighborhood is never a good neighborhood.' 

In regard to what is here said of Spain, it is demonstrable, 
that she did not intend to treat on any terms, and Mr Jay was 
amused and deceived, during the two years and a half that he 
remained in that kingdom, by the duplicity of an artful Minis- 




GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 227 

try, till he was called away to assist in making the peace of 
Paris. The records of his acts, in conducting the fruitless ne- 
gotiation in Madrid, are among the fairest testimonies of his 
firmness, address, and talents, and are equally dishonorable to 
the sincerity, and disgraceful to the dignity of Spain. There 
were perhaps good reasons, why that cabinet should be tar- 
dy in recognising the independence of the United States, 
considering the circumstances of the Spanish possessions on 
this continent, but there was no reason, there could be none, 
why they should practise deceit, excite delusive hopes, and 
make promises with which they never intended to comply. A 
slender but insidious encouragement was held out, at the first 
stage of the revolutionary contest, enough to raise expecta- 
tions and elicit confidence, which was succeeded by heartless 
professions and idle pretences, till the end of the war. The 
United States are in no degree indebted for their existence as a 
nation, either to the good will or good wishes of Spain, to say 
nothing of more substantial benefits, that would have done 
them infinite service in their time of need.

THE manner of transacting the various forms of government 
in Congress by committees, adopted at first from necessity, 
and continued because it was difficult afterwards to effect a 
change, became at length so complicated and perplexing, as 
to demand serious attention and a speedy remedy. Congress 



228, LIFE OF 

exercised at the same time legislative and executive powers ; 
they passed resolves in their capacity of representatives, and 
executed them by committees chosen from their own numbers. 
This mode introduced a multiplicity of affairs, and a pressure 
of business, suited neither to regularity nor despatch. The 
committees were in a measure irresponsible bodies ; much was 
left undone, and more was done imperfectly. This remark 
applies with particular force to the foreign affairs and fi- 
nance, each of which required great ability, as well as the un- 
divided care of an individual officer, for its proper management. 

These evils were early perceived by Congress, and they 
grew more and more apparent daily. Much time was ex- 
pended in discussing the subject of a new arrangement, but 
the workings of party spirit, the interested views of some mem- 
bers, the doubts, and fears, and divided opinions of others, 
caused delays injurious to the public welfare. It was finally 
resolved to institute a department of Foreign Affairs, and three 
civil executive departments, that is, of Finance, War, and Ma- 
rine, with a Secretary at the head of each. 

While the subject was under discussion in Congress, the 
qualifications necessary in the persons, who should fill these of- 
fices, naturally became a topic of general interest and inquiry. 
At this time Mr Morris wrote the following sketch. 

' To determine who should be appointed Minister either of 
the Finances, of War, of the Marine, or of Foreign Affairs, 
may be difficult ; but it may not be so difficult to determine 
the qualities requisite for each of these departments, and hav- 
ing thereby established a rule, the proper persons will be

under the different heads of genius, temper, knowledge, edu- 
cation, principles, manners, and circumstances. 

' Our Minister of the Finances should have a strong under-

from all a rigid compliance with their duty. He should pos-

ferent States ; habituated to business on the most extensive 
sc^le, particularly that which is usually denominated money 
matters ; and, therefore, not only a regular bred merchant, but 
one who has been long and deeply engaged in that profession. 
At the same time, he should be practically acquainted with our 
political affairs, and the management of public business; 
warmly and thoroughly attached to America, not bigoted to 
any particular State; and his attachment founded not on whim, 
caprice, resentment, or a weak compliance with the current of 
opinion, but on a manly and rational conviction of the benefits 
of independence, his mariners plain and simple, sincere and 
honest, his morals pure, his integrity unblemished ; and he 
should enjoy general credit and reputation, both at home and 
abroad . 

' Our Minister of War should have a mind penetrating, clear, 
methodical, comprehensive, joined with a firm and indefatiga- 
ble spirit. He should be thoroughly acquainted with the sol- 
diery, know the resources of the country, be most intimately 
informed of the geography of America, and the means of march- 
ing and subsisting armies in every part of it. He should be 
taken from the army, and have acted at some time or other 
as a quartermaster general, if not as a commander in a sep- 
arate department. He should be attached to the civil head of 
the empire, and not envious of the glory of others, but ambi- 
tious of honest fame ; his manners those of a generous soldier, 
and not of an intriguing politician ; disagreeable to no consid- 
erable body or denomination of men, and by all means agree- 
able to the commander in chief. 

'A Minister of the Marine should be a man of plain good 
sense, and a good economist, firm but not harsh ; well ac- 
quainted with sea affairs, such as the construction, fitting, and 
victualing of ships, the conduct' and manoeuvre on a cruise and 
in action, the nautical face of the earth, and maritime pheno- 
mena. He should also know the temper, manners, and dispo- 
sition of sailors ; for all which purposes it is proper, that he 
should have been bred to that business, and have followed it,

in peace and in war, in a military, and commercial capacity. 
His principles and manners should be absolutely republican, 
and his circumstances not indigent. 

' A Minister of Foreign Affairs should have a genius quick, 
lively, pen etrating ; should write on all occasions with clear- 
ness and perspicuity ; be capable of expressing his sentiments 
with dignity, and conveying strong sense and argument in easy 
and agreeable diction : his temper mild, cool, and placid ; 
festive, insinuating, and pliant, yet obstinate ; communicative, 
and yet reserved. He should know the human face and heart, 
and the connexions between them ; should be versed in the 
laws of nature and nations, and not ignorant of the civil and 
municipal law ; should be acquainted with the history of Eu- 
rope, and with the interests, views, commerce, and productions 
of the commercial and maritime powers : should know the 
interests and commerce of America, understand the French 
and Spanish languages, at least the former, and be skilled in 
the modes and forms of public business ; a man educated more 
in the world, than in the closet, that by use, as well as by 
nature, he may give proper attention to great objects, and have 
proper contempt for small ones. He should be attached to 
the independence of America, and the alliance with France, as 
the great pillars of our politics ; and this attachment should 
not be slight and accidental, but regular, consistent, and foun- 
ded in strong conviction. His manners gentle and polite ; 
above all things honest, and least of all things avaricious. His 
circumstances and connexions should be such, as to give solid 
pledges for his fidelity ; and he should by no means be dis- 
agreeable to the Prince, with whom we are in alliance, his 
Ministers, or subjects.' 

The two important departments were those of foreign affairs 
and finance. Robert R. Livingston, the early and intimate 
friend of Mr Morris, was appointed to the former. Whether 
he came up in all respects to the portrait drawn above, it would 
be inapposite to inquire. It may be affirmed, however, that 
he filled the office with dignity, and executed its duties with 






OOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 231 

ability, promptness, and complete success. Congress were 
divided in his election. There was a party for Arthur Lee, 
but whoever has attended to that Commissioner's correspon- 
dence in France, and has witnessed there the exhibitions of 
his mind and temper, must think it a fortunate circumstance 
for the public, that so important a station was reserved for 
a person possessing other and very different qualities. To 
talents of a high order, and a cool judgment, Mr Livingston 
added zeal, energy, and a facility in affairs, not often com- 
bined in the same individual. He remained at the head of 
this department till the war was over, a position novel in its 
character, and difficult in its complicated relations, but sus- 
tained in a manner that reflects equal honor upon his patri- 
otism and discretion, his discernmeut as a statesman, and his 
integrity as a faithful and efficient officer. 

But whatever may have been thought, in regard to the 
candidates suitable for the other departments, there was but 
one opinion in Congress and in the nation, as to the proper 
person for taking charge of the finances, then in a dilapidated 
and most deplorable condition. The public sentiment every- 
where pointed to Robert Morris, whose great experience and 
success as a merchant, his ardor in the cause of American 
liberty, his firmness of character, fertility of mental resources, 
and profound knowledge of pecuniary operations, qualified 
him in a degree far beyond any other person for this arduous 
and responsible station. There is no doubt, that lie was the 
original in the eye of the writer, when he sketched the 
above traits of a minister of finance.* 



* Robert Morris was one of the signers of the Declaration of Inde- 
pendence, and a warm advocate for that measure after it was estab- 
lished, though, with some other true and tried patriots of that day, he 
considered the time at which it was done premature and inappropriate. 
On the twenty seventh of October, 1777, he wrote to General Gates as 
follows.

After his appointment by Congress, there was a little diffi- 
cult in arranging the details of his office, and some scrupu- 
lous members hesitated in yielding him the powers he requir- 
ed. He well knew, that unless he could act with decision and 
authority, he could effect nothing, which would satisfy general 
expectation, or enable him to execute his designs. For his own 
security, therefore, as well as for the public good, he demanded 
that the choice of all officers, who were in any way connected 
with his department, and for whose conduct he was at least 
indirectly responsible, should be in himself, and their remo- 
val at his discretion. This was a startling proposition to those 
prudent members of Congress, who were always looking for the 
downf-ili of the republic to the ambitious aims of its leaders, 
and whose dreams were peopled with the phantoms of tyrants 
made giddy by the intoxicating draught of power. The army

of all America, except the army. If is the fruit of a certain premature 
declaration, which you know I always opposed. My opposition was 
founded on tlie evil consequences I foresaw, or thought I foresaw, 
and the present state of several of the colonies justifies my appre- 
hension. We are disputing about liberties, privileges, posts, and pla- 
ces, at the very time we ought to have nothing in view, ,but the secur- 
ing of tliose objects, and placing them on such a footing, as to make 
them worth contending for amongst ourselves hereafter. But, instead 
of that, the vigor of this and several other States is lost in intestine 
divisions; and, unless this spirit of contention is checked by some 
other means, I fear it will have a baneful influence on the measures 
of America. 

'Nothing do I wish for more than a peace, on terms honorable and 
bemficial to both countries; and I am convinced it is more consistent 
with the interest of Great Britain to acknowledge our independence, 
and enter into commeicial treaties with us, than to persist in attempt- 
ing to reduce us to unconditional submission. I hope we shall never 
be reduced to such a vile situation, whilst a true friend of America and 
freedom exists. Life would not be worth having, and it is better to 
perish by the sword, than to drag out our remaining days in misery 
aril scorn ; hut I hope Heaven has better things in store for the vota- 
ries of such a cause.'

suffered throughout the war from this trembling timidity of the 
civil fathers, this fearful distrust of the strength of purpose and 
self-control of the leading agents of their will. In the exam- 
ples of other times and countries, it is true, they had read 
monitory lessons, and they felt themselves more safe in cau- 
tion than confidence. Within certain bounds, this was wise. 
The fault was in narrowing the bounds, and curtailing powers, 
till effort was cramped and gfeat ends often defeated. Good 
sense got the better of suspicion, however, in the case of 
Robert Morris, and conceded, although by a tardy acquies- 
cence, the terms he required. 

As soon as Congress had made provision for an assistant 
officer in his department, he wrote the following letter to 
Gouverneur Morris. 

' Office of Finance, July 6th, 1781. 
' Dear Sir, 

' The cheerful manner in which you agreed to render me the 
assistance I solicited, soon after my appointment to the super- 
intendency of the Finances of the United States, gave me great 
pleasure on my own account, and a still more solid satisfaction 
on account of my country. Depending solely on myself, I 
trembled at the arduous task I had reluctantly undertaken ; 
aided by your talents and abilities I feel better courage, and 
dare indulge the fond hope, that, uniting our utmost exertions 
in the service of our country, we may be able to extricate it 
from the present embarrassments, and dispel those only clouds, 
that seem to hang destructive over it. 

' The honorable Congress, by their act of this date, have 
fixed a salary for the assistant, whom I may appoint, agreeable 
to the powers annexed to my office by a former act of Con- 
gress. My entire conviction of the great and essential servi- 
ces, which your genius, talents, and capacity enable you to 
render to your country, and of that aid, ease, and confidence 
you can and will administer to my own exertions and feelings, 
never left me one moment to hesitate about the choice I should 
make. I only lament, that the provision allowed by Congress 
20*

is not more adequate to your deserts, but as I know you are 
incapable of mercenary views and considerations, this circum- 
stance shall be overlooked for the present, in expectation that 
the utility of our measures may draw a proper attention from 
those, who employ us. At any rate we will have the conso- 
lation to pursue the interest of the United States to the best of 
our judgment and abilities, whether we meet with suitable 
rewards or not. 

' Therefore, it is with the utmost satisfaction, that 1 do here- 
by appoint you assistant to the Superintendent of the Finances 
of the United States of North America, and I do assure you, 
that nothing will make me more happy, than to acquire and di- 
vide with you the thanks of our country, and applause of the 
world ; for I am, with esteem and affection, your sincere friend 
and obedient servant, 

' ROBERT MORRIS.' 

In his reply Mr Morris observes ; ' you estimate rny talents 
more highly than they deserve, but such as they are, my coun- 
try may command them. Greatly to curtail salaries is a false 
economy, because it brings men into office, who are incapable 
of the duties, or unworthy of confidence. On the present oc- 
casion, I am not sorry the allowance is so moderate. I will 
demonstrate, that the partiality of friendship has not influenced 
your choice, nor the motives of interest induced my accept- 
ance.' Immediately after the date of these letters, he entered 
publicly upon the duties of his office. Indeed, he had been 
performing the same duties for about two months, ever since 
the Superintendent took charge of his post. He wrote to Mr 
Jay ; ' Finance, my friend, the whole of what remains of the 
American revolution grounds there. The States begin more 
and more 10 see the necessity of complying with the requisi- 
tions of Congress. This is good. Congress will by necessity

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 235 

The salary allowed for the services of the Assistant Financier 
was eighteen hundred and fifty dollars a year. * 

One of the first acts of the Superintendent of Finance was to 
propose the plan of a bank ; which was incorporated hy Con- 
gress under the name of the Bank of North America. Mr 
Gouverneur Morris says in a letter to a friend, written not long 
before his death, ' the first bank in this country was planned by 
your humble servant.' By this he probably meant, that he 
drew up the plan of the bank, and the observations accompa- 
nying it, which were presented to Congress, and not that he 
individually originated the scheme. This was doubtless ma- 
tured in conjunction with the Superintendent. A warm friend- 
ship had existed between them for some time, which it may 
be presumed was increased by a similarity in their turn of mind 
for financial pursuits. To Hamilton, also, may properly be 
ascribed a portion of the merit in forming this bank. About 
two weeks before the plan was sent to Congress, Hamilton wrote 
a letter to Robert Morris, enclosing an elaborate project , for a 
b:\nk. In a letter acknowledging the reception of this paper 
the Financier speaks of it with commendation. He says, 
' 1 have read your performance with that attention, which it 
justly deserves, and finding many parts of it to coincide with 
my own opinions on the subject, it naturally strengthened that 
confidence, which every man ought to possess to a certain de- 
gree in his own judgment.' He then tells him, that he shall 
communicate it to the directors of the bank, to aid them in 
their deliberation on certain points, which it was not thought 
expedient to embrace in the plan itself, particularly that of in- 
terweaving a security with the capital. 

This bank had an extraordinary effect in restoring public 



* It may be worth while here to remark, that there was no relation- 
ship of family between Robert Morris and Gouverneur Morris ; at least 
none which could be traced by them. Robert Morris was born in Eng- 
land, and came to America when he was thirteen years old, his father 
having emigrated some time before. 



236 LIFE OF 

and private credit in the country, and was of immense utility 
in aiding the future operations of the Financier, although r 
was begun with the small capital of four hundred thousand dol- 
lars. Hamilton's project contemplated a vastly larger sum, in 
which Mr Morris agreed with him, but its immmediate success 
on so large a scale was doubtful, and if it failed in the outset, 
it could not be revived ; whereas, by beginning with a small 
capital, and establishing a credit with the public gradually, it 
would be easy afterwards to increase the amount, and in the 
end all needful advantages would be derived, to the utmost 
extent of banking facilities.* 

During the three years and a half, in which Mr Morris act- 
ed as Assistant Financier, he was so closely devoted to the af- 
fairs of that department, that his life afforded few incidents of 
much biographical interest. From fragments which remain it 
would appear, that his correspondence was kept up with a good 
deal of regularity, but he was so negligent at that time in retain- 
ing copies of his letters, and preserving papers, that I have not 
succeeded in gathering many particulars illustrative of his do- 
ings or opinions. A few brief memorandums of causes, and 
heads of .arguments, which still exist, indicate that he was oc- 
casionally engaged in the business of his profession, notwith- 
standing his financial duties. Just before his appointment as 
assistant, he went to head quarters on a mission to confer 
with General Washington, respecting supplies for the army, 
which Robert Morris had undertaken to provide in a time of 
great distress, by pledging his own credit, a rare and lofty 
proof of patriotism, exhibited by him on more occasions than 
one to relieve the pressing wants of his country. 

About this time, Congress appointed four additional Com- 
missioners for negotiating peace, to be joined with Mr Adams, 



*The Plan of this Bank may be seen in the Diplomatic Correspon- 
dence of the American Revolution, Vol. vii. p. 444. The Bank did not

GOUVERNEUR MOURIS. 237 

who had already been sent out for that purpose. There was 
a clause in the instructions, which, although approved by a 
large majority of Congress, was much disrelished by others, 
and considered derogatory to the national dignity. The 
Commissioners were directed to ; undertake nothing in the ne- 
gotiations for peace, or truce, without the knowledge and con- 
currence of the French cabinet, and ultimately to govern them- 
selves by their advice and operation.' This condescension to 
France, and submission to the will and guidance of her Minis- 
ters, in the all important affair of treating for peace, were look- 
ed upon as a token of humiliation unworthy of the spirit of an 
independent nation, and not to be justified by any ties of alli- 
ance, or any debt of gratitude. Mr Jay was one of the new 
Commissioners, and, in writing to him immediately after the 
instructions had passed through Congress, Mr Morris uttered 
his opinions on the subject freely and forcibly. 

'Although I believe myself thoroughly acquainted with you, 
yet I cannot tell whether I ought to congratulate or condole 
with you on your late appointment. Ere this reaches you r 
you will have learnt, that you are on the part of this country 
one of the Commissioners for negotiating a peace. So far is 
well, but when you come to find by your instructions, that you 
must ultimately obey the dictates of the French Ministers, I 
am sure there is something in your bosom, that will revolt at 
the servility of the situation. To have relaxed on all sides, to 
have given up all things, might easily have been expected 
from those minds, which,, softened by wealth and debased by 
fear, are unable to gain and Unworthy to enjoy the blessings of 
freedom. But that the proud should prostitute the very little 
dignity this poor country was possessed of, would be indeed 
astonishing, if we did not know the near alliance between 
pride and meanness. 

' Men, who have too little spirit to demand of their constitu- 
ents that they do their duly, who have sufficient humility to 
beg a paltry pittance at the hands of any and every sovereign 
such men will always be ready to pay the prices, which vanity 



23S LIFE OF 

shall demand from the vain. Do I not know you well enough 
to believe, that you will not act in this new capacity ? I think 
I do, and therefore I will express my concern, that you must 
decline the proffered honor, if that name can indeed be ap- 
plied to such an office. Decline it, however, with decency and 
dignity. I mean always if no alteration shall take place, which, 
if] can effect it, shall be done, though I almost despair.' 

Mr Jay and the other Commissioners accepted their appoint- 
ments, nevertheless, and no change was made in the instruc- 
tions, but they took care to quiet the clamors of conscience, 
and save the wounded dignity of their country, by breaking 
them as soon as they came to act. They cut the Gordian 
knot in the way, in which all such knots are usually cut. In 
this they did partly right and partly wrong. They did right 
to act for themselves, and on their own responsibility, and 
make as good a treaty as they could ; they did wrong in sign- 
ing the treaty without the knowledge and concurrence of their 
friends and allies, who were still their friends, and wished 
them all the success they could gain, in spite of their jealou- 
sies, suspicions, and surmises. But this is trenching on the 
ground of history, a task more fitting to be pursued on some 
other occasion than the present. 

The appointment of a secretary at war was deferred for 
some months after those of the finance department and of 
foreign affairs. Mr Morris wrote to General Greene, urging 
him to be a candidate for the office, or at least to accept it if 
appointed. But he declined on various grounds, though it 
would seem, from the following letter, that Mr Morris did not 
think his determination had been unalterably fixed. 

Philadelphia, December 24th, 1781. 
' Dear Sir, 

' Lincoln is our Minister of War, and the election to that 
office has been to you most honorable, for all agreed that you 
were the proper person, and nothing prevented your unani- 
mous appointment, but an opinion almost as unanimous, that, if 
recalled from your command, you could not be replaced. 




GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 239 

at you were not chosen I do truly lament, for I can with 
great truth assure you, that I know not a man who is in my 
opinion equal to the office except yourself. It is, however, 
much consolation to me, that General Lincoln is an honest 
and a sensible man, and, what is also of importance, that he is an 
industrious man. These are qualities, which will make him 
a good Minister, if not a great one, and these qualities will 
go far towards restoring or rather creating that order and reg- 
ularity, without which a Minister of the most superior genius 
and talents would be only a lion in the toils, and be the soon- 
er exhausted in proportion to his superior strength and more 
vigorous struggles. 

'I shall not now attempt to remove your obstacles to the 
acceptance, though it is right that they should not weigh with 
you too heavily, because it is not impossible that your country 
may still call you from the field to serve in the cabinet. I 
cannot, however, omit the present opportunity of lodging in 
the bosom of friendly confidence my sentiments of our interior 
political situation. That Congress have not proper powers I see, 
I feel, and I lament. Their Ministers have the arduous task 
before them to govern without power, nay, more, to obtain the 
power necessary to govern. They must persuade where oth- 
ers command, and the strong phalanx of private interest, with 
the impetuous sallies of private politics and party, encounters 
them at every step. 

' These features of our character and situation are very dis- 
agreeable, but are not these the distinguishing marks of gov- 
ernment in its infancy, in every age and in every clime ? To 
reinforce the reasonings, to impress the arguments, and to 
sweeten the persuasions of the public servants, we have that 
great friend to sovereign authority, a foreign war. Conviction 
goes but very slowly to the popular mind, but it goes. The 
advantages of union and decision in carrying on a war, the 
disadvantages, which flow from the want of them, the waste, 
the expense, and inefficacy of disjointed efforts over the face 
of an immense region, the incompetency of determining what 
is best for the whole through thirteen different communities, 



240 LIFE OF 

whose rulers are yet ignorant of what is best even for the sin- 
gle one which they govern ; these, with the thousand others, 
which it is hardly in language to enumerate or in genius to 
conceive, or in anything but experience to show, these must 
at last induce the people of America, if the war continues, to 
entrust proper powers to the American sovereign, as they have 
already compelled that sovereign reluctantly to relinquish the 
administration, and entrust to their Ministers the care of 
this immense republic. I say, if the war continues, or if it 
does not continue, I have no hope, no expectation, that the 
government will acquire force ; and I will go further, I have 
no hope, that our union can subsist, except in the form of an 
absolute monarchy, and this does not seem to consist with 
the taste and temper of the people. The necessary conse- 
quence, if I am right, is, that a separation must take place, 
and consequently wars, for near neighbors are very rarely, if 
ever, good neighbors. But all political reasonings are liable to 
very e;reat uncertainty, and it is only the Supreme Intelligence, 
who can determine sufficiently, even on facts to ground reason- 
ings. Still, our conduct must be swayed by our opinions, and 
therefore from the same attachment to the happiness of man- 
kind, which prompted rny first efforts in this revolution, I am 
now induced to wish, that Congress may be possessed of more, 
much more authority, than has hitherto been delegated to 
them. 

' Though you are not Minister of War, you must act in some 
measure us such, and you will see that you are also to be a 
kind of financier. Indeed the distance of the Southern States, 
the interruptions in communications with them, the changes 
which take place before facts can be known here, and determi- 
nations on them transmitted from hence, all require that a man 
of sense ami integrity should act on liberal principles, as circum- 
stances m;iy require. From considerations like these, I have 
been induced to think, that there was wisdom in leaving you 
where you are, and 1 might have agreed in opinion on that 
subject with other people, only I am inclined to think, that 
the Southern Slates will be evacuated.

At this time there was a Spanish agent in Philadelphia, by 
the name of Rendon, acting in a kind of demi-official capacity, 
stationed there ostensibly to watch over the commerce of his 
countrymen, and protect them from the undue freedoms of 
American privateers, but in reality to keep his eye on the 
doings of Congress, to penetrate their designs in regard to the 
Mississippi country, to observe the political aspect of affairs, to 
collect information of various kinds, and to communicate the 
results of the whole to his government. Mr Rendon was a 
faithful agent to his employers, and were it not for the habitual 
insincerity of the Spanish cabinet in all their proceedings to- 
wards America, his mission might be thought to have been a 
token of friendship and respectful consideration. At any rate 
it was desirable to keep the agent in good humor, and pains 
were not spared to give him knowledge and fix just impressions. 

On the subjects of the paper money and finance of the 
United States, Mr Rendon put a series of questions to Mi- 
Morris, which he requested might receive such answers, as he 
could send to the King, and as would be easily understood by 
him and his Ministers. In his note of queries he says, ' Mr 
Rendon is infinitely desirous of making his Court acquainted 
how much America is indebted to the particular care of the 
Messrs Morrises, and with what is to be expected from an 
administration, which already enjoys so much credit.' He 
requests a history of American nance from the beginning of 
the revolution, the plan and present state of the bank, an

account of the national debt and means of paying it, and the 
amount of annual expenses, adding that ' Mr Morris will see 
how necessary it is for the King to be informed, as to the last 
point in particular, which will enable him to judge both of the 
wants and resources of America, and perhaps determine him 
to afford her effectual aid.' 

In reply to these queries Mr Morris wrote an able paper, 
containing a brief but clear and forcible exposition of each 
topic by itself. This he could easily do, as no man in the 
nation had surveyed the whole ground with a more exact 
scrutiny, or was better informed in all its details. It is not 
known whether Mr Rendon sent the paper to the Spanish Cab- 
inet as he proposed, but it is quite certain that nothing was 
ever heard of the ' effectual aid,' at which he had hinted. A 
copy was forwarded to Mr Jay, and left to his discretion for 
such use, as circumstances might render expedient in his 
negotiation.

BY an agreement between General Washington and Sir

the purpose of consulting on the exchange of prisoners. Gen- 
eral Knox and Gouverneur Morris were delegated on the par 
of General Washington, and General Dalrymple and Andrew 
Elliott on that of the British commander. They met and ex- 
changed powers at Elizabeth Town, in New Jersey, on the 



GOUVERNEUK MORRIS. 243 

31st of March, 1782. They had a wide scope of business en- 
trusted to them, extending both to military and naval prison- 
ers. Mr Morris wrote to the Superintendent of Finance on 
the first day of their meeting. 

' We exchanged powers with the Commissioners of Sir Hen- 
ry Clinton, viz. General Dalrymple and Andrew Elliott, this 
morning, and shall proceed to business tomorrow. I fancy 
we shall be engaged for some time, though I cannot positively 
determine. But you shall know, as soon as I do, the events, 
which may be important. With respect to the designs of the 
enemy on our commerce, I am as yet ignorant of them, but 
shall probably gain some intelligence before long. I believe 
you may rely that Germain and Sandwich give place to Shel- 
burne and Howe. Clinton will, I believe, go home. As to 
their situation here, I think it is not yet decided among them- 
selves.

and shall have more. If you can let me know anything very 
recent of English politics, I wish you to do it, as it may be 
useful. General Dalrymple wishes to know how the change 
has been operated in our finances, so as to have avoided the 
convulsions apprehended, which he considers as a prodigy. I 
tell him it is the age and country of miracles, and he will see 
more and greater ones ere long. 1 shall give him at a con- 
venient opportunity some little details on this subject with great 
candor. He this morning asked my sentiments, as to the 
change in their Ministry. I told him candidly, that I had sup- 
posed Great Britain would change Ministers before they offer- 
ed treaty with us, but I did not expect a change so soon, for 
that I really did not expect they would think of treating with 
us on the ground of independence as yet. This, said he, is 
another affair. I told him 1 was sorry Lord Howe was ap- 
pointed, because he is a great marine officer. "It might," said 
he, " have done some time ago, but" " Oh, Sir, you are still a 
great people, a very great people." " Why yes, if we had five 
or six years to bring our finances in order again, we might

perhaps still "hold our rank in Europe." " You undoubtedly 
will, notwithstanding the loss of this country." " Why \vc 
shall be more compact." 1 

The Commissioners had before them three specific objects 
of consultation and arrangement; a cariel for the exchange of 
prisoners, a liquidation of all- accounts for the maintenance of 
prisoners on both sides, and provision for their future support. 
Unluckily they could not agree upon :iny one point. The 
demands and terms on each side were such, as the other would 
not accede to, and after two weeks' deliberation they separated 
without having decided upon anything. The truth is, the 
subject had become a very delicate and a very difficult one to 
handle. Mutual complaints about prisoners had existed from 
the beginning of the war. The cruel treatment of those, who 
were first taken by the British in New York, had exasperated 
the minds of the Americans, and the detention afterwards of 
the Convention troops of Saratoga, ns the English always in- 
sisted against the rules of war, had equally roused the indig- 
nation of the enemy. Various oiher incidents contributed to 
keep alive this feeling on both sides, ;ud, in the mean time, 
the unfortunate prisor.ers were detained, the victims of British 
pride on the one hand, and American obstinacy on the other. 

An intimate correspondence was stil! kept up between Mi- 
Morns and Mr Jay. That Commissioner had repaired to Paris 
in June, and. was engaged with Dr Franklin in negotiating the 
treaty of peace. 

J'UIN JAY TO GOUVEHNEUK MOKHIS. 

' Paris, Octolier 13th, 1782. 

' Dear Morris, 

' I have received your festina Jente letter, but wish it had 
been, at least partly, in cyphers. You need not be informed of 
my reasons for this wish, as by this time you must know, lhat 
seals are en this side of the water rather matters of decora- 
tion, than of use. It gave me nevertheless great pleasure to 
receive lhat letter, it being the first from you that had reach- 
ed me, the Lord knows when ; except, indeed, a few lines

covering your correspondence with a Don. I find you are 
industrious, and of consequence useful. So much the better 
for yourself, for the public, and for our friend Morris, whom I 
consider as the pillar of American credit. 

' The King of Great Britain, by letters patent under the 
great seal, has authorized Mr Oswald to treat with the Com- 
missioners of the United States of America. His first commis- 
sion literally pursued the Enabling Act, and the authority it gave 
him was expressed in the very forms of that act, viz. to treat 
with the colonies, and with any or either of them, and any 
part of them, and with any description of men in them, and 
with any person whatsoever, of and concerning peace, &tc. 

' Had I not violated the instructions of Congress, their digni- 
ty would have been in the dust, for the French Minister even 
took pains not only to persuade us to treat under that commis- 
sion, but to prevent the second by telling Fitzherbert that the 
first was sufficient. I told the Minister, that we neither could 
nor would treat with any nation in the world, on any other 
than an equal footing. 

' We may, and we may not, have a peace this winter. Act 
as if the war would certainly continue ; keep proper garrisons 
in your strong posts, and preserve your army sufficiently numer- 
ous and well appointed, until every idea of hostility and sur- 
prise shall have completely vanished. 

' I am, dear Morris, very much yours, 

*JOHN JAY.' 

Mr Jay's well known impressions, respecting the motives of 
the French Cabinet in the treaty of peace, are strongly hint- 
ed in this letter. The form of Mr Oswald's commission was 
indeed faulty, and ought to have been disapproved by the Ame- 
rican Commissioners, as it was both by Mr Jay and Dr Frank- 
lin, but it must be remembered, that it was the form only, and 
not the substance, which was objected to. Mr Oswald was 
authorized to negotiate with the American Commissioners a 
treaty of peace, which was virtually acknowledging them to 
21* 



246 LIFE OF 

represent nn independent power. This was Mr Adams's 
view of ihe subject, when lie wrote from Holland to Dr Frank- 
lin n short time before; 'If they rn;ike a treaty of peace willi 
the United States of America, this is acknowledgment enough 
for me.' But Mr Jay insisted, that the commission should be 
so worded, as to imply an express acknowledgment of inde- 
pendence, before they proceeded to treat. This was fair, it 
was what the Commissioners might justly demand, it was due 
to the dignity of their country ; but the question was, whether 
it would be advisable to interrupt the negotiation at the outset, 
and perhaps endanger its progress, by a punctilious regard for 
mere forms. Count Vergennes thought not ; he considered, 
like Mr Adams, the act of treating to be an avowed acknowl- 
edgment of independence, and he advised the Commissioners 
to make everything secure, by introducing proper articles into 
the treaty itself, and fixing bounds to further claims and pre- 
tensions. 

Jt was a harsh censure upon the French Minister, to charge 
him with a design to degrade the dignity of the American na- 
tion, or to put obstacles in the way of their independence. It 
was a censure, which, however justified by appearances or sus- 
picion at the lime, is neither borne out nor in any degree sus- 
tained by more 7 recent and exact investigations. And, indeed, 
nothing could be less probable in itself. France, it is well 
known, went into the war for the sole object of severing Amer- 
ica from England, and she came out of it with no other gain, than 
the independence of the United Slates. In all the secret over- 
tures for a separate treaty, that were made to Count Vergen- 
nes, (and they were several) by emissaries from the British 
Court during the war, hu invariably insisted on the recogni- 
tion of American independence as a preliminary step. When 
Russia and Austria proposed to mediate between England and 
France, Count Vergennes accepted the offer, but imposed as 
a condition, that commissbr.eis should be admitted from the 
United States, and take part as the representatives of nn inde- 
pendent po.\er in the negotiations for peace. He maintained 



OOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 247 

the same ground when Spain came forward as a mediator. 
And what is more, in a secret Convention between France and 
Spain, entered into a short time before the latter declared war 
against England, there is a clause, in which France exacts a 
promise from Spain not to oppose the independence of the 
United States. 

This is a very important fact, inasmuch as it has gene- 
rally been believed, by those who have doubted the sincerity 
of France in her professions to America, that she never de- 
sired Spain to acknowledge American independence, hut had 
her own motives for discouraging such an act, and used her 
influence accordingly. The contrary is the truth, as will gen- 
erally be the case, where suspicion of one's friend is made the 
groundwork of an opinion. In the preamble to this Conven- 
tion it appears, that France used strong and' pressing arguments 
to induce Spain to recognize the independence of the United 
States, and, failing in this object, she required in the first arti- 
cle of the instrument itself the stipulation above mentioned. 
Spain agreed to carry on the contest jointly with France 
agp.inst England, but refused to take any part directly in favor 
of the American States, although earnestly solicited to make 
common cause with her ally in all the objects of the war. * 

Count Vergennes was the earliest an<l most decided friend 
America had in the French councils. The cabinet was orig- 
inally divided on the subject of aiding the crilonies against 
England, and the King was pointedly opposed to such a step. 
Vergennes took his position and maintained it. He brought 
over the King by degrees to his views. The resolution of the 
government was taken, and steadily pursued, till the great 
object was effected. The burden of the undertaking, the 
weight of responsibility, rested mainly on the shoulders of

Count Vergennes. A failure would have ruined him. The 
independence of America was an aim, upon the success of 
which, his reputation, his existence as a public minister, de- 
pended. He was aware of this, and adhered to his purpose 
steadily to the last. Whatever may be thought of Count Ver- 
gennes' talents or character as a man, of his general policy 
or practice as a statesman, he must ever be regarded, by 
those who will diligently examine the history of his ministerial 
career, as a true and valuable friend to the United States, and 
as deserving the lasting gratitude of the American people.*

not settled. If settled, the balances are not secured by com-

250 LIFE OP 

Mr Johnson, in his Life of General Greene, has advanced 
two or three charges against the opinions and character of 
Gouverneur Morris, which it seems proper to notice as we go 
along. The friendship and confidence, that subsisted between 
Morris and Greene, induced them lo correspond without re- 
serve on subjects of the greatest political moment. Of this 
fact the reader has already been apprized. Two more letters 
will here be inserted. 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS TO GENERAL GREENE. 

Philadelphia, February 15th, 1783. 
' Dear Sir, 

'I cannot omit so good an opportunity of communicating to 
you my thoughts on the present situation of affairs. Knowing 
as I do, that your heart is actuated by the same principles of 
justice, and the same sentiments of policy, which, influence my 
own, I can venture on a freedom of communication which, to 
most men, would be imprudent. The approach of peace can- 
not but give very serious thoughts to every officer and soldier 
of the American army. The promises made by the public 
will, if performed, be of beneficial importance, and, if broken, 
extremely injurious. The main army have had anxieties on 
this subject ; and though I do not pretend to guess precisely 
their sentiments, I am convinced they will not easily forego 
their expectations. Their murmurs, though not loud, are 
deep ; and I do not think that the committee they have sent 
hither will, from their report, allay the apprehensions which 
were excited. 

' From this committee, however, I learn that they were pre- 
cipitating themselves in the road to ruin. I mean by pursuing 
a recommendation to the several States for compensation. 
This, which would have divided them into thirteen different 
parts, would have made it easy to elude the force of their ap- 
plications, or, after their compliance, to have resumed any 
grants made in consequence of them, when the army should 
have been disbanded. At present, however, ihe committee have 
become so thoroughly persuaded, that the army will be de- 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 251 

frauded, unless they unitedly pursue a common object, that I 
believe it will soon become the general sentiment. If the ar- 
my, in common with all other public creditors, insist on the 
grant of general permanent fluids for liquidating all the public 
debts, there can be little doubt that such revenues will be ob- 
tained ; and there can be no doubt, that, when they are obtain- 
ed, they will afford to every order of public creditors a solid 
security. The half-pay promised the officers is estimated to 
be worth five and a half years' full pay in hand. 

'Admitting, then, that the proper revenues were obtained, 
the officer would be able always to sell his stock for the value. 
It is needless to say, that the United States have no other mode 
of paying the arrearages due to the army. It is also unneces- 
sary to mention, that this kind of provision ought to be made 
for debts of every description. The effect of it, in all its 
parts, you will, I am sure, be at no loss to trace ; and you will 
agree with me in opinion, that Congress can, by that means, 
obtain a degree of influence essential to the happiness of this 
country. Now, my dear Sir, I am most perfectly convinced, 
that, with the due exception of miracles, there is no probability 
that the States will ever make such grants, unless the army be 
united and determined in the pursuit of it ; and unless they be 
firmly supported, and as firmly support the other public credi- 
tors. That this may happen must be the entire wish of every 
intelligently just man, and of every real friend to our glorious 
revolution, 

' GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.' 

GENERAL GREENE TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

' Charleston, April 3d, 1783. 
( Dear Sir, 

' The subject of your letter by Major Edwards is impor- 
tant to the public, and interesting to the army. The dispo- 
sition of the latter here is much the same as it is to the north- 
ward, but I am afraid of both. When soldiers advance with- 
out authority, who can halt them? We have many Clodiuses 



252 LIFE or 

and Oatilines in America, who may give a different direction 
to this business, than either you or I expect. It is a critical 
business, and pregnant with dangerous consequences. Con- 
gress arc fast declining, and their po.ver and authority must ex- 
pire, without more effectual support. What this may produce, 
time will manifest. I have done my duty, and wait events. 

' 1 wrote a letter to the Governor of this State on the sub- 
ject of finance, and the discontents of the army. It gave some 
alarm and much disgust. Continental authority and the finan- 
cier are looked upon with a jealous eye here. No people 
were ever more blind to their true interest. Time and further 
expeiience will produce what reason and persuasion can- 
not. I send you a copy of my letter to the Assembly, and a 
couple of papers with some strictures thereon. More will he 
said upon the subject hereafter. Plain dealing will soon be- 
come necessary. 

'Within a day a report prevails that Mr Morris will resign 
in May. Public credit will receive a fatal stab should it take 
place. No more bills can be negotiaied, and I expect the 
contractor will decline the business. How we are to be sup- 
ported I cannot imagine. Every mind seems to be impress- 
ed with a kind of awful suspense. The doubis upon war and 
peace, the hopes and fears in matters of revenue, the discon- 
tenis ol the army, and the consequences that all these may pro- 
duce upon our own internal policy, and in the measures of 
British administration, must fill every mind, which feels for 
the tranquillity of this country, with no small anxiety. Most 
part of the force in this quarter will march northwardly in 
about a fortnight. I am, &c. 

' NATHANAEL GKEENE.' 

From two of Mr Morris's letters to General Greene, printed 
abovf, Mr Johnson infers, first, that he was the author of the 
eels 1 " rated Newhurgh letters, or addresses; and secondly, that 
he \vas an advocate for an absolute monarchy, and wished to 
establish such a system in America by an improper use of the 
armv. 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 253 

As to the first charge, it has been happily put to rest by 
General Armstrong, who has declared himself the author of the 
Addresses, and that he wrote them at Newburgh, in General 
Gates's quarters, at the request of several officers, he being 
a Major in the army of the United States, and aid to Gen- 
eral Gates. Here then is an end of this matter.* 

To those, who have read Mr Morris's letters, on which 
Mr Johnson relies for his proofs of the second charge, very 
little needs be said to show, that his deductions are not well 
sustained. Most persons indeed would infertile contrary. So 
far from exhibiting any evidence, that he was a friend of mon- 
archy, and wished to set up such a form of government in 
the United States, Mr Morris expresses his fears, that such a 
calamity would be the consequence of the disordered condi. 
tion of the country, particularly in regard to the finances, 
unless some powerful and speedy remedy should be applied. 
So little power was lodged in the hands of Congress, and so 
little influence possessed by that Assembly over the States, 
that when the pressure of a foreign war should cease to con- 
solidate a union for mutual defence, his serious and alarming 
apprehensions were, that civil dissensions and a weak govern- 
ment would lead to their natural results, anarchy in the first 
instance, and monarchy in the last. There was nothing new 
or singular in this doctrine. Ft was probably the sentiment of 
every patriot in the nation, who looked deeply into the state of 
public affairs, and foresaw the impending dangers. 

It would be idle to discuss this subject. All Mr Morris's 
writings, all his actions, vindicate him from the charge of 
seeking to establish a monarchy in America. It was a favorite 
maxim with him, as it must be with every wise man, that 
forms of government should be suited to the condition, charac- 
ter, manners, and habits of the people. In France, therefore, 



*See an article, understood to have been written by General Arm- 
strong, in the United Slates Magazine, for January 1, 1823, New York. 
VOL. i. 22 



254 LIFE OF 

and reasoning as a Frenchman, he was a monarchist, he- 
cause he believed the monarchical form the only one adapted 
to that nation ; and from the very commencement of the rev- 
olution in that, country, he predicted the inefficiency of the 
French Republic, and the final issue of a military despotism. 
This he conceived to be the natural order of things, and so it 
turned out. The same idea appears, where he expresses his 
apprehensions of a monarchy in the United States, adding 
that ' this does not seem to consist with the taste and temper of 
the people.'* His wish was, that such a plan of government 
should be established in America, as would be received and 
obeyed, secure strength from union, and prosperity and happi- 
ness from its suitableness to the social and political condition 
of the inhabitants. 

Mr Johnson says further, that ' General Greene was not de- 
ceived by the specious affectation of disinterestedness and 
public spirit,' in Mr Morris's letter, and adds, 'it so happened, 
also, that he was fully apprized of the writer's intimate con- 
nexion with the public creditors, to a greater amount probably 
than any other man in the union.' This is a very grave in- 
sinuation, meaning, as I presume, that Mr Morris was improp- 



* For some reason not given, Mr Johnson omits this clause of the 
letter, in the extract published by him. He quotes Mr Morris as say- 
ing, that if war does not continue, 'I have no hope, no expectation, 
that the government will acquire force ; and I will go further, I have 
no hope, that our union can subsist, except in the form of an abso- 
lute monarchy, (Here Mr Johnson stops, and cuts off the sentence 
in the middle, but Mr Morris goes on to say) and this does not seem 
to consist with the taste and temper of the people.' It is evident, that 
this last part of the clause gives a turn to the author's ideas, essential- 
ly different from what would be derived from the former part alone. 

Again it is remarkable, that the letter, in which this passage is con- 
tained, is printed by Mr Johnson without dote, and in connexion with 
that of February eleventh, 1783, as if they related to the same subject, 
and were intended to support each other ; whereas, the former was 
written on the twenty-fourth of December, 1781. 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 255 

erly concerned in speculating projects with public creditors, 
and had his private ends to answer, in bringing about violent 
measures to operate on the government. I feel bound to de- 
clare, that I have discovered nothing in any records of Mr 
Morris's private or public transactions, that gives a shadow of 
probability to such a suspicion. There is not a glimpse of 
evidence, that he had any personal concern with those cre- 
ditors, or took any other interest in their affairs, than what 
was prompted by generous motives for the public good, and 
desire to see justice done to all parties. He was devoted to his 
duties as Assistant Financier, and had no income or means, ex- 
cept his salary in that office. From the time he ceased to be a 
member of Congress, till he received his new appointment, he 
was supported by occasional allowances from his mother, and 
such precarious receipts as he derived from his profession. As 
yet nothing had come to him from his father's estate. Hence 
it is clear, if other circumstances were not conclusive, that, 
destitute as he was of means and of credit, he could not 
meddle in such deep speculating projects, and that the bi- 
ographer of Greene must be mistaken on this point. 

If he means by the insinuation a political intrigue, and that 
Morris was to be rewarded for his services in that line, the 
proof is equally wanting, and the thing itself still more im- 
probable. He quotes a passage from Gordon, in which that 
writer says, Gouverneur Morris was suspected of being at the 
bottom of an extraordinary scheme, which was to ' throw the 
officers and soldiers into such a paroxysm of rage and resent- 
ment, as should drive them into an attempt of compelling 
Congress to comply with their own demands, and those of 
the public creditors, who were to arm and join them.' This 
description itself is too ludicrous to require a formal reply, and 
it is enough to add, that Gordon suspected many things, which 
never happened, as he wrote many things not worth recording. 

There is a letter from General Knox to Mr Morris on this 
subject, written but a few days before the Newburgh addresses 
appeared, in reply to one brought to him by the committee 



256 LIFE OF 

of the army, on their return from Philadelphia to camp. The 
letter of Mr Morris, to which this is an answer, has not been 
found. 

' West Point, February 21st, 1783. 
' My Dear Morris, 

' I thank you for your kind favor of the seventh instant by 
Colonel Brooks. I am convinced your ideas of the general 
state of our affairs must be just, as they are the result of ex- 
perience. The army generally have always reprobated be- 
ing thirteen armies. Their ardent desires have been, to be 
one continental body ; looking up to one sovereign. This would 
have prevented much heart-burning at the partialities, which 
have been practised by the respective States. They know of 
no way of bringing this about, at a period when peace appears 
to be in full view. Certain it is, they are good patriots and 
would forward everything, that would tend to produce union, 
and a permanent general constitution. But they are yet to 
be taught how their influence is to effect this matter. They 
may assist, but they must be directed in the mode by proper 
authority. 

' It is a favorite toast in the army, " a hoop to the bar- 
rel," or, " cement to the union." America will have fought and 
bled to little purpose, if the powers of government shall be in- 
sufficient to preserve the peace, and this must be the case with- 
out general funds. As the present constitution is so defective, 
why do not you great men call the people together, and tell 
them so. That is, to have a convention of the States to form 
a better constitution ? This appears to us, who have a super- 
ficial view only, to be the most efficacious remedy. Let some- 
thing be done before a peace takes place, or we shall be in a 
worse situation than we were at the commencement of the 
war. 

' Your affectionate 

<I1. KNOX.' 

The whole matter amounts to this. A certa-in number of 
gentlemen, among whom was Mr Morris, looked with much 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 257 

alarm on the feeble state of the national government, and fore^ 
boded the melancholy consequences of this weakness after the 
peace, when a separation of interests and powers would inevit- 
ably lead to disunion and civil disorders. To prevent such a 
catastrophe, these gentlemen wished to secure a more solid 
government, while there was yet any means of effecting it. 
To consolidate the public debts, embracing those to the army 
as well as to private citizens, and to make the United States, 
and not the States individually, responsible for the payment of 
the whole mass, would be to create a bond of union more firm 
and durable, than could be devised in any other manner. The 
army was about to be disbanded, and the officers and soldiers 
sent home to the States to obtain their pay, or lose it, accord- 
ing to the caprice of circumstances. Thus disappointed and 
left at the mercy of events, was it to be expected, that they 
would retain any attachment for that body of rulers, by whom, 
after fighting the battles of their country in the times of her 
greatest peril, they were now neglected and turned off? Was 
it to be expected, that they would cherish a single sentiment 
of regard for a national government, which was too weak to 
render justice to its servants, too low in public estimation to 
maintain its own dignity ? 

Setting aside the score of equity, therefore, and placing the 
subject merely on the ground of patriotism, the course pur- 
sued by Mr Morris and his coadjutors will claim approbation, 
rather than censure. Their design was to strengthen and 
perpetuate the national government, by combining as many 
interests as possible in its support. The army and the public 
creditors happened to be two large classes of citizens, respect- 
able for their character and numbers, who had the same pow- 
erful and stimulating cause for working together in the attain- 
ment of the same end, that of procuring their just dues, and 
sustaining a government that could command the means of 
paying them. While kept up by these two pillars, the gov- 
ernment might still hold together, and perform its functions, 
although tottering with premature decay in some of its parts.

Such, it is conceived, were the motives, such the efforts of 
those, who united (in this conspiracy as it has been called) to 
save the Republic from ruin. 

On the seventeenth of July, Mr Jay wrote to Mr Morris 
from Passy, ' Orders are gone out to evacuate New York. 
The present British Ministry are duped, I believe, by an opin- 
ion of our not having union and energy sufficient to regulate 
our trade, so as to retaliate their restrictions. Our ports were 
opened too soon. Let us however be temperate, as well as 
firm.' And again on the twenty-fourth of September. 

' While there are knaves and fools in the world, there will 
be wars in it: and that nations should make war against 
nations, is less surprising, than their living in uninterrupted 
peace and harmony. You have heard that the Ottoman and 
Russian empires are on the point of unsheathing the sword. 
The objects of the contest are more easy to discern than the 
issue ; but if Russia should extend her navigation to Constan- 
tinople, we may be the better for it ; that circumstance is an 
additional motive to our forming a treaty of commerce with 
her. Your commercial and geographical knowledge render it 
unnecessary for me to enlarge on this subject. 

' But whatever we may have to do abroad, it is of little im- 
portance when compared with what we have to do at home. 
1 am perfectly convinced that no time is to be lost in raising 
and maintaining a national spirit in America. Power to gov- 
ern the confederacy, as to all general purposes, should be 
granted and exercised. The government of the different 
States should be wound up and become vigorous. America 
is beheld with jealousy, and jealousy is seldom idle. Settle 
your boundaries without delay; it is better that some improp- 
er limits should be fixed, than any left in dispute. In a word, 
everything conducive to union, and constitutional energy of 
government, should be cultivated, cherished, and protected; 
and all counsels and measures of a contrary complexion should 
at least be suspected of impolitic views and objects. 

' The rapid progress of luxury at Philadelph ia is a frequent

topic of conversation here, and what is a little remarkable, I 
have not heard a single person speak of it in terms of appro- 
bation.' 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS TO JOHN JAY. 

Philadelphia, September 24th, 1783. 

' Dear Sir, 

'The British employ themselves about the evacuation of 
New York, but that business goes on slowly. I am however 
informed from tolerable authority, that they will be gone by the 
beginning of November. Tf, as you suppose, the British Min- 
istry imagine that we cannot retaliate their restrictions, they 
are deceived, for their conduct will itself give Congress a pow- 
er, which they might not otherwise be possessed of. Indeed, 
my friend, nothing can do us so much good, as to convince the 
Eastern and Southern States how necessary it is to give pro- 
per force to the federal government, and nothing will so soon 
operate that conviction as foreign efforts to restrain the naviga- 
tion of the one, and the commerce of the other. 

' But for my own part, I have no desire to retaliate commer- 
cial restrictions. It is my fixed opinion, that a nation can by 
such restrictions do nothing more than injure herself, nor is an 
injury the less so because it affects mope the remote members, 
than it does the head of an empire. The sovereign may col- 
lect and ought to have revenue from all his dominions, which 
are in condition to afford it, but he acts weakly, as well as 
wickedly , if he cramps one part of the community, that he may 
draw more easily the blood and juices from another part. 
The late prohibition to trade with the British Islands, unless in 
British bottoms, can do us no harm, and can do them no 
good. Our produce they must and will have, and if they 
employ half a million in carrying on the navigation at a great 
expense, which we should have performed at a less expense 
for two hundred thousand, our two hundred thousand will be 
left for other operations, even to speculate on their produce 
and our own, so as to make them pay the speculator a profit 



260 LIFE OF 

on every gallon of rum they sell, and every barrel of flour they 
buy in our ports. By making the subsistence of their people 
in the Islands more expensive, they aid the efforts of rival na- 
tions to furnish the commodities of their Islands to others, and 
even to their own subjects. This kind of policy is so bad, that 
I am persuaded the British Ministers cannot seriously intend 
the prohibition, although I am equally convinced, that a regard 
to the national prejudices renders it unavoidable at present. 
I do not, therefore, think we should labor to undo what is 
done, but leave things a while to their own course. And as to 
a treaty of commerce, I think the best way is to make no 
treaty for some time to come, and if we tell them that we 
will make no treaty, they will be much more desirous of it 
than we ought to be. 

' Mr Adams seems to be in opinion with you, as to the ne- 
cessity of sending a Minister to England, as indeed he does on 
some other points. He will, I suppose, be the man, for sundry 
reasons, which I might assign, but he will have serious cause 
to repent of the appointment under present circumstances. 
Nothing would have more unfavorable effects, than to send a 
Minister, who should feel himself attached or opposed to any of 
the parties, by which that nation is rent asunder. We should 
hold them in equal indifference of sentiment, with equal ap- 
pearance of confidence, paying to the Ins a respect due to 
their places, but which neither Ins or Outs are, or can be, enti- 
tled to on the score of their merit and virtue, at least from us. 
As we may not easily find a man capable of this conduct, per- 
haps the best Minister is no Minister, for the want of one will 
show, that we are not precipitate in a desire of close connex- 
ion, and that, however the old mercantile habits may have re- 
vived commercial intercourse, the government has a proper 
jealousy and caution. This circumstance, also, must work fa- 
vorably on our politics with other powers, and give weight 
and dignity lo the Ministers we do send. I am, &.c. 

' GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.' 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 261 

On the second of October he wrote to an American gentle- 
man, who had lately gone to London. ' You will, I suppose, 
have found the government rather indisposed towards us, and 
by what we have seen of their conduct, it appears not improb- 
able that, in our turn, we shall become indisposed towards 
them. My consolation on the present system of the Europe- 
an powers, is, that they will operate as a band to our union. 
We read fables in youth, and have not in age the temper to 
profit by them. Nay, we almost forget, when charged with 
great affairs, that it was the sun, and not the wind, which made 
the old man throw off his great coat. France, not liable as 
England is to mercantile influence in the operations of state, 
would be mad to imitate that imperious rival. But it is not 
impossible that she may be so mad, for I believe her rulers 
have not the best information from this quarter. I judge by 
the conversation of M. de Marbois, who is as much and as 
blindly attached to a restrictive system for their Islands, as 
you can easily conceive.' 

From the time that there had been a prospect of peace, 
Mr Morris had given much attention to the subject of West 
India trade, and had convinced himself of the impolicy of restric- 
tive regulations, both in regard to England and France. In- 
deed, when he wrote the above letter, he was engaged in draw- 
ing up a paper for the consideration of the French Minister, 
M. dela Luzerne, entitled, ' Ideas of an American on the Com- 
merce between the United States and the French Islands.' 
The point of his argument is, that it will be advantageous alike 
to France and her Islands, to leave the commerce of the latter 
open to the United States. 

He lays it down as an axiom, that the Islands themselves 
must flourish, in proportion to the facility with which they can 
obtain the means of subsistence. Make subsistence cheap to 
the inhabitants, and their produce will be cheap in the same 
proportion, more lands will be cultivated, the population and 
the amount of produce increased. Hence a greater demand 
for the commodities of France, and the means of paying for 



262 LIFE or 

them ; and hence an increase to the internal wealth, revenue, 
and navigation of that country. 

But the question occurs, whether it will be expedient for 
France to permit this commerce with America to be carried 
on in American bottoms ? The advocates for restriction say 
no. The objection is advanced, that if the Americans are 
permitted to carry away the produce of the Islands for their 
own use, they will not be contented with the privilege to this 
extent, but will take away more than they want, and thus elude 
the commercial regulations with reference to France and her 
Islands, and become the sole carriers of the Islands to all parts 
of the world. To obviate this objection, according to the 
doctrine of the restrictionists, the trade between the Isl- 
ands and the United States must be carried on in French 
bottoms only. 

This doctrine is at variance with the fact, that the commerce 
cannot be carried on with any chance of advantage by vessels 
sailing from Europe to America, thence to the Islands, and 
thence again to Europe. Owing to the nature of the navigation 
among the Islands, and on the American coast, the articles 
from the United States must be carried in small vessels, navi- 
gated by few men. This has been proved by long experi- 
ence. But this kind of craft is not suited to the commerce 
from the Islands to Europe, any more than the large ones are 
from America to the Islands. It follows, that if the Islands 
are to be supplied by the intervention of large vessels from 
Europe, the price of the supplies will be increased, and the 
prosperity of the Islands, and the value of their commerce to 
France, proportionately diminished. 

This may be illustrated by an example. The produce 
shipped directly from America to Europe employs many more 
vessels, than are wanted to bring back articles from Europe to 
America. Two hundred large ships are required to transport 
the tobacco from the Chesapeake, and these two hundred are 
sufficient to bring the annual supplies from Europe for all 
America ; but tobacco does not employ more than one fifth of 
the shipping engaged in the commerce between America and 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 263 

Europe. It follows that a large portion of the returning ships 
come empty. And heretofore this has been so remarkably 
the case, in regard to the tobacco ships, that goods have been 
freighted from Great Britain for a mere trifle, and sometimes 
for nothing. 

It must be considered, also, that a voyage from France to 
the West Indies can be performed with great certainty in a 
given time, by reason of the tropical winds, but to the United 
States it will be more uncertain and longer. Of two vessels, 
therefore, sailing at the same time, one for the United States 
and the other for the Islands, the expenses of the former at 
the end of the voyage, taking into consideration the risk of the 
ship, the crew, repairs, and provisions, will exceed those of 
the latter in the amount of one fourth of the cargo, which she 
is to receive in the United States for the Islands, and still she 
has another voyage to perform before she arrives at the point 
of destination. The result is, that the price of supplies thus 
carried to the Islands, is enhanced, at least one fourth, beyond 
what it would be, if the same supplies were transported direct- 
ly from the United States in American bottoms. This ex- 
pense must be borne by the merchant, who fits out the ship, 
or the planter who consumes the produce, and it yields no re- 
turns to anybody. 

But allow a free competition, and this expense will not be 
incurred at all ; in other words, no merchant will send a ship 
from Europe to take American produce to the Islands. For 
the same reason, no one will send a ship from the United 
States to the Islands, for the purpose of taking freight there for 
Europe, and returning thence to America. The circle is the 
same, let it commence at whatever point it may. And this is 
a conclusive answer to the objection, that if the trade is thrown 
open to the Americans, they will take away more produce 
than their own market demands, and become the carriers from 
the Islands to Europe. Natural causes prevent it. Moreover, 
if it is hoped or expected to increase the number of French 
seamen, by undue restrictions on the colonial commerce, the 



264 



LIFE OF 



end will be defeated by the very means used to attain it; foe, 
if a free trade be allowed, tbe produce of the Islands will 
become so much more abundant, that, after deducting all that 
can possibly be carried away by Americans, there must still 
remain such a surplus, as will require a great increase of 
French shipping to take it to Europe. 

Such is a summary of the facts and reasonings used to con- 
vince the French Minister, that the restrictive policy of his 
government was founded on erroneous principles, and that a 
system of free trade, between the French West India Islands 
and the United States, would be mutually advantageous to 
the two nations.

CHASTELLUX. PAMPHLET ON THE BANK. MR MORKls's PLAN OF A 

NEW COINAGE. PURCHASES THE ESTATE OF MORRISAMA. 

THE preliminary articles of peace having been signed, and 
hostilities suspended, Mr Morris returned to New York, and 
visited his mother at Morrisania, after an absence of almost 
seven years. He writes to Mr Robert Morris ; ' I arrived at 
this place last evening, in company with my uncle, and after 
making a dinner at six o'clock we drank your health in Cape 
wine, which has stood on a shelf in this house twenty years to 
my knowledge, and how much longer I know not. We will 
drink no more of it, but leave the remnant till you and Mrs 
Morris can accompany me hither.' He reached home in sea- 
son to advise arid assist his mother, in presenting her claims 
for depredations committed at Morrisania by the British army 
during the war. The estate was within the British lines, and 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 265 

when the army first came to New York, they took from it 
sixty-five head of horned cattle, ninety four sheep, and other 
provisions, ilnd in the course of the war, the timber had been 
cut on four hundred and seventy acres of woodland, and used 
for various purposes of ship-building, artillery, and fire-wood. 
Colonel de Lancey's regiment of refugees was also stationed 
there, for nearly two years, erected above seventy huts in 
which they dwelt, cultivating the land in the mean time, and 
cutting the wood for fuel. 

Papers and affidavits certifying .all these particulars, with 
estimates of the damages, were presented to the British board 
of claims, who examined them, and reported that the facts 
were proved and the charges reasonable, and that, as the tim- 
ber and other articles had been used in his Majesty's service, 
the claimant ought to be paid to the full amount of her de- 
mands. It is but just to add, that the records of these trans- 
actions show the British commander, and the ether officers 
concerned, to have acted apparently on principles honorable 
and generous. The clnim, amounting to rrore than eight 
thousand pounds, was sent to England and entrusted for col- 
lection to General Staats Long Morris, but it was not paid 
during Mrs Morris's lifetime. 

The war being now over, Mr Morris retired from the office 
of Assistant Fnancier, and betook himself anew to the practice 
of the law, which indeed he had never entirely given up. It 
was his intention at first to return to New York, and establish 
hi.nself in that city, but various ties of business kept him in 
Philadelphia, which may be considered his permanent place of 
re deuce from this time till he went to Europe, five years 
afterwards. He was more or less associated with Robert 
Morris, in his mercantile affairs and other speculations, some- 
times acting as his agent, at others devising plans of new 
adventure, voyages at sea, purchases of stocks, of lands, or any 
other projects, which promised successful results, good profits, 
and the means of accumulating property. By their long inti- 
macy they had acquired a perfect knowledge of each other's 
VOL. i. 23 



266 LIFE OF 

character, which, strengthened by a mutual confidence, enabled 
them to co-operate with double effect in executing the splen- 
did schemes of enterprise, which marked the career both pri- 
vate and public of the great American financier. 

Mr Morris's correspondence with his friends was still con- 
tinued, though with less frequency and less point, as the topics 
of keen excitement after the peace were diminished in number 
and interest. To Mr Jay, who was still in Europe, he wrote 
on the tenth of January, 1784. 

' I was lately in New York, and have the pleasure to tell 
you, that all your friends were well. Things there are now in 
that kind of ferment, which was rationally to be expected, and 
I think the superior advantages of our constitution will now 
appear, in the repressing of those turbulent spirits, who wish 
for confusion, because in the regular order of things they can 
only fill a subordinate sphere. 

' This country has never yet been known to Europe, and 
God knows whether it ever will be so. To England it is less 
known, than to any other part of Europe, because they con- 
stantly view it through a medium either of prejudice or of fac- 
tion. True it is, that the general government wants energy, 
and equally true it is, that this want will eventually be sup- 
plied. A national spirit is the natural result of national exist- 
ence, and although some of the present generation may feel 
colonial oppositions of opinion, yet this generation will die 
away and give place to a race of Americans. On this occa- 
sion, as on others, Great Britain is our best friend, and by 
seizing the critical moment when we were about to divide, she 
has shown clearly the dreadful consequences of division. 
You will find, that the States are coming into resolutions on the 
subject of commerce, which, if they had been proposed by 
Congress on the plain reason of the thing, would have been 
rejected with resentment and perhaps contempt. 

'With respect to our taste for luxury, do not grieve about it. 
Luxury is not so bad a thing as it is often supposed to be, and 
if it were so, still we must follow the course of things, and 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 267 

turn to advantage what exists, since we have not the power 
either to annihilate or create. The very definition of luxury is 
as difficult as the suppression of it, and if I were to declare 
my serious opinion, it is, that there is a less proportion of 
rogues in coaches than out of them. 

' Do not condemn us till you see us. Do not ask the Brit- 
ish to take off their foolish restrictions. Let them alone, and 
they will be obliged to do it of themselves. While the pre- 
sent regulation exists, it does us more political good, than it 
can possibly do commercial mischief.' 

The news of the signature of the definitive treaty of peace 
produced in different parts of the country demonstrations of 
joy, in the various displays of illuminations, fire-works, shows, 
and the like, to which people are wont to resort in expressing 
their delight at any felicitous public event. Mr Morris sent 
to his friend Hamilton a description of the efforts in this way 
at Philadelphia. 

' I arrived here on Thursday evening, after a mighty dijsa- 
greeable ride, and a mighty whimsical accident in crossing the 
Delaware, the particulars of which I shall reserve till we meet. 
As I promised to write you the politics and news of Philadel- 
phia, I will do it this day ; for the snow storm rages so inces- 
santly, that I cannot go abroad. This you will say bodes a 
long letter, and I fear you will not be mistaken. 

'I would entertain you with a splendid account of those illu- 
minations and fire-works, which, if we may believe the Phila- 
delphia newspapers, were to have been the most brilliant im- 
aginable, but I arrived too late, and only know by hearsay 
the accident, which happened to them, and which you may 
know too by consulting the newspapers. The exhibition 
would have been perfectly rediculous, but for the death of one 
spectator, and the wounds of others. These are subjects on 
which pleasantry is misplaced. I have been however to see 
the place, which was to have been the most splendid of all 
possible places, and truly if the projectors had intended to firo 
this city, it was as ingenious invention. Only think of a 



268 LIFE OF 

large wooden stage, raised in the middle of a street, to hang 
canvass on, with a number of lamps on the inside, and no pre- 
cautions against the flames. You will perhaps be curious, as 
I was, to know what put it into their heads. The account 
I received is to this effect. The quakers, who have more 
than one reason for not illuminating their houses, and some 
others who have, on this occasion, at least one reason for the 
same thing, wished to save both their glass and their princi- 
ples. But how was this to be brought about, without offend- 
ing certain persons, whose whiggism consists in abusing the 
tories? The President, who is said to be clever at expedi- 
ents, undertook the task. In order to secure the aforesaid 
whigs, a man was employed to prepare decorations and devi- 
ces for the triumphal arch, and to superintend the expenditure 
of the sum of six hundred pounds, appropriated by government 
to the splendid exhibition. At the same time, all illuminations 
were forbidden, and, by a wise foresight, squibs were also pro- 
hibited. This you see is the age of coalitions ; and so, bless- 
ed be the peace-makers. 

' A man, who arrives in this city from New York, beholds a 
scene as perfectly new, as if he went to the Mogul's domin- 
ions. The Philadelphians, long famous for their progress in 
the arts, have already completed what we have but just begun. 
For the violent whigs and the violent tories, who turned their 
backs upon everybody else about two years ago, have each 
performed a semicircle, and met at the opposite point. You 
know the present influenza is the banko-mania, and this day's 
newspapers "give us the plan of the intended Pennsylvania, 
or, as some call it, Coalition Bank.' 

The remainder of the long letter, with which he threatened 
his friend, is taken up in details about the proposed bank, 
and the persons designated to be the directors. This bank, 
by the way, caused him no little trouble and labor. It threat- 
ened to be a rival of his favorite Bank of North America. 
The leaders of the project petitioned the legislature of Penn- 
sylvania for a charter. This alarmed the directors of the old 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 269 

bank, and they requested to be heard before the legislature in 
opposition to the petitioners. Mr Morris was made their coun- 
sel and advocate, and he entered the lists in debate with those 
members of the Assembly, who were for granting a charter 
to the new bank. The contest was warm and protracted, 
and he made two arguments, highly applauded at the time for el- 
oquence, ability, and the perfect knowledge of the subject, which 
they exhibited. It was on this occasion, that he apostrophized 
the shades of William Penn in a manner so extraordinary, that 
the heads of the audience were for the moment instinctively 
turned, as if to behold the ghost of the great founder of their 
republic entering the hall of legislation. The traditionary 
reminiscence of this event is still fresh in the minds of many 
persons in Philadelphia. 

Before quoting a letter written on the eighteenth of June, 
1784, to Mr Peter Van Schaack, then in London, it may be 
premised, that this gentleman was a refugee from New York, 
who had been in England several years, but had left his 
country under circumstances that claimed the strong sympathy 
of his early friends, whom the caprices and the unbending rigor 
of war had made his political enemies. Mr Van Schaack was 
in sentiment opposed to the American Revolution, but he took 
no part on either side. By an act of the legislature of New 
York, however, he was numbered among the enemies of his 
country, on the broad, politic, and perhaps equitable principle, 
that in war whoever is not a friend is an enemy. By this 
act he was obliged to flee from his country. 

When peace was again restored, and it was no longer trea- 
sonable to be detected in writing to a tory, the correspondence 
between these two friends was renewed, apparently by Mr 
Van Schaack in a letter from London, to which the one from 
Mr Morris, about to be quoted, was a reply. His liberal senti- 
ments, his humane and generous feelings, as expressed in this 
reply, cannot but meet with a responsive acquiescence in 
every benevolent heart. The contest was over, the wild hor- 
rors of war had ceased, the causes of acrimony were swal- 
23* 



270 LIFE OV 

lowed up in the successful issue of events, and why remem- 
ber any longer the errors, or even the offences of those, whom 
a painful experience had convinced of their waywardness, and 
who, in the humility of defeated expectation, or deferred re- 
pentance, now asked the slender boon of breathing their na- 
tive air, and ending their days in the land that had given 
them existence? Magnanimity is sometimes a nobler virtue 
than justice, and the emotions of sympathy do more to hu- 
manize the heart, than the stern precepts of law, or the cold 
maxims of political expediency. 

' I perfectly coincide with you in opinion,' says Mr Mor- 
ris to his refugee friend, ' that America is the country in the 
world, whose social state admits of the greatest portion of 
happiness. Such being my sentiment, I have commisserated 
the fate of those, who are exiled from among us. My po- 
litical ideas, also, are far from lessening the regret, because 
I see no necessity for the measure. Were this a mon- 
archy, 1 would subscribe to it fully, because the reigning and 
the deposed families must each have hereditary friendships 
and antipathies among the people, but in a republic it can- 
not be so. The metaphysical idea of the state does not so 
inhere in any particular body, as to give room for an exercise 
of the dissocial feelings. We may love the country, though 
we hate the king, but it is not in nature to hate the country, 
nor can we long dislike the government, when that government 
is ourselves. With a very few exceptions, therefore, of old and 
powerful enemies,*! would open wide the doors of that tem- 
ple, which we have reared to liberty, and, in consecrating an 
asylum to the persecuted of mankind, I would not exclude 
those, who first drew the vital air, and first saw the light in 
America.' 

Peace being established, the States began to set up new 
commercial regulations, and, as is natural ir such cases, each 
hnd an eye to its own interest?, with little regard to its neigh- 
bors, and less to its confederated head. What, with ignorance, 
cupidity, the love of exercising power, and the spirit of rival- 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 271 

ship, things soon ran into such a state of confusion, as threat- 
ened all sorts of disasters to the republics severally, and to the 
Union. Pennsylvania, although staggering under the awkward 
burden of her ill balanced constitution, was not less venture- 
some in these experiments, than the other States. The mer- 
chants were little satisfied with the unpractised skill of the leg- 
islators, in their attempts at making laws for governing com- 
merce, and mercantile affairs. Mr Morris was on their side, 
in some sense indeed one of their number, and the memorials, 
remonstrances, petitions, and recommendations, which they 
presented from time to time to the legislature, usually flowed 
from his pen. 

Still continuing to give much attention to the commercial 
relations between France and the United States, and particu- 
larly in regard to the West India trade, he wrote two letters 
on that subject to the Marquis de Chastellux, which were 
shown to the French Ministry, and highly commended. In 
reply to them, December 8th, 1784, M. de Chastellux says ; 

' Your letters have been communicated to M. le Marechal de 
Castries, Minister of Marine, who was delighted with them. 
He told me, and repeated it several times, that he had seen 
nothing superior, or more full of powerful thought, on the sub- 
ject of government and politics. He gave them to many of 
his friends to read, and I have been importuned for permission 
to take copies of them, which I have granted only to those, 
who were worthy of it. In one word, I have been congratula- 
ted on having such a friend in another hemisphere. There is 
enough, my dear Morris, to content you, if self love rather 
than love of country had guided your pen ; but your object 
was the good of your nation and of ours. 

' Have we secured this object by the measures we have tak- 
en ? 1 wish to have your opinion on this subject, though it 
would, perhaps, be easy forme to anticipate it. 1 do not send 
you the decrees of the Council, relative to your commerce with 
our colonies in the West Indies, because I doubt not you have 
received them, or that they will reach you at the same time 



LIFE or 

with this letter. You will see, that we have done more than 
the English, but we have done less than I wished. I was de- 
sirous that you should be permitted to take sugar, for I consid- 
er it hard to oblige you to come to Europe after ours, when 
you might receive it in return for such articles as we asked 
you to carry to our colonies. Yet notwithstanding these re- 
strictions, the French merchants, and especially those of Bor- 
deaux, complain bitterly. But we now know enough to make 
a distinction in regard to you, between the interests of com-

' I trust you will continue to communicate your opinions. 
They will be eagerly received here, particularly by our excel- 
lent Minister of Marine, who joins to very extensive knowledge, 
a love of truth, and zeal for the public good, which you republi- 
cans would be astonished to find in a monarchy, especially in 
a Court. Why should you not be surprised at it ? We are 
even much surprised in this country, to see how little harmony 
and union reign in your rising republic ; 1 should say your 
republics; and in employing this expression, I have perhaps 
explained all. I cannot dissemble with you, that the Ameri- 
cans do not rise in the opinion of Europeans. Till you order 
your confederation better, till you take measures in common 
to pay debts, which you contracted in common, till you have 
a form of government and a political influence, we shall not be 
satisfied with you on this side of the Atlantic. In expressing 
myself thus, I speak of the public in France ; for what nation, 
unless it be our own, has at this moment any interest in seeing 
you become powerful ? ' 

From January to the middle of July, 1785, he was in Vir- 
ginia, employed in affairs of business for Robert Morris, em- 
bracing a settlement of accounts with several persons, and 
other concerns of that nature, the details of which would have 
few attractions for a general reader. In latter years he was 
accustomed to look back upon this residence in Virginia, as 
among the most agreeable periods of bis life. 

Scarcely had he returned to Philadelphia, when he was 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 273 

called on again to defend the Bank of North America, a new 
attack having been made upon it from another quarter. Peti- 
tions, procured by party influence, were brought up to the 
legislature, praying for the abolition of the charter. One of 
the ablest performances of his pen is a pamphlet written on 
this occasion, developing the principles of the Bank, its pro- 
ceedings, and the great benefits derived from it to the public, 
answering at the same time, in a close and logical series of 
arguments, all the objections advanced against it. With the 
whole, is interwoven a view of banking operations in general, 
and their effects on the community. 

Soon after Mr Robert Morris had been placed at the head 
of the finance department, he was instructed by Congress to 
prepare a report on the foreign coins, then circulating in the 
United States. Accordingly, as early as January, 1782, a full 
exposition of this subject was made to Congress in a letter, 
which was officially sent in his name, but which Mr Jefferson 
says was written by the Assistant Financier, Gouverneur Morris, 
indeed, the estimates and calculations on which the letter is 
founded still exist in his handwriting. But the most curious 
and remarkable part of this report, was a new plan for an 
American coinage, which originated with Gouverneur Morris, 
and which in fact was the basis of the system afterwards adopt- 
ed and now in use. The following extracts contain the hints 
as they were first struck out. 

' In order that a coin may be perfectly intelligible to the 
whole people, it must have some affinity to the former curren-' 
cy. This, therefore, will be requisite in the present case. 
The purposes of commerce require, that the lowest divisible 
point of money, or what is more properly called the money 
unit, should be very small, because by that means, price can 
be brought in the smallest things to bear a proportion to the 
value. And although it is not absolutely necessary, yet it is 
very desirable, that money should be increased in decimal 
ratio, because by that means all calculations of interest, 
exchange, insurance, and the like, are rendered much more 



274 LIFE OF 

simple and accurate, and of course, more within the power of 
the great mass of the people. Wherever such things require 
much labor, time, and reflection, the greater number, who 
do not know, are made the dupes of the smaller number who 
do. 

* The various coins, which have circulated in America, have 
undergone different changes in their value, so that there is 
hardly any which can be considered as a general standard, 
unless it be Spanish dollars. These pass in Georgia at five 
shillings, in North Carolina and New York at eight shillings, 
in Virginia and the four Eastern States at six shillings, and in 
all the other States, excepting South Carolina, at seven shil- 
lings and sixpence, and in South Carolina at thirty-two shil- 
lings and sixpence. The money unit of a new coin to agree, 
without a fraction, with all these different values of a dollar, 
excepting the last, will be the fourteen hundred and fortieth 
part of a dollar, equal to the sixteen hundredth part of a 
crown. Of these units, twenty-four will be a penny of Geor- 
gia, fifteen will be a penny of North Carolina or New York, 
twenty will be a penny of Virginia and the four Eastern 
States, sixteen will be a penny of all the other States, except- 
ing South Carolina, and forty-eight will be thirteen pence of 
South Carolina. 

' It has already been observed, that to have the money unit 
very small, is advantageous to commerce ; but there is no ne- 
cessity, that this money unit be exactly represented in coin ; 
it is sufficient that its value be precisely known. On the 
present occasion, two copper coins will be proper, the one of 
eight units, and the other of five. These may be called an 
Eight, and a Five. Two of the former will make a penny. 
Proclamation or Pennsylvania money, and three a penny 
Georgia money. Of the latter, three will make a penny New 
York money, and four a penny lawful, or Virginia money. 
The money unit will be equal to a quarter of a grain of fine 
silver in coined money. Proceeding thence in a decimal 
ratio, one hundred would be the lowest silver coin, and might 



WOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 275 

be called a Cent. It would contain twenty-five grains of fine 
silver, to which may be added two grains of copper, and the 
whole would weigh one pennyweight and three grains. Five 
of these would make a Quint, or five hundred units, weighing 
five pennyweight and fifteen grains ; and ten would make a 
Mark, or one thousand units, weighing eleven pennyweight 
and six grains.'* 



* See Diplomatic Correspondence of the American Revolution, Vol. xii. 
p. 91. 

It may be proper to subjoin the elements of the letter here quoted, 
as extracted from Mr Morris's manuscripts of that date. He proposed 
the following table of currency ; 

One crown, or ten dollars, equal to 10,000 

One dollar, or ten bills, equal to ..... 1,000 
One bill, or ten pence, equal to - - - - - ICO 

One penny, or ten quarters, equal to 10 

One quarter, equal to --- 1 

The value of the quarter is equal to a quarter of a grain of pure sil- 
ver, or one fourteen hundred and fortieth part of a Spanish dollar. 

This was his first plan of a new coinage, founded on the principle of 
decimals and a money unit. The larger piece, or crown, was to be of 
gold ; the next, or dollar, of silver. He proposed, also, that for conve- 
nience there should be other coins struck, besides those here designa- 
ted, but that each should contain a precise number of the money unit. 
' The advantages of the coin here proposed,' he adds, ' are first, that 
none other will effect the object of banishing other currencies, because 
this alone applies without fractions to them all. 

' Secondly, the minuteness of its lower denominations will render it 
an accurate measure of the smallest variations of quantity, or quality, 
in any commodity. 

'Thirdly, the decimal proportion of its parts will render all calcula- 
tions in it easy. 

' Fourthly, few figures will be used for the largest sums, while at the 
same time the smallest sums will be Comprehended. 

'Lastly, as to the names above chosen, they, like all other names, are 
arbitrary, and perhaps better may be substituted. The word croton 
occurred, fiom the following idea of an impression fora gold coin ; viz. 
An Indian, with his bow in his left hand, and in his right hand thir- 
teen arrows, and his right foot on a crown ; the inscription, manus 
rimica tyrannis. 



276 LIFE OP 

Notwithstanding this subject was discu^ed from time to time 
in Congress, nothing was decided about it for several years. 
Mr Jefferson was appointed one of a committee in 1784, for 
considering the coinage. He examined Mr Morris's scheme, 
allowed it to be ingenious, and in its general principles the best 
that could be devised. 

He did not accord with him, however, in regard to his mon- 
ey unit, believing it to be too small for convenience, if not for 
practicability. It required so many figures to express small 
amounts, that it was feared the people would never be able to 
adopt it, and if they should, the evil itself would not be re- 
moved. Whoever should make a purchase amounting to a 
quarter of a dollar, for instance, would pay for it three hundred 
and sixty units, and however the coins might be subdivided as 
to size, this mode of expression must adhere to their value. 
In writing large sums in figures, the same inconvenience would 
occur to a much greater extent. A hundred dollars, instead 
of being noted by three figures, would be expressed by a hun- 
dred and forty-four thousand units, and require six figures. 

To get rid of these obstacles, Mr Jefferson hit upon the 
dollar as a money unit, and applied to it Mr Morris's plan 
of decimal notation. He recommended it to Congress, in a 
paper explaining its advantages. In that state the subject re- 
mained for more than a year, till at length, in August, 1785, it 
was resolved, that the dollar should be the money unit of the 
United States, and the pieces of coin should be in a decimal 
ratio. But as yet there was no mint, and of course no coins 
were struck. A Committee of Congress had the business of 
coining in hand, but slow progress was made, and it was not 
till August of the next year, that the names and character of 
the coins were decided upon, and the way opened for estab- 
lishing a mint. The first ordinance, however, about the unit 
and decimal ratio had gone into partial operation. 

Meantime, while the committee were investigating the 
matter, Mr Morris wrote a letter to Dr Ramsay, then a mem- 
ber of the board, urging his plan anew, and adding some modi- 



GOUVERNEDR MORRIS. 277' 

fications, by which he contrived to escape from his troublesome 
unit, and to introduce a large one, which was to operate on a 
very ingenious principle, and to be free from all the objec- 
tions brought against the other. He took an arbitrary amount, 
without reference to any existing coin, which was to apply in 
its subdivisions to the currency of every State, and also to 
those of England and France. His idea was to have a 
money of account, and a money of coinage, the former to be 
used in mercantile transactions and book accounts, and the 
latter to pass PS a currency. He adhered to the decimal di- 
visions, and fashioned the coins of such a size, that they 
would adapt themselves without a fraction to the money of ac- 
count.* 

The great advantage, which he expected from this plan, 
was to introduce the new coinage and mode of reckoning easi- 
ly into all the States, which he did not believe could be effect- 



* He assumed for his Unit an amount equal to twelve shillings and 
six pence sterling, which he called a pound, making this divisable by 
ten, and giving the names of pounds, shillings, pence, and doits to the 
several divisions ; thus, 

One pound is equal to T ----- 1,000 

One shilling equal to------- 100 

One penny equal to------- 10 

One doit equal to------- - 1 

Now the money of all the States, reduced to pence, may be expressed 
in this doit w' hout a remainder. For example, in the New England 
currency five doits make a penny. Hence 10 19 5, reduced to 
pence, are equal to 2,633, which, multiplied by 5, give 13,165 doits, or 
13 pounds and 165 doits of the new reckoning; or 13 pounds, 1 shil- 
ling, 6 nence, 5 doits. By an easy proctss the same result will follow 
with all the old currencies of the Stat. -s ; that is, any sum in pence 
may be reduced to doits without a fractional remainder, which 13 
rarely the case with the cents now in use. The above unit is there- 
fore taken, on account of its being susceptible of this division. 

It will be seen, that, by omitting the names of shillings and pence, 

the mode of reckoning will be by dollars and doits, precisely like the 

present mode of dollars and cents, except that the place of doits takes 

three f'.gt ires instead of two. By rejecting the last figure, as we now 

VOL. i. 24 



278 LIFE OF 

ed by taking the dollar for the unit. To this latter scheme 
he states several objections. 

1 The proposed penny, (cent) or hundredth part of a dol- 
lar,' he observes, ' will not apply to any currency in America. 
It will be a British halfpenny, and, calculating accurately, nine 
of them make eight pence of New York currency, six make 
five pence of Pennsylvania currency, three make two pence of 
New England and Virginia, nine make five pence of Georgia, 
and twenty-seven make fourteen pence of South Carolina. 
Nay, the dollar itself will be a fractional sum, when compared 
with present currencies. This then being the case, it is be- 
yond rny comprehension, that the people of America should 
abandon their present local money, to adopt the proposed gen- 
eral money, which bears an accurate relation to no other than 
the currency of Great Britain. 

* Let us suppose a merchant, desirous of adopting the plan 
of Congress, pays a laborer nine pence. Is this to be charged 
to his correspondent ? It so happens, that, let him reside in 
any one of these States, he could not enter that sum on his 
books, should he open them in the new money. We cannot 



do the mills in common calculations, the reckoning would then stand 
in dollars and pence, and be exactly the same as the present mode. 

The table of coins proposed in connexion with this system of reck- 
oning was as follows. 

Crown, of gold, ----- value 1,200 doits 

Halfcrown 600 

Dollar, of silver - - 300 

Shilling 100 

Groat 20 

Doit, of copper -- ] 

These coins were chosen for a double purpose ; viz. their conve- 
nient size, and their moariures of weight and of the values of the old 
currency. Each coin weighs an exact [number of grains, without a 
fraction, and its value in this respect might thus he easily proved. 
Each one is an expression of an exact number of pence in the old 
currencies of the States : as well as in that of England, and in the ii- 
vres and sous of France. They are all, moreover, decimal parts of 
the new unit, and thus adapted to the money. of account. 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 279 

expect the common people, with whom the merchant must 
deal, will take the lead, and at once conform to a plan, which, 
simplify it as we may, they at least cannot comprehend. 
Some persons must begin, and who are to be the first? I 
answer the merchants. Now should it be rendered impracti- 
cable to them, they will not attempt it. But, as the merchant 
must in the first instance conform to the ideas of the common 
people in money matters, so the rest of the community must 
eventually conform to -the merchant. This we know by ex- 
perience, and therefore his convenience should be consulted 
by government, if they wish the plan to succeed. 

1 Indeed, were government about to institute a manufactory 
of scythes, we should expect that they would choose such as 
would be convenient to the mowers of America, though per- 
haps longer or shorter than are used in Switzerland. In like 
manner, it might be prudent for the money manufacturers to 
make such coins, as would suit the American merchants, 
though it might not square precisely with the currency of Lon- 
don or Amsterdam. The idea of a piece of silver worth one 
hundred coppers is easily comprehended. It is simple enough, 
and I have heard it said, that nice calculations on this subject 
are abstruse and unnecessary, for merchants might easily com- 
ply by rejecting the fractions. This also is easy and simple, 
and in a negotiation for a pennyworth of apples or nuts might 
answer, but if we take that unnecessary trouble of calculating, 
we shall find the rejection of these fractions would exceed five 
per cent, which merchants consider as a full compensation for 
much labor and some risk. To make a money, which in- 
volves the assumption and rejection of fractions, is a paraphrase 
on the bed of Procrustes. ' If the patient is too short for the 
bed, stretch him ; if too long, clip him.' 

These arguments, however plausible and in some respects 
cogent, did not bring Congress over to his views. They ad- 
hered to Mr Jefferson's unit, and the coinage was established 
upon that basis. 

But there are evidently two sides to the question, and it 



280 LIFE OF 

may not be easy even now to decide, which system was the 
best to attain the end desired in the shortest time. As to the 
ultimate convenience, they would both have come to nearly 
the same thing. The primary object was to establish a uni- 
form mode of reckoning money in all parts of the union ; the 
next, to introduce a coinage, which should drive the old coins 
out of the country, and supersede their use. According to Mr 
Morris's plan, this was to be done by an entire new coinage, 
and a system of reckoning, which should adapt itself with the 
greatest facility both to the old coins, and to the different sys- 
tems already in vogue. Mr Jefferson believed, that it would 
be more readily accomplished, by taking a standard coin, 
whose value the people well understood, and making it the 
basis of the new divisions and nomenclature. Everybody 
knew the value of a dollar, and could easily comprehend the 
parts of a dollar, let them be named as they might. 

Forty years of experiment have proved that the process 
has been slow. As yet it is far from being completed. The 
fractional remainders in converting the old currencies into the 
new, which were so much dreaded by Mr Morris, and which 
it was the first element in all his plans to evade, have present- 
ed the same obstacles that he anticipated. Many values in 
the old currencies cannot be expressed in the decimal parts of 
a dollar. Besides, two mischievous little coins of foreign 
growth, the eighth and sixteenth of a dollar, have kept their 
hold on the affections of the people, by reason of their being 
even parts of the adopted unit, although at variance with the 
decimal notation. Such is their power, that the government it- 
self is to this day obliged to yield obedience to it, in the trans- 
actions of the postoffice. As things now stand, it is time for 
this vassalage to be thrown off, and the rates of postage fixed 
in the decimals of a dollar. Let the people pay the fraction- 
al half or quarter cent, in deference to their money unit, till it 
becomes so well grounded, as to expel these disorganizing lit- 
tle foreigners from circulation. New coins of home manufac- 
ture, and a plenty of them, are the only aids that can be 



GOUVEBNEUK MOURIS. 

called in for such a purpose, and these will be feeble auxilia- 
ries, unless a stigma of some sort shall be attached to the intru- 
ders, from abroad. 

Mr Morris's mother had been more or less affected with ill- 
ness for several years, and she died in Januaiy, 1786. This 
event brought him to Morrisania, at which place and at New 
York he remained for two or three months. By his father's 
will, the estate at Morrisania and its appendages were left to 
his mother during her lifetime. The property then devolved 
upon the second son, Staats Long Morris, who was a General 
in the British army, and resided in England. Lewis Morris, 
the eldest son, had received his portion before his father's death. 
A legacy of seven thousand pounds was to be paid by General 
Morris to the other children, before he could take possession 
of the estate, and of this sum Gouverneur Morris was to re- 
ceive two thousand pounds. 

General Morris also owned lands in New Jersey, and to 
settle the affairs of these estates he came to America. As he 
had no intention to reside there, he was of course willing to 
sell this property upon fair terms, and his brother Gouverneur 
resolved to make the purchase. The amount required was 
much above his means, but by the accommodation of friends, 
and convenient arrangements with his brother, he finally bought 
the patrimonial estate at Morrisania, and a part, if not all, of 
the General's lands in New Jersey, the contract being com- 
pleted before the end of the year. 

His business operations had already become extensive, and 
in several of them he was concerned with Robert Morris. 
Commercial adventures, and particularly an East India voyage 
on a large scale, shipments of tobacco from Virginia to France, 
and shares in iron works on the Delaware River, were among 
the objects of this kind, to which his time and thoughts were 
devoted, and by which his fortune was increased. As tha 
winter was approaching when he purchased the estate at 
Morrisania, he did not remain there long, but returned to 
Philadelphia.

CHAPTER XVII. 

CONVENTION FOR FORMING THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. 

MR MORRIS'S OPINIONS IN THAT BODY. MR MADISON'S LETTER. HAH 

ILTON. MR MORRIS VISITS VIRGINIA. PREPARES TO DEPART FOR EU- 
ROPE WASHINGTON. 

HAVING resided seven years in Pennsylvania, since he ceas- 
ed to be a member of Congress, he was considered a citizen, 
and was elected one of the delegates from that State to the 
Convention for forming the Constitution of the United States. 
The Convention assembled at Philadelphia in May, 1787, and 
continued together more than four months, before the Consti- 
tution was completed. Mr Morris was present during the 
whole time, except a few days in the last part of June, which 
he passed at Morrisania, being called there to arrange the af- 
fairs of his farm. He had employed a manager, and a large 
number of laborers in the spring, and was now commencing 
extensive improvements upon his estate, such as removing and 
repairing buildings, planting forest and fruit trees, and direct- 
ing various agricultural arrangements, which demanded his 
presence. As soon as he had effected a general supervision 
of these matters, and left full and minute written instructions 
with his manager, he went back and took his seat again in the 
Convention. 

As there is not a note or memorandum among his papers, 
indicating his acts in the Convention, very little can be said 
on that subject. In a letter to Colonel Pickering, written two 
years before his death, he remarks ; ' While I sat in the Con- 
vention, my mind was too much occupied by the intesests of 
our country, to keep notes of what we had done. Some gen- 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 283 

tlemen, I was told, passed their evenings in transcribing speech- 
es from short-hand minutes of the day. My faculties were 
on the stretch to further our business, remove impediments, 
obviate objections, and conciliate jarring opinions.' In sundry 
letters to his friends, contained in his published correspon- 
dence, and written after constitutional questions began to be 
much agitated in Congress, particularly one to Mr Walsh, he 
explains his views on those topics, and alludes to the proceed- 
ings of the Convention, but this only in general terms, and 
rather as an interpreter of its intentions, than a historian of its 
deeds. 

Thus destitute of written or printed materials on this sub- 
ject, I applied to Mr Madison, the only survivor of the list 
of worthies, who attended the Convention, and signed the great 
charter of union and freedom. The following are extracts of 
a letter to Mr Madison. 

' It is said by several persons, who profess to know the fact; 
that the Constitution in its present form and language is from 
the pen of Gouverneur Morris ; that, after all the debates were 
finished, and each part had been adopted in substance, the in- 
strument was put into his hands to be wrought into proper phra- 
seology and style. His friends are in the habit of thinking, 
that much is due to him for the clear, simple, and expressive 
language, in which the Constitution is clothed. 

1 The following anecdote is also current. While the Conven- 
tion was sitting, Mr Morris was absent for several days. On 
his return to Philadelphia, he called at the house of Robert 
Morris, where he found General Washington, who, as well as 
Robert Morris, was much dejected at what they regarded the 
deplorable state of things in the Convention. Debates had run 
high, conflicting opinions were obstinately adhered to, animos- 
ities were kindling, some of the members were threatening to go 
home, and, at this alarming crisis, a dissolution of the Conven- 
tion was hourly to be apprehended. Instructed in these par- 
ticulars, Gouverneur Morris went into the Convention on the 
day following, and spoke with such eloquence and power, on 



234 LIFE OF 

the necessity of union, of partial sacrifices and temperate dis- 
cussion, that he contributed much to work a change in the 
feelings of the members, which was the means of restoring 
harmony, and ultimately of attaining the objects of the Conven- 
tion. It is added, that, as his absence had prevented his par- 
taking of the warmth, which had been excited by the previous 
discussions, his counsel and coolness had the greater effect.' 

Concerning these points, and in reply to queries on others, 
Mr Madison wrote an answer, which every reader will be glad 
to see entire. 

Montpellier, April 8th, 1831. 

' Dear Sir, 

< I have duly received your letter of March 30th. In an- 
swer to your inquiries, " respecting the part acted by Gouver- 
neur Morris in the Federal Convention of 1787, and the polit- 
ical doctrines maintained by him," it may be justly said, that 
he was an able, an eloquent, and an active member, and 
shared largely in the discussions succeeding the 1st of July, 
previous to which, with the exception of a few of the early 
days, he was absent. 

' Whether he accorded precisely with the " political doctrines 
of Hamilton," I cannot say. He certainly did not " incline to 
the democratic side," and was very frank in avowing his opin- 
ions, when most at variance with those prevailing in the Con- 
vention. He did not propose any outline of a constitution, aj 
was done by Hamilton ; but contended for certain articles, (a 
Senate for life particularly) which he held essential to the sta- 
bility and energy of a government, capable of protecting the 
rights of property against the spirit of democracy. He wish- 
ed to make the weight of wealth balance that of numbers, 
which he pronounced to be the only effectual security to each, 
against the encroachments of the other. 

' The finish given to the style and arrangement of the Consti- 
tution fairly bejongs to the pen of Mr Morris ; the task having, 
probably, been handed over to him by the chairman of the 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 285 

Committee, himself a highly respectable member, and with 
the ready concurrence of the others. A better choice could 
not have been made, as the performance of the task proved. 
It is true, that the state of the materials, consisting of a report- 
ed draft in detail, and subsequent resolutions accurately 
penned, and falling easily into their proper places, was a good 
preparation for the symmetry and phraseology of the instrument, 
but there was sufficient room for the talents and taste stamped 
by the author on the face of it. The alterations made by the 
Committee are not recollected. They were not such, as to 
impair the merit of the composition. Those, verbal and oth- 
ers, made in the Convention, may be gathered from the Jour- 
nal, and will be found also to leave that merit altogether un- 
impaired. 

' The anecdote you mention may not be without a founda- 
tion, but not in the extent supposed. It is certain, that the 
return of Mr Morris (o the Convention was at a critical stage 
of its proceedings. The knot, felt as the Gordian one, was 
the question between the larger and the smaller States, on the 
rule of voting in the senatorial branch of the legislature; the 
latter claiming, the former opposing, the rule of equality. 
Great zeal and pertinacity had been shown on both sides, 
and an equal division of votes on the question had been reiter- 
ated and prolonged, till it had become not only distressing, but 
seriously alarming. It was during that period of gloom, that 
Dr Franklin made the proposition for a religious service in 
the Convention, an account of which was so erroneously given, 
with every semblance of authenticity, through the National In- 
telligencer, several years ago. The crisis was not over, when 
Mr Morris is said to have had an interview and conversation 
with General Washington and Mr Robert Morris, such as may 
well have occurred. But it appears that, on the day of his re- 
entering the Convention, a proposition had been made from 
another quarter to refer the knotty question to a Committee, 
with a view to some compromise, the indications being mani- 
fest, that sundry members from the larger States were relaxing 



286 L.IFE OF 

in their opposition, and that some ground of compromise was 
contemplated, such as finally took place, and as may be seen 
in the printed Journal. Mr Morris was in the deputation from 
the large State of Pennsylvania, and combated the compromise 
throughout. The tradition is, however, correct, that, on the 
day of his resuming his seat, he entered with anxious feelings 
into the debate, and, in one of his speeches, painted the conse- 
quences of an abortive result to the Convention, in all the deep 
colors suited to the occasion. But it is not believed, that 
any material influence on the turn, which things took, could be 
ascribed to his efforts. For, besides the mingling with them 
some of his most disrelished ideas, the topics of his eloquent 
appeals to the members hr.d been exhausted during his absence, 
and their minds were too much made up, to be susceptible of 
new impressions. 

{ It is but due to Mr Morris to remark, that, o the brilliancy 
of his genius, he added, what is too rare, a candid surrender 
of his opinions, when the lights of discussion satisfied him } that 
they had been too hastily formed, and a readiness to aid in 
making the best of measures in which he had been overruled.

fidence in the discretion with which it will be used, than in its

'JAMES MADISON.' 

In Yates's minutes of the Convention there is a brief report 
of a speech, which was made by Mr Morris on the second of 
July, and in which sentiments are advanced in accordance 
with those above ascribed to him by Mr Madison. He fol- 
lowed Roger Sherman, who had just said, ' it seems we have 
got to a point, where we cannot move one way or the other.' 
Mr Morris avowed himself the advocate of a 'strong govern- 
ment,' but admitted that the aristocratic tendency of wealth

Ought to bo guarded. The House of Representatives, as ori- 
ginating from the people, he thought would be subject to 
precipitancy, changeableness, and excess, which could be 
checked only by virtue and ability in the Senate. For this 
reason, he would have the Senate composed of men possessing 
large property, whose pride would be enlisted in support of 
their consistency and permanency, and who, to make them 
completely independent, should be appointed for life. 

He allowed that examples from history proved wealth to 
incline naturally to tyranny ; power always seeks to enlarge its 
bounds and fortify itself ; but he oe'ieved this aristocratic fea- 
ture of the Senate would be balanced by the democratic 
branch, and that together they would secure the stability of the 
government. Vacancies in the Senate he thought should be 
filled by the executive, for if the Senators were chosen either 
by the people, or any othe^ mode of election by the States, they 
would not be a sufficient check upon the representative 
branch, they would partake too much of the same character, 
be imbrued with local and State prejudices, and overlook the 
general government, which it ought to be their special province 
to strengthen and uphold. 

It had been proposed, that the Senators should be incapable 
of holding any office under the national government. To this 
idea he objected. He would give them every inducement to 
take an interest in the government, as a means of making 
them more attentive to its welfare, and bringing their weight 
to act in the scale of its confederated powers. 

Whatever may have been Mr Morris's opinions in the Con- 
vention, and however he may have approved or disapproved 
parts of the Constitution, it can be affirmed in his praise, that 
no one put his name to the wnole instrument with a more 
willing mind, or felt a livelier concern as to its final success 
with the people, or was more zealous in all his after life to 
maintain its integrity, as the palladium of national freedom and 
happiness. In one of his letters he says, that Hamilton re- 
quested him to join the gifted trio in writing the ' Federalist.' 



288 LIFE OF 

Why he declined the proposal he does not tell, but it may be 
presumed, that the multiplicity and pressure of his private 
affairs at that time absorbed his whole attention, and left him 
no leisure to engage, in elaborate compositions. 

It must be confessed, however, and it is a tribute due to so 
rare an instance of public virtue, that, after the Constitution 
had passed the ordeal of the Convention, no one exhibited a 
more illustrious example of disinterestedness and patriotism, 
sacrifices and effort, than Hamilton. He had presented a plan 
of his own, which differed radically from the one that was car- 
ried through ; he labored long and hard, with the full force of 
his mind and eloquence, to impress his convictions on others ; 
his character as a statesman, and as an accurate observer and 
judge of human events, was pledged on the side of his faith 
and predictions ; but all in vain, the current set against him, 
and was resistless. Yet, with a nobleness of spirit seldom seen 
on similar occasions, he rose above defeat, saorinsed the pride 
of opinion on the altar of public good, signed the Constitution, 
and was ever afterwards in the very front ranks of its ablest 
defenders. 

As soon as the Convention had dissolved, Mr Morris repair- 
ed to Morrisania, where he passed four or five weeks. On 
bis return to Philadelphia he wrote to General Washington. 

' Philadelphia, October 30th, 1787. 

1 Dear Sir, 

' Shortly after your departure from this place, I went to my 
farm, and returned hither last Sunday evening. Living out of 
the busy world, I had nothing to say worth your attention, or 
I should earlier have given you the trouble you must now ex- 
perience. Although not very inquisitive about political opin- 
ion, I have not been quite i, ttentive. The States eastward 
of New York appear to be almost unanimous in favor of the 
new Constitution, (for I make no account of the dissension in 
Rhode Island.) Their preachers are advocates for the adop- 
tion, and this circumstance, coinciding with the steady support 






GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 289 

of the property, and other abilities of the country, makes the 
current set strongly, and, I trust, inresistibly that way. 

' Jersey is so near unanimity in her favorable opinion, that we 
may count with certainty on something more than votes, should 
the state of affairs hereafter require the application of pointed 
arguments. New York, hemmed in between the warm friends 
of the Constitution, will not easily, unless supported by power- 
ful States, make any important struggle, even though her citi- 
zens were unanimous, which is by no means the case. Par- 
ties there are nearly balanced. If the assent, or dissent, ol 
the New York legislature were to decide OD the fate of Ameri- 
ca, there would still be a chance, though I believe the force; 
of government would preponderate, and effect a rejection. 
But the legislature c'-mnot assign to the people any good reason, 
for not trusting them with a decision on their own affairs, and 
must therefore agree to a convention. In the choice of a 
convention, it is not improbable that the federal party will 
prove strongest, for persons of very distinct and opposite in- 
terests have joined on this subject. 

'With respect to this State, I am far from being decided in 
my opinion, that they will consent. True it is, that the city 
and its neighborhood are enthusiastic in the cause, but I dread 
the cold and sour temper of the, back counties, and still more 
the wicked industry of those, who have long habituated them- 
selves to live ou the public, and cannot bear the idea of being- 
removed from the power and profit of State government, which 
has been and still is the means of supporting themselves, their 
families, and dependants, and (which perhaps is equally 
grateful) of depressing and humbling their political adversa- 
ries. What opinions prevail more southward I cannot guess. 
You are in a better condition, than any other person, to judge 
of a great and important part of that country. 

' I have observed, that your name to the new Constitution 
has been of infinite service. Indeed, I am convinced, that if 
you had not attended the Convention, and the same paper had 
been handed out to the world, it would have met with a colder 
VOL. i. 25 



290 LIFE OF 

reception, with fewer and weaker advocates, and with more 
and more strenuous opponents. As it is, should the idea pre- 
vail, that you will not accept of the Presidency, it would prove 
fatal in many parts. The truth is, that your great and decid- 
ed superiority leads men willingly to put you in a place, 
which will not add to your personal dignity, nor raise you 
higher than you already stand. But they would not readily 
put any other person in the same situation, because they feel 
the elevation of others, as operating by comparison the degra- 
dation of themselves, and, however absurd this idea may be, 
yet you will agree with me, that men must be treated as men, 
and not as machines, much less as philosophers, and least of all 
things as reasonable creatures, seeing that in effect they reason 
not to direct, but to excuse, their conduct. 

' Thus much for the public opinion on these subjects, which 
is not to be neglected in a country where opinion is every- 
thing. I am, &,c. 

' GOUVERNEUR MoRRIS.' 

Business now called Mr Morris a second time to Virginia, 
where he remained, during the larger portion of the winter and 
spring, superintending the mercantile affairs of Robert Morris, 
in which he was himself also partly concerned. Large con- 
tracts had been entered into by Robert Morris for supplying 
tobacco in France, and as Virginia was the theatre of that 
traffic, it was necessary to have an agent there, who under- 
stood the business, and who was qualified to arrange some 
important matters, that had got into disorder, and caused un- 
easiness among the purchasers in Europe. While in Virginia 
he wrote a letter to a gentleman in France, containing a para- 
graph on the political state of affairs. 

' You will long ere this have seen the Constitution propos- 
ed for the United States. This paper has been the subject of 
infinite investigation, disputation, and declamation. While some 
have boasted it as a work from Heaven, others have given it a 
less righteous origin, I have many reasons to believe, that it 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 291 

was the work of plain honest men, and such, I think, it will 
appear. Faulty it must be, for what is perfect ? But if adopt- 
ed, experience will, I believe, show, that its faults are just the 
reverse of what they are supposed to be. As yet, this paper 
is but a dead letter. Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, 
Connecticut, and Georgia have adopted it. We wait impa- 
tiently the result of their deliberations in Massachusetts. 
Should that State also adopt it, which I hope and believe, 
there will then be little doubt of a general acquiescence, but 
otherwise it may be a tedious and difficult business. Should 
it, however, take effect, the affairs of this country will put on 
a much better aspect, than they have yet worn, and Ame- 
rica will soon be as much respected abroad, as she has for 
some time past been disregarded.' 

The time at length arrived, when he was soon to sail for 
Europe, and he wrote to General Washington for letters of 
introduction. 

' Morrisania, November 12th, 1788. 

'Dear General, 

' After many unforeseen delays, I am about shortly to take 
my departure from Philadelphia for the kingdom of France, 
and I expect to visit both Holland and England. When I 
desire to be favored with your commands, it is not the mere 
ceremonious form of words, which you may every day meet 
from every man you meet, and which you know better than 
any man how to estimate at its true value. Whether I can be 
useful to you in any way, I know not ; but this I know, that 
you may command my best endeavors. And I now desist 
from farther profession on that subject, because I am sure you 
know my sincerity. 

' You will oblige me by giving me letters of introduction to 
those persons, who may in your opinion be useful to me, and 
to whom you may think it proper to present me. Among oth- 
ers to Mr Jefferson, witli whom I have only a slight acquaint- 
ance. I believe I once mentioned to you my wish, not to be 
encumbered with the letters introductory of the many, who 



'292 LIFE OF 

are prone to give them. I think them a kind of paper money ; 
which is not only of little value, but which is not always a repu- 
table, though a legal tender. I solicit yours, as an undoubted 
bill of exchange, which is gold wherever it goes. Permit me, 
however, to pursue the mercantile phrase, or metaphor, and 
honestly to request that you do not give me credit for more 
than I am worth, lest proving a bankrupt, you be called on by 
my creditors. 

' I will pray your care of the enclosed to Colonel Hum- 
phreys, who, I doubt not, is still with you, and will, I expect, 
come on with you in the spring. I promised you some 
Chinese pigs, a promise which I can perform only by halves ; 
but such as 1 have I will send you; and, to piece and patch 
the matter as well as I may, in company with the pigs shall 
be sent a pair of Chinese geese, which are really the foolish- 
est gee'sel ever beheld, for they choose all times for sitting but 
the spring, and one of them is now actually engaged in that 
business. 

'It would be degrading to the noble race of man, should I 
introduce politics after hogs and geese. This is a tolerable 
excuse for saying nothing, but the truth is I have nothing to 
say. I am of the breed of optimists, and believe that all will 
go well, for you will certainly be seated in the President's 
chair, and will, I am certain, when there greatly labor to pre- 
vent things from going ill. As to the rest, I heartily agree in 
the text, that " the wisdom of man is foolishness with God," 
having seen both fools and folly succeed in a most surprising 
manner. And the only key to such sort of success, that I 
ever met with, was in a sarcastic remark on three lawyers of 
New York; Smith given to the study of divinity, Alexander 
deep in mathematics, and C. deep in nothing. Smith, said the 
wag, is always in the clouds ; Alexander loses himself in 
angles and triangles ; the only sensible man at the bar is C. 
for he talks nonsense to a common jury. 

' Present, I pray you, my sincere respects to Mrs Washing- 
ton. It is my fervent wish, that neither she nor you may regret 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 293 

the shades of Mount Vernon. But this is more rny wish, than 
expectation, for I do not believe it possible for you to be more 
happily placed, at least if I may judge from what I saw and 
what 1 felt. I am yours, 

' GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.' 

In compliance with this request, General Washington sent 
him several letters of introduction to persons in England, 
France, and Holland. He likewise entrusted him with a 
commission to purchase in Paris a gold watch for his own use, 
{ not a small, trifling, nor a finical, ornamental one, but a watch 
well executed in point of workmanship, large and flat, with a 
plain, handsome key.' In regard to the Presidency, upon 
which Mr Morris had touched, he adds ; ' I have really very 
little leisure or inclination to enter on the discussion of a sub- 
ject so unpleasant to me. You may be persuaded, in the first 
place, that I hope the choice will not fall upon me ; and in the 
second, that, if it should, and I can with any degree of propri- 
ety decline, I shall certainly contrive to get rid of the accept- 
ance. But if, after all, a kind of inevitable necessity should 
impel me to a different fate, it will be time enough to yield to 
its impulse, when it can be no longer resisted.'

sen r on the eighteenth of December. It was a cheerless day, 
and the shores of his native country receded from his view, 
under an atmosphere darkened and chilled with snow, sleet, 
and hail. He kept a journal during the whole voyage, but 
like most journals at sea, M is little else than a record of the 
winds and w;ives, calms, gales, and storms. It establishes the 
certainty, however, that he had a most disagreeable winter 
passage of forty days, before the Henrietta entered the port of 
Havre. He remained there three days, detained by the civil- 
ities of friends and arrangements of business. One gentleman, 
in particular, beset him with his attentions. ' This must,' says 
he, ' certainly be a man of great wealth, great talents, and great 
integrity, for he has assured us of all this twenty times over. 
He has given me some advice gratis. He thinks it a great 
pity, that he is not Kin^, or Minister at least. France would 
then be well governed, for all her misfortunes flow from the 
ignorance and cupidity qf her rulers, who have done no one 
wise- act these thirty years, and the alliance with America is, 
it seems, the most foolish part of all her conduct.' 

IMr Morris arrived in Paris on ihe third of February, 1789, 
and the first persons he sought out were Mr Jefferson, at that 
time American Minister in France, and the Marquis de Lafay- 
ette. These gentlemen engaged him to dine the two succeed- 
ing days. Meantime he delivered his letters of introduction, 
looked out for lodgings, and prepared to establish himself for a 
residence of considerable duration in Paris. With Lafayette, 
of course, he had been well acquainted in America. After 
their first interview on the present occasion, he writes in his 
Diary ; ' Lafayette is full of politics ; he appears to be too repub- 
lican for the genius of his country.' In short, it is as well to 
premise at the outset, that, from the first day of his arrival ir 
France, Mr Morris showed very little cordiality of sentiment 
or feeling with the revolutionists; and although some "of his 
connexions of friendship were among the leaders of that party, 
yet his attachments soon ran into the other channel, and his 
intimate associates were- chiefly in the list of those, who aimed 






GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 295 

only at a moderate reform of the old system, but deprecated 
revolutionary projects and principles. This will appear so 
manifest at every step we take with him, that it is only neces- 
sary here to throw out the hint as a clue, which may conduct 
the reader to a proper understanding of his opinions, counsels, 
and acts, as they shall arise in our progress. 

In the family of Lafayette he was received with that frank 
and open-handed hospitality, those kind and unaffected civilities, 
which, from that day to this, have been bestowed upon every 
American, whose good fortune has given him an opportunity 
to participate them. Of these Mr Morris himself does not 
forget to make due acknowledgments. When he dined 
there, soon after his arrival, he might perhaps be allowed to 
feel flattered at a trifling incident mentioned in his Diary. 
' After dinner, one of M. de Lafayette's little daughters sang a 
song for me. It happened to be one of my own composition. 
Madame is a very agreeable good woman.' But he never 
would be reconciled to the politics of his friend. When 
Lafayette showed him a draft of the celebrated Declaration 
of Rights, which he first proposed to the National Assembly, 
Mr Morris writes ; ' I gave him my opinions, and suggested 
several amendments, tending to soften the high colored ex- 
pressions of freedom. It is not by sounding words, that revo- 
lutions are produced.' 

From the time of his first arrival in Paris, he kept a 
Diary of occurrences, so minute and full, that no abridgment, 
or analysis, can convey to the reader so good an idea of his 
life in that city, and his observations on passing events, as 
selections in his own language. In such a journal, there must 
of course be numerous unimportant particulars, which would 
neither merit the attention, nor contribute to the interest, of a 
general reader. Limits must also be prescribed, suitable to 
the compass of this memoir. Upon these principles, therefore, 
of comparative value and proportionate extent, the extracts 
will be made, in chronological order, without regard to a con- 
nexion between the topics treated ; for indeed the nature 



296 LIFE OF 

of the materials would render any attempt at such a con- 
nexion impracticable. 

The Diary seems to have been designed for his private use, 
rather as a register of his first impressions, and an aid to his 
reminiscences, than as containing memorials of permanent 
utility, or for the inspection of others. Candor and justice, 
therefore, will plead successfully with every reader to regard 
with indulgence the negligences, or other defects of style, which 
may be detected in writings of such a character. 

' March 1st. Sup with Madame de la Suse. A small psr- 
ty absorbed in Quinze. Monsieur de B. for want of something 
else to do, asks me many questions about America, in a man- 
ner which shows he cares little for the information. By way 
of giving him some adequate idea of our people, when he men- 
tioned the necessity of fleets and armies to secure us against 
invasion, I tell him, that nothing would be more difficult than 
to subdue a nation, every individual of which, in the pride of 
freedom, thinks himself equal to a king ; and if, Sir, you 
should look down on him, would say r " I am a man ; are you 
anything more ?" "All this is very well; but there must be 
a difference of ranks, and I should say to one of these peo- 
ple, 'You, Sir, who are equal to a king, make me a pair of 
shoes.' ' ; " Our citizens, Sir, have a manner of thinking pecu- 
liar to themselves. This shoemaker would reply ; ' Sir, I 
am very glad of the opportunity to make you a pair of shoes. 
It is my duty to make shoes, and I love to do ray duty. Does 
your King do his ? " This manner of thinking and speaking, 
however, is too masculine for the climate I am now in. 

' March 3d. Monsieur le Comte de Nenni does me the hon- 
or of a visit, and detains me till 3 o'clock. I then set off in 
great haste to dine with the Comtesse de B. on an invitation 
of a week's standing. Arrive at about a quarter past three, 
and find in the drawing room some dirty linen and no fire. 
While a waiting woman takes away one, a valet lights up the 
other. Three small sticks in a deep bed of ashes give no 
great expectation of heat. By the smoke,, however, all doubts 



\ GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 297 

are removed respecting the existence of fire. To expel the 
smoke ; a window is opened, and, the day being cold, 1 have 
the benefit of as fresh air as can reasonably be expected in so 
large a city. 

'Towards four o'clock the guests begin (o assemble, and I 
begin to expect that, as Madame is a poetess, I shall have the 
honor to dine with that exalted part of the species, who devote 
themselves to the Muses. In effect, the gentlemen begin to 
compliment their respective works, and as regular hours can- 
not be expected in a house, where the mistress is occupied 
more with the intellectual, than the material world, I have a 
delightful prospect of a continuance of the scene. Towards 
five, Madame steps in to announce dinner, and the hungry 
poets advance to the charge. As they bring good appetites, 
they have certainly reason to praise the feast. And I console 
myself in the persuasion, that, for this day at least, I shall 
escape an indigestion. A very narrow escape loo, for some 
rancid butter, of which the cook had been liberal, puts me in 
bodily fear. IQhe repast is not abundant, we have at least 
the consolation, that there is no lack of conversation. Not 
being perfectly master of the language, most of the jests es- 
caped me. As for the rest of the company, each being em- 
ployed either in saying a good thing, or in studying one to say 
it is no wonder if he cannot find time to applaud that of his 
neighbor. They all agree, that we live in an age alike defi- 
cient in justice and in taste. Each finds in the fate of his own 
works numerous instances to justify this censure. They tell 
me, to my great surprise, that the public now condemn theat- 
rical compositions, before they have heard the first recital. 
And to remove my doubts, the Countess is so kind as to assure 
me, that this rash decision has been made on one of her own 
pieces. In pitying modern degeneracy, we rise from the 
table. 

' I take my leave immediately after the coffee, which by no 
means dishonors the precedent repast ; and Madame informs 
me, that on Tuesdays and Thursdays she is always at home, 



298 LIFE OF 

and will always be glad to see me. While I stammer out some 
return to the compliment, my heart, convinced of my unvvor- 
thiness to partake of such attic entertainments, makes me 
promise never again to occupy the place from which, perhaps, 
I had excluded a worthier personage. 

'March 2dth. Went to Madame de Chastellux's. Madame 
de Segur and M. de Puisignieu arrived shortly after. In a 
few minutes the Dutchess of Orleans, and then more company. 
The Dutchess is affable, and handsome enough to punish the 
Duke for his irregularities. Madame de Segur goes away 
early, as the company seems determined to increase. The 
widow of the late Duke of Orleans comes in, and at going 
away, according to custom, kisses the Dutchess. I observe 
that the ladies of Paris are very fond of each other ; which 
gives room to some observations from her Royal Highness on 
the person, who has just quitted the room, which show that the 
kiss does not always betoken great affection. In going away, 
she is pleased to say, that she is glad to have met me ; and I 
believe her. The reason is, that I dropped s^me expressions 
and sentiments a little rough, and which were agreeable, be- 
cause they contrast with the palling polish she constantly meets 
with everywhere. Hence, I conclude, that the less I have the 
honor of such good company the better ; for, when the novelty 
ceases, all is over, and I shall probably be worse than insipid. 

'March 21th. At three the Marechal de Castries calls, and 
takes me to dine with Monsieur and Madame Necker. In the 
salon we found Madame. She seems to be a woman of sense, 
and somewhat of the masculine in her character. A little 
before dinner Monsieur enters. He has the look and manner 
of the counting-house, and, being dressed in embroidered vel- 
vet, he contrasts strongly with his habiliments. His bow, his ad- 
dress, say, " I am the man." Our company is one half acade- 
micians. The Dutchess of Biron, formerly Lauzun. is one. I 
observe that M. Necker seems occupied by ideas, which rath- 
er distress him. He cannot, I think, stay in office half an hour, 
after the nation insist on keeping him there. He is now much 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 299 

harassed, and Madame receives continually Memoires from dif- 
ferent people ; so that she seems as much occupied as he is. 
If he is really a very great man, I am deceived ; and yet this 
is a rash judgment. If he is not a laborious man, I am also 
deceived.* 

' Jlpril 3d. I go to the Louvre, on an engagement with 
Madame de Flahaut, to see the statues and paintings. She 
is in bed, and her brother-in-law in the room with her, so that 
it appears she has, as she says, forgotten her engagement 
to me. M. de Flahaut comes in. She sends us forward, and 
is to follow. This is done. We walk over .the court of the 
Louvre through the mud, and view the statues. The paintings 
we cannot see. That pleasure is for another opportunity. 
Return to her quarter. Monsieur, presuming that I was about 
to follow her up stairs merely out of politesse, apologizes for 
me. In consequence, I take my leave. And thus a scene, 
which imagination had painted very well, turns out good for 
nothing. The -weather contributes to render it disagreeable. 
Wind, rain, and of course mud without, and dampness within. 
But this is human life. Monsieur, as 1 go away, express- 
es a hope to see me again soon, and requests to be com- 
manded, if he can be useful in anything. This politesse is 
always agreeable ; though a man must be a fool to believe 
in it. 



* There is a curious coincidence between these impressions of 
Necker, which Mr Morris derived from his first interview, and the 
description given of him in Montgaillard's spirited History of the 
French Revolution, 'In his personal appearance M. Necker had 
nothing insinuating, or even agreeable. His figure was repulsive at 
first sight, and it was difficult not to perceive an affected stateliness 
of air, which seemed to say, "behold in me a great man, a superior 
genius." Before the opening of the States-General, M. Necker said 
modestly, "the safety of France is in my portfolio." We have heard 
Madame de Stae'l repeat these words of her father, and in the excess 
of her tenderness, or rather of her filial adoration, Madame de Stae'l 
found these words just and suitable.' Hist, de France, fyc. par Mont- 
gaillard, Vol. ii. p. 12.

' From hence go to M. le Normands, for the copy of a 
letter, which was to have, heen sent this morning, hut is, I sup- 
pose, neglected by his absence. It turns out to he as I sus- 
pected. The ccmmis promises it for this evening. In going 
from hence, I slip as I step into the carriage, and bruise my- 
self. Thus everything goes wrong. Visit the Countess de 
Darfort. She has company, and is but just risen. Pressed 
to dine ; but decline it. She is going to sup with the Baron 
de Bezonvald, and I promise to be there if I can. She says 
if I do not go, it is because I will not. Ou fait tout ce qu'on 
veut. I stammer out a bald compliment in reply. I am cer- 
tainly good for nothing, and the only tolerable thing I can do 
is to go home. This is done ; and, being out of humour with 
myself, I find the dinner very bad. Threaten to deal with 
another traiteur. Extremely ridiculous ! The waiter, who 
behaves with great humility, must, I think, despise me for pre- 
tending to talk angrily, before I can talk French. 

' At five, I visit Madame de Segur. Madame de Chastel- 
lux and M. de Puisignieu are there. The former is obliged 
to go away. In conversing about public men and measures, I 
am so weak and absurd as to express many opinions, which I 
ought to conceal, and some of which I may, perhaps, find 
reason to alter. Two ladies come in, and, as I am going 
away, Madame de Segur, to whom I had mentioned my inten- 
tion of visiting Mr Jefferson, has the politeness to say, "/tows vous 
reverrons, Monsieur 'Morris," and I have the stupidity to an- 
swer in the affirmative. Call on Mr Jefferson, and sit an hour 
with him, which is, at least, fifty minutes too long, for his 
daughters had left the room on my approach, and waited only 
my departure to return. At least I think so. Returning, in 
compliance with my promise, call on Madame de Segur, and 
am shown into the room where she is with her father-in-law. 
He lies on a couch, or rather sofa, the gout in his right hand, 
which is his only hand. Madame de Chastellux and another 
lady there. I think I was wrong to come here, and, for that 
reason, find it more difficult to get away. Vastly awkward. 




GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 301 

At length make a sliift to take leave ; and, to avoid all further 
folly for this day, determined to go home and not visit the 
Baron. 

l Jlpril llth. Visit Monsieur de Lafayette. A long conver- 
sation. He gives me the history of his political campaign in 
Auvergne. I find that his mind is getting right, as to the busi- 
ness he has in hand. We consider of a revolt in Paris, and 
agree that it might occasion much mischief, but could not pro- 
duce any good. That, in consequence, it will he best to enter 
a protestation against the manner of convoking the city. But 
to go on with the business and get the members elected. 
There is to be a meeting of the Noblesse this afternoon, and 
Monsieur de Clermont will talk to this effect. He is, if possi- 
ble, to be made one of the representatives; and is, therefore, 
to be brought forward as a speaker immediately. Lafayette 
says he has genius and family, though of small fortune. 

' Go to dine with Monsieur de la Breteche. After dinner 
Monsieur de Durfort comes in. He has been at the meeting. 
Monsieur de Clermont's speech was very much admired, and 
he carried his point by a large majority, contrary, says M. de 
Durfort, to the wish of M. Necker's friends. I am very curi- 
ous, and among other things, ask if Monsieur de Lafayette was 
there. Yes, and said a few words, which were very well. 
As M. de Durfort is not the friend either of Monsieur de La- 
fayette or of Monsieur Necker, I fancy things have gone very 
right. 

' From Monsieur de la Breteche, I go to Madame de 
Segur's. We have a little tete a tete over a dish of tea. The 
tea is very good, and her conversation is better flavored than 
her tea, which comes from Russia. The Marechal de Duras 
comes in, and says a great many very civil things to Madame 
de Segur, mixed with some advice. She seems not much 
affected either by the one or. the other. From hence I go to 
the Palais Royal, and find Madame de Chastellux with her 
son lying in her lap. A mother in this situation is always 
interesting, and her late loss renders her particularly so. In 
VOL. i. 26 



302 LIFE OF 

the course of conversation, asking after the health of her prin- 
cess, she repeats a message formerly delivered. Betwreu 
nine and ten, it is concluded that the Dutchess will not make 
her evening visit, and I take my leave, returning the message 
I had received. " I have visited Madame la Duchesse chez 
Madame de Chastellux, and am sorry not to have met her 
there." ' 

Madame de Chastellux, of whom Mr Morris has spoken 
several times in the above extracts, was the widow of his late 
friend, the Marquis de Chastellux, who had died three months 
before his arrival in France. She was an Irish lady, whom 
the. Marquis had first met at Spa the year before, and whom 
he soon after married. He wrote a letter to Mr Morris at the 
time, speaking in great raptures of her beauty, character, and 
accomplishments. She became maid of honor to the Dutchess 
of Orleans, and was, it would seem, her most intimate compan- 
ion. 

' jQpril 20th. If the Court should attempt now to recede, it 
is impossible to conjecture the event. The chiefs of the pat- 
riotic party have gone so far, that they cannot retreat with 
safety. If there be any real vigor in the nation, the prevailing 
party in the States-General may, if they please, overturn the 
monarchy itself, should the King commit his authority to a 
contest with them. The Court is extremely feeble, and the 
manners are so extremely corrupt, that they cannot succeed, 
if there be any consistent opposition, unless the whole nation 
be equally depraved. The probability, I think, is, that an 
attempt to retreat, at this late period of the business, would 
bring the Court into absolute contempt.' 

The two extracts, which follow, relate to the famous opening 
of the States-General at Versailles, which has been called by 
historians the first day of the Revolution. Great preparations 
had been made to give splendor and effect to this ceremony. 
There was a religious procession the day preceding, and a 
discourse, or sermon, was pronounced by the Bishop of Nancy, 
at which were present the Royal Family, the nobility, and all 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 303 

the members of the three orders about to constitute the grand 
Assembly of the nation, which was now convened after a lapse 
of more than a century and a half. The Bishop, when he used 
the words public liberty, and some other expressions of that 
kind, was loudly applauded, with continued clapping of hands, 
a demonstration of feeling, it is said, never before known in a 
church, and particularly on a religious occasion. 

' May 4th. At six this morning I set off for Versailles. 
Am overtaken on the road by M. le Normond and M. la Gaze. 
We alight together, and walk through the streets till the pro- 
cession commences, except a little while that I sit with Mad- 
ame de Flahaut, who was so kind as to send and offer me part 
of a window. 

' The procession is very magnificent, through a double row 
of tapestry. Neither the King nor Queen appear too well 
pleased. The former is repeatedly saluted as he passes along 
with Vive le Roi ; but the latter meets not a single accla- 
mation. She looks, however, with contempt on the scene in 
which she acts a part, and seems to say,' for the present I sub- 
mit, but I shall have my turn. 

' Return to Paris and dine. After dinner walk to the 
Palais Royal and see Madame de Chastellux. Make a short 
visit, as she is going to the Dutchess. Find I was right in my 
conjecture, as to the Queen's temper and the King's. He was 
vexed that the Duke of Orleans should walk as representative, 
and not as Prince of the blood ; and, also, that his consort 
received no mark of public satisfaction. She was exceedingly 
hurt. I cannot help feeling the mortification, which the poor 
Queen meets with, for I see only the woman ; and it seems 
unmanly to treat a woman with unkindness. Madame de 
Chastellux tells me a sprightly reply of Madame Adelaide, 
the King's aunt ; who, when the Queen in a fit of resentment, 
speaking of this nation, said, " Ces indignes Frangais," exclaim- 
ed, " dites indignes, Madame." 

1 The Dutchess of Orleans could not get a billet for rne, but 
the Dutcbess de Bourbon has promised to try. and, if she sue- 



304 LIFE or 

ceeds, will send it to the Palais Royal this evening ; and, in 
that case, Madame de Chastellux \vill receive it from the 
Duchesse d'Orleans, and send it to me. 

' May bth. Go to Versailles, and a little after eight get into 
the Hall. Sit there in a cramped situation till after twelve, during 
which time, the different members are brought in and placed, 
one Bailliage after the other. When M. Necker comes in, he 
is loudly and repeatedly clapped, and so is the Duke of Or- 
leans, also a Bishop, who has long lived in his diocese, and 
preached there what his profession enjoins. Another Bishop, 
who preached yesterday a sermon, which I did not hear, is 
applauded ; but those near me say that this applause is unmer- 
ited. An old man, who refused to dress in the costume pre- 
scribed for the Tiers, and who appears in his farmer's habit, re- 
ceives a long and loud plaudit. M. de Mirabeau is hissed, 
though not very loudly. The King at length arrives, and takes 
his seat, the Queen on his left, two steps lower than himself. 
He makes a short speech, very proper, and well spoken, or 
rather read. The tone and manner have all the fierte, which 
can be desired in, or expected from, the blood of the Bourbons. 
He is interrupted in the reading by acclamations so warm and 
of such lively affection, that the tears start from my eyes in 
spite of myself. The Queen weeps, or seems to weep, but 
not one voice is heard to wish her well. I would certainly 
raise mine, if I were a Frenchman ; bull have no right to ex- 
press a sentiment, and in vain solicit those who are near me to 
do it. 

' After the King has spoken he takes off his hat, and when 
he puts it on again, his Nobles imitate the example. Some of 
the Tiers do the same ; but by degrees they, one after the oth- 
er, take them off again. The King then takes off his hat. The 
Queen seems to think it wrong, and a conversation seems to 
pass, in which the King tells her he chooses to do it, whether 
consistent or not consistent with the ceremonial ; but I would 
not swear to this, being too far distant to see very distinctly, 
much less to hear. The Nobles uncover by degrees, so that 




GODVERNEUR MORRIS. 305 

if the ceremonial requires those manosuvres, the troops are 
not yet properly drilled. 

' After the King's speech, and the coverings and uncover- 
ings, the Garde des Sceaux makes one much longer ; but it is 
delivered in a very ungraceful manner, and so indistinctly, 
that nothing can be judged of it by me until it is in print. 
When he has done, M. Necker rises. He tries to play the 
orator, but he plays it very ill. The audience salute him with 
a long and loud plaudit. Animated by their approbation, he 
falls into action and emphasis ; but a bad accent and un- 
graceful manner destroy much of the effect, which ought to 
follow from a composition written by M. Necker, and spoken 
by M. Necker. He presently asks the King's leave to em- 
ploy a clerk, which being granted, the clerk proceeds in the 
lecture. It is very long. It contains much information, and 
many things very fine, but it is too long, has many repetitions, 
and too much compliment, and what the French call emphrtse. 
The plaudits were long, loud, and incessant. These will con- 
vince the King and Queen of the national sentiment, and tend 
to prevent the effect? of the intrigue against the present ad- 
ministration, at least for a while. After this speech is over, 
the King rises to depart, and receives a long ami affecting 
Five le Roi. The Queen rises, and, to my great satisfaction, 
she hears for the first time in several mouths the sound of Vive 
la Reine. She makes a low courtesy, and this produces a 
louder acclamation, and that a lower courtesy. 

' As soon as I can disengage myself from the crowd and 
find my servant, I go to where my carriage puts up, in order 
to proceed to Paris, being tolerably hungry, and not inclining 
to ask any one for a dinner, as I am convinced that more such 
requests will be made this day, than are agreeable to those 
who have dinners to bestow. I find that my horses are not 
harnessed, and that I am at a traiteur's. I ask for s, dinner, 
and am shown into the room where there is a table d'hote, and 
some of the Tiers are set down at it. We enter into conver- 
sation. Talk of the manner of voting. I tell them that I 
26* 



306 LIFE or 

think, when their constitution is formed, it will be well for them 
to vote oar ordre, but in forming it to vote par tcte. Those, 
who best understand the thing, incline to this opinion ; but 
they are from Brittany; and one of them inveighs so strongly 
against the tyranny of the nobles, and attacks his brother so 
warmly, that the others come about ; and one, a noble repre- 
senting the Tiers, is so vociferous against his own order, that 
I am convinced he means to rise by his eloquence, and finally 
will, I expect, vote with the opinion of the Court, let that be 
what it may. I rise, and" wish them very sincerely a perfect 
accord, and good understanding with each other, and set off 
for Paris.' 

In a letter to Mrs Morris of Philadelphia, he gives addition- 
al sketches of this scene, which are still more graphic, and 
may help to fill up the picture. 

' I had the honor to be present on the fifth of this month at 
the opening of the States-General ; a spectacle more solemn 
to the mind, than gaudy to the eye. And yet, there was dis- 
played everything of noble and of royal in this titled country. 
A great number of fine women, and a very great number of 
fine dresses, ranged round the Hall. On a kind of stage the 
throne ; on the left of the King and a little below him the 
Queen; a little behind him to the light, and on chairs, the 
Princes of the blood ; on the right and and left, at some dis- 
tance from the throne, the various Princesses, with the 
gentlemen and ladies of their retinue. Advanced on the :-tage, 
to the left of the throne, the Keeper of the Seals. Several of- 
ficers of the household, richly caparisoned, strewed about in 
different places. Behind the throne, a cluster of guards, of 
the largest size, dressed in ancient costumes, taken from the 
times of chivalry. In front of the throne on the right, belo\v 
the stage, the Ministers of state, with a large table before them. 
On the opposite side of the Hall some benches, on which sat 
the Marechals of France, and other great officers. In front 
of the Ministers, on benches facing the opposite side of the 
Hall, sat the Representatives of the Clergy,, being priests of all 






GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 307 

colors, scarlet, crimson, black, white, and gray, to the number 
of three hundred. In front of the Marechals of France, on 
benches facing the Clergy, sat an equal number of Represent- 
atives of the Nobility, dressed in a robe of black, waistcoats of 
cloth of gold, and over their shoulders, so as to hang forward to 
their waists, a kind of lappels about a quarter of a yard wide at 
top, and wider at bottom, made of cloth of gold. On benches, 
which reached quite across the Hall, and facing the stage, sat the 
Representatives of the People clothed in black. In the space 
between the Clergy and Nobles, directly in front of the Repre- 
sentatives of the People, and facing the throne, stood the her- 
alds at arms, with their staves and in very rich dresses. 

' When the King entered, he was saluted with a shout of 
applause. Some time after he had taken his seat, he put on a 
round beaver, ornamented with white plumes, the part in front 
turned up, with a large diamond button in the centre. He 
read his speech well, and was interrupted at a part, which af- 
fected his audience, by a loud shout of Vive le Roi. After 
this had subsided, he finished his speech, and received again 
an animated acclamation of applause. He then took off his 
hat, and after a while put it on again, at which the Nobles also 
put on their hats, which resembled the King's, excepting the 
button. The effect of this display of plumage was fine. 

' Tho Keeper of the Seals then performed his genuflexions 
to the throne, and mumbled out, in a very ungraceful manner, 
a speech of considerable length, which nobody pretends to 
judge of, because nobody heard it. He was succeeded by 
M. Necker, who soon handed his speech to his clerk, being 
unable to go through with it. The clerk delivered it much bet- 
ter than the Minister, and that is no great praise. It was three 
hours long, contained many excellent things, but too much of 
compliment, too much of repetition, and indeed loo much of 
everything, for it was too long by two hours, and yet fell 
short in some capital points of great expectation. He receiv- 
ed, however, very repeated plaudits from the audience, some 
of which were merited, but more were certainly paid to his 



LIFE OF 



character, than to his composition. M. Necker's long speech 
now comes to a close, and the King rises to depart. The Hall 
resounds with a long loud Vive, h Roi. He passes the 
Queen, who rises to follow him. At this moment some one, 
imbued with the milk of human kindness, originates a faint Vive 
la Heine. She makes a humble courtesy and presents the 
sinking of the high Austrian spirit ; a livelier acclamation in re- 
turn, and to this her lowlier bending, which is succeeded by a 
shout of loud applause. Here drops the curtain on the first 
great act of this great drama, in which Bourbon gives free- 
dom. His courtiers seem to feel, what he seems to be in- 
sensible of, the pang of greatness going off.' 

One of the immediate objects of Mr Morris's visit to France, 
was to prosecute and settle a claim of Robert Morris against 
the Farmers General for tobacco, shipped to them by contract. 
For reasons not necessary to be enumerated, the affair had 
become much .involved, and after repeated and ineffectual 
attempts to bring about a compromise, Mr Morris at last 
determined on a suit at law. The case, in some of iis forms, 
was to come before a bench of judges, whom he was advised 
to see in person, previously to its being committed to them. 
In company with a gentleman, who also had some concern in 
the transaction, he set out on this visit to the judges, and when 
it was finished, wrote down the following account of his ad- 
ventures. 

' May 28th. He desires me to tell the judges, that I came 
over on purpose to settle the business now before them. I tell 
him that 1 cannot, because it is not true. This, says he, is of 
no consequence, for it will injure nobody. I tell him, that I 
cannot bring myself to lie, although it be not maliciously done, 
but he may, if he pleases, tell them so. He says he will, for 
that if I did not come on that account, I ought to. We first 
call on M. Etienne, a bookseller. He is not at home, and 
Laurent writes a message, L do not know what. Secondly, 
we call on M. le Camus Avard, a woollen draper. He also 
is from home, and Laurent writes a message. Thirdly, we 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 309 

call on M. Magimel, a goldsmith, and have the honor to see 
him. He is to be relieved next month hy M. Maillard, a 
furrier. However, we are to send him a memoire, because 
on les affaires majeures they generally confer together. He 
promises to expedite the matter. We then return to M. le 
C. who is to leave town this afternoon for Rouen, and has a 
great deal to do, but will despatch it immediately, and go 
with me to visit our other judges. Sit waiting for him in my 
carnage a long hour, and then at the door of it he talks with a 
man, (whom he has been long talking to already,) for several 
minutes. He gets in, and I tell him, in a manner which suffi- 
ciently shows vexation, that it is too late to visit any of these 
people, but we will go home and dine. He apologizes, and 
apprehending, I believe, that in my present temper we shall 
be had company, declines my invitation, and gets out again. 

' Return home and dine. At five resume my visits to rny 
judges ; and first wait upon the honorable M. Gillet, the 
grocer, who is in a little cuddy, adjoining his shop, at cards. 
He assures me, that the court are impartial, and alike uninflu-r 
enced by Farmers, Receivers, and Grand Seigneurs ;that they 
are generally of the same opinion ; that he will do everything 
in his power, and the like. De Vautre cote, perfect confidence 
in the integrity and ability of the court. Wish only to bring 
the cause to such a point, as that I may have the honor to pre- 
sent a memoire. Am vastly sorry to have been guilty of an 
intrusion upon the amusements of his leisure hours. Hope he 
will excuse the solicitude of a stranger, and patronize a claim 
of such evident justice. The whole goes off very well, though 
I with difficulty restrain my risible faculties. The coachman, 
who sees the respectfulness of my adieus at the shop door, is 
not quite so discreet. 

' My next visit is to M. Maillard, the vender of skins. A 
chariot stopping at the door, and a servant in livery inquiring 
for him, without anything of the humble suitor in his counte-. 
nance, brings his honor into the street. A world of apologies 
for rny indiscretion ; hope he will excuse it. He is so kind 



310 LIFE OF 

as to receive my excuses very graciously, though I think he 
must be disappointed at receiving a client instead of a custom- 
er. Explain my object. He will do whatever may lie in his 
power. My last visit is to the honorable M. Servi, the vint- 
ner. He will take the earliest opportunity tomorrow to men- 
tion the matter to his brethren. I tell him that a confidence 
in the wise and impartial attention in the consulate, PS also in 
the speediness of their decisions, have induced the suit, which 
gives him the trouble of my visit, and so forth. In reply, the 
desire of this nation to give the best reception to strangers, 
and, finally, that he already believes my cause to be good, and 
hopes he may not be disappointed. Certainly I must believe 
it good. A winter's passage of a thousand leagues is not un- 
dertaken on light ground, by a man of common understanding, 
and although there is doubtless every reason for confiding in 
the justico of the French, yet a stranger, opposed to a power- 
ful Company, can never have the same opportunities and 
advantages ; that, at present, I only supplicate for despatch, 
and shall do myself the honor at a future day to explain the 
grounds of my demand. 

' Having got through this disagreeable scene, the ridicule of 
which is so strongly painted to my own eyes, that I cannot 
forbear laughing at myself, I call on Mr Jefferson to take 
him and his family to the garden of Monsieur, for which I have 
a ticket, but he is not at home. 

' May 30th. Dine with the Marechal de Castries. In my 
way call on General Dalrymple, stay about five minutes, and 
by this means do not arrive till they are sitting down to table. 
After dinner explain to the Marechal the affair of the claim set 
up against the Farm. He desires a note of it, which I am to 
make out aaid give him. I tell him that a man of sense, de- 
cision, and firmness, is necessary to the King in the present 
moment to extricate him from the difficulties in which they 
are plunged, also some rough sketch of the means. Call on 
Mr Jefferson and sit a good while. General conversation 
on characters and politics. I think he does not form very just 



GOUVEBNEUR MORRIS. 311 

estimates of character, but rather assigns too many to the hum- 
ble rank of fools ; whereas in life the gradations are infinite, 
and each individual has his peculiarities of fort and feeble. 
Go to Madame de Flahaut's to spend the evenin g. Talk a 
good deal of loose, light nonsense, and at eleven o'clock come 
home.' 

While the Marechal de Castries was Minister of the Marine, 
he had read Mr Morris's two letters to the Marquis de Chas- 
tellux, on the commerce of the French Islands, and often 
spoke of them in terms of high approbation, which caused 
them to be read and commended by others. Of this the Mar- 
quis took care to give his friend due intelligence. The rep- 
utation acquired by these letters was valuable to him after his 
arrival in Paris. 

' June 3d. Go to Mr Jefferson's. Some political conver- 
sation. He seems to be out of hope of anything being done 
to purpose by the States-General. This comes from having 
sanguine expectation of a downright republican form of gov- 
ernment. The literary people here, observing the abuses of 
their monarchical form, imagine that everything must go the 
better in proportion as it recedes from the present establish- 
ments, and in their closets they make men exactly suited to 
their systems; but unluckily they are such men as exist 
nowhere else, and least of all in France. I am more than ever 
persuaded that the form, which at first appeared to me most 
fit for them, is that which will be adopted ; and exactly to my 
idea, but probably in a much better manner. 

' June bth. Go to M. Hudon's. He has been waiting 
for me a long time. I stand for his statue of General Wash- 
ington, being the humble employment of a manikin. This is 
literally taking the advice of St Paul, to be all things to all 
men. Promise M. Hudon to attend next Tuesday morning 
at half past eight to have my bust taken, which he desires, to 
please himself, for this is the answer to my question, what he 
wants with my bust. 

'June 6th. Dine with Mr Jefferson. He has just re- 



312 LIFE OP 

ceived some news from America, where all is going on well. 
Sit pretty long at table and stay tea. At ten go to sup with 
Madame de Flahaut, who is ill, but eats supper, and is of 
course much worse after having eaten. The States-General 
seem to approach a little more towards accommodation. The 
Bishop of Autun, (Talleyrand) who is one of our company, 
and an intimate friend of Madame Flahaut, appears to me a 
sly, cool, cunning, ambitious, and malicious man. I know not 
why conclusions so disadvantageous to him are formed in my 
mind ; but so it is, and I cannot help it. 

' June llth. This morning I go to Reinsi. Arrive at 
eleven. Nobody yet visible. After some time the Dutchess 
(of Orleans) appears, and tells me, that she has given Madame 
de Chastellux notice of my arrival. This consists with iny 
primitive idea. Near twelve before the breakfast is paraded ; 
but, as I had eaten mine before my departure, this has no pre- 
sent inconvenience. After breakfast we go to mass in the 
chapel. In the tribune above, we have a Bishop, an Ab- 
be, the Dutchess, her maids, and some of their friends. Mad- 
ame de Chastellux is below on her knees. We are amused 
above by a number of little tricks played off by Monsieur de 
Segur and Monsieur de Cabieres with a candle, which is put 
into the pockets of different gentlemen, the Bishop's among 
the rest, and lighted, while they are otherwise engaged, (for 
there is a fire in the tribune,) to the great merriment of the 
spectators. Immoderate laughter is the consequence. The 
Dutchess preserves as much gravity as she can. This scene 
must be very edifying to the domestics, who are opposite to us, 
and the villagers who worship below. After this ceremony is 
concluded, we commence our walk, which is long and exces- 
sively hot. Then we get into batteaux, and the gentlemen row 
the ladies, which is by no means a cool operation. After that, 
more walking; so that I am excessively inflamed, even to fever 
heat. Get to the Chateau, and doze a little, era attendant le 
dine, which does not come till after five. A number of persons 
surround the windows, and doubtless form a high idea of the 



GOEVERNEUR MORRIS. 313 

company to whom they are obliged to look up at an awful dis- 
tance. Ah, did they but know how trivial the conversation, 
how very trivial the characters, their respect would soon be 
changed to an emotion extremely different. , 

' June 12th. Mr Jefferson has been to Versailles. The Tien 
have called on the Nobles and Clergy to join them and proceed 
to business, which has thrown the former into a rage. He 
considers the affairs of this country as being in a very critical 
situation. They are so ; but the royal authority has yet great 
weight, and, if brought in to the aid of the privileged orders, 
may yet prevent their destruction. However, he and I differ 
in our systems of politics. He, with all the leaders of liberty 
here, is desirous of annihilating distinctions of order. How 
far such views may be right, respecting mankind in general, is, 
I think, extremely problematical. But, with respect to this 
nation, I am sure it is wrong, and cannot eventuate well. 

' June 19th. The Clergy have this day, by a small majori- 
ty, determined to join the Tiers. This stroke is fatal to the 
Noblesse, for the Tiers, having already constituted themselves 
the National Assembly, as representing ninety-six hundredths 
of the nation, they will now have the claim to be a majority of 
orders also, as well as of heads. Unless the royal authority 
be interposed to save the Nobles, they are gone ; and of this 
there seems to be but slender probability. 

' M. de Boursac tells me, which is the aristocratic consola- 
tion, that the King has called a council on the present state of 
affairs, in which each is to deliver his opinion in his Majesty's 
presence. I do not believe, that this will produce any effect 
whatever ; for the decision of this day will awe those, who, 
two days ago, would have been loud against M. Necker. 
And probably those who called, or rather prompted the call 
of this council, will find the event to be a direct reverse of 
their wishes and expectations. 

' June 20Z/4. Go to club. Meet the Comte de Croix, Due 
de Rochefoucauld, Vicomtes de Noailles and de Segur, young 
Dillon, and sundry others. Various conjectures about the ob-

ject of the Seance royale to be held on Monday. I believe 
that this step would not have been taken, had the Court fore- 
seen the step of the clergy yesterday. They have very in- 
flammable materials to handle now, and must take good heed. 
The general idea seems to be, that this Seance is consequen- 
tial upon what passed in the Tiers, when they assumed to 
themselves the title of National Assembly ; but I conjecture 
that, however this incident may have precipitated that event, 
it originates in the idea of arranging the different corps in such 
way, as that they may act, instead of being as at present a 
useless herd. 

' June 23d. Go to Versailles and call on Monsieur de la 
Luzerne, but both he and his lady are out of town. Thence 
to Madame de Tesse's, who gives me a cordial reception, 
complaining, however, of my politics. The King has this 
day, in his Seance royale, pleased the Nobility, and very much 
displeased the Tiers. I find it difficult to learn exactly what 
has passed, but it seems to me, that the Nobility have less 
cause for exultation than they imagine. At dinner I sit next 
to Monsieur de Lafayette, who tells me that I injure the cause, 
for that my sentiments are continually quoted against the good 
party. I seize this opportunity to tell him, that I am opposed 
to the democracy from regard to liberty. That I see they are 
going headlong to destruction, and would fain stop them if I 
could. That their views respecting this nation are totally in- 
consistent with the materials of which it is composed ; and 
that the worst thing, which could happen, would be to grant 
their wishes. He tells me, that he is sensible that his party 
are mad, and tells them so, but is not the less determined to 
die with them. I tell him, that I think it would be quite as 
well to bring them to their senses, and live with them. He 
says that he is determined to resign his seat, which step 
approve of, because the instructions by which he is bound are 
contrary to his conscience. Before we part, I take an oppor- 
tunity to tell him, that if the Tiers are now very moderate 
they will probably succeed ; but, if violent, must inevitably 
fail. 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 315 

* From hence go to Madame d'Angiviliers, who is not at 
home. Then call on the Due de la Vauguyon, who is also 
abroad. Thence to Madame de Montoissieux's, where the 
party is aristocratical. Delighted with the King. In the 
course of conversation they tell me some anecdotes, which 
convince me that the King and Queen are confoundedly 
frightened ; and T am thence led to conjecture, that the Court 
will still recede. M. Necker offered yesterday to resign, but 
the King refused to accept his resignation. This afternoon 
he waits on his Majesty, surrounded by the common people, 
who attend him with shouts of applause to the door of the 
Chateau. At half past seven, when I leave Versailles, he is 
still with the King. 

' July 3d. Cantellux is full of politics. He tells me, that 
I am frequently quoted by the aristocrats, as being of their 
party. This leads to an explanation of my opinions, in which 
we perfectly agree, and he appears glad of it. The concilia- 
ting point is an abolition of the parliaments, which I think es- 
sential to the establishment of freedom, justice, and order. 

{ July 4th. Go to Mr Jefferson's to dinner. A large par- 
ty of Americans, and among them Monsieur and Madame de 
Lafayette. Some political conversation with him after din- 
ner, in which I urge him to preserve, if possible, some consti- 
tutional authority to the body of Nobles, as the only means of 
preserving any liberty for the people. The current is sitting 
so strong against the Noblesse, that I apprehend their destruc- 
tion, in which will, I fear, be involved consequences most per- 
nicious, though little attended to in the present moment. 

'July ilth. The King, in answer to the States respecting 
the troops, has told them that he had no intentions to affect 
them, and if their apprehensions continue, he will remove the 
session of the States to Soissons, or Noyons, and go himself 
to Compiegne. This is an artful reply. If he can get them 
far from Paris, he will weaken that impulse, which at present 
creates such alarm. But the evil lies deeper than his coun- 
sellors are aware of, and the business now broached must have 
its complete course. 



316 LIFE OF 

' July l%th. Dine with the Marechal de Castries, who in- 
quires very kindly the state of my business. I tell him that I 
am about to conclude an indirect agreement, because un 
mauvais accommodement vaut mieux qiCun bon proces. He 
agrees in this sentiment, and is glad that my voyage has not 
been wholly fruitless. He tells me that he is in town for a 
few days, which he devotes to business, and therefore inquires 
how mine goes on. As 1 am going away, he takes me aside, 
and informs me that M. Necker is no longer in place. He is 
much affected at this intelligence, and indeed so am I. I urge 
him to go immediately to Versailles. He says he will not ; that 
they have undoubtedly taken all their measures before this 
moment, and therefore he must be too late. I tell him that it 
is not too late to warn the King of his danger, which is infinite- 
ly greater than he imagines. That his army will not fight 
against the nation, and that, if he listens to violent counsels, the 
nation will undoubtedly be against him : that the sword has 
fallen imperceptibly from his hand; and that the sovereignty 
of this nation is in the Jlsscmblce Nationale. He makes no 
precise answer to this, but is very deeply affected. He tells 
me, that if he stays longer in town, he will inform me, that we 
may see each other again. 

1 Learn that the whole administration are routed, and M. 
Necker banished. Much alarm here. Paris begins to be in 
commotion, and from the invalid guard of the Louvre a few of 
the mobility take a drum and beat to arms. Monsieur de Nar- 
bonne, the friend of Madame de Stae'l, considers a civil war inev- 
itable, and is about to join his regiment, being, as he says, in a 
conflict between the dictates of his duty and his conscience. 
T tell him, that I know of no duty, but that which conscience 
dictates. I presume that his conscience will dictate to join the 
strongest side. The little Abbe, Bertrand, after sallying out 
in a fiacre, returns frightened, because of a large mob in the 
Rue St Honore ; and presently comes in another Abbe, who is 
of the parliament, and who, rejoicing inwardly at the change, 
is confoundedly frightened at the commotions. I calm the 






GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 317 

fears of Madame de Flahaut, whose husband is mad, and in 
a printed list, it seems, of the furious aristocrats. 

' Offer to conduct the Abbes safely home, which offer Ber- 
trand accepts. His terror as we go along is truly diverting. 
As we approach the Rue St Honore,his imagination magnifies 
the ordinary passengers into a vast mob, and I can scarcely 
persuade him to trust his eyes, instead of his fears. Having 
set him down, I depart for Mr Jefferson's. In riding along the 
Boulevards, all at once the carriages, horses, and foot passen- 
gers turn about and pass rapidly. Presently after, we meet a 
body of cavalry, with their sabres drawn, and coming at half 
speed. After they have passed us a little way, they stop. 
When we come to the Place Louis Quinze, 1 observe the peo- 
ple, to the number of perhaps of one hundred, picking up 
stones, and, looking back, find that the cavalry are returning. 
Stop at the angle to see the fray if any. The people 
take post among the stones, which lie scattered about the 
whole place, being there ^ewn for the bridge now building. 
The officer at the head of this party is saluted by a stone, and 
immediately turns his horse in a menacing manner towards the 
assailant. But his adversaries are posted on ground where the 
cavalry cannot act. He pursues his route, therefore, and the 
pace is soon increased to a gallop, amid a shower of stones. 
One of the soldiers is either knocked from his horse, or the 
horse falls under him. He is taken prisoner, and at first ill 
treated. They had fired several pistols, but without effect. 
Probably they were not even charged with ball. A party of 
the Swiss guards are posted in the Champs-Elysees with 
cannon. 

' Proceed to Mr Jefferson's. He tells me that M. Necker 
received yesterday about noon a letter from the King, by the 
hands of Monsieur de la Luzerne, in which he orders him to 
leave the kingdom ; and at the same time Monsieur de la 
Luzerne is desired to exact a promise, that he will not men- 
tion the matter to anybody. M. Necker dines, and proposes 
to his wife a visit to a female friend in the neighborhood. On 




318 LIFE or 

the route, he communicates the intelligence, and they go to a 
country seat, make the needful arrangements, and depart. M. 
de Montmorin immediately resigned, and is in Paris. 

' In returning from Mr Jefferson's, I am turned off to the 
left by the vidette, posted on the road to the Place Louis 
Quinze. Go to club. A gentleman just arrived from Ver- 
sailles gives us an account of the new administration. The 
people are employed in breaking open the armorer's shops, 
and presently a large body of the Gardes Frangaises appear 
with bayonets fixed in the garden, mingled with the mob, some 
of whom are also armed. These poor fellows have pussed 
the Rubicon, with a witness. Success, or a halter, must now 
be their motto. I think the Court will again recede ; and, if 
they do, all further efforts will be idle. If they do not, a civil 
war is among the events most probable. If the Representa- 
tives of the Tiers have formed a just estimate of their consti- 
tuents, in ten days all France will be in commotion. The 
little affray, which I have just witnessed, will probably be 
magnified into a bloody battle before it reaches the frontiers, 
and, in that case, an infinity of corps-bourgeois will march to 
the relief of the capital. They had better gather in the har- 
vest. 

'July 13th. Martin comes in and tells me, that the Hotel 
de Force is forced, and all the prisoners out. Presently after, a 
letter is brought to him, enclosing one for me from Mr Nesbitt, 
who is at the Temple, and wishes to see me ; but my cocher 
tells me he cannot bring my carriage, having already been 
stopped and turned back. In fact, the city of Paris is ir 
as fine a tumult as any one could wish. They are getting 
arms wherever they can find any. Seize sixty barrels of 
powder on the Seine. Break into the Monastery of St Lazar 
and find a store of grain, which the holy brotherhood had laid 
in. Immediately it is put into carts and sent to the market, 
and on every cart a Friar. The Garde Meuble du Roi is at- 
tacked, and the arms are delivered up, to prevent worse con- 
sequences. These, however, are more curious than useful, 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 319 

But the detail of the variety of this day's deeds would be 
endless. 

' Dine at home, and la Gaze dines with me. After dinner 
dress and walk to the Louvre, having previously ornamented 
my hat with a green bough, in honor of the Tiers, for this is 
the fashion of the day, which everybody is obliged to comply 
with, who means to march in peace. It is somewhat whimsi- 
cal, that this day of violence and tumult is the only one in 
which I have dared to walk the streets ; but as no carriages 
are abroad but the fiacres, I do not hazard being crushed, and 
I apprehend nothing from the populace. 

' July 14^A. While sitting here, a person comes and an- 
nounces the taking of the Bastile, the Governor of which is 
beheaded, and the Prcvot des Marchands is killed, and also 
beheaded. They are carrying the heads in triumph through 
the city. The carrying of this citadel is among the most ex- 
traordinary things, that I have met v/ith. It cost the assail- 
ants sixty men, it is said. The Hotel Royal des Invalides 
was forced tl.is morning, and the cannon, small arms, 
&c. brought off. The citizens are by these means well 
armed ; at least there are the materials for about thirty 
thousand to be equipped with, and that is a sufficient army. 
I find that the information received last night, as to the arrete 
of the Assembles Nationale, is not just. They have only de- 
clared, that the last administration carry with them the regret 
of the chamber ; that they will persist in insisting on the re- 
moval of the troops; and that his Majesty's advisers, whatever 
their rank and station, are guilty of all the consequences 
which may ensue. Yesterday it was the fashion at Versailles, 
not to believe that there were any disturbances at Paris. I 
presume that this day's transactions will induce a conviction, 
that ?11 is not perfectly quiet. 

'July 15th. The Due d'Aiguillon and Baron de Menou 
are at club, both of them deputies of the Noblesse. I learn 
through, and from them, the secret history of the revolution of 
this day. Yesterday evening an address was presented by the 
Assembly, to which his Majesty returned an answer by no 



320 1AFE OF 

means satisfactory. The Queen, Count d'Artois, and Dutch- 
ess de Polignac had been all day tampering with two regi- 
ments, which were made almost drunk, and every officer was 
presented to the King, who was induced to give promises, 
money, &tc. to these regiments. They shouted Vive la Reine, 
Vive le (Jomte d'jlrtois, Vive la Duchesse de Polignac, and 
their music came and played under her Majesty's window. 
In the mean time, the Marechal de Broglio was tampering in 
person with the artillery. The plan was to reduce Paris by 
famine, and to take two hundred members of the National 
Assembly prisoners. But they found, that the troops would 
not serve against their country. Of course these plans would 
not be carried into effect. They took care, however, not to 
inform the King of all. the mischiefs. At two o'clock in the 
morning, the Due de Liancourt went into his bed-chamber 
and waked him. Told him all. Told him that he pledged 
his life on the truth of his narration, and that, unless he 
changed his measures speedily, all was lost. The King took 
his determination. The Bishop d'Autun, they say, was called 
on to prepare un discours ; which he did. The orders were 
given for dispersing the troops. And at the meeting of the 
Assembly, the King, accompanied by his two brothers and the 
Captain of his guard, came in and made his speech. This 
produced very enthusiastic emotions of joy, and he was re- 
conducted to the Chateau by the whole Assembly, and by 
all the inhabitants of Versailles. They tell me, that the Ba- 
ron de Bezenvald is denonce by the Jlssemblee Nationale, 
which appellation the King recognises in his discours, that 
they will pursue the present Ministry, &tc. &c. I give my 
opinion, that, after what is passed, the Count d'Artois should 
not be suffered to stay in France. In this they agree. They 
say, that they will faire le proces of the Marechal de Bro- 
glio, and probably of the Baron de Breteuil. It is said that the 
King is to be in town at eleven o'clock tomorrow. But for 
what ? 
' July llth. This morning my coachman tells me, that there 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 321 

are placards up forbidding any corriages to run, as the King is 
to be in town this day between ten and eleven o'clock. Here 
then is another day, in which nothing will be done. Dress 
immediately and go out. Get at a window in the Rue St 
Honore, through which the procession is to pass. In squeez- 
ing through the crowd, my pocket is picked of a handkerchief, 
which I value far beyond what the thief will get for it ; and I 
would willingly pay him for his dexterity, could I retrieve it. 
We wait from eleven till four. It seems that his Majesty was 
escorted by the militia of Versailles to the Point de Jour, 
where he entered the double file of Parisian Militia, which 
extends from thence to the Hotel de Ville, each line compos- 
ed of three ranks, consequently it is a body six deep extend- 
ing that distance. The Jlssemblee Nationale walk promiscu- 
ously together in the procession. The King's horse-guards, 
some of the Gardes du Corps, and all those who attend him, 
have the cockades of the city, viz. red and blue. It is a 
magnificent procession in every respect. 

'JttJy 1 9th. The painter shows us a piece he is now about 
for the King, taken from the ./Knead j Venus restraining the 
arm, which is raised in the temple of the vestals to shed the 
blood of Helen. I tell him, that he had better paint the storm 
of the Bastile. It will be a more fashionable picture, and that 
one trait will admit of a fine effect. It is one of the Gardes 
Frangaises, who, having got hold of the gate, and unable to 
bring it down, cries to his comrades of the populace, to pull by 
his legs ; and this man has the force and courage to hold, 
while a dozen of them pull him like a rope and bring down 
the gate ; so that he actually sustains the rack. To repre- 
sent him drawn out of joint, with his head turned round en- 
couraging them to draw still harder, must, I think, have a fine 
effect. L'Eveque d'Autun agrees with me entirely in the 
sentiment. I recommend a subscription to collect the various 
papers found in the Bastile, and then to employ an able hand 
to write the annals of that diabolical castle, from the beginning 
of Louis the Fourteenth's reign to the present moment. Some- 



322 LIFE OF 

thing of this sort will, I believe, be done. Give the hint also 
of forming the Gardes Franpaises into a city guard, with very 
high pay ; and to keep up the corps, by putting into it all 
those, who by good conducts hall have merited something more 
than the rank of a common soldier, without being qualified 
for that of a sergeant. 

' July 20th. Go to the Hotel de Ville, and with much 
difficulty find out the Marquis de Lafayettie, who is exhaust- 
ed by a variety of attentions. Tell him I will send his letters 
to America, and that he must give me a passport to visit the 
Bastile. Agree to dine with him, on condition that I may 
bring my own wine. Return home, write, and about four 
go to the Hotel de Lafayette. Find there Madame, the Due 
de la Rochefoucauld, and others. Dine. He gives me my 
passport. Suggest my plan respecting the Gardes Franpaises, 
which he likes. Advise him to have a complete plan for the 
militia prepared, aud to submit it to the Committee. Ask 
him if he can think of any steps, which may be taken, to in- 
duce the King to confer on him the government of the Isle of 
France. He tells me, that he would prefer that of Paris sim- 
ply, that he has the utmost power his heart could wish, and is 
grown tired of it ; that he has commanded absolutely a hun- 
dred thousand men, has marched his Sovereign about the 
streets as he pleased ; prescribed the degree of applause, 
which he should receive, and could have detained him prison- 
er, had he thought proper. He wishes, therefore, as soon as 
possible, to return to private life. 

4 July 22c?. After dinner, walk a little under the arcade of 
the Palais Royal, waiting for my carriage. In this period the 
head and body of M. de Toulon are introduced in triumph. 
The head on a pike, the body dragged naked on the earth. 
Afterwards, this horrible exhibition is carried through the dif- 
ferent streets. His crime is, to have accepted a place in the 
Ministry. This mutilated form of an old man of seventy-five 
is shown to his son-in-law, Bertier, the Intendant of Paris; 
and, afterwards, he also is put to death and cut to pieces, the

populace carrying about the mangled fragments with a savage 
joy. Gracious God, what a people ! ' 

In the first part of August Mr Morris made a tour to Lon- 
don, taking the route of Dier pc and Brighton. He had re- 
turned to Paris on the 13th of September. 

1 September 16ih, 1789. This morning set off for Versailles. 
Alight at the door of Monsieur de la Luzerne. * Neither he 

O 

nor Madame at home. Madame de Montmorin not yet visible, 
and Monsieur occwpe.f Visit at Madame de Tesse's. She is 
abroad, but Madame de Tot is visible at her toilette. Some 
conversation on their affairs, by which I find, that opinions' 
change. Return to Monsieur de Montmorin's to dine. She 
is much afflicted by the state of affairs. Madame de Segur 
comes in with her brothers. She is in great anxiety. Ap- 
prehends that the King will fly. I lell her ; that his flight ap- 
pears to be impracticable. She thinks it will set Paris in a 
flame. There is no conjecturing the consequences. A prince 
so weak can influence very little, either by his presence or ab- 
sence. After dinner, we have a conversation on politics with 
some of the Deputies, in which I endeavor to show them the 
absurdity of their suspensive veto, and the. probable tyranny 
of their single chamber. I had better have let this alone ; but 
zeal always gets the better of prudence. 

' September llth. Go to Mr Jefferson's. The Due de la 
Rochefoucauld comes in from the States-General, and. at 
half past four Lafayette, when we sit down to dinner. He 
tells us, that some of the troops under his command are 
about to march tomorrow to Versailles, to urge the decisions 
of the States-General. This is a rare situation, for which 
they must thank themselves. I ask him, if his troops will

man beings.' 



324 LIFE OF 

obey him. He says, they will not mount guard when it rains ; 
but he thinks that they would readily follow him into action. 
I incline to think, that he will have an opportunity of making 
the experiment. Mention to him my desire to confer on the 
subject of subsistence. He says, that I must come and dine 
with him, but this is idle, if I am rightly informed; because 
he has generally a crowd, and is but a few minutes at home. 

1 September 2GfA. This morning at five I rise and dress, 
but my carriage does not come till half past six. Drive smart- 
ly, arrive at the door of the National Assembly at eight. By 
this means am still in time, and get well seated immediately 
behind my friend. At ten the session is opened. Some 
trifling matter of presents to the Assembly, called the gifts of 
patriotism, but more properly the sacrifices to vanily. After 
these a tedious verbal controversy on the reduction of yes- 
terday's minutes. Much heat, and noise, and impatience, by 
which means half an hour is employed in what ought to 
have been settled in half a minute. The Marquis de Mon- 
tesquiou makes his report. Vast respect for the Premier 
Ministre das Finances, and then sundry details and combina- 
tions, which show that the committee understand the business 
much better than the Minister. At the close, however, of the 
report, there is a feebleness, which they are not, perhaps, fully 
aware of, or perhaps it was unavoidable. They appeal to pa- 
triotism for aid ; but they should in money matters apply on- 
ly to interest. They should never acknowledge such want of 
resource, as to render the aid of patriotism necessary. 

'After the report is read, the Comte de Mirabean objects to 
the consideration of it, and insists that they should immediate- 
ly take up M. Necker's proposition, on which he has a motion 
to make. He is called to the Tribune, and in a style of fine 
irony ur^es the immediate adoption of the plan proposed by 
the Premier Ministre, from the blind confidence which the 
Assembly have in him, and from the unbounded popularity 
which he enjoys. These, says he, in that dreadful situation 
which he has exposed, and in the imminency of danger, which 




GOUVERNEUR. MORRIS. 325 

precludes debate, urge, nay command, us to adopt, without 
examination, what the Minister has devised for our relief. 
Let us then agree to it literally, (textullement) and, if it 
succeeds, let him, as he ought, enjoy the glory. If it fails, 
which Heaven forefend, we will then exercise our talents in 
trying to discover, if yet there remain any means to save 
our country. 

' To my great astonishment, the Representatives of this na- 
tion, who pique themselves on being the modern Athenians, 
are ready to swallow this proposition by acclamation. The 
President, Clermont de Tonnerre, who perceives its tendency, 
throws into a different form the style of adoption. Mirabeau 
immediately rises, and very adroitly parries the stroke, by 
showing that this form is not consistent with his view, which 
the Assembly appeared willing to comply with ; that certainly 
a subject of such magnitude should not be carried by acclama- 
tion, without having the specific form before them ; and, if he 
were to propose a form, it would require at least a quarter of 
an hour to consider and prepare it. He is immediately (by 
acclamation) ordered to redact his proposition, and while he 
is about it, the Bishop d'Autun retires. We remark it. My 
friend acknowledges that they are in league together. The 
world already suspects that union. During their absence, 
there is a great deal of noisy debate on various subjects, if, 
indeed, such controversy may be dignified with the name of 
debate. At length Mirabeau relurns and brings his motion 
forward in consistence with his original idea. The Assembly 
HOW perceive the trap , and, during the tumult, Lally de Tol- 
lendal proposes, that the motion be sent to the Committee of 
Finances to frame an act (Jlrrcle.) Here again Mirabeau 
manuoevres to evade that coup. And while the House are 
hungup in their judgment, or rather entangled from the want 
of judgment, d'Espresmenil makes a motion coincident with 
that of Mirabeau in substance, though contrarient in form. 
There is not sufficient confidence in him, and, therefore, his 
proposition -drops. But it would seem from thence, that he

' October 6th. Paris is all in a tumult. Two heads of the 
Gardes du Corps are brought to town. The Royal Family, 
who are in possession of the Regiment National, late Gardes 
Frangaises, are to come this afternoon. 

' Evening. Capellis gives us a recital of what has passed. 
Many circumstances of insult to the royal personages. The 
Queen obliged to fly from the bed in her undress, with her 
stockings in her hand, to the King's chamber for protection, 
being pursued by the Poissardes. At the Hotel de Pille, M. 
Bailli, in reading the King's speech, omitted in some parts the 
words, avec confiance. The queen corrected him, which pro- 
duced a shout of Vive, la Reine. They are to lodge in the 
chambers fitted up in the Tuileries. The Queen, in retiring to 
her chamber, told her attendants, that, as the King was deter- 
mined to go to Paris, she must accompany him, but she should 
never leave it. Poor lady ! This is a sad presage of what is 
too likely. 

' October Sth. Proceed to Monsieur de Lafayette's. He is 
surrounded. In conference with Clermont de Tonnerre. 
Madame de Lafayette, M. de Stael, and M. de S. his friend are 
en Comite in the salon. This is all petit. Mr Short is there. 
I take a few minutes to tell Lafayette what appears necessa- 
ry, as to a change of administration. He has spoken to Mi- 
rabeau already. I regret it. He thinks of taking one Minis- 
ter from each party. I tell him, that he must have men of 
talents and firmness, and, for the rest, it is no matter. Am to 
dine with him tomorrow and converse on the subject.

the Bishop (d'Autun) and me outj which surprises - 
not a little. We con verse -pretty fully on the arrangement of 
a Ministry. 7 The' getting rid of Necker is a sine- qua non with- 
the Bishop, who wants his place. Indeed,, I? am of the same 
opinion. He gives me .every; assurance. I, can wish respecting 
Lafayette. After arranging the new Ministry, we come , to- 
the finance; the means, of restoring -credit, &&c. , Consider his 
plan respecting the property of the*/ Church. He is bigoted to 
it, and the thing is well. enough 5 but the mode is not so well. 
He.is attached to this, as- an auth(fr, -which is not a good 
symptom Tor a man of business. 

-.* October \\-thi - This morning at oioe.I go to the MarquU 
de Lafayette's. He ia engaged with a gentleman in his, closet 
a long time,, who. a,t Jength comes out and Lafayette with him, 
I.fiod that he wishes to avoid: coming to any points, as to. 
a new administration, therefore - carelessly ask., him, if he, has, 
thoaglit on . the subject of our last conversation./ -This -l^ads, 
us on. I state to him tbe present situation , of , France, and 
the necessity of combining men of talents, who have principle^ 
favorable to liberty. That, without talents, the; opportunity of 
regaining executive authority will be lost, and .that, without 
proper. principles,-the. authority when recovered will be abused. 
That he- cannot possibly act .both as Minister and soldier, 
still less as Minister of every department. That he must 
have coadjutors in.' whom he can confide. That as to the ob- 
jections he has made, on the score of morals in some, he must 
consider that men do not/go into an administration as the direct 
road to Heaven. That they are prompted by ambition .or ,aya- 
rice, and therefore, that the only way to secure the most virtu- 
ous is, by making it their interest to act rightly. He tells me, 
?,hat he means to introduce Maelsherbes as Garde des Sceaux, 
and to the objection that he will not be induced 'to accept, the 
reply is, .that he .will accept from Monsieur de Lafayette, I 
have a stronger, objection, which I do not choose to make, viz. 
that he is not sufficiently .a man of business, although .certain-- 
ly well informed, and possessed of a great deal of understand?

ing. He mentions la Rochefoucauld as Minister of Paris, and 
to the objection that he has not the needful talents, he answers, 
that he will give him a premier commis who has. The Minis- 
ter of War is in the same situation. But they cannot carry 
their commis with them into the Council to deliberate and 
judge. 

' After supper the Bishop d'Autun comes in, and the rest 
go away. I then tell him what has passed with Lafayette, as 
far as is proper, and my future intention, which is to tell him 
that, having done my duty to him and to his country, I quit 
the matter, and leave him to the course of events. I urge the 
union of those, who are to form the new Ministry, and that 
they avow themselves to the people as candidates, and let the 
Court know, that they will come in together, or not at all. He 
thinks this right, and also that the present circumstances have 
sufficient force to consume another administration, before things 
are entirely fixed. He reads to us his motion. It is well done. 
Afterwards, we talk about the best ways and means to effect 
the intended objects, and I give him a few hints on general 
principles, tending to the wealth and happiness of a nation, 
and founded on the sentiments of the human heart. 

' October IQth. The arrangement talked of at present for an 
administration is, to make Necker Premier, the Bishop d'Au- 
tun Minister of Finance, arid Liancourt Minister of War. Mi- 
rabeau (who had yesterday four hours' conversation, not with 
the King, but with Monsieur, and who is to see the King this 
day) wishes to be in the Ministry. An embassy will no long- 
er content him.' 

LETTER FROM MR MORRIS TO GENERAL LAFAYETTE. 

' Paris, October 16th, 1739. 

1 My Dear Sir, 

' I took the liberty in some late conversations to give you 
my sentiments on public affairs. 1 know the folly of offering 
opinions, which bear the appearance of advice, but a regard for 
you, and the sincerest wishes for the prosperity of this kingdom, 
pushed me beyond the line, which caution would have drawn 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 331 

for one of less ardent temper. I do not wish you to consider 
this as an apology. On the contrary, I desire you to recollect, 
both now and hereafter, the suhstance of those conversations. 
In that progress of events, which rapidly advances, you will 
judge my judgment. 

' I am convinced, that the proposed Constitution cannot serve 
for the government of this country ; that the National As- 
sembly, late the object of enthusiastic attachment, will soon be 
treated with disrespect; that the extreme licentiousness of your 
people will render it indispensable to increase the royal au- 
thority ; that under such circumstances the freedom and happi- 
ness of France must depend on the wisdom, integrity, and firm- 
ness of his Majesty's counsels, and, consequently, that the ablest 
and best men should be added to the present administration j 
that, so far as regards yourself, you should take care that those, 
who come in, be sensible of the obligation they owe you, dis- 
posed to repay it, and of a temper neither to desert you, nor 
their sovereign, nor each other, in the moment of danger, or for 
the sake of advantage. I consider the present time as critical, 
and that if neglected many inseparable mischiefs must ensue. 

' Such are the bodingsof a mind, not easily ruffled nor alarm- 
ed, but feelingly alive to the interests of friendship, and devo- 
tedly attached to the liberties of mankind. Certainly you 
have much better means of information than I have. Certain- 
ly you^have that intimate knowledge of your own nation, which 
it is impossible for a stranger to acquire. And most certainly 
you have perfect acquaintance with the characters, which stand 
forward for public observation. Let what I have said there- 
fore go for nothing. I have repeated it here, as being in some 
sort the needful introduction to what I am now to communi- 
cate. 

'Last evening, in company with some of your friends, who 
supposed me to enjoy a share of your confidence, in which I 
assured .them, with great truth, that they were mistaken, I 
\vas urged to visit and entreat you not to go into the Council. 
Knowing how much you are occupied, and how improper it is 



338 :t;of .i-tii-B or 



for me .to ; interfere// I tlecliiied the visit, but was at -length 
prev&iled on by .-earnest 'entreaty to prorfiise, that I;would in a 
letter assign- the.reasons, which influence them, and which are. 
first, that .yew present command must of -necessity engnosd 
your time, and require undissipated attention, and in conse- 
quence that you must foil -in the > duty either of Minister or 
General. Secondly, that when irv Council your opinions will 
not have more weight, and perhaps less-, than they have at pres- 
ent'/becaose at present they are respected as coming from you ', 
but will only be received in Council according to the reasons 
adduced in their support, and it is not always that the wisest 
man is the most eloquent. ' Thirdly, if your opinions do not 
prevail, you wilf have the mortification to sanction by your 
presence the measures, which you disapprove, or quit in dis- 
gust the seat, which you have taken. Fourthly, if your opin- 
ions prevail, you will then in your quality of Generalbe called 
on to execute what in your quality of councillor you have or- 
dained. Tn this situation the puhlic opinion will revolt' unless 
it : be subdued. The one will ruin -you, and the other your 
country, Fifthly, the jealousy and suspicion inseparable from 
tumultuous revolutions, and which have already been malicious- 
ly pointed against you, will certainly follow all your future 
steps, if you appear to be loo strictly connected with the Court. 
The foundations of your authority uili then crumble away, and 
you will fall the object of your own astonishment. Sixthly, the 
retreat of the Duke of Orleans is attributed to you, and if you 
go into the Council immediately after what is called by some 
his flight, and by others his banishment, the two events will be 
coupled in a manner particularly disadvaniageous and disa- 
greeable.- Seventhly, if you go into the Ministry with Mira- 
beau, or about the same time, every honest Frenchman will 
ask'hhnself the cuuse of what he will call a very strange coali- 
tion. There are in this world men, who are to be employed ; 
not trusted. Virtue must ever be sullied by an alliance with 
vice. And liberty witt blush at her introduction, if led by a 
hand polluted. Lastly, lam earnestly, most earnestly, request- 






GOUVERNEUR MOHRIS. 333 

ed by those who love you well, to add one caution as to your 
friends. Trust those who had that honor before the twelfth 
of July. New friends are zealous, they are ardent, they are 
attentive, but they are seldom true. 

' Excuse the liberty of an old one, who is truly yours, 

' GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.' 

' October 18th. Converse about the intended changes in the 
administration. I insist that Mirabeau be not brought into the 
Council. That they are mistaken in supposing that he can, 
after that elevation, preserve his influence in the Assembly. 
That introducing a man of such bad character will injure them 
in the public opinion; and that everything depends, in the 
present moment, upon the preservation of that opinion. The 
Bishop (d'Autun) tells me that, in his opinion, no administra- 
tion can work well, in which M. Necker has a share. After 
he is gone, Madame tells me, that Lafayette is determined 
not to let Montesquiou come into the war department. This 
Mirabeau told the Bishop. And Montesquiou told her, that 
Necker declares that the calculations in the Bishop's motion 
are pitiful. This accounts for his opinion delivered to me. 
Lafayette has committed a great blunder in opening himself 
to Mirabeau. If he employs him, it will be disgraceful ; and, 
if he neglects him, it will he dangerous, because every conver- 
sation gives hirn rights and means. 

'November 1st. At five, I visit the Marquis de Lafayette. 
He tells me that he has followed my advice, though he did 
not answer my letter. I congratulate him on what passed two 
days ago from a gentleman to the Count de Mirabeau, which 
was so pointedly affrontive as to ruin him, because he cannot 
be now placed in the Ministry, and is lost in the opinion of 
the Assembly. He asks, with eagerness, if I think he is lost 
with them. I reply, that the Bishop d'Autun has just ex- 
pressed that opinion to me. He says that he does not know 
the Bishop much, but should be glad to know him more. I 
offer to give them a dinner together the day after tomorrow.

racies, fee. &c. Thus it is that mankind in similar situa- 
tion always adopt a correspondent conduct. I had some con- 
versation before supper with the Count de Segur, who disap- 
proves of the Bishop's oration ; and so, indeed, do most others. 
And they blame particularly those things, which I had advised 
him to alter. He has something of the author about him. 
But the lender attachment to our literary productions is by no 
means suitable to a Minister. To sacrifice great objects for 
the sake of small ones is an inverse ratio of moral proportion. 
' December 26th. At club a member of the Committee of 
Finances mentions, that the totality of the public debt here is 
about 4,700,000,000 livres, including herein all reimburse- 
ments of charges of every kind, arid calculating the Viagere^ at 
ten years' purchase. That it may amount, perhaps, to 4,800, 
000,000 livres ; that is, to 200,000,000 sterling. This then is 
the extreme of a burthen, which this kingdom totters under. 
The Abbe d'Espagnac insists, that it is not so much by a great 
deal. While the dispute on this subject is at the height, a 
gentleman arrives, who communicates the extraordinary intel- 
ligence that Monsieur, the King's brother, has been to the 
Communes, and made a speech on the subject of a charge cir- 
culated against him yesterday, that he was at the head of the 
supposed plot against Monsieur Bailli and Monsieur de Lafay- 
ette. Go to Madame de Chastellux's. While there, the Che- 
valier de Graave brings us Monsieur's speech. It is very well 
written ; but has the fault of calling himself a citizen, and 
again, his audience fellow citizens. Go to the Louvre. Ma- 
dame tells me the history of this speech. Monsieur, yesterday, 
upon hearing of the slander, applied to the Due de Livi, who, 
not knowing what advice to give him, applied to the Bishop 
d'Autun, who made the speech for him. This morning, 
Monsieur applied to the King, and asked him if he meant to 
send another of his brothers out of the kingdom, and then 
went on to complain of the slander. This touches Lafayette, 
who has too many of these little matters on the anvil. It was 
then determined, that Monsieur should go to the Ville. 




GOUVERNEUR MOItRIS. 337 

ember 27th. After dinner I speak to Lafayette about 
Monsieur's speech to the Commons. He takes Short and me 
into his closet. Tells us, that for a long time he has .had 
information of a plot, that he has followed the track, and 
at length taken M. de Favras, that on M. de Favras was 
found a letter from Monsieur, which seemed to show that he 
was but too deeply concerned in it, that he had immediately 
waited upon him with that letter, which he delivered, telling 
Monsieur, that it was known only to him and Monsieur Bailli ; 
consequently, that he was not compromised, that Monsieur 
was much rejoiced at this intelligence, that yesterday morning, 
however, he sent for him, and, being surrounded by his cour- 
tiers, spoke in high terms respecting a note, which had been 
circulated the evening before, charging him with being at the 
head of the conspiracy. Lafayette told him, that he knew of 
but one way to discover the authors, which was by offering a 
reward, which should be done. That Monsieur then declared 
his determination to go to the town-house in the afternoon, and 
that, in consequence, due preparation was made to receive him 
when he should come, that he carne and pronounced the speech 
we have seen, which was written by Mirabeau, whom he con- 
siders as an abandoned rascal. 

' Every man is dear to himself. All the world knew Mira- 
beau to be a rascal, when Lafayette connected himself with 
him ; but it is in this moment only, that he feels the misery 
of such a connexion. T remind him of the warnings I had 
given, with respect to Mirabeau, and add the intelligence, which 
the Count de Luxembourg desired me to convey, viz. that 
Mirabeau had sworn, that he would ruin Lafayette. I then 
tell him, that this step of Monsieur has thrown the cards into 
his hands. That he has placed himself at the head of the re- 
volution, in which place he ought to be kept ; because, if there 
should happen any counter revolution, he secures the heads 
of all others against accidents; and, if the revolution is iully 
effected, the nullity of his character will of course seclude him 
from all weight and authority.

' January 1st, 1790. I go to Monsieur <le Lafayette's a long 
time before the company assemble. Dine at half past four. 
He tells me that Monsieur and Mirabeau are closely allied ; 
that one is a weak and indolent creature, the other an active 
and artful rascal. I tell him that they must finish the trial of 
Bezenvald, because the people be^in to take his part, and that, 
of course, a violent torrent n;ay be turned against his prosecu- 
tors. This affects him. To nr surprise he tells me that, 
notwithstanding my criticisms on the Assemllce, I must ac- 
knowledge that their Constitution is better than that of Eng- 
land. I assure him that he is much mistaken, if he imagines 
that to be my opinion. 

' January 12th. There has been a riot this day in Paris, 
and a number of the militaire, who were engaged in the squab- 
ble, have been taken prisoners. The matter is not as yet 
thouroughly understood. But all agree, that Lafayette has 
acted with great prudence and decision. 

' January 19th. Dine at the Palais Royal. The Dutchess 
after dinner tells me, that the Duke's treasurer does not pay, 
as he ought to do, monthly ; and that, unless this is done, 
she will not adhere to the contract. She receives now 450,- 
000 livres per annum, of which 350,000 are appropriated to 
the house servants, table, &c. near 15,000 louis. Certainly 
a great economy might be made upon this article.

ing the matter, that his advisers to that step give him un con- 
seil ou inepte ou perfide.' 

It was at this time, that Mr Morris addressed a note to the 
Queen of France, containing advice as to the course, whict 
the King ought to pursue. He opposed the idea, that tl 
King should place himself at the head of the revolution, alleg- 
ing that he had already gathered fruits but too bitter from his 
intercourse with the Assembly, and all that he had now to do

was to remain quiet, and let things take their course. Disas- 
ters were thickening, confusion would follow, and ere long the 
people would be disgusted with the novelties, that were work- 
ing so much to their injury, and they would then return to their 
King, ' and offer him the spoils, which they had wrested from 
him, and it would depend on him alone to ensure the happi- 
ness of France.' A Constitution, securing the liberties of the 
nation, suited to ks condition, and acceptable to a wise and 
benevolent King, might then be framed. At present nothing 
should be done. This paper was handed to the Queen by

effect upon reasonable minds, it must be to prove more clear- 
ly the feebleness of his Ministers.'

ON the twenty-first of January, Mr Morris received a letter 
from General Washington, appointing him a private agent to 
transact important affairs with the British Ministry, and enclo- 
sing credentials for that purpose. From the time Mr Adams 
left England, there had been no American Minister at that 
Court, and points of deep interest to the United States now 



340 LIFE OF 

existed, on which it was desirable for the American govern- 
ment to ascertain the views of the cabinet of London. 

Mr Morris was detained in Paris till the fifteenth of Februa- 
ry, when he set off for England. Business calling him to Hol- 
land, he took Brussels, Antwerp, and Amsterdam in his route, 
and at length crossed the channel from Helvcetsluys to Har- 
wich. 

About five weeks from the time he left Paris, we find him at 
his hotel in London, prepared to enter upon the commission, 
with which he had been entrusted by the President of the 
United States. The day after his arrival, he wrote a note to 
the Duke of Leeds, one of the Ministry, requesting an in- 
terview, which was granted for the next day. 

Up to this period, some of the articles of the treaty of peace 
between Great Britain and linited States had not been execut- 
ed by the former, and this had caused complaints and unea- 
siness with the latter. In regard to two of these articles, Mr 
Morris was charged to ascertain the intentions of the British 
government. The first related to the compensation for negroes, 
taken from the Southern States during the war ; and the second, 
to the fortified posts on the frontiers, situate .within the limits 
of the United States. Hitherto the British had declined pay- 
ing for the negroes, and the posts they still held in contraven- 
tion of the treaty. Another topic of inquiry was, whether the 
British cabinet were disposed to enter into a treaty of com- 
merce with the United States. And a fourth, whether they 
intended to send a Minister to America. 

At the first interview, when the Duke of Leeds read Mr 
Morris's letter of credence, he expressed a marked satisfaction 
with its contents, and said, ' I am very happy to see this letter, 
and under the President's own hand ; I assure you, it is very 
much my wish to cultivate a friendly and commercial inter- 
course between the two countries.' But as the conversation 
proceeded, it was manifest that his Grace of Leeds was pre- 
pared to go no further, than to reiterate general assurances of 
good will, and the disposition of his Majestiy's government to 



OOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 341 

maintain a friendly intercourse. It was his idea, that the ar- 
ticles ought to be performed in the order in which they stood 
in the treaty ; and, as the United Stales had not yet complied 
with the article, stipulating the payment of debts due before 
the war to British subjects, they could not rightfully demand 
compensation for the negroes, till that article should be per- 
formed. This argument had a sound basis, though the idea, 
that the articles of a treaty are to be executed in the order of 
their arrangement, is illusory, and would prevent the perform- 
ance of any treaty, if each party should choose to hold out 
till the other takes the lead. It was nevertheless true, that 
the British debts had not been paid, and the reason was, that 
the national government wanted power to compel the payment, 
but since the adoption of the Constitution they were invested 
with the power, and this reason had censed to exist. The 
Supreme Court held jurisdiction over cases of this sort, and the 
British creditors had only to bring their suits before that tribu- 
nal. It was further urged, in extenuation of past delinquency, 
that the Southern States, which had been the most blamed on 
this score, had been deprived of the labor of their negroes, 
and of the stipulated compensation, which would have furnish- 
ed a resource for the payment of these same debts. 

In regard to the posts, the Minister said nothing. When 
the topic was pressed, he turned the conversation. Mr Mor- 
ris then gently hinted, that it was a circumstance, which had 
not made an agreeable impression in the United States, that 
his Majesty had forborne to send them a Minister, while they 
had one residing for two or three years in London. The 
Duke of Leeds rejoined, that it was his wish to send one, that 
the thing had often been thought of, but it was difficult to find 
a person of adequate abilities, who would be acceptable to the 
people of the United States; and, besides, America was a 
great way off, and many did not like to go so far. It may be 
imagined, that Mr Morris did not think it worth while to dis- 
cuss these reasons. He suggested to his Grace, that he might 
possibly wish to consider the matter a little, and read over 
29* 



LIFE OF 



ihe treaty and the American Constitution, before they proceed- 
ed further. He then gave him General Washington's letter, 
that he might have it copied, and took his leave. The busi- 
ness of a commercial treaty did not come up at this interview. 

Three weeks had passed away, when he received a letter 
from the Duke of Leeds, in which he lamented, that the Uni- 
ted States had failed to comply with the engagements in the 
treaty, by which they were in the most solemn manner bound, 
and added, ' should the delay in fulfilling them have rendered 
their final completion impracticable, we have no scruple in 
declaring our object is to retard the fulfilling such subsequent 
parts of the treaty, as depend entirely upon Great Britain, un- 
til redress is granted to our subjects upon the specific points 
of the treaty itself, on a fair and just compensation obtained 
for the non-performance of those engagements on the part of 
the United States.' As to a commercial treaty, the Minister 
wrote so vaguely, that no definite impressions could be deriv- 
ed from his language, and hence it was reasonable to infer, 
that the British government really did not wish to enter into 
such a treaty. 

To this note Mr Morris replied, by requesting an explana- 
tion, or rather an explicit statement, of the particulars in the 
treaty, to the fulfilment of which the United States had been 
bound, and which had been rendered impracticable ; and, 
moreover, the nature and extent of the redress expected for 
the subjects of his Britannic Majesty, and the measure of 
compensation required, as preliminary to a perfect execution 
of the treaty on the part of Great Britain. Till these things 
were brought into a definite, tangible form, they could neither 
be understood nor discussed, obstacles could not be removed, 
nor remedies provided. 

Nothing further passed till the nineteenth of May, when Mr 
Morris had occasion to call the attention of the Minister to 
another subject. The affair at Nootka Sound, in which two 
British vessels had been captured by the Spaniards, was looked 
upon as an insult by the government, and the press-gangs 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 343 

were set in mdfton to recruit sailors for the navy, with the 
avowed design of retaliating for this outrage. In consequence 
of this step, several American seamen were impressed, and ap- 
plications made by the captains for their relief. As there was 
no Minister, consul, or other public agent in London, from' the 
United States, there was no mode of bringing these applica- 
tions in form before the government. In this state of things 
Mr Morris thought it his duty to interfere, and upon his re- 
quest the Duke of Leeds consented to hold a conversation on 
ilu: subject. The great difficulty, which then existed, and 
which always will exist, of distinguishing between English and 
American seamen, was stated and examined, and Mr Morris 
suggested the idea, that certificates of citizenship, granted by 
admiralty courts in America, should be admitted as a protec- 
tion to American seamen. 

The interview was continued the next day in presence of 
Mr Pitt, the Prime Minister, who took the lead of the conver- 
sation. He was pleased with Mr Morris's plan of the protecting 
certificates, but thought, in spite of every caution in the admi- 
ralty offices, that it was subject to abuse. No doubt ; yet it 
was for the interest of the British government to wink at such 
abuse, rather than risk the consequences of the practice now 
begun, which would sow the seeds of national animosity, and 
produce innumerable evils. The plan of certificates was then 
discussed, and a mode of carrying it into effect was dwelt upon 
in detail by Mr Morris. 

From this topic the discourse diverged to others, upon 
which, as before, Mr Pitt was the chief spokesman. The 
Ministers both declared, however, that the Duke's letter had 
been misunderstood, respecting a treaty of commerce, intimat- 
ing that such a treaty was desired. They next advanced to 
the business of compensation and the posts, in which Mr Pitt 
took the same ground, of course, as had already been held by 
the Duke of Leeds, and adhered to it in terms as general and 
vague. He seemed, also, to have an idea of making a new 
treaty, in which matters should be arranged and difficulties 



344 LIFE or 

settled ; but Mr Morris saw no occasion for this,' and thought it 
would be better to perform the old one. 

In regard to sending a Minister to the United States, Mr 
Pitt inquired if one would bo sent in return. Mr Morris was 
not authorized to say so, but there could hardly be a doubt. A 
Minister had already been sent to England, on the proposal of 
the British government to exchange Ministers, but they had 
sent none on their part, and now it was necessary for them to 
make the first advances. This was due to the dignity of the 
United States, and it was very easy to arrange the form of 
communication. Let a Minister be appointed, and his depar- 
ture delayed, till it should be ascertained that another was ap- 
pointed in the United States. ' I assured him,' says Mr Morris 
in writing to General Washington, 'that the rulers of America 
have too much understanding to care for etiquette, but prayed 
him at the same time to remember, that they (the British) had 
hitherto kept us at a distance, instead of making advances ; 
that you had gone quite as far as they had any reason to ex- 
pect, in writing the letter just mentioned, but that from what 
had passed in consequence of it, and which, as he might natu- 
rally suppose, I had transmitted, we could not but consider 
them as wishing to avoid an intercourse.' Mr Pitt observed 
that this was a wrong impression, which he ought to remove, 
and that they were disposed to cultivate friendly connexions. 
Mr Morris replied, tint, if such was their sentiment, it should 
be given in writing, that there might be no mistake. 

' 1 observed further,' says Mr Morris, ' that our disposition 
towards a good understanding was evidenced, not only by your 
letter, but also by the decision of a majority of the House of 
Representatives, against laying extraordinary restrictions on 
British vessels in our ports. Mr Pitt said, that instead of re- 
strictions, we ought to give them particular privileges, in return 
for those which we enjoy here. I assured him that I knew of 
none, except that of being impressed, a privilege which of all 
others we least wished to partake of. The Duke of Leeds 
observed, in the same style of jocularity, that we were at least 



GOUVKKNEUK MORRIS. 345 

treated in that respect as the most favored nation, seeing that 
we were treated like themselves. But Mr Pitt said seriously, 
that they had certainly evinced good will towards us, by 
what they had done respecting our commerce. I replied, 
therefore, with like seriousness, that their regulations had been 
dictated by a view to their own interest ; and, therefore, as we 
felt no favor, we owned no obligation.' 

Here the interview terminated, with the promise of the 
Ministers to consult together, and let him know the result of 
their deliberations. From these hints it may be gathered, 
that the conversation was animated and warm, but the views 
of the British government, on all the main topics of discussion, 
were left enveloped in as dark a cloud of uncertainty, as they 
were when General Washington wrote his letter. The infer- 
ence of Mr Morris was therefore just, that they were not dis- 
posed to second any advances towards new arrangements. 
He waited till the tenth of September, when another letter 
from the Duke of Leeds convinced him, that his impressions 
were correct, and that it would be in vain to pursue the objects 
of his mission further. He had another interview, and much 
talk with his Grace, but not more satisfactory, as to the main 
points at issue. 

It was Mr Morris's opinion, that the British government 
were willing, that their relations with America should remain 
unchanged, till they should see what course the affairs of Eu- 
rope would take, and this conjecture was borne out by suc- 
ceeding events. The prospect of war or peace might make 
an essential difference with them, as to the terms on which 
their interest would dictate permanent arrangements with the 
United States. Delay could do no harm, and, in the present 
crisis, there was a fair ground for anticipating, that it might be 
turned to an advantage. The same argument, though in the 
opposite direction, was just as strong on the side of the United 
States. If England were entangled in a European war, she 
would be more likely to yield to the just demands and seek 
the good offices of her American friends ; and if she remained 



346 LIFE OF 

at peace, she could never have more encouragement, from the 
aspect of her fortunes, than at present, ior assuming an air of 
reserve and indifference. If delay was policy on one side, 
therefore, it was equally so on the other, as far as distant ob- 
jects and general interests were concerned, but the internal 
condition of the United States, at the outset of the new gov- 
ernment, .made it important to them, that the articles of the 
treaty of peace should be speedily performed by Great Bri- 
tain. 

When Mr Morris first arrived in London, he made known 
the cbjects of his mission to the French Minister, enjoining 
secrecy. His motive was, as he declares in his Diary, that 
the American government might always have it in their power 
to say to the French Court, that they had taken no steps, in 
regard to the treaty of peace, without the knowledge of 
their ally. This was surely an honorable motive, but the 
result proved, that prudence is sometimes a safer virtue 
than honor. The secret was poorly kept -by his friend, M. 
de la Luzerne, who, in the trne spirit of a diplomatist, made 
a handle of it to the British Ministry, and contrived to fix the 
impression, that the first movement came from his Court. 
The thing went out from this source, and, getting to the ears 
of Washington and the American cabinet, operated to Mr 
Moriis's disadvantage in that quarter. It was pretended, that 
the disclosure of M. de la Luzerne was the reason, why the 
British Ministry showed so much reserve in their negotiation 
with the American agent, not being flattered with the idea of 
French influence mingling in this manner with the American 
councils. Mr Morris was also charged, by his political oppo- 
nents at home, with seeking the society of the opposition in 
England, and thus associating himself with men, who were 
odious to the Ministers, and losing his weight with them on 
that account. 

When these reports and charges came to his knowledge, he 
doubted the former and denied the latter. M. de la Luzerne 
was then dead, but Mr Morris did not believe he had disclosed 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 347 

the secret, because, to say nothing of honor, he had a direct 
interest in keeping it to himself, for he was afraid the Ameri- 
can government would call on France to support their claims, 
which, in the deranged state of French affairs at that time, 
would have been an awkward and disagreeable circumstance. 
He was well advised of the British views concerning the trea- 
ty, and, therefore, it was his best policy to appear unacquaint- 
ed with the demand of the United States. This is plausible 
enough, but still, the temptation of divulging a secret, which 
gave consequence to the Minister and his government, was 
greater, perhaps, than M. de la Luzerne's diplomatic ambition 
found strength to resist, even at the hazard of a little policy. 
If the tale was not told by him, how did it get abroad ? It evi- 
dently leaked out through the medium of the British cabinet, 
and it could only find its way there, by the obliging communi- 
cativeness of the French Ambassador. But, after all, there 
is no cause for believing, that Mr Pitt and the Duke of Leeds 
were influenced, in the negotiation, by any views of the subject 
connected with this fact. They acted from other and deep- 
er motives. As to the story of his frequenting the opposition, 
it was the forgery of malice or ignorance. Mr Morris affirms, 
that, purposely to avoid suspicion on this ground, he took spe- 
cial pains to walk in another track, and that Fox, the Cory- 
pheus of the party, he never met but twice during the period 
of his agency. 

In returning to France, Mr Morris made a rapid excursion 
through the Netherlands and Germany, by the way of Dun- 
kirk, Ghent, Antwerp, Aix la Chapelle, Cologne, Coblentz, 
Francfort, Darmstadt, Manheim, and Strasburg. It seems to 
have been a journey merely for exercise and observation, for 
he stopped but a short time only at the principal towns. His 
Diary presents little else, than the daily incidents common to 
every traveller, remarks on the inns, roads, vehicles of convey- 
ance, the slowness of their movements, obstinacy of postillions, 
and the like, events and circumstances more interesting to him 
at the moment, than the detail of them would be to the reader. 



348 LIFE or 

There is a great deal about the face of the country, soil, and 
agriculture, to which, in passing through different countries, his 
attention was always much attracted, as indicating the condi- 
tion of the inhabitants, and national resources. In the towns 
he likewise visited the objects usually pointed out to travellers, 
as things to be seen, and he talks now and then, but not often, 
of antiquities, architecture, and paintings. 

He proceeded up the Rhine to Francfort, and thence by the 
usual route through Strasburg to Paris. Here things presented 
themselves much as he had left them six months before, the 
revolutionary excitement still increasing, and the same porten- 
tous uncertainty hanging over the future. He went to the club, 
one of his former haunts, where he ' found the sentiment aris- 
tocratique prevailing not a little,' and, from sundry circumstan- 
ces, it may be inferred, that his own aristocratic tendencies, in 
regard to France, had not suffered diminution during his ab- 
sence. His friend de Moustier was busy in making a Constitu- 
tion, ' and as usual on the high ropes of royal prerogative.' De 
Moustier had the happiness to ' stand better at Court, than he 
had himself ever expected.' According to him, ' the King and 
Queen were determined never to abuse their authority, if 
they should recover it.' The Queen had been particularly 
gracious, and de Moustier ' expected to be consulted on affairs 
by and bye.' Mr Morris called on Lafayette, who ' affected 
to be very well pleased to see him,' and asked him to dine the 
next day. This accordingly took place, but Lafayette was so 
much occupied, that he came late to dinner and retired soon, 
which left no time for a conversation, which Mr Morris wished 
to hold with him upon a special topic. For this cause, or 
some other, he went away a little out of humor. 

' November 19th. Go to the Palais Royal. We meet here 
the Due de Laval. After dinner, I have some conversation 
with him and the Count de Thiare, from whence I apprehend 
that a serious plan is laid for introducing troops of the Empe- 
ror, in order to liberate the King and Queen, and restore the 
former government. After dinner go to the Comedie Fran- 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 349 

fats, and sit with the Dutchess, to hear Brutus. Thence to 
Madame de Segur's, where I take up Madame de Chastellux. 
In the way home, she tells me that she is persuaded there will 
be an effort made by the Emperor in favor of his sister. I 
hinted to the Count de Thiare the advantages, that would re- 
sult from putting the Dauphin into the hands of governors, 
and sending him upon his travels. 

' November 25th. After dinner I go to Lafayette's. Ma- 
dame receives me coolly enough. I stay some time leaning on 
the chimney piece. He comes out, and, as soon as he sees 
me, approaches. Asks why 1 do not come and see him. I 
answer, that I do not like to mix with the crowd, which I 
find here. That whenever I can be useful, lam at his orders. 
He desires me to call tomorrow at three. 

'November %6th. Go to Lafayette's. Converse about 
half an hour. He asks my opinion of his situation. I give it 
sans menagement. 1 tell him that the time approaches, when 
all good men must cling to the Throne. That the present 
King is very valuable, on account of his moderation ; and if he 
should possess too great authority, might be persuaded to grant 
a proper Constitution. That the thing called a Constitution, 
which the jlssemblee have framed, is good for nothing. That, 
as to himself, his personal situation is very delicate. That he 
nominally, but not really, commands his troops. That I real- 
ly cannot tell how he is to establish discipline among them ; 
but, unless he can accomplish that object, he must be ruined, 
sooner or later. That the best line of conduct, perhaps, 
would be to seize an occasion of disobedience and resign, by 
which means he could preserve a reputation in France, which 
would be precious, and hereafter useful. He says, that he is 
only raised by circumstances and events, so that when they 
cease he sinks, and, the difficulty now is, how to excite them. 
I observe, that events will arise fast enough of themselves, if he 
can but make a good use of them, which I doubt, because I 
do not place any confidence in his troops. 

' He asks, what I think of a plan in agitation, with respect

to the protesting Bishops, viz. to withhold their revenues. I tell 
him, that the Assembly must turn them out of doors naked, if 
they wish the people to clothe them. He says he is a little 
afraid of that consequence. I reiterate to him the necessity of 
restoring the nobility, at which, of course, he flinches, and says 
that he should like two Chambers as in America. I tell him, 
that an American Constitution will not do for this country, and 
that two such Chambers would not answer, where there is a he- 
reditary Executive. That every country must have a consti- 
tution suited to its circumstances, and the state of France re- 
quires a higher toned government, than that of England.' 

After this interview, there is an occasional hint in Mr Mor- 
ris's Diary, that Lafayette was cold to him, and perhaps he 
was not much surprised, that it should be so. Conversations, 
like the above, were but ill suited to create the warmth, or ce- 
ment the bonds of friendship. In truth, their political creeds 
were constructed on principles so opposite and discordant, that 
it was not possible for them to harmonize in opinion or action, 
respecting subjects of that nature. It will be seen as we ad- 
vance, however, that whatever temporary coldness may have 
existed, on account of these political differences, the sense of 
personal regard and respect remained as strong as ever, and 
that proofs of a true friendship were not wanting, when oppor- 
tunity called for their exhibition and use. 

It would seem, that the Bishop d'Autun had a project 
to get himself appointed Ambassador to the Austrian Court. 
The following is Mr Morris's advice in that matter. 

c December 6th. The Bishop d'Autun comes in. I speak 
to him again on the subject of an embassy to Vienna, and 
mark out the means of succeeding. I tell him that, at present, 
it is equally dangerous to be in or out of the Assembly. That 
a foreign employ is the only means of preserving himself en 
evidence, and that, if he can make himself the confidential man 
between the Queen and her brother, he will be in the straight 
road to greatness, whenever circumstances will render it desir- 
able.' 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 1 351 

Mr Morris had hardly been a month in Paris, when he 
returned again to London. His commercial and money trans- 
actions had been multiplying, from the time of his first arrival 
in Europe, and they were now grown so extensive and com- 
plicated, as to absorb his time and thoughts. ' Never in my 
life,' said he, ' have I had so many different things agitating 
my mind, as at present, and I cannot commence one affair, be- 
cause another is constantly obiruding.' This will not be doubt- 
ed, if we recur to a few of the objects, to which he lias been de- 
voted since leaving America. 

In the first place, he had in charge a troublesome business, 
entrusted to him by Robert Mortis, respecting a contract for 
supplying tobacco on a large scale. This has already been 
mentioned. Next, he had agreed with M. Necker to furnish 
twenty thousand barrels of flour by a given time, for the sub- 
sistence of Paris. The order reached America in the middle 
of winter, when the article was scarce, dear, and difficult to be 
collected in so large a quantity.. The consequences were de- 
lay, disappointment, and loss. For some time, he was con- 
cerned with banking houses in Holland and France, in nego- 
tiating for the purchase of a portion of the American debt, 
which M. Necker, wishing to recruit his stock of ready cash, 
proposed to sell. But the thing proved abortive. Robert 
Morris had two ships, which he destined for a cotton voyage 
to Surat and Bombay, and which were to be fitted out in Eu- 
rope, under the direction of Gouverneur Morris. They were 
to take out wines and specie, and to bring home cotton to the 
European market. Two or three good voyages of this kind 
had recently been made. But the enterprise did not promise 
well now, and was thought in the end to be unworthy of pur- 
suit. In London he was concerned in shipping operations with 
two or three houses, and was some way engaged in consigning 
tea to merchants in Flanders. He also fitted out an India 
voyage in London, on account of his mercantile connexions in 
America. But a very important part of his business was to 
find purchasers of wild lands, belonging to Robert Morris, him- 



352 LIFE OF 

self, and others, lying mostly in the State of New York. He 
was a long time negotiating with the Penn family, in regard to 
their estates and other property in Pennsylvania, proposing to 
buy the whole ; and the same, also, of the Fairfax estate in 
Virginia. 

The purchase of the American debt to Spain was another 
project, recommended by his correspondents in the United 
States. While Mr Jay was Minister in Spain, the Court of 
that nation, after many deceptive promises, squeezed out the 
pitiful sum of one hundred and seventy-four thousand dollars, 
as a loan to the Americans, in assisting them to carry on a war 
against her enemies and theirs. Nothing had since been done 
about this debt. The Spanish government, little pleased prob- 
ably with the recollection of the circumstances attending its 
origin, had never mentioned it, and the Americans had not yet 
been in a condition to search after debts, which their creditors 
permitted to rest. This debt it was supposed might be pur- 
chased on such terms, as to be a good speculation, since the 
government under the new constitution would undoubtedly 
make timely arrangements for paying all foreign debts. 

When Dr Franklin first went to France, he and Silas 
Deane made an extensive contract with the Farmers General 
to supply them with tobacco, on the part of the American 
government, for which the money was advanced to the full 
amount of the contract. But a portion of the tobacco only was 
supplied, and a claim still existed against the United States for 
the surplus. This claim Mr Morris was commissioned to pur- 
chase, or rather to make an arrangement for furnishing the 
tobacco, according to the original terms of the contract, and 
assuming the demand against the United States. Thia, again, 
was a matter of speculation. He was engaged in seeking a 
private loan for a Company, and another for Robert Morris, 
and in superintending the general concerns of the latter in Eu- 
rope. In performing all the above operations, he kept up a 
constant and labored correspondence in the English and French 
languages, with bankers and merchants in Philadelphia, New 
York, London, Paris, Antwerp, Amsterdam, and Hamburg. 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 353 

And this he did, for the most pan, without any assistant or 
clerk, his letters and accounts, according to his usual custom, 
being written and copied out by his own hand. 

Although his residence was in Paris, yet his business called 
him often to London. In the course of the year 1791, he 
made this journey three or four times. On the 19th of Janu- 
ary, he arrived in Paris, after a month's absence in England. 

' January 19th, 1791. Visit Madame de Chastellux, and go 
with her to dine at the Dutchess of Orleans. Her Royal High- 
ness is ruined, that is, she is reduced from 450,000 to 200,- 
000 livres per annum. She tells me, that she cannot give 
any good dinners; but, if I will come and fast with her, she 
will be glad to see me. 

' January 25th. At three o'clock go to dine with Madame 
de Stael, who is not yet come in. The Abbe Syeyes is here, 
and descants with much self-sufficiency on government, despi- 
sing all that has been said or sung on that subject before him ; 
and Madame says, that his writings and opinions will form in 
politics a new era, as those of Newton in physics. 

'January %9th, At noon take up Madame de Chastellux, 
and we go together to Choisy, and dine with Marmontel. He 
thinks soundly. After dinner he mentions his mode of contest- 
ing the new-fangled doctrine of the Droits d'homme, by asking 
a definition of the word droit. And, from that definition, he 
draws a conclusion against the asserted equality of rights. 
He admits, however, that all are equal before the law and un- 
der the law. I deny this position, and make him remark, that 
where there is great inequality of rank and fortune, this sup- 
posed equality of legal dispensation would destroy all propor- 
tion, consequently all justice. If the punishment be a fine, it 
oppresses the poor, but does not affect the rich. If it be a 
corporal punishment, it degrades the Prince, but does not 
wound the beggar. I draw only one conclusion, that in mor- 
als every general position requires numerous exceptions, 
wherefore logical conclusions from such positions must fre- 
quently be erroneous. I might have pursued, as I have some- 
30* 



354 LIFE or 

times done, my remarks a little farther to the legal compensa- 
tion for injuries, where the varieties are greater, because the 
party committing, and the party suffering wrong, may each 
be of different rank in society. I might go farther, and notice 
those varieties of sentiment, which the manners of different 
nations introduce into social life ; for it is a fact, that " the ill 
we feel is most in apprehension." The legislator, therefore, 
who would pare down the feelings of mankind to the metaphy- 
sical standard of his own reason, would show little knowledge, 
though he might display much genius. 

' February 24tk. At noon walk till I am pretty well tired, 
and then go to the Louvre to dine. Madame is in bed ill. 
When she got home last night, she found in a blank envelope 
a will of her Bishop (d'Autun,) making her his heiress. In 
consequence of some things he had dropped in conversation, 
she concluded that he was determined to destroy himself, and 
therefore spent a night in great agitation, and in tears. M. 
de St Foi, whom she roused at four o'clock in the morning, 
could not find the Bishop, he having slept near the church in 
which he was this day to consecrate two Bishops lately elect- 
ed. At length it turns out, that, pursuant to repeated menaces, 
he feared the clergy would cause him to be this day destroy- 
ed, and had ordered the letter not to be delivered till the 
evening, meaning to take it back again, if he lived through the 
day. 

'March 3d. M. Barmont and Monsieur de Bergasse came 
in.* We have much conversation on public affairs, which 
forms the object of their visit. They tell me, that the Queen 
is now intriguing with Mirabeau, the Count de Lamarck, and 
the Count de Mercy, (Austrian Ambassador in Paris,) who en- 
joy her confidence. They wish to visit me again. They tell 
me that Mirabeau, whose ambition renders him the mortal 
enemy of Lafayette, must succeed in ruining him by the in- 



* M. Bergasse was the only one of the Deputies, who refused to take 
the oath of fidelity to the Constitution, on the fourth of February, 
1790. 







GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 355 

strumentality of his compeers in the Department. I incline 
to think, however, that Lafayette will hold a good tug, being 
as cunning as anybody. Mirabeau has much greater talents, 
and his opponent a better character. 

' April 1st. Mirabeau died this day. I tell the Bishop 
d'Autun, that he should step into the vacancy he has made, 
and, to that effect, should pronounce his funeral oration, in 
which he should make a summary of his life, and dwell par- 
ticularly on the last weeks in which he labored to establish or- 
der. Then dwell on the necessity of order, and introduce 
properly the King. He says, that his thoughts have run 
much upon that subject this day. I tell him, that he has not 
a moment to lose, and that such occasions rarely present 
themselves. I spoke to the Count de Montmorin about 
a successor to Mirabeau this day, but he tells me, that he can- 
not easily see who shall be put in his place. He owns that 
Mirabeau was determined to ruin Lafayette, and says, that he 
had held him back for some time. He thinks that there is no 
chance now left but to convoke the next Assembly, as soon as 
may be, excluding the members of the present. And that 
the meeting should be far from Paris. 

' April 4th. The funeral of Mirabeau, attended, it is said, 
by more than 100,000 persons in solemn silence, has been an 
imposing spectacle. It is a vast tribute paid to superior ta- 
lents, but no great incitement to virtuous deeds. Vices, both 
degrading and detestable, marked this extraordinary being. 
Completely prostitute, he sacrificed everything to the whim 
of the moment, Cupidus alieni, prodigus sui. Venal, shame- 
less, and yet greatly virtuous, when pushed by a prevailing 
impulse, but never truly virtuous, because never under the 
steady control of reason, nor the firm authority of principle. 
I have seen this man, in the short space of two years, hissed, 
honored, hated, mourned. Enthusiasm has just now present- 
ed him gigantic. Time and reflection will shrink that stature. 
The busy idleness of the hour will find some other object 
to execrate or to exalt. Such is man, and particularly the 
Frenchman.

LIFE OF 



1 April 1 3th. Go to Madame de Stael's. Converse there 
with the Dutchess de la Rochefoucauld. Madame de Stael 
reads her tragedy of Montmorenci. She writes much better 
than she reads. Her character of the Cardinal de Richelieu 
is drawn with much ability. The society is small, and \ve 
have no small reprehension of the JLsscmbUe Nationals, who. 
it must be confessed, act weakly enough. 

' Jlpril 30th. M. Monciel and M. Bremond come in, and 
the former gives me an account of what he has done with tho 
chiefs of the Jacobins. He is to have a further conference. 
They think it will be best to act in concert with the Court, 
without appearing to do so, lest thereby they should lose their 
popularity. I agree in the propriety of this, and urge, con- 
formably to what I suppose their views to be, a repeal of the 
Decrct de quatre ans, and the Decret de reeligibilitc. He is 
to propose this to them, and to obtain, if he can, a list of the 
articles they desire. Also, if possible, of the places they aspire 
to. 

* May 1st. After dinner, I have a long conversation with 
Monsieur de Montmorin, in the course of which I show him a 
note I have made on their situation. He begs me to let him 
have it, and I give it, but with the injunction, that none but 
their Majesties shall know from whom it comes. I inform him 
of what has been done with the chiefs of the Jacobins He tells 
me how the Ministers stand in that respect. He assures me, 
that they can do nothing with the King but through him. He 
mentions a wish to have commissaries appointed by the crown, 
to keep the peace in the different departments. I reply, that all 
officers concerned in keeping the peace should be appointed 
by the crown, but that it is too early to propose anything of the 
sort. Experience must first demonstrate the necessity. He 
tells me that he has indisputable evidence of the intrigues of 
Britain and Prussia. That they give money to the Prince of 
Concle and to the Duke of Orleans. 

' Jtfiy lo/7/. I learn that the West Indians have retired 
from the Assembly, and that a decree has been passed to pre- 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 357 

vent the re-eligibility of the present delegates. I am well 
pleased with both of these events ; for the West Indians have 
hitherto run into every extreme to obtain popularity, that 
thereby they might carry their favorite measures, and, being 
indifferent about France, have contributed much to the mis- 
chiefs which have been occasioned. 

' May 20th. Montmorin tells me, that he considers the 
Assembly as finished, and this gives me a poor opinion of his 
sagacity. A few days ago he was in trepidation, but now in 
a kind of security, both unfounded. He fears, however, yet 
for the person of the King. He says, that different people 
are urging him to do different things, but that he sees nothing 
to be done. I tell him to remain quiet, for the Assembly are 
now doing everything they can for the King, with the inten- 
tion to do everything against him. I ask him whereabouts 
he is with the claims of the German Princes. He says, that 
he thinks the Emperor will become the intermediary ; but that 
he fears the Count d'Artois and Prince of Conde. I treat 
this lightly, as supposing that they will only act in favor of the 
Royal authority ; but he says that they will form a party for 
themselves ; by which I understand only, that they will oblige 
the King to drive away all his former advisers.' 

On his way again to London, Mr Morris took in his route 
the town of Eu, situate about fifteen miles from Dieppe, on 
the coast near the English Channel. The Dutchess of 
Orleans, her father, and the family, were now residing at this 
place. 

'May 3lst. This morning I wait upon the Dutchess of 
Orleans and breakfast in her chamber with Madam de Chas- 
tellux. She sends to her father to announce my arrival and 
desire of visiting him. The old gentleman returns a very po- 
lite answer, and we agree that I shall dine with them. I find 
that there is much restraint and etiquette here. After break- 
fast, she reads to me her letters to and from the Duke, (Ega- 
lite) and then we walk till near dinner time. She tells me 
the history of their breach from a long time back, and the 



358 LIFE OF 

manoeuvres used by him and those about him. He is a 
mighty strange fellow. She tells me, that what the world 
attributes to fondness in her was merely discretion. She 
hoped to bring him to a more decent and orderly beha- 
vior, but finds, at length, that he is to be governed by fear 
only. She speaks of her difficulties in bringing her father to 
act. He is nervous and trembles at everything like, exer- 
tion.' 

The same afternoon Mr Morris proceeded to Dieppe, thence 
to London, and returned in, a few days to Paris. 

' July llth. Colonel Tarleton and Lord Selkirk are here, 
(at the British Ambassador's) and the conversation accidentally 
falls on American affairs, which is diverting, as they did not 
know me. Tarleton says, that once on the outposts he ob- 
tained a list of General Washington's spies, and that Clinton, 
after putting them in the provost, in a few days let them all 
out, from weakness of compassion. I blame this weakness, &.c. 
Go from hence to the Louvre, and in my way meet the muni- 
cipality, with the Drapeau rouge displayed. At the Louvre 
we get kito the carria-ge of my friend, and, after stopping to 
take my telescope, go to Chaillot ; but the time lost tbere, in 
taking up Madame de Courcelles, brings us too late on the 
heights of Passy to see what passed in the Champs de Mars. On 
our return, however, we learn, that the militia have at length 
fired on the mob, and killed a few of them. They scamper- 
ed away as last as they could. This morning, however, they 
massacred two men. And this evening they have, it is said, 
assassinated two of the militia in the street. This affair will, 
I think, lay the foundation of tranquillity ; although, perhaps, 
a more serious affair is necessary to restrain this abominable 
populace. Go to Madame de Segur's, to pass the evening. 
Her company are all frightened and stay away, except the 
Chevalier de Bouflers. Segur tells us what passed between 
the Queen and him, and how he has been deceived by her. 

' August 6th. M. de Montmorin repeats what has passed 
this morning with the King. The recital of the scene brings 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 359 

tears both into his eyes and mine. ' Poor man ! He consid- 
ers himself as gone, and that whatever is now done must be 
for his son. 

' August 2lst. Visit Bergasse, who corrects what I had 
written this morning, (in the French language.) He says he 
will write to the King tomorrow on the state of affairs, and tell 
him, that having obtained the communication of my plan, in 
order to correct the language, he sends it to his Majesty, but 
under the strictest injunction of secrecy. 

' August 26tfA. Dine with Madame de Stae'l, who requests 
me to show her the memoire I have prepared for the King. I 
am surprised at this, and insist on knowing how she became 
acquainted with it. She tells me pretty nearly. I read it for 
her and the Abbe Louis, through whom she gained her intel- 
ligence, and they, as I expected, are very averse to so bold a 
tone. I am well persuaded that a poor conduct will be adopt- 
ed. The British Ambassadress came in during our lecture, 
which interrupted it to me very agreeably. Madame de Stae'l 
is getting over the illusions she was under about the Constitu- 
tion. 

( August 27th. Go to the manufacture of Angouleme, and 
afterwards to dine with Monsieur de Montmorin, where I ar- 
rive late. After dinner retire into his closet and read to him 
the plan I have prepared of a discourse for the King. He is 
startled at it. Says it is too forcible. That the temper of the 
people will not bear it. We have much discourse on this 
subject. I leave the thing with him. We ar to confer fur- 
ther on it, and he is to show it to the King on Monday. I 
give him leave, which otherwise he would have taken, to show 
it to his daughter. I know that she will encourage such a step, 
having previously mounted her imagination to that point. 

* August 30th. Give to Monsieur de Montmorin a memoire 
on the present state of things. He tells me, that Madame de 
Stae'l once took him in, as she did me, and that her father 
told him, that it was a common trick with her to pretend to 
know, in order to learn. I inform him, that I have caused 



360 LIFE OF 

her to believe, that I have given up the idea entirely, and de- 
sire him to speak of it lightly, and as of a thing, which I had 
abandoned. He says, that it is now in the King's possession, 
who found the discourse prepared for him difficult to swallow, 
because it acknowledges the loss of the crown. But he re- 
plied to this, that it was only defective, because he had not 
the command of 150,000 men. 

' September 1st. Go to the British Ambassador's, where I 
converse a little with the Count de Lamarck, who is or pre- 
tends to be of my opinion respecting the Constitution, and the 
conduct to be pursued by the King in that regard. Madame 
de Stael is here, and is in violent disputation with the Abbe 
de Montesquieu, and the Bishop d'Autun is in part the subject, 
to the great edification of Monsieur de Narbonne, who is just 
arrived from Italy. 

' September 12th. This morning Bremond calls and tells 
me, that the King objected to a speech prepared for him by 
Felling, in consequence of a memoire he had received in Eng- 
lish. Mr Short tells me, that on Friday last in Council, M. de 
Montmorin produced observations written by Felling, but the 
King preferred mine, and on this he felicitates me. I lead him 
off the scent, but he tells me that he is informed of this in 
such a manner, as admits of no doubt, and also that M. de 
Montmorin is vexed at that preference. 

'September 16th. I ask M. de Montmorin for the different 
papers I have given him. He tells me that the last is in the 
King's hands, being intended to regulate his future conduct. 
On inquiry, I find that he did not deliver it till after his Maj- 
esty had accepted the Constitution. This is wrong, but it is 
too late to do any good by saying so. The first paper, being 
a discourse intended for the King, he says the King has 
returned, but as I gave it to him, he wishes to keep it. I ask 
him what became of Felling's work. He says that it was 
only a memoire. I tell him what Short told me. He says it 
is a fabricated story 5 but from what he afterwards says, I find 
that Short's and Bremond's are different editions of the same 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

thing, and I am pretty well persuaded, that the poor King has 
been prevented by an intrigue from acting as he ought.' 

The papers alluded to above were, first, the draft of a speech 
intended to be pronounced by the King to the Assembly, on 
his taking the oath to observe the Constitution ; and, secondly, 
a memoir respecting the general state of France at that time, 
and the course which it was expedient for the King to pursue. 
The latter was submitted to the King in the English language. 
He returned the original, and desired Mr Morris to furnish him 
with a translation, which he might retain for his own use.* 
The former was also read by the King, but it was not used for 
the purpose designed. Mr Morris was dissatisfied with the con- 
duct of his friend Montmorin, on account of the part taken by 
him in this affair. The report of M. Bremond and Mr Short, 
from whatever source it originated, shows that the King was 
pleased with Mr Morris's draft, and was inclined to adopt it in 
part, at least. This impression could hardly get abroad with- 
out some foundation. How far the Council influenced his de- 
cision, ^r in what way the personal agency ofM. de Montmo- 
rin was exercised, are points now left to conjecture. f 

' October 1st. Ask M. de Montmorin for my discourse. 
He promises on his honor to give it me. I desire him to give 
the King my letter about subsistence. That I care nothing 
for the event, but it is his duty to lay the matter before his 
Majesty. I ask him, who made the King's speech, which is 



* Mr Morris writes; 'M. de Montmorin comes in, and gives me 
the M&moire I had written for the King. He shows me at the same 
time a note, in which he desires a translation of it.' Again, ' M. de 
Montmorin tells me the King is urgent for my translation, which he 
supposes is in order to communicate it to the Queen.' 'Give him the 
translation as he goes to the Council, having just mentioned to him, 
that the strong traits are, I fear, dangerous just now, as his Majesty 
has accepted in a different manner from what I expected. He tells 
me that there is no danger. September 23rf.'

excellent. He assures me that the groundwork is by the 
King himself. I desire him to make the King observe the dif- 
ference of effect between this and those long stories, which 
they made him tell heretofore. He says that he has already 
done so. 

' October 2d. After dinner visit Madame de Stae'I, who 
has a motley company, which she says have partaken of a 
coalition dinner. There is Beaumetz, the Bishop d'Autun, 
Alexander Lameth, the Prince de Broglio, &tc. &c. Malouet 
comes in, and also the Count de Lamarck, who converses 
with Madame, I observe, en particulier. As to the others, 
who dined with her, their coalition is natural enough. Segur 
is here, who tells me that he has asked for the Ambassade de 
Londres, and is told that it will meet with no difficulty, but 
must be left to the successor of Monsieur de Montmorin. 

' October 19th. This morning the Count de Moustier 
breakfasts with me. He tells me what passed yesterday even- 
ing with the King and Queen, and says that I stand high in 
their opinion, as well as in that of Monsieur Montmorin. He 
says the King has offered him the Embassy to England, and 
that he is to stay there until a proper opportunity shall offer of 
placing him in the Ministry, which would at present be dan- 
gerous. He wishes me to persuade Montmorin to stay long- 
er, which I promise to attempt. He says that he will urge 
the sending to America for a supply of provisions, or rather of 
flour, according to my proposal to Monsieur de Montmorin. 
He has some scheme of finance in his head, which I must dis- 
cover, if I can. 

' October *2lst. The Count de Moustier calls and tells me, 
that he has asked an audience of the Queen on the subject of 
flour. Her Majesty told him, that she has never yet seen my 
letter to Monsieur de Montmorin, and she thinks it is of a na- 
ture not to have escaped her attention. He desires me ,to 
give him a copy. He then tells me, that the King of Prussia 
will furnish money to assist in putting the finances of this coun- 
try to rights. He tells me what passed with his Prussian 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 363 

Majesty on that subject, and that lie intended to head his ar- 
mies for re-establishing the French monarchy.* 

' I dine at Madame de Stael's, and say too much against the 
Constitution, to which she provoked me. 

' October 22d. Before dinner, I go into M. de Montmo- 
rin's closet, and there urge him to continue for some time lon- 
ger in office, then to retire as President of the Council. He 
will not agree. First, because it is impossible to manage the 
department well. And, secondly, because he has so point- 
edly declared his determination to retire, that he cannot re- 
treat. I think this last is the strongest reason, 

* He repeated to me this morning, what he had once men- 
tioned before, viz. that he considers it as indispensably neces- 
sary, that the Queen should be present at the discussion of af- 
fairs of the cabinet, and that, for this purpose, there should be 
a privy council, to which Malouet should be admitted. I do 
not see the use of tjiis ; neither can I conceive his reason. 
If he expects through Malouet to govern that little council, 
he mistakes his man. At least, I think so. I told Monsieur 
de Molleville, that it appeared to me most fitting to remove 
Duportail at present, and place ihe're some brave, honest sol- 
dier, without much regard to his abilities, and then, when de 
Moustier comes forward, to place him, de Molleville, as Garde 
des Sceaux, and Bourgainville as Minister of the Marine. He 
approves of this, but wishes to stay where he is, until he shall 
have gained some reputation by putting the affairs of that de- 
partment in order. 

' November 15th. Call and visit Madame de Stael. She- 
is angry with me. I told Monsieur de Molleville, that she 
had consulted me relative to Narbonne's acceptance, and he 
has used it as a pretext against his appointment. I tell her 



* De Moustier had recently returned from an embassy to the King 
of Prussia, whither he had been sent after his return from America. 



364 LIFE OF 

that I see nothing in this to make a handle of. That every 
body knows Monsieur Narbonne has been in contemplation 
for that office, and therefore it is natural enough to ask the 
opinion of different people, whether, in case the post is offer- 
ed, he should accept. I then add, that he had better not 
think of it. That the object is merely to fill a gap for a few 
months, and then to drop the person, who may have been ap- 
pointed. She tells me, that the Ministry is stronger than is 
imagined. 

' November 26th. M. de Montmorin tells me, that he late- 
ly communicated the assurances, that one of the provinces, 
with all the troops in it, might be depended on. He adds, 
that the real cause why he quitted the Ministry was, that he 
had not the full confidence of their Majesties. That they 
were governed sometimes by counsels from Brussels, some- 
times from Coblentz. That he urged them to adopt a privy 
council to decide in all cases, and endeavored to convince 
them, that unless they fixed a plan of conduct, they would be 
greatly injured, but in vain. 

' M. Bremond comes, and I work with him at a pamphlet 
on the finances. I dictate and he writes. 

' December 1th. This morning employ myself in preparing 
a form of government for this country. At half past four go 
to dine with Monsieur de Montmorin. Find him employed 
in reading the address to the King by the members of the De- 
partment of Paris. It is well written in many respects ; but 
the style is rather that of a popular harangue, than of an ad- 
dress to a monarch. 

' December 13th. Finish the copy of a plan of government, 
and of general principles to accompany it. 

'December 14th. Inform the Minister of Marine, (M. de 
Molleville) that I have prepared some Notes on a Constitution 
to show him. He says he has sounded the King on the sub- 
ject, who has commanded him to attend to it. He has re- 
commended to his Majesty the most profound secrecy, and 



GOUVEUNEUR MOHRIS. 365 

taken occasion to inculcate the necessity, from seeing in a 
gazette what had passed in Council.* 

' December 2lst. The Bishop d'Autun observes to me, 
that the Jacobins have not been able to raise a riot about their 
address. I tell him that, since the frolic at the Champ de 
Mars, there is little danger of riots, because the people are 
not very fond of them, when they find that death is a game 
which two can play at. He says that the King is in wondrous 
high spirits, since his Vztos have gone off easily, and that he 
will apply them every now and then. Poor King ! 

'January \0th, 1792. This morning M. Bremond and M. 
Monciel call on me and breakfast. After they are gone, I 
read and write till rny carriage is ready, then go to the Minister 
of the Marine, with whom I have a conference on the Bishop 
d'Autun's mission,! and on other public affairs. He tells me, 
that he has communicated to the Queen his sentiments on the 
very impolitic step now taken, and that she is sensible of this 
confidence. He says the King spoke of me in very favora- 
ble terms the other day, when he communicated to him the 
plan of a correspondence with Monsieur de Monciel. T tell 
him, that it is time to arrange matters wth the Emperor, Stc. 
He says (and justly) that, unless he were sure that the King 
and Queen make no imprudent confidences, he dares not risk 
himself. The risk is indeed great. 

'January [Ith. M. Monciel informs me, that he has con- 
versed with Monsieur Barthelemi, upon the Bishop d'Autun's 
errand to London. He informs him, that the object is to 
make an alliance with England, in order to counterbalance 
Austria ; and the offer to England is the Isle of France and 
Tobago. This is a most wretched policy. Bremond says, 
the Jacobin party have got hold of a plan of their enemies to 
work a violent change in the Constitution, and he brings me

a newspaper which contains it. There is reason to believe, 
that some such thing was in agitation. It was very absurd. 

' M. de Marbois assures me, that he is faithful to the King, 
and considers that as being the only possible fidelity to the na- 
tion. He told me that he hoped the Bishop's embassy would 
be stopped. 

' January 14th. The Bishop d'Autun goes off tomorrow. 
The Assembly have this day, upon a report of the Diplomatic 
Committee, determined to attack the Emperor, unless he begs 
pardon by the tenth of February. The Bishop says, that the 
nation is une parvenue, and, of course, insolent. He says 
their situation is such, that nothing but violent remedies can 
operate, and then must either kill or cure. 

1 January Iftth. M. de Montmorin informs me, that when 
the Duke of Orleans was in England, he tried hard to obtain 
an authority to offer a treaty to England, which was of course 
not granted. He acquaints me with the conversation, which 
he had on that subject with the Bishop d'Autun, who hopes, 
as he says, to turn out Pitt, and thinks his success certain, if 
he could have the aid of the Duke of Biron. This is curi- 
ous enough. 

' January 22d. This morning prepare for my departure. 
Vic d'Azyr (the Queen's physician) comes in, and tells me 
he has been to my lodgings at the request of her Majesty, to 
desire, if I learn anything in England interesting to them, that 
I would communicate it.'

FROM FRANCE. BERTRAND DE MOLLEVILLE. MONCIEL. THE KING DE-

LEANS. 

SCARCELY had Mr Morris departed from Paris, when an ar- 
ticle came out in Brissot's paper, affirming that he was sent 
over to London by the Aristocrats and the Court, for the pur- 
pose of thwarting the plans and defeating the negotiations of 
the Bishop d'Autun. This was copied into the British pa- 
pers, but was doubtless without any foundation.* He had been 
but a few days in London, when he received intelligence of 
his appointment as Minister Plenipotentiary from the United 
States to the Court of France. 

The news of this appointment was not altogether unexpect- 
ed. His friend Robert Morris had written to him eighteen 
months previously, that there could be little doubt of his being 



* When the report of the above imputation of Brissot de War- 
ville readied Mr Morris, he wrote to him the following note. 

' Mr Morris is informed, that Monsieur de Warville has imputed to 
him, in terms not very delicate, an intention to counteract the designs 
of the Bishop d'Autnn in England. He takes the liberty to assure M. 
de Warville, that he is much misinformed. Whether the French Court 
does or does not wish success to the mission of M. de Perigord, Mr 
Morris will not pretend to conjecture, till he knows what that mission is ; 
but if the idea of their Majesties' disinclination be no better founded, 
than that of Mr Morris's agency, he ventures to assure M. de Warville, 
that it is totally unworthy of credit. London, Ftbruary 3d, 1792.'

intended either for the Court of London or Versailles, and that 
Mr Jay believed it \vould be the former. He added, that Mr 
Jay had conversed with the President on the subject, before 
Mr Jefferson's arrival as Secretary of Stale, and considered it 
as a fixed point in the President's mind, thatGouverneur Mor- 
ris should be nominated to one of the two Courts. It was sup- 
posed, that Mr Jefferson's partiality would induce him to pre- 
fer Mr Madison, as Minister to France, and that Washington's 
well known friendship for that gentleman, and respect for his 
character and talents, would naturally incline him to accord 
with the opinion of the Secretary of State. Again, a movement 
was made in Europe, probably through M. de Montmorin, to 
promote Mr Carmichael, then Charge des Affaires in Madrid, to 
the station of Minister at the Court of Versailles. Montmorin 
had been on terms of intimacy and friendship with Carmichael, 
during the time of his residence in Spain as Minister from 
France. Mr Short, also, who had been left by Mr Jefferson 
as Charge in Paris, had some good grounds for expecting the 
appointment of Minister. Amidst these floating rumors, Mi- 
Morris had slender expectations of being designated for that 
mission, although he had reasons for anticipating the one to 
England. It was known, however, to Robert Morris, that his 
preference was for France, and it may be presumed his friend 
did not leave the President ignorant of the fact. 

Mr Morris, Mr Pinckney, and Mr Short were nominated by 
the President on the same day to the Senate, the first for the 
Court of France, the second for England, and the third for 
Holland. But these nominations were not confirmed, till twen- 
ty days afterwards, during which period there was much de- 
bate on the question, whether it was for the interest of the 
United States to have Ministers residing permanently at foreign 
Courts. The sentiment of the Senators was divided, and the 
same was understood of the Representatives. In the Senate 
there would seem to have been a majority against the question, 
for the appointments were after all confirmed on the ground, 
that there was then a ' special occasion' for sending Ministers 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 369 

to the three respective Courts. These were the first appoint- 
ments of Foreign Ministers under the new government. 

In Mr Morris's case were also other considerations, which 
his enemies made the most of against him. The ill success of 
his negotiation in England, and the insinuations that had got 
abroad of his indiscreet confidence in M. de la Luzerne, and his 
abrupt manners towards the British Ministry, were magnified 
by his political adversaries into charges of a grave nature.* 
His aristocratical connexions in France, and his hostility to the 
principles of the revolution, as it was then conducted, were al- 
so well known, and thought by many to disqualify him for the 
station of Minister from a Republic, in alliance with that nation, 
and professing a sympathy in its revolutionary progress. Owing 
to these combined causes of opposition, he was chosen in the 
Senate, January 12th, 1792, by a majority of only five votes 
out of sixteen, there being eleven against him. 

When the notice of his appointment was forwarded, under 
the seal of the Secretary of State, General Washington wrote 
him a private letter, in which he frankly enumerated all the ob- 
jections, which had been raised against him, and more than inti- 
mated a belief that they were in some instances too well found- 
ed. ' The official communications of the Secretary of State,' 
says the President, ' accompanying this letter, will convey to you 
the evidence of my nomination, and the appointment of you to 



* Mr Morris ever considered these reports, as having been sent out 
by the British Ministers, with the view of apologizing for their own 
conduct, in not coming to some seasonable arrangement with him, 
which he believed they afterwards repented of. In writing to Robert 
Morris, November 14th, 1791, he says; 'The obstacle to a treaty was 
in the British Cabinets. The opposers have since found out, that they 
committed a fatal error, and wish to get clear of the blame. They 
would have been very glad of any excuse to tread the ground back 
again, but fortunately none such was given, and they have, therefore, 
in fear of French influence, sent you a Minister. And they will make a 
treaty with us, as soon as the people are ripe for it, and the mercan- 
tile interests feel the necessity.' 



370 LIFE OF 

be Minister Plenipotentiary for the United States at the Court 
of France ; and my assurance, that both were made with all 
my heart, will, I am persuaded, satisfy you as to that fact. I 
wish I could add, that the advice and consent (of the Senate) 
flowed from a similar source. Candor forbids it, and friend- 
ship requires, that I should assign the causes, as far as they 
have come to my knowledge.' He then recapitulates all the 
particulars, which have been heretofore mentioned, respect- 
ing Mr Morris's sentiments, manners, and transactions in Eng- 
land and France. ' It was urged,' he continues, ' that in 
France you were considered as a favorer of aristocracy, and 
unfriendly to its revolution, (I suppose they meant the Consti- 
tution;) that under this impression you could not be an ac- 
ceptable public character; and, of consequence, you would 
not be able, however willing, to promote the interest of this 
country in an essential degree.' It is remarkable here, that 
the .President regard ed Mr Mania's aristocratical tendencies, 
as appertaining to the Constitution, and not to the principles or 
progress of the revolution, but this inference would scarcely 
be drawn from his Diary, or letters, at any stage of his resi- 
dence in France. To the revolution, as it was conducted, 
and in the spirit of its advocates and movers, he cannot be said 
ever to have been friendly. 

General Washington closed his letter in the same tone of 
frankness, which he had begun, seasoned with a spice of ad- 
monition, that could not fail to give it effect. 

' Not to go further into detail, I will place the ideas of your 
political adversaries in the light, in which their arguments 
have presented them to me ; viz. that the promptitude, with 
which your lively and brilliant imagination displays itself, allows 
too little time for deliberation and correction, and is the pri- 
mary cause of those sallies, which too often offend, and of that 
ridicule of character, which begets enmity not easy to be for- 
gotten, but which might easily be avoided, if it were under 
the control of more caution and prudence. In a word, that it 
is indispensably necessary, that more circumspection should 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 371 

be observed by our representatives abroad, than they conceive 
you are inclined to adopt. In this statement you have the 
pros and cons. By reciting them, I give you a proof of my 
friendship, if I give none of my policy or judgment. I do it 
on the presumption, that a mind conscious of its own rectitude 
fears not what is said of it, but will bid defiance to shafts, that 
are not barbed with accusations against honor or integrity. 
Of my good opinion, and of my friendship and regard, you 
may be assured.' 

This letter was received by Mr Morris in the same friendly 
temper in which it had been written, and his subsequent con- 
duct as Minister to the French government affords ample 
proof, that its counsels were not disregarded. That his opin- 
ions, and the bold manner in which he had expressed them on 
all occasions, were a serious obstacle to the successful exer- 
cise of his official duties, especially after the overthrow of the 
monarchy in France, and the triumph of the disorganizing 
factions, cannot be denied, but he is entitled to the full credit 
of caution and circumspection, and to the praise of maintain- 
ing with dignity and firmness the interests of his country, in 
circumstances extremely vexatious and trying. It may with 
truth be affirmed, that no American Minister abroad ever 
had a more difficult task to perform, or executed it, consider- 
ing the situation in which he was placed, with more skill and 
ability. 

His official correspondence, while he was Minister to the 
French Court, was with Jefferson then Secretary of State, and 
occasionally with Hamilton, Secretary of the Treasury. To 
Washington he wrote constantly, as to a private friend, and 
presented a more detailed narrative of affairs, than was con- 
tained in his public despatches. It would be difficult to find, 
within the same compass, so full an account of the political 
progress and changes of the French Revolution for nearly five 
years, as may be gathered from his letters, private and official. 
He viewed the great panorama of passing events with a pene- 
trating and comprehensive mind, and sketched what he saw 



372 LIFE OF 

in. a style of bold and graphic accuracy. Allowance is to be 
made for the bias of his opinions, and his settled aversion to 
the principles of the revolutionists, but his judgment seldom 
deceived him, and his sincerity may always be relied on. 
His speculations are uttered as speculations, and may be dis- 
tinguished as such. No one ever need confound them with 
the deliberate convictions of his understanding, his deductions 
from argument, or his statement of facts. Frankness, honesty, 
and a fearlessness in expressing his sentiments, were promi- 
nent features of his mind, and appear in all his writings. 

When Mr Morris arrived in Paris, on the sixth of May, 
there was a rumor afloat, that the French Cabinet did not in- 
tend to receive him, as Minister from the United States ; but 
if such a design had at any time been entertained, it was 
abandoned, and never communicated to him from any official 
source. 

'May 15th. I go to Mr Short's, from whence we go to- 
gether to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The interview here 
is very short. He observes, that I am already acquainted 
with the King. I reply, that I never saw his Majesty but in 
public, nor ever exchanged a word with him in my life, 
although some of their gazettes have made me one of his 
Ministers, and that I am persuaded he would not know me, if 
he should see me. Upon this, he says, that, since I have 
mentioned it, he will acknowledge that such is the general 
idea. I tell him, that I am naturally frank and open, and 
therefore do not hesitate to say, that in the time of the Con- 
stituent Assembly, I endeavored, being then a private individ- 
ual, and prompted by my regard for this nation, to effect cer- 
tain changes in the Constitution, which appeared to me essen- 
tial to its existence. That I was not successful, and being at 
present a public man, I consider it as my duty not to meddle 
with their affairs. 1 ask him then, when I shall wait upon him 
to be presented, and he says he will let me know, but he thinks 
the sooner it is done the better. 

* June Zd. I am presented to the King, who, on receiving 




GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 373 

my letter of credence, says " C ' est de la part des Etats Unis" 
and his tone of voice and his embarrassment mark well the 
feebleness of his disposition. I reply, " Oui, Sire, et Us m'ont 
charge de temoigner a votre Majeste leur attachement pour 
elle, et pour la nation Francaise." I am afterwards presented 
to the Queen, who shows me her son and says, " 11 n'est pas 
encore grand." I reply, "J'espere, Madame, qu'il sera bien 
grand, et v entablement grand." " Nous y travaillons, Mon- 
sieur." 1 then go to mass.'* 



*The following letter from Hamilton to Morris will serve as a key 
to some of the published correspondence of the latter, during his resi- 
dence in France as Minister from the United States. 

4 Philadelphia, June 22d, 1792.

( June 4th. Dine at Dumouriez's (Minister of Foreign 
Affairs.) The society is noisy and in bad style. After din- 
ner, I converse with M. Bonne-Carrere, and give him reasons 
why they should repeal the decrees respecting our commerce. 
He says he is fully in opinion with me, hut nothing can be 
done till they have brought the Assembly into greater consis- 
tence. I observe that Dumouriez is anxious to converse. 
Give him the opportunity, and begin by delivering the letter 
from the President of the United States to the King, on his ac- 
ceptance of the Constitution. He says, that he cannot attend 
to the affairs of the United States, until after his return from 
the frontiers. He says the King of Prussia will not act against 
France ; that he is quite easy on that head ; that, if the ne- 
gotiators in England have made any considerable offers since 
he came into the Administration, it is without authority. He 
is against all treaties, other than those of commerce. He 
thinks there is no danger to the Constitution at present, that 
it will triumph over every obstacle, and must amend itself. I 
think he cannot believe one half he says. 

' June 17th. M. Monciel calls and tells me, that the La- 
meth party have pressed him hard to accept the place of 
Minister of the Interior.* I advise him to take nothing but the 
office of Foreign Affairs. He quits me with that intention, but 



you shall have a sketch of the general state of the country, its politics 
and parties. I thank you for your calculations, as I will for every 
suggestion you shall make. I shall seldom fail to get either a new 
idea, or a new application of an old one. I shall endeavor to put in 
train, by this opportunity, the papers you advise to be sent to the 
Russian Ambassador. If jour courage is not put to the test, by being 
put to wear what you have won, it will not be my fault. Do you know 
enough of the catechism in the vulgar tongue to fulfil what you have 
lately undertaken ? Yours sincerely, 

'ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 

* Monciel became Minister of the Interior on the eigteenth of June, 
but he went out with the rest of the Ministers on the ninth of July, 
having held the place only twenty days. 






GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 375 

says they have offered him the Interior, as a step towards the 
other office. 

1 June 19th. Bremond tells me, that Monciel will call on 
me early tomorrow. He has had a long conversation with 
the King, and is well pleased with him. There is to be a 
sort of riot tomorrow about fixing a Maypole before the 
Chateau. 

' June 20th. There is a great movement in Paris, and the 
guard is paraded. I dine with the Baron de Blome. After 
dinner we learn, that the deputation of the Fauxbourgs has 
forced the unresisting guard, filled the Chateau, and grossly 
insulted the King and Queen. His Majesty has put on the 
Bonnet rouge, but he persists in refusing to sanction the de- 
crees. The Constitution has this day, I think, given its last 
groan. 

' June 25th. The King has received an offer of assistance 
from Picardy. Bremont comes and writes under my dicta- 
tion a plan to be submitted by the King to the Assembly. 

' June C 28th This morning M. de Monciel calls on me be- 
fore I am up, and tells me that M. de Lafayette is arrived, 
and is to go this morning to the Assembly. The King, on re- 
ceiving the project prepared for him, said it would be very 
good, if they could count on the Gardes Nationales. I tell 
him, that Lafayette's visit can produce nothing, and therefore 
he must exert himself to bring forward the Picards. He thinks 
Lafayette may be rendered instrumental to the sortie of the 
King from Paris, and he counts on the Swiss. This latter 
part of the plan is the most reasonable. Dress and go to 
Court, but find that the Corps Diplomatique is postponed till 
tomorrow. 

1 June 29th. I go to Court. Madame Elizabeth and the 
Queen remark to me, that I came yesterday. I tell the latter, 
that it was the fault of the post, for so Sequeville told me, and 
the remark seems directed against him and Lalive. Lafayette 
speaks tome at Court in the tone of ancient familiarity. I tell 
him that I should be glad to see him for a few minutes. He 



376 LIFE OF 

says that he is going out of town this evening, but gives me 
rendezvous at Monsieur de Montmorin's. I observe to him 
that he must soon return to his army, or go to Orleans ; and 
that he must determine to fight for a good Constitution, or for 
that wretched piece of paper, which bears the name ; that in 
six weeks it will be too late. He asks what I mean by a good 
Constitution, whether it is an aristocratic one. I tell him, 
yes ; and that, I presume, he has lived long enough in the 
present style to see, that a popular government is good for 
nothing in France. He says that he wishes for the American 
Constitution, but a hereditary Executive. I reply that, in such 
case,, the monarch will be too strong, and must be checked by 
a hereditary Senate. He says it goes hard with him to give 
up that point. Here ends our colloquy. 

''July 2d. Monciel and Bremond call on me. The King 
has neither plans, money, nor means. The Lameth faction 
are all as naked as he. Monciel says, that he is afraid of 
falling into the hands of the Constitutionalists. The French, 
says Monciel, are, I am afraid, too rotten for a free govern- 
ment. I tell him that the experiment may, nevertheless, be 
tried, and despotism still remains as a last resort. 

' July 7th. The different parts of the Assembly are united, 
and all is love and kindness. This arises from fear among 
the republicans. The King has been to the Assembly, which 
1 disapprove. 

' July 8th. Bremond calls and tells me, that Monciel in- 
tends to resign. He opposed in Council what was done yes- 
terday, and spoke privately both to the King and Queen, but 
without effect. Go to Court. Her Majesty is in good spirits, 
and very affable. I am not pleased, however, with her con- 
duct. 

' July 9th. Spend the evening at Madame d'Albani's. 
The Venetian Ambassador, who had expressed great hopes 
and expectations yesterday, from the reconciliation scene, is 
quite done over to day. Brissot has pronounced a fiery dis- 
course against the King. 






GOUVEBNEUR MORKIS. 377 

' July \\tJi. Bremond comes this morning and tells me, 
that their Majesties flashed in the pan yesterday morning, 
which occasioned the resignation of the Ministry. This I sus- 
pected. He says they have reproached Monciel, who retort- 
ed smartly. On the ground of these reproaches, we prepare 
heads of a discourse for Monciel, in the view, if their Majes- 
ties come round, to strike a still more important stroke. I 
think there is a want of mettle, which will ever prevent them 
from being truly royal. 

1 July \2th. Bremond has seen Pellin, who blames Mon- 
ciel for precipitation, and says that things may yet be arranged. 
Monciel is to have an interview with the King and Queen 
this morning. I go to Court. The countenances of their 
Majesties are a little down. 

' July llth. Monsieur and Madame de Montmorin and 
Madame de Beaumont, Lord Govver and Lady Sutherland, 
and Mr Huskisson, secretary to Lord Gower, the Venetian 
Ambassador, and Spanish Charge d'Affaires, dine with me. In 
the evening, Monsieur de Montmorin takes me into the garden 
to communicate the situation of things and ask my opinion. I 
tell him, that I think the King should quit Paris. He thinks 
otherwise, and fosters a thousand empty hopes and vain ex- 
pectations.* 



* On the morning of the 18th of July, Mr Mori-is received a mes- 
sage from Paul Jones, that he was very ill, and desired to see him. Mr 
Morris called immediately, and found him dying. He was in full pos- 
session of his faculties, however, and at his request Mr Morris drew 
his will, which was certified in a regular form by a notary. He went 
afterwards for the Queen's physician, Vic d'Azyr, and returned with 
him, but when they arrived, Jones was dead. 

Some persons wished to have a pompous funeral, which Mr Morris 
declined, as involving a large and unnecessaiy expense, which he had 
no right to contract for such a purpose. He was censured in his own 
country, it seems, for what was considered an undue apathy on this 
occasion. Writing to Robert Morris some time afterwards, he said, 
' It is somewhat singular, that he, who detested the French revolt!

1 July 20th. This morning Bremoncl calls and tells me, 
that in consequence of the memoire, which he made up from 
my hints, and which Monciel presented to the King, a conver- 
sation had taken place between, M. de Montmorin, and M. de 
Bertrand. He gives me the heads of the manifesto, which is 
to appear, and desires to know what step the King should take 
in consequence of it. He informs me that Mallet-Dupan is 
sent by M. Bertrand to be secretary to the Duke of Bruns- 
wick. 

' July 24th. Monciel brings me the King's money, at his 
Majesty's request, who tells him at the same time, that I have 
always given him good advice, and he has the greatest confi- 
dence in me. We consider what is to be done in the case of 
a suspension. Monciel and I go after dinner to Bertrand's, 
and bring him a good deal into our views. 

'July 25th. At a little after two M. Monciel and M. Ber- 
trand come. I read the memoires written for the King, at the 
time of his acceptance of the Constitution. We dine, and after 
dinner read the plan of a Constitution. Then discuss the steps 
which the King is to to take. M. Bertrand is a stickler for 
the ancien regime, but we drive him a little out of his 
opinion, which he will, I think, come back to again. He is to 



tion, and all those concerned in it, should have been followed to 
the grave by a deputation from the National Assembly, and that I 
should read in your gazettes something like a severe reflection on 
me, for not paying him due respect ; I, who, during his life, had 
rendered him all possible service, and possessed his confidence to the 
last, so that he wished to name me with you for executor.' 

Mr Morris had met Paul Joues at Amsterdam, where he had pro- 
jects of some sort in reference to Sweden, and Mr Morris wrote at 
the time, ' we adjust the means by which he is to get a direct offer 
from the Swedish Anihassjulor or Minister here. They have made a 
kind of indirect application through Kosciuszko.' He next had a plan 
for going round the Cape of Good Hope. Not long afterward.", he 
went over to England, and engaged in a speculation with Dr Ban- 
croft for supplying the wool dyers with quercitron bark.

' July 26th. Monciel informs me, that Bertrand has begun 
his work by mentioning the cahiers, which is idle enough. He 
is to see the King at eleven, and give him the result of the 
measures, which I have proposed, and which we have dis- 
cussed. 

' July 21th. Bremond and Monciel call. We work all the

Monciel, who stay till three o'clock. We finish the form of a 
letter from the King to the Assembly. 

' July 30th. Monciel calls to tell me he has delivered 
to the King the letter, and one from M. Bertrand, on which 
he has communicated his observations. In the evening I go 
to Madame d'Albani's, where I find them all terrified at a 
riot, in which the Marseillois have killed one or two of the 
Gardes Nationales. There is much stir in Paris. 

' August 2d. M. de Monciel says they are trying to send 
him to Orleans. We agree 'on the conversion of the King's 
paper into specie. 

< August 4th. Bremond brings me this morning 5000 
louis d'ors, which he has purchased. He is to have the cor- 
respondence of the Jacobins for 1000. Monciel calls, and we 
complete a letter to be written by the King to the President 
of the section of the Fauxbourg St Marceau, about the river 
Bievre, which will, it is supposed, give his Majesty that Faux- 
bourg. MoncieJ says the King and Queen are much distress- 
ed and in great apprehension. I call at M. de Montmorin's, 
where I find a family in deep distress. At my return home, 
I find Lady Sutherland at my door. She comes to obtain an 
interview between me and the Chevalier de Coigny. I tell 
her that I will be at home, if he will call on me tomorrow. He 
wishes to give my ideas directly to the Queen, without pass- 
ing through the medium of Monsieur de Montmorin. They 
expect all to be y murdered this evening at the Chateau.

* August 1th. This morning M. de Monciel calk, and the 
Chevalier de Coigny, with whom I have a long conversation 
on the state of affairs. Monciel tells me that the King would 
not listen to the entrusting of his secret to St Croix. We di- 
gest a petition for the Marseillois, calculated to make the King 
declare himself. Monsieur de Coigny is to push the same 
point with the Queen. 

' August 8th. M. de Monciel calls and tells me that things 
are going on well. The King seems to hold the proper opin- 
ions also, which is a desirable thing. 

' August 9th. This morning M. de Monciel brings me 
some money. I dress and go to Court. 

' August Itith. This morning M. de Monciel calls. His 
report is tranquillizing ; but shortly after he leaves me, the can- 
non begin, and musketry mingled with them announce a warm 
day. The Chateau, undefended but by the Swiss, is carried, 
and the Swiss, wherever found, are murdered. The King 
and Queen are in the National Assembly, who have decreed 
the suspension of his authority.' 

Except what is contained in the above hints, little is known 
of the scheme concerted between Mr Morris, M. de Monciel, 
Bremond, and others, for the removal of the King and the 
Royal Family from Paris. I find a press copy of a letter, in 
Mr Morris's hand writing, without address, date, or signature, 
which relates to this subject, and affords some further elucida- 
tions. He first gives an account of the discourse and memoir 
he had written for the King, respecting the Constitution, as 
heretofore noticed, and then proceeds in substance as follows. 

His Majesty had conceived similar ideas to those contained 
in the project of a discourse, and unfolded more at large in 
the memoir accompanying it. He abandoned them with re- 
gret. Besides, he saw in the conduct of M. de Montmorin a 
finesse, which weakened his confidence in that Minister. At 






GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 381 

the same time, the appalling situation of the King made it 
necessary to receive the services of persons, who were hardly 
known to him. Among those, whom circumstances had 
brought into the Ministry, was M. Terrier de Monciel, a man 
known by Mr Morris to be faithful to the King, although his 
connexions were such as might justly render him suspected. 
Mr Morris believed it to be his duty, therefore, to assure his 
Majesty, that he might confide in M. Monciel. The conse- 
quence was, that the King charged him with a very important 
affair, namely, to devise the means of rescuing him from his 
perilous situation. 

For this purpose Monciel held frequent consultations with 
Mr Morris, and after considering the various means, which 
presented themselves, it was agreed that the only effectual 
course to be pursued was the removal of the Royal Family from 
Paris. The project for this enterprise was so well concerted, 
and the measures so discreetly taken, that it was hardly possi- 
ble for it to fail. Just at that juncture it was renounced by 
the Kin^, even on f hp very morning fino<3 for hJs HeDar^" 1 ' / 
and when the Swiss guards were on their way to cover his es- 
cape. His Ministers, finding themselves seriously compromit- 
ted, gave in their resignations. The moment was the more 
critical for the King, as he already possessed proofs, that a 
conspiracy was forming against his person. One resource on- 
ly remained, which was to get the victory in the combat about 
to be raised by the conspirators, as soon as they should find 
themselves in force. 

M. de Monciel, having had an explication with the King and 
Queen, consented to serve them as before, notwithstanding 
he had retired from the Ministry. The plan was to collect, as 
soon as possible, a kind of royal army, an affair of extreme de- 
licacy, which would inevitably endanger thoie engaged in it, if 
the enemies of the King should gel the upper hand. M. de 
Monciel associated himself in this work to M. Bremond, a 
man of courage, zeal, and fidelity, but passionate, talkative, 
and imprudent. This last quality was almost essential, since 



382 LIFE OF 

the situation of the Royal Family was such, as to keep at a dis- 
tance all those, who were removed by the dictates of pru- 
dence, and whose zeal could be cooled by the prospect of a 
hazardous undertaking. 

Towards the end of the month of July, the King sent his 
thanks to Mr Morris for the counsels he had rendered, testi- 
fying his regret that they had not been followed. In short, he 
desired Mr Morris to continue the aid of his advice in what 
was doing, and to become the. depositary of his papers and 
his money. Mr Morris answered, that his Majesty might al- 
ways count on his efforts ; that the Royal House of France 
did not appear to him more sure than the palace of the Tuil- 
eries, since the King had long been exposed to the hatred of 
conspirators ; that neither the King's papers nor money would 
be secure in his posession ; but, as to this latter, he would 
not object to receive it, and hold the same at the disposal of 
the King, it being understood, that, in any event, no right of 
property on his part would attach to the money thus depos- 
ited. Ho.-c.iipoii the King, sent to him, by the hands uf INI. 
de Monciel, five hundred and forty seven thousand and five 
livres. It was expected, that a large portion of this sum would 
be distributed among the persons, who were concerned in ex- 
ecuting the project for removing the King from Paris, and it 
was in train for this destination by the orders of the King, on 
the second of August. To conceal the design as much 
as possible, it was the intention to employ the Marseil- 
lois. and other agents of the conspirators, and that no room 
might be left for deception and perfidy, the payments were to 
be delayed till the services were rendered. 

The events of the tenth of August put an end to the whole 
affair. On that day M. de Monciel and his family, with ma- 
ny other persons, took refuge in Mr Morris's house, and ere 
long Monciel was obliged to conceal himself. Bremond was 
in the same condition. Madame de Monciel was charged 
with making arrangements for saving the persons, who had 
been compromitted, and some of whom, from their opera-

lions, were strongly suspected. D'Angremont was seized, and 
condemned, but he had the courage to keep silence. The 
force of money procured the means of saving the rest, some 
by escape, others by concealment. Monciel went to London.* 
The whole amount of money, deposited with Mr Morris in 
the King's name, was about seven hundred and forty eight 
thousand livres. Out of this, Bremond took five thousand 
louis d'ors, in a way not very satisfactory to the other par- 
ties, but to which they could not object without the risk of an 
exposure. Other large sums were withdrawn by Monciel for 
purposes above specified. The remainder was remitted to 
London, where advances were made to Monciel, till at last 
there was left in the hands of Mr Morris only the amount of 



* An American gentleman, who was in Paris at that time, has pub- 
lished the following anecdote. 

' On the ever memorable tenth of August, after viewing the destruc- 
tion of the royal Swiss Guards, and the dispersion of the Paris militia, 
by a band of foreign and native incendiaries, the writer thought it his 
duty to visit the Minister, who had not been out of his hotel since the 
insurrection began, and, as was to be expected, would be anxious to 
learn what was passing without doors. He was surrounded by the old 
Count d'Estaing, and about a dozen other persons of distinction, of dif- 
ferent sexes, who had, from their connexion with the United States, been 
his most intimate acquaintances at Paris, and who had then taken refuge 
with him, for protection from the blood-hounds, which, in the forms 
of men and women, were prowling in the streets at the time. All was 
silence here, except that silence was occasionally interrupted by the 
crying of the women and children. As I retired, the Minister took me 
aside, and observed, " I have no doubt, Sir, but there are persons on the 
watch, who would find fault with my conduct as Minister, in receiving 
and protecting these people, but I call on you to \\itness the declara- 
tion, which I now make, and that is, that they were not invited to my 
house, but came of their own accord ; whether my house will be a pro- 
tection to them, or to me, God only knows, but I will not turn them 
out of it, let what will happen to me" ; to which he added, " you see, Sir, 
they are all persons to whom our country is more or less indebted, nnd 
it would be inhuman to force them into the hands of the assassins, 
had they no such claim upon me." '

six thousand seven hundred livres, equal to one hundred and 
sixty eight pounds sterling, after making a proper allowance 
for the depreciation of Assignats. 

As before stated, there is no certain means of ascertaining 
the date of the letter, from which the preceding narrative is 
drawn, nor the person for whom it was designed, but circum- 
stances favor the idea, that it was written at Vienna in De- 
cember, 1796, and directed to the daughter of Louis Six- 
teenth, the present Dutchess d'Angoulerne, who was then at 
the Austrian Court. He calls the person, to whom he writes, 
' Son Vitesse RoyaleJ and ' Princessef and, speaking of him- 
self, in the third person, he says ; ' For this reason he has come 
to Vienna, having no other object than to communicate the 
facts herein mentioned,' that is, the facts relating to the money. 
In the same letter is folded a press copy of an account current, 
exhibiting in detail the amounts received and paid out, and 
showing the balance in favor of the King. This balance, of 
one hundred and forty seven pounds sterling, he adds, ' Mr 
Morris will have the honor to pay to any person, whom her 
Royal Highness shall designate.' He also enjoins profound 
secrecy. 

Bertrand de Molleville, in his Annals of the French Revolu- 
tion, tells of another plot to rescue the King, of which he was 
at the head, and which, by his account, was in operation at 
the same time with this of M. de Monciel, and the King 
was giving encouragement to both of them, without letting the 
leaders of either know the existence of the other. From Mr 
Morris's Diary it appears, that Bertrand was with him and 
Monciel on several occasions, while their plan was in progress, 
and it might naturally be inferred, that he was accessory to 
their counsels, but from Bertrand's description of his own plot, 
and his surprise at detecting another at a very late hour, this 
is not probable. It must have been Monciel's object to 
amuse Bertrand, and quell suspicion of the doings of himself 
and associates. In this he succeeded. Bertrand's plan was 
suspended by order of the King, and its projector was neither 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 385 

flattered nor pleased to discover, that his Majesty was secret- 
ly lending himself to another project, which he chose to 
shroud in mystery. It should be recollected, however, that, 
in the King's dangerous situation, it was both his interest and 
his duty to acquaint himself with the best means offered for 
his escape, and then to judge for himself. The principles of 
honor, as well as the dictates of discretion, forbade his disclos- 
ing the schemes of one party to the agents of another. His 
fault was to approve all, and follow none. 

From the circumstance of the King's paying over so much 
money to promote Monciel's plan it is probable he gave 
that the preference, and had resolved to carry it into effect. 
He evidently adhered to it down to the very morning of the 
tenth of August. Bertrand writes as if he had got correct 
hints of the details of that plan, though it seems quite certain 
he did not know who were its authors or abettors. According 
to him, the design was for the King and Royal Family to take 
the route to Compiegne, where everything was to be in readi- 
ness, in case of necessity, to convey them out of the kingdom, 
by way of the forest of Ardennes and the principality of 
Beaumont. This is not improbable, as it was a part of Mon- 
ciel's scheme, if occasion required, to call in the military aid 
of Lafayette, who was stationed with his army in that quarter. 
Several other plans of escape, besides the two above mention- 
ed, were sent to the King, and one in particular by Madame 
de Stael, the accomplishment of which was to have been 
under the guidance of her friend Narbonne.* 



* Six years after the above events, Mr Morris met at Francfort, in 
Germany, a Mr Crawford, from whose account it appeared, that he had 
been a private agent from the English government to procure the 
removal of the Queen and Dauphin. The following is from Mr Mor- 
ris's diary.

Two or three notes from the Dutchess of Orleans, written 
at this time of perilous excitement and cruel disasters, will 
exhibit pleasing evidences of the goodness of her heart and 
warmth of her feelings. 

The. Dutchess of Orleans to Mr Morris, August 2lst. 'I 
pray you to send the letter accompanying this to the person, 
who wrote to rne by you. I feel that his departure will increase 
the void of which he complains, and I wish it were in my pow- 
er speedily to lessen it. No more agreeable idea ever presents 
itself to my mind, than that of the tea-table, where the admin-

Ris's ATTEMPT TO PROCURE HIS RELEASE. JIR MORRIS'S RECALL. 

ONE of Mr Morris's first official transactions with the French 
ministry, was an arrangement respecting the liquidation of a 
portion of the debt due from the United States to France. 
This debt had been contracted during the American revolution, 
the original amount being thirty-four millions of livres. The 
interest and a part of the principal had already been paid. In 
the year 1790, Congress authorized the President to borrow 
a sum or sums not exceeding fourteen millions of dollars, to be 



388 LIFE OF 

appropriated towards the payment of the public debt. The 
business of contracting for the loans, thus authorized by Con- 
gress, was entrusted by the President to Mr Short, then Charge 
des Affaires from the United States to France, and he received 
instructions accordingly from the Secretary of the Treasury to 
repair to Holland, and contract for loans on the best terms that 
should offer, within certain limits prescribed by the Secretary. 
The disposal of this money after it was borrowed, and while 
in the bankers' hands, as well as all arrangements with the 
French government concerning the debt, was also committed 
to Mr Short. 

When Mr Morris presented his credentials to the King, as 
minister from the United States, Mr Short had already made 
considerable progress 'in negotiating loans, and there was at 
that time a large sum of money belonging to the United States 
in the hands of their bankers at Amsterdam. As the interest 
on this money was lost, while thus lying useless, both Mr Short 
and Mr Morris thought it advisable, that some provision should 
be made for paying it over to the French government, on ac- 
count of the American debt. Mr Short had received his cre- 
dentials and instructions as Minister Resident in Holland, and 
was obliged to depart speedily for the Hague. The question 
then arose, as to the person duly empowered to manage the 
affairs of the American debt. Mr Morris's instructions con- 
tained nothing whatever on that head, whence he inferred, that 
the President intended the business to remain in the hands of 
Mr Short. On the contrary, Mr Short considered his agency 
at an end, when the new Minister was accredited, and took it 
for granted that the whole business devolved on him. In a 
concern of so ranch responsibility and delicacy, however, Mr 
Morris declined acting, without explicit instructions to that ef- 
fect. Nevertheless, as the public good seemed to require it, he 
consented to negotiate a payment to the French ministry, as Mr 
Short's agent, the latter promising to sanction any arrangement 
thus made, and to order the money to be paid for carrying it 
into execution, 



GOUVERNKUR MORRIS. . 389 

With this understanding on bo'.h sides, Mr Short went to 
Holland, and Mr Morris concluded an agreement with the 
Commissioners of the Treasury, hy which six millions of livres 
were to be paid to the French bankers in Holland, towards 
the liquidation of the American debl. On the 6th of August 
he gave notice of the same to Mr Short, who was then at the 
Hague, and requested him to make a transfer of that amount 
accordingly. By some accident, the letter conveying this in- 
formation did riot reach Mr Short, till the 16th of the month, 
very nearly the time that intelligence arrived of the revolu- 
tion of the tenth. Here was a new and unexpected dilemma. 
The King was suspended, and the old government dissolved. 
Could the money rightfully be paid to the men, who had then 
put themselves at the head of affairs, and might perhaps be 
superseded in a week or a month by others, who would not 
acknowledge their authority, nor the validity of the payment? 
Mr Short thought not, and, moreover, believed, that he had 
authority only to pay the money to the King, or to the govern- 
ment existing at the time he received his instructions. At all 
events, he resolved to write to Mr Morris, and wait for his 
answer, as he had not heard from him since the events of the 
tenth. In reply, Mr Morris gave it as his opinion, that the 
change of government did not invalidate the transaction, and 
that the money ought to be paid. 

Mr Short was surprised at this decision, so contrary to his 
own views, and ^to the views of almost every person whom 
he consulted, yet having great confidence in the judgment of 
Mr Morris, and believing it to have been the real intention of 
the President, that the Minister in Paris should have entire 
control in the affairs of the debt, although by some oversight 
nothing had been said about it in the instructions, he resolved 
to pay over the money. In doing this, he bethought himself 
of a mode of obtaining security for the payment, in case any 
succeeding government should disavow the transaction. It 
happened, that the Executive Council in Paris named as their 
bankers the same house in Amsterdam, which had formerly 
33* 



390 LIFE OF 

acted in that capacity for the King. It was Mr Short's plan 
for these bankers to receive the money, as paid from the 
United States on account of the King of France, and for them 
to give a receipt in this form. To this the bankers objected, 
and would act only in the name of the Executive Council. 
At length, on the fifth of September, the money was paid, 
more, as Mr Short acknowledged, in conformity with Mr 
Morris's judgment, than his own. 

As it turned out, although the new order of things in France 
continued, and there was afterwards no difficulty about the 
payments of the debt on that ground, yet Mr Short's senti- 
ments accorded exactly with those of his own government at 
the time. When the news of the revolution of the tenth of 
August reached the United States, Hamilton, then Secretary 
of the Treasury, happened to be absent from the seat of 
government. He wrote immediately to Mr Short, directing 
him to suspend all further payments, adding that he would be 
responsible for obtaining the President's confirmation of that 
order. It was in fact confirmed, for the Secretary of State, 
in his first letter to Mr Morris, after the intelligence of the 
above event had been received, and when it was known only 
through the public papers, gave him the same instructions, 
advising him not to mention the fact to the existing authority, 
unless occasion rendered it necessary, and then with the 
assurance, that the United States had no design to delay the 
payment, and were only solicitous to pay the debt to such 
persons, as were really authorized by the nation to receive it. 

Notwithstanding this coincidence of opinions between Mr 
Short and his own government, he was severely censured by 
the ruling powers in France. M. Maulde, then French 
Ambassador at the Hague, represented Mr Short's conduct in 
very unfavorable terms to the Executive Council, even affirm- 
ing that he refused to pay the money, till a written approba- 
tion signed by the King should bo obtained. This was an 
error, since f.Ir Short requested only, that the bankers would 
receive it in the King's name. The Ambassador also hinted, 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 391 

that Mr Short's intimacies at the Hague were among the 
Foreign Ministers, who were hostile to the French revolution. 
The Executive Council, jealous of their new authority, wrote 
to Mr Morris expressing great indignation at these reports of 
their Ambassador, and adding their conviction, that the 
American government would disapprove, in the most pointed 
manner, the course pursued by their Minister at the Hague. 
All this, however, was manifestly unjust, because Mr Short, 
from the nature of the case, could have no other motive than 
that of doing his duty, by paying the money into proper hands. 

Mr Morris had a concise argument, in regard to the validity 
of the payment. The contract had been made with the old 
government, and the money was paid to the only persons 
pretending to represent the nation. Should the King be 
restored, tiierefore, no future claim could be presented ; and 
should the new order of things continue, the security was 
equally certain, for the money had been paid on that footing. 
But in case of difficulty on either side, the United States had 
the staff in their own hands, and could walk with it which way 
they pleased. They owed more money, and, in a final 
adjustment, could insist on this amount being allowed as a part 
of the extinguished debt. 

While the above transaction was going on in Holland, the 
Executive Council labored hard to push Mr Morris into 
another arrangement, which he resisted. At this time the 
French government were furnishing large supplies of provi- 
sions to the inhabitants of St Domingo. An agreement had 
previously been entered into, by which four hundred thousand 
dollars of the American debt were to be paid in the United 
States, and expended there in purchasing provisions for that 
island. This was thought a favorable scheme to the United 
States, because it was virtually paying the amount to their 
own citizens, in exchange for produce, instead of sending it to 
Europe. It was now proposed by the French Ministry, to 
extend the sum thus expended, to four hundred thousand dol- 
lars more. Some initiatory steps to this effect had already 
been taken with Mr Short. 



392 LIFE OF 

In opening the subject to Mr Morris, the Minister of Marine 
first had an interview with him, and afterwards the three Min- 
isters, Lebrun. Claviere, and Monge, in concert. He told 
them at once, that he had no instructions, and could not act. 
This they chose to consider an evasion, and said he must of 
course regard his instructions as adequate to the fulfilment of 
the essential functions of his office, and particularly to the 
completion of such business, as his predecessor had commenc- 
ed. He repeated what he had often told them, that all money 
concerns were still in the hands of Mr Short. He then ad- 
ded, that even if he were to make such an agreement as they 
desired, it would be void, as he had no instructions to treat 
with the new government. On their own account, therefore, 
it was better for them to wait till he could write, and obtain 
the directions of his government. This last argument was lit- 
tle relished. M. Claviere, in particular, ventured some re- 
marks, which Mr Morris thought indecorous, and to which he 
replied with suitable firmness and spirit. He maintained his 
position, that he could do nothing in this line without instruc- 
tions. The meeting broke up with little cordiality of feeling 
on either side. 

The next day M. Lebrun, Minister of Foreign Affairs, wrote 
to Mr Morris pressing the same thing anew, in a style far 
from courteous or conciliatory. He spoke of the American 
Minister's pretended insufficiency of powers, and observed that, 
upon the principle of his having no instructions to treat with 
the new French government, his functions must have ceased 
altogether, and be then void. But he insisted that this was a 
false view of the subject, th:U the King was only suspended, 
and that, as the government itself was immutable, no Minister 
or Representative could refuse to treat with it, unless he had 
express orders from his ccurt, or constituents. His instructions 
must necessarily remain in force, till countermanded. And 
above all, he was surprised to hear such an objection from a 
Representative of the American Republic. The part acted by 
France, in establishing the independence of that nation, (which 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 393 

M. Lebrun modestly declared was her work) should not be 
forgotten, and, if gratitude slumbered, good will should be 
awake. 

In reply, Mr Morris recapitulated the reasons, which ren- 
dered it impossible for him, without further instructions, to 
meddle in the affairs of the debt. On the other topic he ob- 
serves ; ' As to the supension of the King, Sir, you must sure- 
ly agree with me, that a Minister has no right to express any 
opinion whatever, without the previous order of his nation. 
And when I spoke of it to you, I was not disposed to give 
my opinion ; nor, at your solicitation, did I express anything 
farther, than that you might perceive that even if it were pos- 
sible for me to run the risk of committing myself, by consent- 
ing to the pecuniary arrangements which you desired, and 
which were not confided to me by my government, you would 
still be unable to claim from them the execution of my en- 
gagements ; for though they might recognize your authority, 
yet they would consider it necessary for you to wait my new 
credentials.' He then says, that J he had recently given no- 
tice of his intention to remain in Paris, but the style of the Min- 
ister's letter was such, that he is now induced to request his 
passport, with the view of going over to England, and remain- 
ing there till he should receive further orders from the United 
States. 

It was in this letter, that Mr Morris used the unluckly di- 
plomatic phrase, ' ma cow,' in referring to his own govern- 
ment, and which sounded so harsh in the ears of these newly 
fledged French republicans, that they never forgave him. It 
was treasured up with exemplary care, and figured long after- 
wards in the list of charges, contained in the memorable let- 
ter of Citizen Genet to the Secretary of State, written in conse- 
qnence^ of the recall of that citizen being demanded from the 
French government. 

The following paragraphs in Mr Morris's Diary would seem 
to imply a suspicion, that the offensive letter was dictated by 
Brissot, though sent in the name of M. Lebrun. 



394 LIFE OF 

' August 31nt. Just before dinner, I receive an insulting 
letter from the Minister of Foreign Affairs. In the evening the 
Bishop d'Autun tells me it is written by Brissot ; and that 
their intention is to force me into an acknowledgment of the 
present government. He urges me to go away, because all 
the others of the Corps Diplomatique go, and because t shall 
in staying be exposed to all the insidious malevolence of bad 
men. He recites a scene which passed in his presence, and 
which is alike shocking and ridiculous. He tells me that 
there is a division already among the rulers here. He com- 
municates the views of those, who in the natural course of 
things must become strongest. I give him my reasons for 
thinking, that they pursue an impracticable object. 

' September 1st. I employ the greater part of this morning 
in making a reply to the letter of M. Lebrun and copying it. 
In the evening, I read both, or rather show them, to the Bish- 
op d'Autun, who approves much of my answer, and observes 
that the letter is both absurd and impertinent. I had sent for 
Swan, and told him that his friend, Brissot, instead of promot- 
ing, had spoiled his business, and would drive me out of the 
country. He says that he laments this last point much, as a 
few days must overset the present establishment. I rather 
think he is mistaken, as to the time at least. And there may 
be yet many overturns before there is a settled government'.*

brought back and very ignominiously treated/ Even his papers examin- 
ed, as is said by him. This is strong, and raises in my mind a question, 
whether I ought not to show resentment by leaving the country. I 
have company at dinner, and in the evening I go to sup with Lady 
Sutherland. They cannot get passports. He is in a tearing passion. 
He has burnt his papers, which I will not do. They give me broad

3ral days passed away before anything further was 
heard from M. Lebrun. At length an apologetical letter was 
received, in which he stated that his meaning had been misun- 
derstood, and explained his views more fully, adding that he 
saw no reason why Mr Morris should not await his instructions 
in Paris, and hoped that on reconsideration he would decide 
to remain. This was satisfactory, and he concluded to stay, 
asking only for a passport to travel in the interior of France. 

* September 5th. Mr P. informs me, that the Ministry and 
Secret Committee are in amaze. Verdun, Stenai, and Cler- 
mont are taken. , The country submits and joins the enemy. 
The party of Robespierre has vowed the destruction of Bris- 
sot. The Bishop d'Autun says, that he has seen one of the 
Commission Extraordinaire, that is, the Secret Committee, 
who tells him that there is the most imminent danger. I was 
told that one of the principal Jacobins had expressed his fears, 
or rather despair, not so much on account of the enemy's 
force, as of their internal divisions. 

' September 1th. The Bishop d'Autun says, that he hopes 
to get his passport, and urges me to procure one for myself, 
and quit Paris. He says that he is persuaded, that those who 
now rule mean to quit Paris and take off the King, and that 
their intention is to destroy the city before they leave it. I 
learn that the Commune have shut the barriers, because they 
suspect the Assembly of an intention to retreat. 

' September 8th. The Bishop d'Autun has got his pass- 
port. He does not think the Duke of Brunswick will be able 
to reach Paris, and he urges me strongly to leave it. I have, 



his orders, and shall ask for his passports tomorrow. In the evening 
a number of persons enter, upon r an order to examine my house for 
arms said to be hidden in it. I tell them they shall not examine, 
that there are no arms, and that they must seize the informer, that 
I may bring him to punishment. I am obliged to be very peremp- 
tory, and at length get rid of them.'

hoAvever, received from the Minister an indirect apology for 
his impertinent letter, and therefore I shall stay. 

This first intercourse with the new government promised 
but indifferently for the future. Both parties had got out of 
humor, and considering Mr Morris's well known sentiments 
in regard to the revolution, it is not surprising, perhaps, that 
he should meet with no more cordiality or comity from the 
successive leaders in the new government, than his official 
character demanded, or their interest in keeping on good terms 
with the United States made it expedient for them to show. 
Mr Morris's own impressions in this respect are discoverable in 
a letter to Mr Short, dated November 14th. ' The Ministry,' 
he observes, ' had taken up the idea, that the management of 
what relates to the debt was in my hands, and that you acted 
in consequence of directions from me. They wished me to 
do things, which were by no means in my power. I endeav- 
ored to undeceive them, but in vain. Every step I took in re- 
lation to it, however indifferent, was considered as a proof of 
their hypothesis, and they treated my refusal as a disavowal 
of the late revolution. 1 assured them, that I could neither 
adopt nor reject it, being merely an agent. But this answer- 
ed little purpose, and the whole Council are personally my 
enemies. You may say that they are unreasonable, and the 
like, but that does not alter the thing.' In this affair of the 
money, Mr Morris must be allowed to have met the rude ap- 
proaches of the agents of the Executive Council with mode- 
ration and consistency. He acted clearly on the just princi- 
ples of the case, and from firm conviction of duty, without re- 
gard to political bias, or personal feeling. In whatever he 
had to do with the government, he encountered constant annoy- 
ances even in trifles. When he came over from England, 
he was obliged to pay duties on his carriage and other effects, 
at the custom-house in Calais, a charge from which Ambassa- 
dors and public Ministers are always exempt. For the honor 
of his country, he would not submit to a departure, unimport- 
ant as it was, from the usage of nations, and it took three 



GOUVEKNEUR MORRIS, 397 

months of assiduous application and much writing, ere he 
could obtain a remission of the duties. 

The revolution of the tenth of August may be regarded, 
both as involving the overthrow of the monarchy, and the an- 
nihilation of the constitutional party. The imbecility of the 
King, the intrigues and false councils of the Queen, the mad- 
ness and folly of the high toned monarchists, had gradually 
undermined the little strength originally possessed by the Con- 
stitution, and treacherously paved the way for the ruin of its 
friends. Lafayette was at the head of the Constitutionalists ; 
he had labored in that cause with an ardor and consistency 
worthy of his character, and sustained with fidelity the true 
interests of the King, long after he was himself deserted by 
that monarch, and denounced by his infatuated counsellors. 
He spared no sacrifice of courage and influence to resist the 
torrent, which the feeble measures of Louis was permitting 
daily to gain force, and which Lafayette foresaw would speed- 
ily bear away the landmarks of order, uproot the pillars of 
government, and lead in its desolating train a wild and bloody 
anarchy. 

All his efforts, disinterested, daring, and chivalrous as they 
were, proved unavailing. Forsaken by his timid friends on 
the one side, and menaced by his frantic enemies on the other, 
nothing was left for him but to fly from a scene, where the 
arm of patriotic virtue was paralysed, and danger held out no 
hope for the brave. The Jacobins, resolved on his destruction, 
had decreed his arrest in the National Assembly ; his army, 
hitherto faithful and devoted, were now becoming infected with 
the poison, that had wrought up to such a pitch of insanity 
the populace of the capital ; emissaries were coming out to watch 
his motions, and doubtless to seize his person. At this critical 
moment, he left his army encamped at Sedan, and, in compa- 
ny with a few confidential associates, set off for the Nether- 
lands, intending to seek an asylum in Holland, or the United 
States. At Rochefort, the first Austrian post, he and his com- 
panions were detained, and eventually conducted as prisoners

first to Namur, and thence to Nivelle, a town near the battle 
ground of Waterloo. Shortly afterwards, as all the world 
knows, they were transferred to the dungeons of Wesel and 
Magdeburg, and ultimately to those of Olmutz. 

This treatment of Layfayette by the allied monarchs, like 
the partition of Poland, and other great acts of despotic infa- 
my, has been viewed by writers of all nations and parties, with 
sentiments of unmingled reprobation. Even Sir Walter Scott, 
barren as he is of facts, and parsimonious as he is of justice, 
in all that concerns Lafayette, even Sir Walter Scott censures 
this conduct, as indicating a littleness of spirit disgraceful in a 
prince, and at war with morality, the laws of nations, and 
sound policy. Lafayette had to the last borne arms in sup- 
port of the King ; he had left France to escape the sanguinary 
violence of the very enemies, whom the allies were combined 
to crush ; he had voluntarily put himself in the power of 
these allies ; and yet, under these circumstances, equally 
forgetful of magnanimity, honor, and justice, they seized him 
as a prisoner of war, and treated him as a malefactor. Little 
could General Lafayette have anticipated such perfidy, and it 
was not till he reached Nivelle, that he was fully aware of the 
fate that awaited him in the hands of the allies. From that 
place, on the 26th of August, he wrote the following letter to 
Mr Short, Resident Minister at the Hague from the United 
States. 

' My dear Friend, 

' You have been acquainted with the atrocious events, 
which have taken place in Paris, when the Jacobin faction oil 
the tenth of August overthrew the Constitution, enslaved both 
the Assembly and the King, the one by terror, the other by 
destitution and confinement, and gave a signal for pillage and 
massacre. 

' I could have found a high station in the new order of 
things, without even having meddled with the plot. But my 
feelings did not admit of such an idea. I raised an opposition 
to Jacobin tyranny ; but you know the weakness of our Aon-

netes gens. I was abandoned ; the army gave way lo clubish 
acts. Nothing was left for me but to leave France. We 
have been stopped on our road and detained by. an Austrian 
detachment, which is absolutely contrary to the droits des gens, 
as may appear from the enclosed Declaration, which I request 
you to have published. You will greatly oblige me, my dear 
friend, by setting out for Brussels as soon as this reaches you, 
and insist on seeing me. I am an American citizen, an 
American officer, no more in the French service. That is 
your right, and I do not doubt of your urgent and imme- 
diate arrival. God bless vou. ' LAFAYETTE.' 

tf 

The Declaration was published in the Leyden Gazette, a 
paper edited with much ability by professor Luzac, and which, 
during the American Revolution, had been firmly attached 
to the cause of the United States. The editor was learned 
and liberal, bold and independent. The above Declaration he 
published without charge, saying he was happy to do it as a 
homage of respect to the name of Lafayette. When Mr Short 
received General Lafayette's letter, he felt himself delicately 
situated, but a little reflection convinced him, that nothing in 
reality could be done. However strong his desire to rescue 
his friend, and however highly he knew such an act would be 
lauded by the whole American people, and by the generous 
and just in all countries ; he saw clearly that he had no au- 
thority to make such an attempt, and that an application to the 
Austrian government, where he was not recognized, would be 
looked upon and slighted as a presumptuous interference. He 
conversed with the Austrian Minister at the Hague on the sub- 
ject, who said he would write for information. 

That he might leave nothing undone, however, towards 
effecting the relief of the illustrious prisoner, Mr Short wrote 
immediately to Mr Morris and Mr Pinckney, American Min- 
isters in Paris and London, stating the facts of the case, and 
asking advice. Their letters in reply will be the best exposi- 
tors of their opinions. 



LIFE OF 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS TO WILLIAM SHORT. 

' Paris, September 12th, 1792. 
* Dear Sir, 

' The situation of M. de Lafayette I have long lamented,, 
and since these last disasters, 1 feel more than ever a desire 
to alleviate his distress. I had already meditated on the cir- 
cumstances in which he might be placed, and his imprisonment 
was among those events, which appeared not improbable. 
The enemy may consider him as a prisoner of war, as a desert- 
er, or as a spy. In the first capacity he might be delivered 
up, to be sacrificed by his countrymen ; in the last he might 
be made the victim of resentment, excited by his former con- 
duct. As a deserter, he is entitled to protection, but I doubt 
whether he would choose to be so protected. 

' I incline, however, to the opinion, that the enemy mean to 
use him in a different capacity, and that his future treatment 
will depend entirely on himself; but at the same time, I fear 
that the employment they would give him, is not such as he 
will choose to engage in. Be all this, however, as it may, he 
is in their power, and they will do as they please. The rea- 
sons you urge for his liberation are cogent, and I hope they 
will be attended to ; but power sometimes makes law for 
itself, and in such cases, it cares but little for history or pos- 
terity. 

1 Supposing that M. de Lafayette were a natural born sub- 
ject of America, and taken under the circumstances in which 
he wns placed, I do not exactly see how the United States 
could claim him. He was not in their service. If he had 
been made a prisoner of war, could they claim him as their 
citizen? Tf claimed and delivered up, would they not be bound 
to put him to death, for having attacked a neutral power, or 
else, by the very act of acquitting him, declare war against 
those who had taken him ? Can the United States interfere 
in an affair of this sort, without making themselves parties in 
the quarrel ? But M. de Lafayette is a Frenchman, and it 






GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 401 

is as a Frenchman, that he is taken and is to be treated. 
Again, supposing the right as clear as it is questionable, I pre- 
sume that before the United States made such demand, they 
would determine to go all lengths to establish their right, in 
case it should be refused ; for otherwise by advancing the 
claim, and then receding, they would sit down quietly under 
an insult. Consequently they would consider well, before 
they placed themselves in a situation to be dishonored, or else 
drawn into a war. 

' These are points of such magnitude, that I do not feel my- 
self competent to decide on them, in behalf of my country ; 
and, therefore, if I were Minister to his Imperial Majesty, I 
should, I think, confine myself to prayer and solicitation, until 
I received express orders from the President of the United 
States. But as I am not Minister to the Emperor, I rather 
think that my interference would prove offensive, and do more 
harm than good to Monsieur de Lafayette. And not only 
the Emperor, and perhaps the King of Prussia too, might com- 
plain, if they thought it worth while to take any notice of such 
unauthorized application ; but the government of this country, 
also, might feel itself offended, and that in either of those 
events, which are now at the issue of the sword. If there was, 
however, any probability that a demand on our part would 
liberate him, it might be well to attempt it. You may perhaps 
find out how that matter stands, through the medium of the 
Court at which you are, and this it would, I think, be well to 
do. If the Austrian Ministry should wish an excuse to deliver 
him from bondage, they may admit of that which you men- 
tion, but certainly they will not consider it as a reason. I am, 
&tc. ' GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.' 

THOMAS P1NCKNEY TO WILLIAM SHORT. 

'London, September 14th, 1792. 
Dear Sir, 

' Among the afflicting considerations, which have impressed 
themselves on my mind, from the moment I heard of the mis* 
34* 



402 LIFE OF 

fortune of our friend and fellow-citizen, the Marquis Lafayette, 
none have affected me with such painful sensations, as the 
conviction, that no exertions of his American friends can be 
of utility to him in his present situation ; and since the receipt 
of your favor of the seventh, which did not reach me till yes- 
terday, this subject has scarcely been a moment out of my 
thoughts. But I search in vain for some foundation whereon 
to establish a right to demand his liberation; and to demand 
it with a certainty of refusal, and with a consciousness, that 
such refusal may be founded on principles of propriety, would, 
without benefitting our friend, commit our country and our- 
selves. 

' I feel myself, however, so much interested in this business, 
that it will afford me real pleasure to find that Mr Morris, or 
you, upon more mature reflection, have devised any plan to 
which my concurrence can add efficacy. And in order to 
evince the readiness, with which I contribute my endeavors to 
strike out some expedient, which may be serviceable, I ven- 
ture to enclose for the deliberation of Mr Morris and yourself 
a rough sketch of a note, to which, however, I perceive forci- 
ble objections ; and only submit it as the least exceptionable 
of such ideas, as have suggested themselves to me. A claim 
of the rights of an American citizen, to a person in the Maf- 
quis's eircumstances, appears to me to be claiming nothing, 
and it can only, I fear, at best, serve as a testimonial of national 
gratitude, and may be a consolatory tribute to the feelings of a 
man, of whose services and zeal for our country there is I be- 
lieve but one sentiment in America. If a measure of that, or 
any other nature, should be adopted, it ought, I conceive, to be 
so conducted as to avoid involving any discussion of principle, 
and should be the joint act of all the American Ministers in 
Europe, if distance of situation will permit their uniting in the 
time necessary to render it serviceable. I am, &tc. 

' THOMAS PINCKNEY.' 

The draft of a note, to which Mr Pinckney alludes, was intend- 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 403 

ed to be signed conjointly by the Amercan Ministers in Europe, 
and sent to the Imperial Ministers at the Courts where they re- 
sided. It contained merely a declaration, that Lafayette was 
a citizen of-the United States, an expression of confidence, 
that he would be protected in the rights belonging to such a 
character, and an assurance, that a liberal construction of these 
rights in his favor would command the utmost gratitude of their 
constituents. But the paper was never sent. The American 
Ministers were persuaded of the impropriety, and the total 
inefficiency, of any interference on their part, and were com- 
pelled to leave this early and ardent friend of their country to the 
rigor of his fate, watching only for such incidental events or 
circumstances, as might be turned to his advantage. So 
completely was he hidden from the world, that for a long 
time no intelligence of him could be obtained, Mr Short, by 
reason of the place of his residence, had the best opportuni- 
ty of gaining information. He wrote to Mr Morris as follows. 
' The Hague, December 1th, 1792. As to our fellow-citizen 
in confinement, and of whom you desire to be fully inform- 
ed, I can only tell you, that the most impenetrable secrecy 
has been observed with respect to him and his fellow suffer- 
ers. It is certain, that he is the individual of all France, that 
both Austrians and Prussians hate the most cordially. The 
desire of revenge, and determination to punish, made them 
commit the most flagrant act of injustice, and the most shame- 
ful violation of the droit des gens. They are probably sensi- 
ble of it, and therefore wish to smother the whole business, 
and the victims also. It is certain the agents of the Emperor 
and of Prussia here, are ignorant of what passes ; which is 
probably confined to the walls of the donjon of Wesel. It has 
been reported, that our fellow-citizen has lost his reason, and 
is in a state of insanity. Although I cannot assure, that it is 
not so, yet I should suppose it was not, from what these gen- 
tlemen have told me, though they can only speak from con- 
jecture. In fine, I have never been able to learn a single 
word with certainty respecting these prisoners, since their 



404 LIFE OF 

transportation to Wesel, nor has anybody else here been able 
to do it.' 

When the news of these transactions reached the American 
government, they approved the conduct of the Ministers, and 
instructed them to spare no pains, by the use of all feasible 
means, to procure the liberation of Lafayette. The result is 
well known. There was no intercourse between the Courts 
of Prussia and Austria and the government of the United States, 
and consequently no mode of opening a direct negotiation. 
And if there had been, there was no probability of success. 
The allied powers had decided the point on grounds, from 
which they were not to be moved by appeals to justice, rea- 
son, morality, religion, or any other principles, which usually 
operate on minds conscious of rectitude and an honorable pur- 
pose. They had shamefully set all these at defiance, and 
yielded to a pitiful spirit of malevolence and revenge, in 
torturing a person of high rank and character, whom the 
caprices of fortune had betrayed into their hands. Would 
such men be influenced by the laws of nations, or the claims of 
right pressed upon them by Commissioners from the new 
world? Surely not. Washington wrote a letter to the 
Emperor of Austria, expressly in behalf of Lafayette, but it 
was disregarded. Any other application, through whatever 
channel, or presented in whatever manner, would have met 
with the same neglect. While Lafayette was in the prison of 
Magdeburg, some secret attempts were made by his friends in 
London to effect his release, but without avail. Mr Pinck- 
ney was consulted by the persons concerned, and he favored 
their plans, as far as prudence and circumstances would per- 
mit. 

In the mean time, Mr Morris bethought himself of a dif- 
ferent expedient. He drafted a petition to be sent by 
Madame de Lafayette to the King of Prussia. It was in the 
nature of a supplicatory address, and intended to work upon the 
gentler qualities of a heart, which had shown itself insensible to 
the higher traits of magnanimity and justice. ' He, in whose 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 405 

favor I implore the mercy of your Majesty,' she is made to say 
in the petition, ; has never known crime. Faithful to his 
King, when he could no longer be of service to him, he left 
France. At the moment when he was made prisoner, he was 
crossing the Low Countries to take refuge in America. He 
believed himself under the protection of the law of -nations, 
and he trusted to it with so much the more confidence, as the 
generous sentiments of your Majesty were not unknown to 
him. I may perhaps be blind to the character of a beloved 
husband, but 1 cannot deceive myself in being persuaded, 
that your Majesty will grant the prayer of an unhappy 
woman.' This draft was forwarded to Madame de Lafayette 
with a letter. 

' Paris, November 7th, 1792. 

' My Dear Madam, 

' I need not tell you why the enclosed paper is transmitted 
to you. I know not the titles of the King of Prussia. These 
should be properly placed, you know, because monarchs are 
very sensitive on that subject. If reports say true, his majesty 
is more likely to listen to a woman than to a man, and this is 
favorable ; but what would be still more advantageous, would 
be to have your letter presented by the favorite of the day. I 
am told that Madame de Guiche has lately received his adora- 
tions. If you were to plead your cause in a court of justice, 
it might be well to insist on the rights of our unfortunate friend, 
but as the person to whom you address yourself is both judge 
and party, the matter of right must be touched with great gen- 
tleness. 

' Be of good courage, for sooner or later the present clouds 
will be dissipated. All human things are liable to change. 
You may remember, that I used to inculcate that maxim when 
circumstances were smiling. It was then true, and it is still 
true. But then it was unpleasant, and now it will afford con- 
solation. Farewell, my dear Madam. It will give me sincere 
pleasure to be useful to you and yours. 

' GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.' 



406 LIFE or 

As soon as Mr Morris learned, that the prisoner in Mag- 
deburg was distressed for money, he gave directions to the 
banker of the United States at Amsterdam to pay to his order 
ten thousand florins, stating at the same time, that he did this 
without authority, and held himself individually responsible for 
the amount. It was ultimately allowed by the government, 
under the name of compensation for Lafayette's military ser- 
vices in America. 

The following letter, written in the prison of Magdeburg, 
by General Lafayette to the Princess d'Henin, presents a 
vivid picture of his sufferings in that dungeon, and at Wesel. 
The Princess d'Henin was then residing in London. By the 
advice of her friends, she forwarded to General Washington 
the original letter, from which has been made the translation 
here published. 

' GENERAL, LAFAYETTE TO THE PRINCESS I^HENIN. 

' Magdeburg, March 15tL, 1793. 

' I am still alive, my dear Princess, and able to tell you so, 
but these are the only two important facts which I can send 
you. This letter is designed both for you and my wife and 
children, of whose place of residence I am ignorant, and for 
those among my friends to whom you and Madame Lafayette 
shall think proper to communicate it. 

' You have been informed of all that has happened to us, 
from the time of the fatal rencounter at Rochefort, till, given 
up by Austria to Prussia, we were transported to Wesel. You 
must also have learnt some particulars respecting our captivi- 
ty in that citadel. It would require a very long account to in- 
form you of all the precautions, that were devised to cut off 
every communication between us and the rest of the world, to 
retain us in our prison, to watch us closely, and to multiply 
our privations. Lameth was dying for several weeks ; I suf- 
fered very much in my lungs and nerves, from fever and want 
of sleep ; our two other companions suffered also ; and as the 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 407 

King of Prussia had again prohibited us from taking fresh air, 
although the physician thought it necessary ; as it had been 
signified to Maubourg, who was by accident apprized of my 
condition, that even on the bed of death we should not see 
each other ; and as the commandant was responsible with his 
head for his vigilance, we were glad to hear of our removal, 
which would reunite us again for some time, and which, by 
enabling us to respire fresh air, would greatly contribute to re- 
establish our health. 

' Our passage through Germany, whatever may have been 
the original intention, was most highly honorable to the mar- 
tyrs of a glorious cause, and has not a little contributed to ex- 
cite towards us a flattering interest, and ideas very different 
from those which were anticipated. The observations that 
were made respecting the last sixteen years of my life, the 
state of things on this side of the Rhine, and the spectacle of 
the four captives, did not appear to me during our journey to 
indicate anything that could alarm us. 

' And now I will present you with a description of my pris- 
on and my manner of life. 

' Represent to yourself an opening made in the rampart of 
the citadel, and encompassed with a high and strong palli- 
sade. It is by that passage, tnat entering successively through 
four gates, each one of which is armed with chains, locks, and 
bars of iron, you may reach, not without difficulty and noise, 
my cell. This cell is three paces broad and five and a half 
long, containing no other ornament than two French verses, 
which rhyme with the words to suffer and to die (souffrir et 
mourir). The wall next to the ditch is dripping with moisture, 
and that opposite permits the light of day, but not the rays of 
the sun, to enter through a small but closely grated window. 
Imagine also two sentinels, whose eyes constantly penetrate 
my subterranean abode, but from beyond the pallisade in or- 
der to prevent our speaking to each other, spies set over us 
distinct from the guard ; and in addition to this, the walls, the 
ramparts, the ditches and the guards, within and without the 



408 LIFE OF 

citadel of Magdeburg, and you will see, my dear Princess, 
that the foreign powers neglect nothing to retain me in their 
dominions. 

( The clanking of my four gates is renewed each morning, 
when they are opened to admit my domestic; again at dinner, 
when I cat in presence of the commandant of the citadel and 
of the guard j and lastly at night to remand my servant to his 
prison ; after which, having made fast all the locks, the com- 
mandant carries with him the keys into the apartment, where, 
since my arrival, the King has ordered him to sleep. 

' Books are furnished me, from which the white leaves have 
been torn out, but I have no news, no gazettes, no communi- 
cation, neither ink, nor pen, nor pencil ; and it is by a miracle 
that I possess this sheet, on which I write to you with a tooth- 
pick. 

' My health declines ; my physical has almost as much need 
of liberty as my moral constitution. The small quantity of air, 
which reaches me in this subterranean cell, affords little relief 
to my lungs ; I am often afflicted with fever ; I have no exer- 
cise, and little sleep ; yet I make no complaint, knowing by 
experience how useless it would be. But I am tenacious of 
my life, and my friends may be assured of the active cojflttjt. 
rence of all the sentiments, which lead me to value the preser- 
vation of my existence, although considering my situation, and 
the progress of my suffering, I cannot much longer answer for 
their efficacy. Perhaps it is better to prepare them in this 
manner, than to surprise them hereafter with the worst. 

' The account which I have given you, will serve also for my 
three companions, whose situation is similar. I doubt if La- 
meth will long hold out ; he was dying at Wesel, and is but lit- 
tle better here. M.de Pusy'suffers much, although he is less ill. 
The same may be said of Maubourg, whose cell is situated on 
the same subterranean corridor with mine, and as, in order to 
prevent me from suffocating at once, they open the two inner- 
most of my four gates a few hours before dinner, I am some- 
times able, on the unbarring of his doors, and in the presence 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 409 

of the commandant, to observe with much pain, that his appear- 
ance is greatly changed. Whatever care they have taken to 
tantalize us by the deprivation of news, we have at length ob- 
tained intelligence of the success of the French armies, the 
mismanagement of public affairs, the assassination of the King, 
in which all the laws of humanity, of justice, and of the nation- 
al compact have been trampled under foot, and the abomina- 
ble murder of my virtuous friend, Larochefoucauld ; but all in- 
formation respecting my wife, my children, and my other 
friends, has been so completely intercepted, with the exception 
of a few words from Damas at the time of our singular meet- 
ing at Ham, that I am in the most painful anxiety as to the 
state of all that is most dear to me. If it were true, as they 
take pains to tell us, but which I cannot believe, that all who 
do not abjure the principles of the Declaration of Rights must 
leave England, my family surely cannot be there. 

' Ten thousand florins have been deposited here on the part 
of the United States, which sum will prevent me, when my 
own money shall be exhausted, from living on bread and wa- 
ter ; but although my American friends are doubtless more 
occupied concerning my liberty than my sustenance, I have 
not heard anything further. I know that the Prince of Coburg 
has had great success against the dispersed detachments of 
Dumouriez, yet in the midst of the strifes of anarchy, and of 
so many hostile attacks, liberty, in spite of all her enemies, will 
not perish. 

'This letter will reach you by way of Hamburg, but I know

it will be forwarded by him. I beg you to pay whatsoever

ignorant what precautions will be taken, and only request you 
to avoid the post offices both in England and elsewhere, it will 
remain with the bearer, with you, and the friends to whom 
Lameth may write, to arrange this matter. But you will con- 
ceive with what anxiety I wait for letters from my family, and 
from you. I recommend, moreover, an inviolable discretion,

on which may depend the fortune and the life of every person, 
who, being under the rule of these governments, shall have 
rendered us any service ; and the fear of compromitting them 
makes me weigh every word with circumspection, from which 
I flatter myself you will not infer any diminution of my forti- 
tude. 

' You will easily conceive how ardently we sigh for our res- 
urrection from this tomb. It was neither just nor politic to 
arrest us, nor is it just or politic to retain us. This we have 
once represented; our friends may directly and indirectly oft- 
en repeat it. This slow death is dreadful to us, and, without 
inquiring to whom it can give joy, I should be extremely glad 
if you could extricate us from it. Communicate to the family 
of Pusy and of Maubourg, who are in France, this intelligence 
respecting my two companions. Send us information of them, 
and in London see the friends of Lameth. They have each a 
servant, and I have two ; one of whom, Felix, has been put 
into a separate cell, and the other, a native of Chavaniac, waits 
on me. We wish their families may know that they are not 
dead. 

' If you know my aunt, judge how anxious I am concerning 
her health. I embrace my wife and my children. Adieu, 
my dear Princess ; a thousand kindnesses to my friends ; you 

know mine for you. 

' LAFAYETTE.' 

'P. S. I know not what disposition has been made of my 
plantation at Cayenne, but I hope Madame Lafayette will take 
care that the negroes, who cultivate it, shall preserve their lib- 
erty.' 

Madame de Lafayette and her children, in common with 
most others of the nobility, were confined to their province. 
They continued at the family residence of Chavaniac, in Au- 
vergne. Owing to a disastrous train of events, she found the 
state of her husband's affairs much deranged, and was particu- 
larly concerned on account of a list of debts to dependants and 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 411 

other persons, who had rendered services to her family, and 
for the liquidation of which she considered his honor and her's 
as standing pledged. To relieve her anxiety, and enable her 
to discharge these debts, Mr Morris loaned to her from his 
private funds one hundred thousand livres. On this occasion 
she wrote to him ; ' In the midst of all its anguish, my heart tru- 
ly dilates at this moment with the feeling of lively gratitude, 
which your goodness inspires in me. I already owe to you 
the hope of seeing the chains, to me indissoluble, imposed by 
honor and probity, broken. In any other circumstances, and 
even in these, were it to any other person, it would be very 
painful to me to incur such obligations, as I am now contract- 
ing to you ; but I think of him, to whom I am indebted for the 
steps taken in my behalf, of those who with me are to receive 
the benefit of them, and I feel the consolation, rather than the 
weight, of these obligations. My gratitude to you, Sir, must 
be very sincere, and deeply felt, since it triumphs over all my 
resolutions, and I accept your offers of personal service, al- 
though I feel their full value and generosity. It would not be 
easy for me to express my feelings better, than by such con- 
fidence.' 

At length Madame de Lafayette was brought up to Paris, 
and imprisoned. Her friends were naturally alarmed for her 
safety. Mr Morris made an immediate application to the pro- 
per authority for her relief, stating in substance, that he did 
not know whether she was brought up to be tried, or only to 
a safer place of confinement ; that he did not pretend to med- 
dle with matters foreign to his mission, but thought it proper 
on that occasion to prove his attachment to the cause, in which 
the French were embarked ; that his letter was not official, 
but dictated by a friendly sentiment ; that the family of Lafay- 
ette was beloved in America, where the whole people enter- 
tained a grateful recollection of his services, and, therefore, the 
death of his wife might lessen their attachment to the French 
Republic ; that it would furnish the partisans of England with 
the means of misrepresenting what passed in France ; that so 



412 LIFE OF 

far from conciliating friends to the Republic, it would gratify 
its enemies, \vho would rejoice at the destruction of everything, 
which bore the name of Lafayette. 

Tiiis letter was written a short time before Mr Morris 
ceased to be Minister, and was succeeded by Mr Monroe. It 
did not procure her release from imprisonment, but it seems to 
have averted the catastrophe of the death, which awaited her, 
lor, in writing to him a few weeks afterwards from her prison, 
she speaks of his having l saved her from the rage of a mon- 
ster, and prevented a crime.' Again, at a later period, in 
alluding to the money she had borrowed, she writes ; ' this is 
a slight obligation, it is true, compared with that of my life, 
but allow me to remember both, while life lasts, with a senti- 
ment of gratitude, which it is precious to feel. That life was 
restored to me, a more endearing gift, if it can administer con- 
solation to him, whom I love.' This was written at Altona, 
after she had escaped from the perils, which threatened her in 
Paris, and was on her way, with her two daughters, to share 
the dismal fate of her husband in the prison of Olmutz. Her 
courage, constancy, and sufferings, in executing that bold en- 
terprise, are well known, and their record is among the bright- 
est pages in the annals of female heroism. 

In the midst of the sanguinary horrors of Paris, Mr Morris 
was advised from many quarters to follow the example of the 
other foreign Ministers, and leave the country, but this he de- 
clined, and remained firm at his post, though surrounded with 
innumerable difficulties, and much real danger. He was at 
one time arrested in the street, because he had not a Carte de 
Citoyen, and taken before the tribunal of arrests. At another 
time, a body of armed men came into his house, for the pur- 
pose of searching it, although by the laws of nations it ought 
to have been exempt from all such intrusions. Again, on a 
short journey into the country, he was arrested and sent back 
to Paris, under pretence that the passport, which he had re- 
ceived from the government, was out of date. These insults, 
it is true, were commonly followed by apologies from the Min- 



GOUVERNEDR MORRIS, 413 

isters, chiefly on the ground of its being impossible to control 
all the acts of subordinate agents, during the violent scenes of 
revolutionary change. This was true, nor is it probable that 
the government were accessary to any direct marks of disre- 
spect to the American Minister; it was their strong interest to 
pursue a different course. They were deserted by all the 
world, except the United States, and they could have no mo- 
tive for offending and alienating this last and only friend. Such 
were the rapid transitions, however, from one form of anarchy 
to another, and such monsters worked their way through blood 
and carnage to the head of affairs, that the laws of nations and 
of honor afforded but a feeble security to any individual with- 
in the reach of their power. Indeed, Mr Morris had provo- 
cations enough for demanding his passport, and retiring from 
France, had he chosen to view them as he would have done in 
tranquil times, but he looked upon the public interests as 
paramount to all other considerations, and as demanding every 
personal sacrifice, not absolutely at variance with the honor of 
his country. 

After the tenth of August his Diary became a barren record of 
unimportant events, and in the January succeeding he brought 
it to a close, with the following memorandum. ' The situation 
of things is such, that to continue this journal would compro- 
mise many people, unless I go on in the way I have done since 
the end of August, in which case it must be insipid and use- 
less. I prefer, therefore, the more simple measure of putting 
an end to it.' He confined himself closely to his public du- 
ties, and all that is known of his ministerial career may be 
found in his correspondence of that period. 

So critical was his situation at one time, that a rumor went 
abroad, and was circulated in the English and American news- 
papers, of his having lost his life. In allusion to this report, 
he wrote thus to Robert Morris. 

' Paris, March 12th, 1793.

shortly, that I may reply immediately. My reason for which 
is, that I am told that the London Gazetteers have killed me, 
besides burning my house, and other little pleasantries of the 
same kind. Now as these accounts may be republished, I ap- 
prize you thereof, and pray you to vouch, that it was not 
true at the time of publication. 

'You tell me that, in my place, you would resign and come

but further, you will consider that the very circumstances, 
which you mention, are strong reasons for abiding, because it 
is not permitted to abandon a post in the hour of difficulty.

you, that my continuance here has not been without some 
use to the United States. I am always and truly yours, 

' GOUVERNEUR MoRUIS.' 

That he might have retirement, and be freed from the 
confusion and disorders of the capital, he purchased a country 
house, and about twenty acres of land, at Sain port, nearly 
thirty miles from Paris, to which he removed, and at which 
he resided during the rest of his stay in France, except oc- 
casional visits to Paris. His secretary, Mr Livingston, re- 
mained chiefly in the city. He describes his country seat as 
an agreeable residence, situated on the margin of a small 
stream, and close upon the borders of the village of Sainport. 

'My prospect,' says he, 'is rural, not extensive. At a 
mile and a half, on the southwest, are the ruins of baths, 
which once belonged to the fair Gabrielle, favorite mistress of 
Henry the Fourth ; and at half of that distance, in the oppo- 
site direction, stands on a high plain the magnificent Pavilion 
built by Bouret. He was what is here called an homme de 
finance. He expended on that building and its gardens 
about half a million sterling, and after squandering in the 
whole about two millions sterling, he put himself to death, 
because he had nothing to live on. I think you will acknow- 






GOUVERNEUR MORH1S. 415 

ledge, that the objects just mentioned are well calculated to 
show the vanity of human pursuits and possessions. 

' My time is spent in reading and writing, of which last I 
have not a little. The French privateers employ many of my 
hours, for the masters and agents of the American vessels they 
take, apply to me for advice and assistance. The other day 
I was desired, on the part of a merchant in London, to claim of 
the Ministry some rice and indigo; but I know neither by 
whom, nor when, nor where they were taken, nor where they 
are deposited. Without observing, however, on so strange and so 
lame a request, I desired the person who made it to appoint an 
agent in the port, with directions to state a proper claim before 
the competent judicature. I wonder what this person would 
have thought, had anybody asked a Secretary of State in Eng- 
land to deliver up goods taken by one of his privateers. 

' I have had applications to grant the privileges of the 
American flag to vessels owned by Frenchmen and others. 
Some of the applicants were offended at my refusal of that 
trifling favor. The state of the government here is also a 
great plague, for it is difficult to discover the best mode of 
compassing an object, when the parties who are to decide are 
perpetually changing. Our old Congress was nothing to this 
Convention ; and you will form a tolerable idea of the nature 
and extent of that influence, which the city of Paris exercises, 
from some late events.' 

His official duties related 'to few objects, but these were in- 
cessantly recurring. They consisted (besides the money 
affairs, which have already been noticed,) in protests against 
decrees of the Convention of France, imposing restrictions on 
the commerce of the United States, and thereby violating the 
treaty between the two countries ; in remonstrances against the 
outrages of French privateers upon American shipping, and 
reclamation of vessels unlawfully seized ; in urging the peti- 
tions and claims of American captains, whose ships were 
detained in French ports on various pretences ; and in apply- 
ing for the release of American citizens, who contrived to get 



416 LIFE or 

into prison, either by being taken for Englishmen, or by some 
informality in their papers. These objects, in their various 
and complicated relations, required industrious attention, and 
careful management. 

Some months previous to the end of his mission, Mr Morris 
was called on to render an act of kindness, if not of official 
duty, to his old friend Paine, who had found his way into the 
prisons of the Luxembourg in Paris. The reader will remem- 
ber on what footing their acquaintance stood, in the days of 
the American Revolution. They had since met in England, 
where Paine frequently visited Mr Morris, and endeavored to 
interest him in a new bridge he had invented, in the intervals 
of his political speculations. Knowing Mr Morris's turn for 
mathematics and mechanics, he requested him to calculate the 
arch of his bridge, and to render him other assistance in that 
line. At length Paine came to Paris, being adopted as a citi- 
zen by the Convention, and chosen a member of that body by 
the Department of Calais. Here he renewed his visits to the 
American Minister, with a show of attachment ; but Mr Morris 
discovered, or was confirmed in the belief, that he was playing 
a treacherous part, and intriguing against him. Paine was 
imprisoned as being one of the Girondist party in the Conven- 
tion, and it is not exactly known how he escaped the fate of 
his confraternity. Mr Morris ascribes it to the contempt in 
which he was held. He had become extremely intemperate, 
and disgusting in his person and deportment. At his request, 
however, Mr Morris applied for his release as a citizen of the 
United States. 

The application, it must be confessed, was neither pressing 
in its terms, nor cogent in its arguments. It was little more 
than a statement of facts, as to Paine's birth in England, and 
citizenship in America. In truth, Mr Morris did not believe 
he had any right to claim him on that ground, for, although he 
was once a citizen of the United States, he had since become 
a citizen of France, and in that character he was imprisoned. 
The Minister replied nearly to the same effect, namely, that 
in accepting the title of French citizen, and sitting in the 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 417 

% 

legislative councils of the nation, he had subjected himself to 
the laws of the Republic, and renounced the protection, which 
the law of nations and the treaties with the United States 
might otherwise have secured to him. The Minister's letter 
Mr Morris enclosed in another to Paine, who wrote in reply ; 

' 1 received your letter enclosing a copy of a letter from the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs. You must not leave me in the 
situation in which this letter places me. You know I do not 
deserve it, and you see the unpleasant situation into which I 
am thrown. I have made an essay of a letter, in answer to the 
Minister's letter, which I wish you to make the ground of a 
reply to him. They have nothing against me, except they 
do not choose I should be in a state of freedom to write my 
mind freely upon the things I have seen. Though you and I 
are not on terms of the best harmony, I apply to you as the 
Minister of America; and you may add to that service whatev- 
er you think my integrity deserves. At any rate, I request 
you to make Congress acquainted with my situation, and to 
send to them copies of the letters that have past on the subject. 
A reply to the Minister's letter is absolutely necessary, were 
it only to continue the reclamation, otherwise your silence will 
be a sort of consent to his observations.' 

This draft of a letter, to which he alludes, was ingenious. 
He first proves himself to have been an American citizen, a 
character of which he affirms no subsequent act had deprived 
him. The title of French citizen was a mere nominal and 
honorary one, which the Convention chose to confer, when 
they asked him over to help them in making a constitution. 
But let the nature or honor of the title be what it might, the 
Convention had taken it away, of their own accord. l He was 
excluded from the Convention on the motion for excluding 
foreigners. Consequently he was no longer under the law of 
the Republic as a citizen, but under the protection of the 
treaty of alliance, as fully and effectually as any other citizen 
of America.' It was, therefore, the duty of the American 
Minister to demand his release. 



Such is the drift of Paine's argument, and it would seem, in- 
deed, that he could not be a foreigner and a citizen at the 
same time. It was hard, that his only privilege of citizenship 
should be that of imprisonment. But this logic was a little 
too refined for the revolutionary tribunals of the Jacobins in 
Paris, and Mr Morris well knew it was not worth while to 
preach it to them. He did not believe there was any serious 
design at that time against the Jife of the prisoner, and he con- 
sidered his best chance of safety to be in preserving silence 
for the present. Here the matter rested, and Paine was left 
undisturbed, till the arrival of Mr Monroe, who procured his 
discharge from confinement. For several months he lived in 
Mr Monroe's house, but so intemperate were his habits, and 
disagreeable his person, that it was necessary to exclude him 
from the family, and send his meals to his own apartments. 

Whilst Mr Morris was thus representing his country in 
France with dignity, firmness, and propriety, the Citizen Genet, 
French Minister in the United States, was, by some strange in- 
fatuation, practising a very extraordinary series of experiments 
upon the forbearance of the American people. These are 
too well known to need recapitulation. Suffice it to say, that 
the diplomatic aberrations of the Citizen Minister compelled the 
American government to demand his recall from the French 
Republic. This demand was transmitted through the hands 
of Mr Morris, and was acceded to immediately. In return, 
the French government solicited the American Minister's re- 
call, which, as an act of reciprocity, could not be refused. No 
charge whatever appears to have been preferred, nor anything 
more -than a request, on the ground of a ' reciprocal act.' 
When the Secretary of State communicated this intelligence, 
he assured Mr Morris that his conduct had given perfect sat- 
isfaction. The President likewise wrote him two private let- 
ters, containing, the same assurance, and adding that his confi- 
dence, friendship, and regard, were undiminished. Alter these 
testimonies, Mr Morris had little to regret in resigning a sta- 
tion, which had been anything to him but a source of enjoy- 
ment. 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 419 

He was not unprepared for this event. The persons in 
power he knew very well entertained towards him no friendly 
feeling. His former devotedness to the cause of the King, and 
the boldness with which he always expressed his political sen- 
timents, had fixed impressions not to be removed or softened. 
Of this he was made fully aware, on more occasions than one ; 
for, although his representations, relating directly to the concerns 
of his country, were duly regarded, yet in matters of minor 
weight, resting chiefly on personal influence, he met with de- 
lays and evasions by no means flattering. In one instance, a 
lady of high respectability, who had taken refuge in his house, 
and to whom he had afforded protection, was seized and im- 
prisoned, contrary to his remonstrances and his claims under 
the laws of nations. 

He had also heard rumors of the intention to ask his recall, 
and in such a way as left him little room to doubt the fact. 
It may be imagined, however, that he was not much gratified 
at the readiness with which a bare request for that object, 
unsupported by a single valid reason or pretended charge, was 
listened to by his government. The sole ground of his recall 
was the tenor of his political opinions, which had nothing to 
do with his character as Minister. After the downfall of the 
King, he had not entered in the remotest degree into the 
affairs of France, and, except the little altercation about the 
St Domingo business, which happened at the beginning of his 
mission, there had been a perfect harmony between him and 
the successive Ministers of the French Republic. He should 
be judged by his conduct after his official appointment, and 
not by his previous acts or sentiments as a private individual. 
This was a strong view of the case, and it no doubt occurred 
to Washington, yet circumstances wore a complexion at that 
time, which made it expedient to comply with the wishes of 
the French Cabinet in this matter, especially as it is desirable, 
in any state of things, that a minister should be acceptable to 
the government at which he is accredited.

MR MONROE arrived at Paris in August, 1794, as successor 
to Mr Morris, whose purpose then was to return soon to the 
United States. In the end, however, this plan was altered. 
He remained several years in Europe, visiting some of the 
principal Courts, and travelling through many countries. The 
limits of this memoir will admit only a brief notice of these 
peregrinations, and such sketches from his Diary, now again re- 
sumed, as will mark the occasional turn of his thoughts, and 
objects of his inquiry. He left Paris, on the twelfth of Oc- 
tober, for Switzerland. 

From the Diary, October 12th, \ 794. ' Before I left Paris, 
Mr Monroe called on me and explained his conduct and his 
views. He begins to find out that fine words are of little 
value ; and his letters from America show me, that something 
more is expected, and justly expected there, for the many 
violences committed against our merchants. In my opinion, 
he has taken the wrong tone at first, and will find much diffi- 
culty in changing it now. Time must determine a pretty se- 
rious question on that subject, so far as I am personally con- 
cerned at least. I have the consolation to have made 
no sacrifice, either of personal or national dignity, and I believe 
I should have. obtained everything, if the American govern- 



GOUVERNEUR MOttRIS. 421 

inent had refused to recall me. I rejoice that I am no long- 
er in the pitiful situation, which I have so long endured. For 
the rest, experience must decide, and I hope that events will 
be favorable to America.' 

On entering Switzerland, he passed a day with M. Necker 
at Copet, and another with Madame de Stael, who was then 
living in that neighborhood. 

' October 23d. Go to dinner at Madame de StaeTs, where 
I am received with great warmth ; the more necessary as I 
have a villanous ague. A good appetite at dinner, but the 
ague comes on very strong, and then the fever, which is gentle. 
We have much talk, or rather I have, for they are desirous of 
information both public and private ; and I am more in condi- 
tion to give it than most others. There is here a little French 
society, which live at her expense, and are as gay as circum- 
stances will permit. The road to her house is up-hill and ex- 
ecrable, so that I think I shall not again go thither. On my 
return, being much out of sorts, I find the bed the properest 
place for me, and my pillow the fittest society. 

' Basle, November Qth. Supper is here, I find, the great 
meal ; dinner being an affair of twelve o'clock. In going out 
this morning I observed that everybody as I passed saluted 
me with great respect. I thought it odd, that the manners of 
any country should extend so far the exterior of civility, and 
especially to strangers. It seemed like what we read of in 
China. This evening Madame Ehinger explains the mystery. 
In the same inn with me lodge some deputies of the other 
Cantons, who according to the constitution, pass three months 
here, and are even obliged to live in this inn. They, it seems, 
use the same coach which I have for this day, and, of course, 
all the profound reverences, which I observed, were made to 
me as deputy perhaps only to the coach. This extreme 
respect for the Magistracy proves, however, in favor of the 
government. 

' Schaffhausen, November 1 5th. Go with Monsieur Hu- 
ber to see the falls of the Rhine, and walk a good part of

422 LIFE OF 

the way, which I think does me good. We look at the fa- 
mous bridge. I am not architect enough to understand it, 
but I wonder much it has never been imitated. If time would 
permit, I would get a plan of it, for it would certainly be use- 
ful in America. The cataract of the Rhine is a very fine ob- 
ject. The color of the water, which resembles that of the 
ocean, is prodigiously fine when beaten into foam. There is 
also in the little slope of the rock, over which it rushes down, 
an advantage of effect ; for the river, instead of seeming to fall 
from the want of a support, as is the case in perpendicular 
cataracts, here leaps and bounds, and then precipitates itself, 
as if indignant that anything should have presumed to impede 
its course. The whole height is said, from actual measure- 
ment, to be between seventy and eighty feet, and the river is 
large. At the foot is a good salmon fishery ; but they take 
these fish, I understand, with a harpoon only, and the amuse- 
ment of angling for them is unknown. I had always suppos- 
ed that salmon returned to the sea after spawning, but I find 
this is not the case. They are taken in the Rhine all the 
year, and in December the flesh is quite white and very soft 
and insipid. Those which I have tasted at Berne and Basle 
are very poor at present, and they are growing worse daily. 

' While we are at dinner, a woman comes in to sell a curi- 
ous kind of stockings. They are lined with a silky fleece of 
some animal, and must be very warm. She asks a guinea a 
pair for them, and tells us that the Duke of Wurtemberg paid 
her two guineas a pairs. M. Huber, who talks German well, 
offers for me one guinea for two pair. She declares she can- 
not take it ; and, conversing of the value, she says that to an 
Earl or a Count they are worth three crowns, and therefore 
Englishmen ought to pay four. He being a Swiss, and 1 an 
American, we send her away with our offer, and presently af- 
ter she returns and accepts the one guinea for two pairs. So 
much for the candor and plain dealing of the Swiss. I think 
I have observed in this country, that the spirit of commerce 
has operated in the cities a depravation of morals, which 



GOUVERNECR MORRIS. 423 

nothing can cure but that same spirit carried still further. It 
teaches eventually fair dealing as the most profitable dealing. 
The first lesson of trade is, My son, get money. The second 
is, My son, get money honestly if you can, but get money. 
The third is, My son, get money ; but honestly, if you would 
get much money.' 

Departing from Switzerland, our traveller pursued his route 
through Germany, by way of Studgard, Wurtzburg, Cassel, 
Gottingen, and Hanover, to Hamburg, where he arrived in 
December. At this place, or rather at Altona, near Ham- 
burg, he resided during the winter and the following spring. 
In May he made a tour through Holstein to the borders of the 
Baltic, visiting the cities of Kiel and Lubec, and the beautiful 
Lake of Ploen, the subsequent residence of Lafayette and his 
family, after their release from Olmutz, which Mr Morris de- 
scribes as affording one of the most enchanting prospects, that 
he had evsr beheld. 

Returned from this journey through Holstein, which had 
been merely a jaunt of pleasure for two weeks, he went over 
to London in June. 

' London, June %9th. This morning the Count de Moustier 
calls on me, and we have a long conversation. He is working 
to place himself as one of the new King of France's Ministers, 
if I can judge of his views by his conversation. He tells me, 
that the King will be well disposed to conciliate with all par- 
ties. I mention the Duke of Orleans, but he thinks that plan 
may encounter some difficulties. While he is here, Mr Bur- 
gess comes in. He gives me a rendezvous at Lord Grenville's, 
and descants on the rigbts of ci-devant Monsieur to be ac- 
knowledged as king of France ; whence I conclude, that the 
administration here lean to that idea. 

' Go thence to the Marquis de Spinola's. The conversation 
here, where our company consists of the Aristocrats of the 
first feather, turns on French affairs. They, at first, agree 
that union among the French is necessary. But, when they 
come to particulars, they fly off and are mad. Madame Spin- 



424 LIFE OF 

ola would send the Duke of Orleans to Siberia. An Abbe, a 
young man, talks much and loud, to show his esprit ; and, to 
hear thera^one would suppose that they were quite at their 
ease in a petit soupe de, Paris. Our little Abbe tells us, that 
the leaders, finding how strong is the disposition of the people 
towards monarchy, will place the Duke of Orleans on the 
throne, and that he, finding it impossible to gain the good 
opinion of the gentlemen of France, must at length accept. I 
ask him, if it be wise to place him in that predicament. He 
answers, whether wise or not, the King will not be able to pre- 
vent his followers from insulting him. There is, I fear, too 
much truth in this. His connexion with Montesquieu is men- 
tioned, as a sad blot in his escutcheon; yet Montesquiou, what- 
ever may be his heart, is certainly one of their best heads, and 
they have not too many people of understanding among them. 
Burgess spoke of them this morning with much contempt, and 
indeed their conduct is not calculated to inspire respect. 

* July %d. This morning at eleven, I wait by appointment 
on Lord Grenville, and stay till half past twelve. We have a 
Jong conversation on general politics, the line to be adopted by 
Great Britain in the present moment, and therein of acknowl- 
edging the French King. I mention the acquisition of Flan- 
ders by this country, and the advantages to be expected from 
it. His Lordship seems to be very attentive to this idea. I 
tell him rny opinion of Prussia, and the relations in which it 
stands to this country, in which he seems to agree. I state to 
him what I conceive as practicable, respecting Austria and 
Russia, in the present moment, and show him how far it would 
affect France, by pushing the King of Prussia to extremity. 
This also strikes him forcibly. I state the various advantages, 
which might result from acknowledging the French King ; 
the treaties which might be formed with him ; the difference 
between appearing as auxiliaries and invaders ; and further, 
the necessity of a moderate line of conduct on the part of the 
new King, so as to lessen, if not destroy, opposition to him, 
Touch on the means of keeping Spain steady. Observe to 



GOTIVERNEUR MORRIS. 425 

him, that Sardinia must ever be the ally of France, and the 
enemy of Austria. I notice the state of Italy, and the utter 
indifference to Great Britain, whether that country continue in 
its present political form, or put on any other. He wishes to 
know the state of France. I observe to him that half a dozen 
different people, going through that country, will each give a 
different account of it, and that he can in his cabinet form a 
better opinion on principles, which I explain, and then add 
correspondent information. I take up what might be the 
feelings of this country, on the step proposed, and cite the 
conduct of Queen Elizabeth as an authority, which they would 
be little inclined to question, whatever might be its intrinsic 
merit. 

' Having gone far into that affair, I then mention as a busi- 
ness I have no right to meddle in, but which, from its impor- 
tance, presses itself upon me, the taking of our ships, and the 
ill blood which might thereby be excited ; how useful it would 
be to give immediate relief, the very bad consequences of de- 
lay to the party interested, and its resulting effects on national 
feelings. He says, that he believes everything is done, which 
can be done, to give despatch. He then mentions a declara- 
tion by Mr Innis to the Governor of Kentucky, that the influ- 
ence of the British cabinet has been used to prevent our suc- 
cess in negotiation for the free use of the Mississippi, and how 
injurious this is, as they are really desirous we should have it. 
He apprehends that the American government are not so well 
disposed towards Great Britain, as he had been led to imagine. 
I say everything, which appears to me proper for removing 
that impression, and suggest a confidential application by the 
British Minister. He states the danger of publicity from the 
nature of our government, and its consequent effects. On 
which I suggest a verbal communication to the President. To 
this also he is disinclined, as not coinciding with their habits of 
business ; but wishes that I would write a private letter on the 
subject, which I promise. At coming away, he expresses the 

36* 



426 LIFE OF 

wish to see me again before I leave town, also that Mr Pitt 
wishes to see me. 

' Dine at Monsieur de Ciricello's, the Neapolitan Minister. 
The Duke d'Harcourt, who is here, speaks to me, first respect- 
ing the Duke of Orleans, and afterwards generally on French 
affairs. He has much the idea of re-establishing the Parlia- 
ments. 1 recommend, on the part of the new King, such gen- 
eral declarations as will bind him down to nothing, excepting 
a genera] oblivion of the past with very few exceptions. Try 
to convince him, that re-establishing the Parliaments will be, 
in the first instance, attended with much difficulty on the part 
of the people, and, in the second, will occasion much opposi- 
tion by them to his measures. 

' July llth. I call on the Count Woranzovv, and show him 
the draft of a Manifesto by the new King of France, which I 
gave to Lord Grenville last Wednesday, and which he has re- 
turned with his wish, that it may arrive in season.* The 
Count Woranzovv is well pleased with it, and thinks the Due 
d'Harcourt should give money to the person, who will carry it 
to the King. I tell him that is a matter to be settled among 
them. He gives me an account of the strange levity, and wild 
negotiations of the Count d'Artois, and the pitiful folly of a M. 
Serenne, to whom he gives his confidence. He fears that, 
when arrived at Vendee, he will surround himself by such 
petits-maitres, and disgust the chiefs, who have acquired the 
confidence of the people in that quarter, viz. Puisaye, Labour- 
donnaye, Charette, Stoflet, and wishes me to caution some of 
his entours. I tell him that would have no other effect, than 
to lead the person, to whom I might give such caution, into a 
communication of it to all those who are about the Prince, and 
by that means to produce the mischief we mean to avoid. 

'July 14th. Dine at Mr Pitt's. We sit down at six. 
Lords Grenville, Chatham, and another come later. The 



* See this Manifesto in the present work Vol. II. p. 529. 




GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 427 

rule is established for six precisely, which is right, I think. 
The wines are good and the conversation flippant. After 
dinner I have some further conversation with Lord Grenville, 
and mention par hazard Monsieur de B. my companion in a 
tour through the Holstein, his poverty among other things, and 
he says the means of joining the army shall be supplied. We 
agree that I shall give him, if still al Altona, a credit on my 
banker' for 100. He says he has taken the liberty to give 
Lord Macartney a copy of the Manifesto, which I had showed 
him, which I, of course, do not disapprove of. Indeed, I 
knew it before. I am to see Mr Pitt tomorrow. The mob 
broke his windows yesterday, and are rioting in Moorfields 
this evening. 

1 July 15th. This morning at ten I visit Mr Pitt. I tell 
him that, as I presume Lord Grenville has given him the 
purport of our conversation, it will be best that he should ask 
me questions. He does so, and I reply to them. Our inter- 
view is long, and he is much satisfied with it. I recommend 
earnestly sending some man with the Count d'Artois, to keep 
him from doing foolish things. Ask the parole of Piquet's sons, 
which he promises, and to pay them 50 a piece. He asks me 
my ideas respecting a future Constitution for France, which I 
avoid giving as much as possible. Some points, however, are 
examined.' 

Mr Morris passed the time from the middle of July, till near 
the end of November, in travelling through various parts of the 
Island of Great Britain. He first made a tour to the south, 
and thence to the north, going to Scotland by the way of 
Cambridge, Hull, York, Durham, and returning through Glas- 
gow, Carlisle, and Liverpool. It was his object to visit the 
most remarkable places, arid particularly the manufacturing 
towns, the economy and details of which he examined every- 
where with a close inspection, and frequently wrote out elab- 
orate descriptions of machinery, and the process of curious 
manufactures. It is to be feared, that the romantic, the pic- 
turesque in nature, and even the venerable memorials of an- 



428 LIFE OF 

tiquity in art, had not many charms for him. Rarely is he 
found in search of these objects, and little does he say of moul- 
dering towers, or ivy-crowned castles, or magnificent cathe- 
drals ; but in all the stirring scenes of life, where the agency 
of man is triumphing in its victories for the improvement of the 
social condition, you will see him busy, inquisitive, indefatiga- 
ble, and elated with enjoyment at the wonders he is perpet- 
ually discovering. His thoughts were equally turned to the 
agriculture of the country, and the comforts of the people. 

He went as far north as the Grampians, and passed a day 
or two there at the seat of the Duke of Athol, with which, as 
well as with the hospitality of its lord, he was much delighted. 
On his return, likewise, he visited the Duke of Argyle, and 
the Duke of Montrose, at their respective residences. He was 
pleased with Scotland, where everything convinced him, that 
the seeds of a progressive prosperity were deeply planted, and 
would have a vigorous and rapid growth. He loitered for a 
short time among the lakes and hills in the north of England, 
and spent a day and night with the Bishop of Landaff, at Col- 
garth Park, near Ambleside. The Bishop told him, among 
other things, that ' the day the Marquis of Rockingham kissed 
hands, on being appointed Minister, he showed him on the 
back of a letter certain conditions he had made with the King, 
and taken down with a pencil. The first was, that the inde- 
pendence of America should be acknowledged. The Mar- 
quis took that precaution, because on a former occasion the 
King had deceived him ; and his Majesty was so hurt by that 
precaution, that he never forgave the Marquis.' The Bishop 
moreover declared respecting himself, that he was a staunch op- 
position man, and a firm, decided whig. To which the trav- 
eller adds in his Diary, let this be as it will, ' he is certainly a 
good landlord and a man of genius.' 

From the .lakes Mr Morris moved slowly onward, stop- 
ping at such places as he thought demanded attention, and ar- 
rived in the Capital on the twenty-third of November. 

* London, November 25th, 1795. Dress and go to Lord

Grenville's office ; thence to Court. Lord Grenville arrives 
late. Am presented to the King, who takes me at first for an 
Englishman ; and, not recollecting me, says " You have been 
a good while in the country." We set him right, and Lord 
Grenville tells his Majesty, that I was not liked by the ruling 
powers in France. " I suppose Mr Morris is too much attach- 
ed to regular government." " Yes, Sir ; and if your Majesty 
would send thither your discontented subjects, it would do them 
much good." " Well, if you '11 contrive it for me, I '11 give my 
hearty consent." Lord Grenville adds, ' There are enough of 
them, Sir." " Oh, aye, quite enough." " I can give your Ma- 
jesty good news from the continent," says Lord Grenville, 
" General Clairfait is still following the French." " And I, Sir, 
can give you a piece of intelligence, which I am sure will be 
agreeable. I am informed from unquestionable authority, that 
all the lower orders of people in Holland are strongly attached 
to the Stadtholder." "Ah! that 's good," (with surprise.) 
" Sir, they have always been so." " Then it is only the aristo- 
cratic party which is against him." " Just so, Sir." " Pray, 
Mr Morris, what part of America are you from ?" " I am from 
near New York, Sir. I have a brother, who has the honor to 
be a Lieutenant General in your. Majesty's service." " Ah, 
what, you're a brother of General Morris ? Yes, I think I see 
a likeness. But you're much younger." " Yes, Sir." " Well, 
and how does your brother do ? He's at Plymouth, is'n't he?" 
" Yes, Sir." I afterwards see a petition presented to the King 
on his throne, from the University of Oxford. Then go home 
with Lord Gower to see Lady Sutherland. Thence to the 
House of Commons. Return again to Lord Gower's and 
dine, and thence again to the House, where Mr Fox delivers 
a very animated speech, in reply to a very cool and sensible 

discourse from Mr . Mr Pitt does not speak, in which 

I am disappointed. On a division, the ministerial party has a 
great majority ; and the affair is to be discussed again next 
Friday. Great acuteness on the part of Mr Fox. 

' December 3d. Go to Court. Count Woranzow tells me 



430 LIFE OP 

an instance of Lord Grenville's candor. It relates to the Man- 
ifesto prepared for the new King. The Count has sent a 
copy of it, and a history of it to his Court. He introduces me 
to the Count de Staremberg. Lord Grenville introduces me 
to the Duke of Portland, and tells me that Mountflorence 
shall have his passport. He presents me to the Queen, who 
is a well bred and sensible woman, I think. 

' Conversing with Lord Grenville about our treaty, I tell him 
that we must not covenant not to export the produce of the 
West India Islands, because our commerce will always give us 
an excess of those articles. That if I had to negotiate with 
him on the subject, I would almost venture to leave the settle- 
ment of the articles with him and the West India planters. 
That whatever may be the final state of the Islands, and who- 
ever may be the possessor, it must be his policy to convince 
us, that it is our interest he should continue in the possession. 
He says that his opinion coincides perfectly with mine, and 
that he treated on that ground. I then tell him, that, in my 
opinion, all difficulties might be removed, if, after designating 
the size of the vessels to be admitted, a further stipulation 
should be made of a maximum of export duty, the amount 
within that limit to be fixed by the King. His Majesty's Min- 
isters would then, by their instructions to the Governors, have 
it so fixed from time to time as to comport with the wants of 
the colony, and the interests of the British navigation, without 
any reference to the colonial Assemblies. He says that 
he thinks something may be made out of that idea. He says 
that Lord Bute informs him from Madrid, that Mr Pinckney 
is on his way back, having concluded a treaty of navigation, (in 
which he supposes the affair of the Mississippi to be settled,) 
and leaving the treaty of commerce for another year. I tell 
him, as I did the King, that their fears prevent them from 
treating ; whereas those very apprehensions should have in- 
duced them to treat. He agrees in this idea, and adds, that 
it is inconceivable how apprehensive they are. I tell him that 
Mr Pinckney has asked for his recall, and that I do not think 
it improbable Mr Adams may be appointed Minister here. 










GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 431 

'April 14th, 1796. This morning I go to the Queen's 
drawing room. They are in high spirits. The Count Star- 
emberg, who is overjoyed at the answer of the French Direc- 
tory, speaks of it to the Queen as being a piece of very good 
news. She prudently answers in German. Asks me after- 
wards, if 1 understand German, on which I tell her, that I 
think she was right in speaking that language upon that occa- 
sion. "I believe it was prudent." "Yes, Madam, much more 
so, than the speech to which you replied." The King, how- 
ever, is very open to Count Woranzovv, and also to me, who 
arrive while they are in the discussion. He afterwards talks 
on the subject of finance with much good sense, but in Eng- 
lish, so that Woranzow don't get his share of it.' 

Mr Morris remained in London till June, when he returned 
to the continent, and resumed his old lodgings at Altona. He 
was engaged in making preparations for a journey to Berlin, 
Dresden, and Vienna. His plan was to travel with his own 
horses, and as those he had purchased for the purpose in Eng 
land were young, restive, and not well broken to the harness, 
he was detained a few days in giving them proper lessons of 
discipline for their new task. This being accomplished, and 
all things else in readiness, he set off for Berlin. As he was 
approaching that city, on the day of his arrival, he held the 
following conversation. 

' July llth. This morning at a quarter after six, I leave 
Fehrbellin with post horses, in order to spare my own. My 
valet-de-chambre has taken it into his head, that he is a man of 
genius, and so, in order to show that genius, he is very elo- 
quent on every occasion in the very worst dialect of the Ger- 
man language. He is a very great patriot, as far as the abuse 
of Kings, nobles, and priests, may go ; and, with high preten- 
sions to superiority over his feliow servants, is disposed to con- 
sider himself on a level with his master. He says, that he 
despises Prussia and its government so much, that he never 
troubled himself to inquire about Berlin. However, as he sits 
next the postillion, this one tells him, that postillions are for- 



432 LIFE OF 

bidden to smoke through the forests. That the Jagers, if they 
see them do it, take away their pipes ; but yet the Jagers 
themselves smoke. He tells me this with much zeal and em- 
phasis, to prove the oppression of the government. What a 
barbarous law against the poor ! 

'I humbly represent to him, that the poor depend much for 
fuel on these forests, which may be quite consumed by the 
carelessness of a postillion ; that there is no great hardship in 
being deprived of the use of a pipe, while a man rides from 
one stage to another ; that it would be, perhaps, a useful regu- 
lation of police to prohibit smoking everywhere, except in the 
apartments of a house, because villages may be consumed by 
it; and remind him of our anxiety on shipboard, lest the smok- 
ers should set the hay on fire. He takes his departure from 
this point, by asserting that there is much more danger from 
the use of flambeaux behind noblemen's carriages. I then 
again humbly represent to him, that in the dark, rainy, or 
snowy nights of winter, numerous carriages, driving about in 
every direction, and through narrow streets without lights, 
might not only injure each other, but prove fatal to foot pas- 
sengers, wherefore it might be a useful regulation of police, to 
oblige those who use carriages to exhibit lights. On the 
whole, I desire him to inquire, whether a nobleman be not 
equally forbidden with all others to smoke in the forest. Af- 
ter some conversation with the postillion, he exults in the dis- 
covery that, though the law be general, yet the Jagers do not 
take away the noblemen's pipes. I take leave to suggest that, 
when a government makes just and equal laws, it cannot be 
blamed merely because some of those > to whom the execu- 
tion is entrusted, wink at the breach of them ; that we our- 
selves on entering the frontier found it convenient to encour- 
age the officers in their delinquency, by way of expediting our 
journey. Here again, filled with patriotic zeal, he complains, 
that the portmanteau of a foot passenger would have been ex- 
amined. 

' I do not find it worth while to continue the conversation 




GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 433 

farther, than to suggest, that the blame here, if any, falls on 
the officer, and not on the Prince ; besides, that one, who 
travels in a chariot and four, is not likely to smuggle. But 
the postillion makes the best commentary on the subject, by 
lighting his pipe, and as the smoke flies in the other's face, and 
incommodes him not a little, I simply observe, that the poor 
can elude the laws as well as the rich. The postillion smokes 
on with great fervor, till the patriot loses all patience, and 
would, I am persuaded, if armed at this instant with legisla- 
tive power, make it felony to smoke at all. I cannot help 
meditating again on this occasion, as on a thousand others, up- 
on the manner in which travels are written. A man has 
adopted some system of morality, or politics, or religion, either 
from habit or whim, and, in the plenitude of his own infalli- 
bility, goes on condemning the practices of every other per- 
son and nation, catches up single incidents, and converts them 
into general data, by way of supporting his hypothesis, and fix- 
ing on special inhibitions, without seeking the reason of the 
law, condemns the legislator for those things which merit ap- 
plause ; and there, where he shows himself a provident parent, 
the self-conceited satirist marks him as the object of detesta- 
tion.' 

He continued in Berlin nearly a month, where he made the 
acquaintance of Prince Ferdinand, and associated chiefly in 
the diplomatic circles. The King and his principal Minister 
were absent at Pyrmont, but the Count de Haguenitz, another 
of the Ministers, treated him with much politeness during his 
stay. He had letters to William Humboldt, who introduced 
him to his friends in Berlin. The British Minister, Lord El- 
gin, was particularly civil. Among the French emigrants, he 
found some of his old Paris acquaintances. To the Baron 
d'Escar, who wanted to know if he thought anything could be 
done, to serve the wandering chief of the House of Bourbon, 
he replied, that ' in his opinion he had nothing to do but to try 
to get shot, thereby redeeming by valor the foregone follies of 
his conduct. Should he fall, this would rescue his memory 
VOL. i. 37 



434 

from reproach, and, if fate should direct away the shot aimed 
at his life, it might restore him to the good opinion of his na- 
tion ; that there was very little chance of his being called to 
the throne of his ancestors, but if any, it was only to be secured 
by such valorous conduct, as might command the respect of 
the French.' The politics of Europe were the constant topics 
of Mr Morris's conversation in Berlin, as they had been in 
Paris and London. He talked in his usual free manner with 
the Ambassadors of different powers, -apparently displeasing 
some, and impressing others with a high sense of the boldness, 
originality, and strength of his views. 

' July 23d. I dine very much against my will with Prince 
Ferdinand. I was engaged to a very agreeable party, but it 
seems the Highnesses must never be denied, unless it be from 
indisposition. I had, however, written a note declining the 
intended honor, but the messenger upon looking at it, for it 
was a letter patent like the invitation, said he could not deliver 
it ; that nobody ever refused ; all which I was informed of af- 
ter he was gone. On consulting, I found that I must go or 
give mortal offence, which last I have no inclination to do ; so 
I write another note, and send out to hunt up the messenger. 
While I am abroad this untoward incident is arranged, and of 
course I am at Bellevue. This Prince resembles the picture 
of his brother, the late King, but has by no means the same 
expression of countenance. The Princess is tolerably well 
looking, now that she is- made up, and the children are rather 
handsome than otherwise. In the afternoon the Ministers of 
Spain and Portugal, with the Marquise de Nadaillac and Baron 
d'Escar, go to the garden at Charlottenburg, which they are 
so kind as to show me, and afterwards we take tea with Mrs 
Brown, wife of the King's physician, an English family. Here 
I see the Princess Auguste, youngest daughter of his Prussian 
Majesty, who seems desirous to please.' 

Having staid nearly four weeks in Berlin, he departed for 
Dresden. On his first arrival he was met with a sight, which 
wrought upon his moral sensibilities. 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 435 

1 Dresden, August 19th. In the streets are many French em- 
igrants, who are travelling eastward to avoid their countrymen. 
They are allowed to stay only three days. Unhappy people ! 
Yet they employ themselves in seeing everything curious, 
which they can get at ; are serene, and even gay. So great a 
calamity could never light on shoulders, which could bear it 
so well. But, alas ! the weight is not diminished by the graceful 
manner of supporting it. The sense however is less, by all that 
spleen and ill humor could add to torment the afflicted. Doubt- 
less, there are many among them, who have a consciousness of 
rectitude to support them. This ground of hope in the kind- 
ness of that Being, who is to all his creatures an indulgent fa- 
ther, with the cheerfulness of temper, which nature has given to 
some of her favored children, may make their hearts beat lightly 
in their bosoms, while those of their more fortunate oppressors 
shall sink and sicken. For surely the oppressor can never be 
happy. I flatter myself with the belief, that a great majority of 
those in France would rejoice at an opportunity to call home 
their brethren, wandering in proscribed wretchedness through 
a world, which is to them almost a wilderness. But the day 
is yet, perhaps, at a distance. Oh God ! it is thy wisdom 
which hath ordained, and thy hand which heavily hath inflict- 
ed this blow, consistent most surely with those just decrees, 
which we may not presumejo measure, nor even dare to know, 
but yet we know, for we feel, that thy mercy will season to 
those, who suffer them, the sharpness of these afflictions. Yes, 
we feel ! and it is this consciousness, which, previous and par- 
amount to all reasoning, has diffused through the whole human 
race, and impressed on the heart of each individual, the same 
conviction of his own existence, and the existence of God. 
Yes, we feel ! and it is in the strict accordance between our finest 
feelings, and the principles of the religion we profess, that this 
stands demonstrated by their evidence to be of divine origin.' 

Here he first saw the Dutchess of Cumberland, and the 
Prince and Princesse de la Tour et Taxis, with all of 



436 LIFE or 

whom he kept up a correspondence for several years after- 
wards. The city of Dresden, its environs, its galleries of 
paintings, statuary, and other curiosities, drew from him 
stronger tokens of admiration, than he had before exhibited for 
similar objects in other places. He went to Court on one oc- 
casion an hour too late. Our readers will remember that in 
Paris he once went a day too early, and was reminded of his 
blunder by Marie Antoinette. 

' August 28th. Go to Court this morning an hour later 
than I ought to ^have done, owing to a mistake of my valet- 
de-chambre, who, with every pretension to genius, and the 
like, has the misfortune to be a little stupid, and, though he 
boasts of a knowledge of three tongues, seems to understand 
neither. The Fourrier had announced the drawing-room for 
halb zwoelf, which, being translated from the German, is half 
past eleven, but he rendered it Anglice, half after twelve.' 

After remaining ten or twelve days in Dresden, he pursued 
his journey, and arrived at Vienna about the middle of Sep- 
tember. The English Ambassador, Sir Morton Eden, was 
among his first acquaintances in the Austrian capital, though 
he paid his respects on the day of his arrival to M. Thugut, 
the Emperor's Prime Minister, and to some of the Ministers 
of foreign powers, to whom he had letters. He seemed here, as 
in Berlin, to fraternize with the Corps Diplomatique, and was 
soon on terms of social intimacy with several of the diploma- 
tists and their families, which brought him of course into the 
rounds of the first society in Vienna. 

' Vienna, September 24?A. This morning Sir Morton Eden 
calls, and we go to Court. He presents me to -the Emperor, 
who is ready in conversation. He is in very good spirits, 
having received favorable advices from the Rhine. The 
Archduke has driven the French back beyond the Lahn, and 
relieved the fortress of Ehrenbreitstein. A body of imperial 
troops is already up as high as Rastadt, in the view of cutting 
off the supplies of Moreau, who is still at Neuburg. The 
Emperor gives us his news, and expresses at the same time his 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 437 

hope, that Moreau will not be able to effect his retreat. In- 
deed this hope amounts almost to expectation. He tells me, 
that in a month's time my way will be open into Switzerland, 
but observes that it will then be cold travelling. 

' October 26th. This morning Sir Morton Eden calls, and 
presents me to the Empress, who speaks a little to Colonel 
Hope, my co-presented, a few words to me, and has a long con- 
versation with Sir Morton, who leans quietly against the wall. 
She seems to be a good sort of little woman ; but, in the 
course of her conversation, she shows about the eyebrow 
something which bespeaks high spirit. She has the Austrian 
countenance a little. 

' Return home and write for the post. After dinner, I visit 
Madame Audenarde, who asks me, if it be true that I am 
charged here with a mission from Congress to ask the liberty 
of Lafayette. I laugh at this a little, and then, assuring her 
that there is no truth in that suggestion, say that it is a piece 
of folly to keep him prisoner. This brings her out violently 
against him, and to the same effect the Count Dietrichstein, 
who indeed is as much prompted to defend the Austrian ad- 
ministration, as to side with his friend. We examine the mat- 
ter as coolly as their prejudices will admit ; and, on the point 
of right, he takes the only tenable ground, viz. that the public 
safety being the supreme law of Princes, the Emperor, con- 
ceiving it dangerous to leave Lafayette and his associates at 
large, had arrested them, and keeps them still prisoners for 
the same reason. Lavaupalliere, who comes in during the 
conversation, shows still more ill will to this unfortunate man, 
than any one else. He seems to flatter himself, that there is 
yet some chance of getting him hanged. He treats him not 
only as having been deficient in abilities, but as having been 
most ungrateful to the King and Queen ; from which last 
charge I defend him, in order to see what may be the amount 
of the inculpation ; and it resolves itself into two favors re- 
ceived from the Court. Firstj pardon for having gone to 
America, notwithstanding an order -given him to the contrary;

and, next, promotion to the rank of Marechal de Camp over 
the heads of several who were, many of them, men of family. 
To crown all, he accuses him of the want of courage, and de- 
clares that he has seen him contumeliously treated without re- 
senting it. To this 1 give as peremptory a negative, as good 
breeding will permit, aud he feels it. 

' Indeed the conversation of these gentlemen, who have the 
virtue and good fortune of their grandfathers to recommend 
them, leads me almost to forget the crimes of the French Rev- 
olution ; and often the unforgiving temper and sanguinary 
wishes, which they exhibit, make me almost believe, that the 
assertion of their enemies is true, viz. that it is the success 
alone, which has determined on whose side should be the 
crimes and on whose the misery. 

' December 1th. Madame Razomousky entertains us much 
by the histoires naives, which she gives of herself in her pre- 
sentation here as Ambassadress, and her reception at Moscow 
by her father-in-law. She is a fine lively woman, with a con- 
siderable share of genius, and most playful imagination. She 
admires much the Empress of Russia, not merely as a great 
sovereign, but as a pleasant woman, and tells among other 
things a story of a sleighing party, in which her coachman 
overset her, and excused himself, by saying that he had tried 
for an hour to overturn the sleigh of a page without effect, and 
could not have succeeded, if he had not seized that opportu- 
nity, in doing which he had unluckily gone farther. than he in- 
tended. She smiled, and begged him in future to play such 
tricks when there was nobody in the carriage. This woman 
is, however, accused, and I believe .justly, of many acts of a 
most serious complexion. But such is human nature.'

CONSUL AT HAMBURG, IN PRESENCE OF MR MORRIS. 

WHILE at Vienna, Mr Morris made it a special object of his 
efforts to procure the liberation of Lafayette, then at Olmutz. 
He was prompted to this by many motives, though he confess- 
ed at the outset, that he had a slender hope of success. He 
could act under no other authority, than the influence of his 
own character ; and he knew the little weight this must have 
in a case, which had become so notorious as that of Lafayette, 
and in which his oppressors had taken their stand before the 
whole world, on the sole and avowed ground of their sovereign 
will. To such judges it was idle to speak of justice or 
clemency, reason or truth. Of this he was convinced, yet the 
deep interest he took in the misfortunes of the prisoner and 
his family, not more on his own account, than on that of his 
country, and of the friends of liberty and humanity everywhere, 
induced him to make the attempt, which, should it prove abor- 
tive, could in no event do any harm. He received two letters 
from Madame de Stae'l on" this subject, after his arrival in Vi- 
enna well suited to kindle enthusiasm in the coldest bosom. 






440 LIFE OF 



MADAME DE STAEL TO MR MORRIS. 

' Copet, September 21 tt. 179C. 

'Sir, 

'I have no right to take this step in addressing you. I es- 
teem you most highly, but who would not esteem you ? I 
admire your talents, for I have listened to you, and in- this I 
am not singular. But what I have to ask of you is so much 
in accordance with your own feelings, that my letter will only 
repeat to you their dictates in poorer expressions. You are 
travelling through Germany, and whether on a public mis- 
. sion or not, you have influence ; for ihey are not so stu- 
pid, as not to consult a man like you. Open the prison door 
of M. de Lafayette. You have already saved his wife from 
death ; deliver the whole family. Pay the debt of your 
country. What greater service can any one render to his 
native land, than to discharge her obligations of gratitude ? 
Is there any severer calamity, than that which has befallen 
Lafayette ? Does any more glaring injustice attract the at- 
tention of Europe ? I speak to you of glory, yet I know a 
more elevated sentiment is the motive of your conduct. 

' The unhappy wife of M. de Lafayette has sent a message, 
in which she begs her friends to apply to him, who has already 
been her preserver. I had no difficulty in recognising you, 
under this veil. In this period of terror, there are a thousand 
virtues, by which they, who fear to pronounce your name, 
may distinguish you. For myself, who am more afflicted, I 
believe, than any one, by the fate of M. de Lafayette, I shall 
not have the presumption to imagine, that my solicitations can 
influence you in his favor. But you cannot prevent me from 
admiring you, nor from feeling as grateful to you, as if you had 
granted to myself alone that, which humanity, your own glory, 

and both worlds expect of you. 

' NECKER DE STAEL.' 

This letter Mr Morris answered, without giving any en- 
couragement to his fair and gifted correspondent, that her 



GOUVERNEUR' MORRIS. 441 

benevolent wishes could be realised. He lamented the mis- 
fortune of their common friend, but feared there was no im- 
mediate remedy at hand. What had already been done he 
believed was impolitic, and more injurious than beneficial to 
Lafayette. ' A commencement was made,' said he, ' by com- 
plaints of injustice, and a conclusion, by demands of repara- 
tion. Now you know, that men do not easily allow they 
have done wrong. Hence, they first defended themselves 
against the charge, and then, by means of disputing, both par- 
ties are angry. At last self-love takes part in the matter, 
so that the most urgent solicitations would perhaps be fruitless; 
for it would be difficult to comply with them, without admit- 
ting the injustice in question, since the circumstances have not 
changed, so as to offer either a reason or pretext for a change 
of conduct. But, persuaded as I am of the unhappy conse- 
quence of the detention of M. de Lafayette, I would use eve- 
ry exertion to break his chains, if I had it in my power.' 
Madame de Stael replied to this by a second letter. 

MADAME DE STAEL TO MR MORRIS. 

' Copet, November 2d, 1796. 
'Sir, 

' The place where your letter was written, is enough to give 
me some hope. It is impossible you should be there without 
succeeding. Such glory is reserved for you, and there is none 
more delightful, or more brilliant, for you, or for any man. 
It is possible the opposition may have been indiscreet. But 
could the unfortunate man, of whom they spoke, have solicited 
it of them ? It appears certain, that his wife was kindly re- 
ceived by the Emperor; that he permitted her to write to him, 
and that he has never received her letters. Humane and just, 
as we are assured he is, would he have suffered the wife and 
children to be treated in the same manner ? The wife and 
children ! What a reward for such a noble self devotion ! It 
is as cruel, as the condition from which you once before saved 
her. What do they expect ? Do they wish that the earliest 



442 LIFE OF 

enemies of the unhappy man should be roused to claim, that a 
period should be put to his misfortunes ? That they should imi- 
tate the demand of the Romans from the Carthagenians ? It 
seems to me, if you were to speak for a single hour to those, 
on whom his fate depends, all would be well. I have such 
experience of your influence over opinions, which were even 
opposed to your own, that I am tempted to ask, what effect 
would you not produce, were you to lend your intelligence and 
talent to second the persuasions of interest ? Should you ask 
this, as the reward of your counsels, could it be refused ? 

, ' In short, the idea that this calamity may be terminated, 
that it may be terminated by your exertions, this idea excites 
in me so much emotion, that, without disguising to myself the 
indiscretion of a second letter, I could not deny myself the 
expression of this belief, which arises as much from admira- 
tion of you, as from pity for him. 

' NECKER DE STAEL.' 

Not long after this letter came to hand, Mr Morris received 
the following letter from Madame de Montagu, the sister of 
Madame de Lafayette. 

' Ploen, Holsteln, November 27th, 1796. 
'Sir, 

' My sister is in danger of losing the life you saved in the 
prisons of Paris. Her tenderness and duty have conducted 
her, with her daughters, to that 1 of Olmutz, where the utter 
privation of salubrious air has sensibly impaired the springs of 
life. Her husband, attacked by a disorder in the chest, will 
soon yield, perhaps, to the slow fever, which is consuming 
him ; and the tender children will see the authors of their be- 
ing, whom they came to serve and console, perish before their 
eyes. 

' Madame de Lafayette has solicited permission to go and 
pass a few days at Vienna, in order to consult a physician 
there. This was not only refused her, but she was positively 
assured, that if she left her husband's prison a moment, she 
could never return. The only alternative allowed her was to 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 443 

abandon him, or to partake all the hardships of his captivity. 
Her choice was not doubtful. She consented to breathe on- 
ly the infected air of the place where he is confined, and to 
give thanks for the privilege allowed her. 

' I have taken the liberty to address a letter to the Empe- 
ror, to denounce to him the cruelties, of which everything at- 
tests his ignorance, because, after having honored my sister 
with the kindest reception, he condescended to assure her, 
that her husband was well treated, while his keepers obstinate- 
. ly refused, for two years, to answer his questions respecting 
the existence of his wife and children. My remonstrance has 
remained unanswered. Has not he, whom Europe numbers 
among those citizens of whom North America ought to be 
most proud, has not he the right to make himself heard in fa- 
vor of a citizen of the United States, and of a wife, whose life 
belongs to him, since he has preserved it? Yes, without 
doubt, and it is in this confidence, that I solicit your aid 
with the Emperor and the Austrian Ministry, and that I come 
to you to seek the hope and comfort so necessary to the 
wretched. 

1 My gratitude is already yours by so many titles, that to feel 
assured of it, Sir, you need only see the signature of your 
most humble servant, 

MARCHIONESS DE MONTAGU.' 



At an Interview with the Baron de Thugut, December the 
18th, after conversing for some time on various political topics, 
Mr Morris introduced the affair of M. de Lafayette, of which 
he gives the following notice in his Diary. 

' After having said as much as was proper, and received his 
thanks for the communication, I take out a letter I had receiv- 
ed from Madame, la Marquise de Montagu, sister to Mad- 
ame de Lafayette. Monsieur de Thugut contradicts the ac- 
count of ill treatment, expresses the wish that they had never 
had anything to do with him, and assures me that Madame de 
Lafayette may leave the prison whenever she pleases, but that 



444 LIFE OF 

she must not be permitted to go backwards and forwards. I so- 
licit his release, but find that it is in vain. He says that prob- 
ably he will be discharged at the peace. To which I reply, 
that I never had any doubt of that, and had taken upon me 
long ago to give such assurances, but that I wish it were done 
sooner; and add, that I am sure it would have a good effect in 
England, giving my reasons. He says that, if England will 
ask for him, they will be very glad to get rid of him in that 
way, and that they may, if they please, turn him loose in Lon- 
don.' 

The next day Mr Morris wrote a letter to Madame de La- 
fayette, which he entrusted to the care of the Baron de Thugut. 

' Vienna, December 19th, 1796. 
' Madam, 

' If this letter ever reaches you, I shall be obliged for the 
favor to his Excellency, the Baron de Thugut, and J shall ex- 
pect from his kindness to have your answer forwarded to me. 
The Marchioness de Montagu informed me, by a letter dated 
November twenty-seventh, that you had been forbidden to 
leave the prison, unless you would entirely abandon the inten- 
tion of returning thither, and that, under this alternative, pre- 
ferring the duty of a tender and faithful wife to the care of 
your own safety, you have given that decision, which those 
who knew the purity of your mind would naturally expect 
from you. Madame de Montagu adds, that you are not permit- 
ted to come here for the purpose of consulting a physician, 
although the state of your health imperiously requires it. 

' It is certainly unnecessary for me, Madam, to express here 
the interest, which I take in your fate, and in that of your un- 
fortunate friend, and to tell you how happy I should be, could 
I procure for him his liberty. Reasons, which I do not know, 
and which I nevertheless feel bound to respect, prevent this. 
But we are far from believing here, that his prison has any other 
disagreeable things about it, than those which are unavoidably 
connected with confinement. T am assured, on the contrary, 



OOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 445 

that he is very well lodged, and in want of nothing ; that the 
vigilant exactness, with which he is guarded, arises only from 
the necessity of using all 'means to prevent his escape ; that, 
far from entertaining the barbarous idea of depriving you of the 
assistance of art, the physician of your choice will be sent to 
you ; and that, if you are forbidden to come to Vienna, and 
then return to Olmutz, it is because circumstances require, that 
the rules of an exact prudence should be followed. 

'You must not despair, Madam; time will give liberty to 
Monsieur de Lafayette ; but, in the mean time, if he has been 
ill treated, as Madame de Montagu lias been induced to be- 
lieve, it is important that it may be known, in order that means 
may be taken to prevent it ; and in case he experiences, in ac- 
cordance with the benevolent intentions of his Majesty, gentle 
and humane treatment, it seems to me equally proper to as- 
certain it, in order to put a stop to odious reports, which can- 
not but exasperate, and which consequently might postpone 
the moment of his liberation. To this effect, have the good- 
ness, Madam, I entreat you, to send me your answer open, 
under cover to his Excellency, the Baron de Thugut. I am 
still uncertain whether I shall be able to receive it at Vienna, 
as it is my intention to depart in a few days. But I flatter 
myself, that we shall meet again in America ; and I pray you 
to believe, that I shall always and everywhere preserve the sin- 
cere attachment, with which I have the honor to be, &c. 

'GoUVERNEUR MORRIS.' 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS TO THE BARON DE THUGUT. 

' Vienna, December 31st, 1796. 
'Sir, 

'I have the honor to send you herewith a letter for Madame 
de Lafayette, requesting you in the first place to pardon me 
this liberty, then to examine the letter, and finally to have the 
goodness to transmit it to her. Your good sense will easily 
perceive the reasons, which have induced me to write to her, 
and will know how to appreciate them. It would, however, 
VOL. i. 38 



446 LIFE or 

be a most praiseworthy action on your part to suppress the 
letter, and to send me, in place of any answer to it, an order 
for the release of the unfortunate individual in question. In 
that case, I promise you not only the good news, which is ex- 
pected from the Rhine, but also that which perhaps is not ex- 
pected from Italy ; which, like the favor I venture to solicit, 
will not be the less agreeable, for having been unexpected. 
You will probably smile at my absurd pretensions to the char- 
acter of a prophet ; but only promise me, that the passports of 
Lafayette shall be prepared three days after you shall have 
heard of the defeat of Bonaparte, and we shall then see what 
will happen. 

' But for the rest, whatever may happen, I return to my first 
subject, and take the liberty of observing to you once more, 
that the sooner he is liberated the better, if, as I suppose, that 
is finally to be done. And since no one has had any right to 
know why his Majesty, the Emperor, determined to detain him 
as a prisoner, so no one can assume that of demanding why 
his kindness has set him at liberty. The maxim, stat pro ra- 
tione voluntcts, may be applied to acts of mercy, as well as to 
those of authority ; and, generally, if not with the same splen- 
dor, at least with the same dignity. Think, also, that forgive- 
ness granted to others is the only unobjectionable title, of 
which we can avail ourselves before the King of kings. And 
may we be at last permitted to hope that the year, which will 
soon commence, may be crowned in its cradle by the hand of 
clemency, and in its course by that of glory. I have the hon- 
or to be, &c. 

* GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.' 

He communicated, likewise, to Lord Grenville the result of 
his interview with the Baron de Thugut, and particularly what 
the Baron said, as to the readiness with which Lafayette, if so- 
licited, should be given up to the English government. He 
pointed out reasons to Lord Grenville, why it would be good 
policy for the Ministry to take this hint, and procure the liber- 
ation of the prisoner of Olmutz. 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 447 

But all these attempts proved ineffectual, according to his 
anticipations. As events turned out, indeed, it is probable they 
were immediately disserviceable to the prisoners. No answer 
was ever received from Madame de Lafayette to the letter, put 
into the hands of M. de Thugut for her, nor is it at all likely that 
it ever found its way out of his cabinet. What is more, the 
correspondence of Madame de Lafayette, with her sister and 
aunt, was fiom that moment cut off. They had been in the 
habit of writing once a fortnight, but on the twelfth of April, 
the last letter they had received was dated the twenty-second 
of December, a space of nearly four months. Observe, that 
this date was four days later than the Baron de Thugut's inter- 
view with Mr Morris, after which an order was unquestionably 
given to detain all letters. The reason for this may easily be 
found in the tenor of Madame de Montagu's letter to Mr Mor- 
ris, which he showed to the Minister, and which contradicted all 
the declarations of the Court, respecting the treatment of the 
prisoners. Yet the picture there drawn was taken from Madame 
de Lafayette's own descriptions, written under the eye of the 
commandant himself, who surely would not have allowed her to 
make false or exaggerated statements, so much to his own 
disadvantage, and to that of his employers. It was the last re- 
sort of despotism, to hide its hypocrisy and smother the voice 
of indignant complaint, by closing the channels of knowledge, 
as it had entombed the living bodies of the sufferers ; a pitiful 
refinement of cruelty, to take away the only consolation that 
remained, and this under the slow torture of suspense and ap- 
prehension, lest some calamity might have stopped the pen, 
through which sympathy and affection were accustomed to 
speak. 

1 December 19th. Mr Bacon, who is just arrived from 
London, says that the nation is still in good spirits, and fears 
little from the Spanish war. Monsieur St Priest tells me his 
news from Petersburg. The Emperor took his son to the 
apartment where Kosciuszko lay ill. He told the prisoner, 
that he saw in him a man of honor, who had done his duty, 



448 LIFE or 

and from whom he asked no other security than his word, that 
he would never act against him. Kosciuszko attempted to rise, 
but the Emperor forbade him, sat half an hour and conversed 
with him, and told his son to esteem the unhappy prisoner, 
who was immediately released, the guard being taken away. 
At the same time, expresses were sent off into Siberia, and 
twelve thousand Poles, confined there, received passports and 
money to bring them home. This story is afterwards told to 
me by Monsieur Lanskorenski, a Pole, who can scarcely re- 
strain his tears as he relates it. They are all of them in ec- 
stacy, and that single trait does more, in my opinion, towards 
securing the Russian part of Poland, than an army of twenty 
thousand men. But yet the character of the Poles is not such, 
as may securely be trusted. 

' December 20th. This morning I go to Court, for the pur- 
pose of paying my respects to the Princess of France, and in 
the hope that an opportunity would offer of saying a word on 
business which concerns her ; but find that she has a large 
circle. I am led, therefore, to mention the object concisely to 
the Bishop of Nancy, who undertakes to open the affair to the 
Grandes Maitresses, through whom it must pass to her Royal 
Highness. Dine at Monsieur de Staremberg's, and go from 
thence to visit the Archdutchess. While here, the Prince 
de Ligne produces some notes he has written on the Empress 
of Russia, desiring me to read them. We retire with the 
Prince de Saxe Teschen to an adjoining room, and look over 
them. On the whole, well written, and containing good anec- 
dote, but smelling rather too strong of the writer. His High- 
ness remarks to me, that a great part of it is calculated rather 
to display the intimacy of the Prince de Ligne, than the 
traits of Elizabeth.' 

The Princess of France, above mentioned, was the daugh- 
ter of Louis the Sixteenth, and Mr Morris wished to converse 
with her respecting the money, entrusted to him by her father, 
of which an account has already been given, in narrating the 
plan of M. de Monciel for removing the King from Paris. 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 449 

' December 22rf. The Baron de Groshlaer comes in. He 
tells me that my arrival here occasioned much inquiry. Peo- 
ple attributed to me different objects, and finding none suffi- 
ciently plausible, at last set my journey down to the account 
of Monsieur de Lafayette. 1 understand that all this arises 
from the Baron's curiosity, as much as anything else. I tell 
him exactly what has passed respecting Monsieur de Lafayette 
between M. de Thugut and me, also read my letters. Final- 
ly, tell him, that the only difference between me and the 
young Englishmen, of whom there is a swarm here, is, that I 
seek instruction with grny hairs, and they with brown. 

'December 25th. At the Archdutchess's one of the little 
Princes, brother to the Emperor, and who is truly an arch 
Duke, asks me to explain to him the different uniforms worn 
by the young English, of whom there is a great number here, 
all in regimentals. Some of these belong to no corps at all, and 
the others to yeomanry, fencibles, and the like, all of which pur- 
port to be raised for the defence of their country, in case she 
should be invaded ; but now, when the invasion seems most 
imminent, they are abroad, and cannot be made to feel the 
ridiculous indecency of appearing in regimentals. Sir M. 
Eden and others have given them the broadest hints without 
the least effect. One of them told me, that all the world 
should not laugh him out of his regimentals. I bowed and told 
him, that the. greatest monarch in Europe was not strong 
enough to brave public opinion. I see him, however, this 
afternoon in his uniform. I tell the Prince, that I really am 
not able to answer his question, but that, in general, these 
dresses are I believe worn for convenience in travelling. He 
smiles at this, and asks what can be the meaning of a blue 
coat worn by Lord Cowper, with gold lace, and a red cape. 
That, says he laughing, is I suppose a Court uniform. If I 
were an Englishman, I should be hurt at these exhibitions, 
and as it is, I am sorry for it. I observe, however, on this oc- 
casion what has often struck me before. They cite, as in- 
controvertible authority in England, the general cpnduct of 
38* 



450 LIFE OF 

young men, from whence I am led to suppose that old men 
are in the habit of admitting the validity of such authority. 
And now I find that here they assume it as unquestionable, 
that the young men of England have a right to adjust the 
ceremonial of Vienna. The political relations of the two 
countries induce the good company here to treat them with 
politeness ; but nothing prevents their being laughed at, as I 
found the other evening at Madame de Groshlaer's, where 
the young women, as well as the girls, were very merry at 
the expense of these young men. 

' December 23th.- The Bishop of Nancy tells me, that the 
Princess of France has given no private audience to any one 
since her arrival, and found it proper to refuse it even to 
Count Fersen, who had been so long and intimately connect- 
ed with the Queen. Her Royal Highness prays, therefore, 
that 1 will send her a note in writing, and if afterwards a few 
words should be necessary, I can take leave of her, and then, 
without breaking in on the established rule, such short conver- 
sation can take place. I tell him, that 1 will write as much 
as rny time will admit, but as for an audience of leave, I con- 
sider that as improper, because I shall not take leave of the 
Imperial Family. But her Royal Highness may decide as she 
thinks proper. 

' January 1st, 1797. This morning' I dress immediately 
after breakfast, and go to Court. The levee is oddly arranged, 
all the males being in one apartment, through which the Em- 
peror passes in going to chapel, and returns the same way 
with the Empress and Imperial Family, after which they go 
through their own rooms to the ladies, assembled on the other 
side. The most brilliant thing here is the noble Hungarian 
guard, a body not numerous, of handsome, tall men on fine 
fiery steeds, magnificently caparisoned. The Captain of this 
guard, the Prince Esterhazy, who i^ but of medium size, or 
rather under it, is in a Hungarian dress of scarlet, with fur 
c?pe and cuffs, but the whole coat embroidered with pearls, as 
is also the cap, pantaloons, and boots of yellow morroco leather, 




GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 451 

four hundred and seventy large pearls, and many thousand of 
inferior size. Notwithstanding this profusion, it is done in 
good taste, and cost but one hundred guineas for the workman- 
ship. A collar of large diamonds, a very large solitaire in a 
ring, another in the head of his cane, a plume of diamonds, 
the hilt and scabbard of his sword set with diamonds, and even 
his spurs. In short, he and his horse, which is bejewelled also, 
though I did not see him, are estimated at a value of half a 
million of guilders, or about fifty thousand pounds sterling. 
His revenue, for he is the richest subject in Europe, amounts 
to from sixty to seventy thousand pounds, and has during the 
Turkish war gone up to a million of guilders. He lives in 
great magnificence, but without that useful part of it, hospital- 
ity. He has now above one hundred and fifty horses in Vien- 
na, but had run out considerably before he came to his estate, 
and his father had also been in debt. This last, in a six 
weeks' residence at Frankfort, where he was Ambassador dur- 
ing an imperial coronation, spent eighty thousand pounds. 
In short, the estate is now dipped to betwixt six and seven 
millions of guilders, so that it is in the hands of creditors, who 
pay him a net two hundred thousand for his expenses, with 
which income he runs annually deeper in debt. 

'Here is the history of the feudal system in its decline. 
Most of the great families here are doing, as I am told, the 
same foolish thing, and the government rejoices at the conse- 
quent humiliation of a haughty nobility, without considering 
that the power, which is to spring up in their stead, and which, 
being novel to the constitution, has of course no counterpoise 
provided, and is moreover increased by the impetus of pro- 
gressive force, must at length, if it do not overturn the throne, 
give it at least the severest shocks. But who cares for pos- 
terity ? If the Minister of the day can but live through his 
day, all is well with him ; and throughout human life, the pres- 
sure of the moment forces men out of all the line of prudence. 
" Vid&o meliora prologue, deteriora sequor" is a motto, which 
might be annexed to almost all escutcheons. 



452 LIFE or 

' Monsieur Mazenski, a Pole, and grandson to Augustus of 
Saxony, was at Court today with diamond epaulettes of very 
large stones< It is said that he has the finest diamonds of any 
subject in Europe. But a finer thing than his jewels, or those* 
of any other man, was the conduct of his servant, who, when 
his master was made prisoner during the late troubles in that 
miserable country, possessed himself of his valuables and 
whispered to him, " If you escape, you will find me at Leipsic." 
Mozenski was under the gallows, and saved himself by haran- 
guing the populace. At Leipsic he found the servant and the 
treasure.' 

Although Mr Morris made a protracted sojourn at Vienna, 
he speaks in no rapturous terms of the society there. He 
loved talking, and everybody in Vienna loved play, for which 
he had no relish. A dumb circle around a card-table he looked 
upon as the dullest company in the world, and usually escaped 
from it as soon as he could. Persons thus occupied are mute 
and deaf; they can neither talk nor listen; two sad obstacles, 
as he conceived, to all social pleasure. On one occasion, after 
leaving a small party, he notes it down as an extraordinary 
thing, that there had been ' some pleasant conversation.' The 
Austrian nobility he considered on the decline, and that the 
monarchy would one day suffer from the weakness and decay 
of this pillar of its support. 

At first he intended returning by the south of Germany and 
Switzerland, but the lateness of the season caused him to 
change his mind. He retraced his steps, passed a few days 
in Dresden and Leipsic, and at length arrived in the capital of 
Prussia. 

'Berlin, February 16th. Go to Court, where I am presented 
to their Majesties. The King is a well looking man. He in- 
quires about the health of General Washington, who (as de 
Moustier tells him) is in very ill health. I tell his Majesty, 
that I cannot believe it ; that when I left him he was a hale, ro- 
bust man ; as much so as the King now is, and, of course, I 
have no reason to suppose that he is now seriously indisposed. 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

This is calculated for the poor Monarch, who has an air tres 
epuise. 

1 February llth. I go to Court. The Queen points out to 
me a young Mademoiselle Riedesel, who was born in Ameri- 
ca, and christened America. She is a fine girl, and when she 
comes down the dance, 1 tell her in presence of her Majesty, 
that I reclaim my countrywoman. After some time the King 
speaks to me, and, when on the subject of America, I tell him, 
that if the French persist in their present conduct, and drive 
us to extremities, Spain will not retain an inch of ground in 
the new world. That his Majesty has a direct interest in such 
events, and a considerable one. But a ball room is not the fit- 
ting place to discuss such subjects. On the finances of Great 
Britain, I repeated, (as having already mentioned it to his 
Ministers) that the resources of that country are immense. 
Upon which he observes, that they were so much the more to 
blame for having attempted to tax us, and this it was which 
led to what I have already noted. After some trifling things, 
I tell him that I have just seen his best friend. He asks who? 
And, to his great surprise, I reply, the Emperor. He speaks 
of him well personally, and I observe that he is a very honest 
young man. To which his Majesty replies by asking, "Mais, 
que pensez vous de Thugut ?" " Quant a cela, c'est une autre 
affaire, Sire" I had stated the interest, which makes him and 
the Emperor good friends, to be their mutual apprehensions 
from Russia. " But suppose we all three unite ? " " Ce sera 
un Diable de fricassee, Sire, si vous vous mettez tons les trois a 
casser hs cevfs" On the subject of Austria, I tell him they 
would do very well, if he would lend them a few of his Gene- 
rals. " Mais nous en avons besoin pour nous memes." " Pas a 
present, Sire, vous etes en paix." He finds that, if this con- 
versation continues, he may commit himself, and so pauses. I 
retire a little, and his Majesty conducts the Princess Henri out 
of the ball room.' 

From Berlin to Hamburg, Mr Morris took the road through 
Brunswick, which he had designed as another resting place. 



454 LIVE OF 

' Brunsurick, March 19th. Igo to Court, where I dine, and 
pass the evening. The Duke and his family are tres prevenans. 
He desires a little conversation, which begins after dinner, but 
is interrupted by his mother, to whom he presents me, the sis- 
ter of old Fritz, and very like him. She has some eighty odd 
years, but is still lively, with a deal of fun about her. The 
Dutchess, who resembles the King her brother very much, is 
affable and pleasant. The Duke is, I think, a candidate for 
the character of the omnis homo. He speaks to me prefera- 
bly in English, but not being master of the language, or entan- 
gled by the matter, he hesitates very much. He makes pro- 
fessions, which he considers as very dubious, and says " You 
won't believe me, but it is very true." I tell him that the 
Prussian cabinet is afraid of him, and it is on that occasion, 
that he declares his unwillingness to manage the affairs of Prus- 
sia. To help him in his delivery, 1 observe that I conceive 
easily, why he, a Sovereign, should not wish to set the exam- 
ple of an imperious control over a Sovereign. This he assents 
to, but his objection is stronger, from the circumstance that a 
German Prince could not do many things, which would be 
suitable to an individual. I understand him to mean any dis- 
memberment of the Empire, and so explain myself to him, or 
rather himself to me. He assents and comes forward with 
another but. But the Dutchess Dowager arrives, and termi- 
nates our conversation, which is to be resumed this evening. 

'March 21 st. I dine with the Dutchess Dowager, who 
says she is very sorry her brother had not seen me. Her 
daughter gives me some late publications to read. I spend 
the evening there, and the Dutchess tells me, that the emigrants 
are much alarmed at my arrival here. I reply that this is to 
me unaccountable, unless they imagine that, recollecting their 
private characters in France, I should say something too much 
for them on that subject, but that they may make themselves 
easy, for it is possible I may never have heard anything, but I 
certainly have forgotten all which may affect the moral charac- 
ter of individuals belonging to a country, which was so gener- 



OOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 455 

ally corrupted. I see here the Prince GalHtzin, whom I had 
formerly known at Hamburg. I visited in the afternoon Mad- 
ame de Riedesel, who reminds me that we had met at Amster- 
dam.* 

' March Zbth. Dine with the Dutchess, who tells me that 
she is sure I don't like her that she likes me, but I don't like 
her. She thinks that I hate the King, her brother, and ex- 
tend that dislike lo the whole family. I assure her that she 
is mistaken, and that nothing is easier than for me, as an Ame- 
rican, to be attached to the Royal Family of England, but 
nothing more difficult, than for a person of that family to like 
one of my country. " Well then I have the more merit, for I 
like you." This conversation, which lasts during the dinner, 
and before a numerous society, would be very embarrassing 
to most men ; and I am afterwards complimented by several, 
for getting through it so well. She said, among other things, 
that she had persuaded herself to forget there was such a coun- 
try as America. On the whole, I am well pleased with her 
franchise, and tell her truly, that I am well pleased with her. 
Converse a little with the Duke confidentially, and give him 
some traits of Berlin, which he was unacquainted with. Men- 
tion the only means, which seem to me fit for bringing the 
Prussian Cabinet into his views. He tells me that it is now 



* The wife of General Riedesel, who commanded the Brunswick 
troops under Burgoyne, and surrendered with them at Saratoga. This 
lady's Memoirs of her life in America, during the war, which have 
been recently translated into English, by M. de Wallenstein, are in a 
high degree spirited and entertaining. Mr Morris makes the following 
entrance in his Diary at Amsterdam. 

' General Riedesel, who lodges in the same house, makes me a visit, 
and we converse about the compaign in which he was taken. He says, 
that Burgoyne was very reprehensible in not insisting, that the troops 
should return to Canada, because Gates would certainly have consent- 
ed ; and that, while the negotiation was pending, and substantially, but 
not formally concluded, Burgoyne proposed to break it off, upon re- 
ceiving the news of the burning of Esopus.' 



456 LIFE OF 

too late, in which sentiment I fully agree with him. I brought 
General Riedesel home with me to tea, and we went together 
to the Hereditary Princess's, where I pass the evening.' 

On the ninth of April, our traveller found himself at rest 
again in his old lodgings at Altona, after an absence of eight 
months and a half. His correspondence during this period, 
particularly with Lord Grenville, shows with what profound 
attention he examined the political state of the countries 
through which he passed, and the character and policy of the 
principal actors. They will also show, amidst some little exu- 
berance of fancy, a mind viewing human affairs on a large 
scale, and fixing what is usually called human greatness at its 
true standard. His speculations, like all other speculations, 
were sometimes visionary, and his predictions, like those of 
most prophets, did not always come to pass, yet his judgment 
of realities, his insight into the nature of events, and his esti- 
mate of the motives of men, were seldom erroneous. From 
the exhibition of his political tendencies in Paris, and from his 
thorough dislike, both in principle and practice, of the new 
systems of rule in France, it is no cause of surprise, that in 
Germany his feelings should be enlisted on the side of the 
allies, and that he should lament with them the successes of 
Bonaparte in Italy, and of Moreau on the Danube. He had 
three rare qualities, which never deserted him, independence 
in forming an opinion, boldness in avowing, and consistency in 
maintaining it. Not that he was obstinate, for he loved argu- 
ment, was accessible to reason, and never too proud to be 
convinced, but while his convictions lasted, they were the guide 
of his thoughts and his acts, proclaimed without fear, and 
obeyed as fixed laws. 

In a circle of friends at Hamburg and Altona, to whom he 
had become much attached, Mr Morris remained quietly till 
June, when he repeated his journey through Holstein, from 
which he had derived so much pleasure two years before. 
At Wittmold, near Ploe'n, he visited Madame de Tesse, and 
Madame de Montagu, and told them personally all he knew 



GODVERNEUR MORRIS. 457 

concerning the prisoners at Olmutz, and of all he had done to 
restore them to liberty. But the time was near at hand, when 
their wishes in this respect were to be consummated. 

The treaty of Leoben, preliminary to that of Campo For- 
raio, had paved the way for a peace, and it is understood to 
have been among the requisitions of Bonaparte, that Lafay- 
ette and the other prisoners at Olmutz should be released. 
They were accordingly liberated on the nineteenth of Septem- 
ber, and General Lafayette, at his own request, was delivered 
up to the American Consul at Hamburg. This ceremony 
took place on the fourth of October, in the presence of Mr 
Morris, who thus speaks of this ^affair in his Diary. 

' September 21th. Mr Parish and his son call on me this 
evening. He has adjusted with the Imperial Minister here 
how Lafayette is to be delivered over. The Minister com- 
municated M. de Thugut's letter, which says expressly that 
M. de Lafayette is not liberated at the instance of France, 
but merely to show the Emperor's consideration for the United 
States of America. * 

' October 4th. Dine with the Baron Buol de Schauen- 
stein, the Imperial Minister. It is not till after five, that Mr 
Parish sends word that M. de Lafayette and his companions 
are come, and then I take the Baron down to perform the 
ceremony of delivering them over. His expressions are ires 
mesures, and he goes through his part with dignity.' 

From these notes it was obviously Mr Morris's impression 
at the time, that Lafayette was restored to freedom by the 
Austrian government, out of regard to the United States, and 
not by reason of any interference of the French. In a letter 
to Judge Marshall, written after his return to America, he re- 
peats the same conviction, and adds, ' notwithstanding this, it 
appeared to me that M. de Lafayette chose to consider him- 
self as freed "by the influence of General Bonaparte, and I did 
not choose to contest the matter, because, believing my ap- 
plication had procured his liberty, it would have looked like 
claiming acknowledgments. Had I known of the Presi- 
VOL. i. 39 



458 LIFE OF 

dent's letter,* I should certainly have connected with it the 
manner in which he was delivered over, and drawn the na- 
tural inference.' To this it may be added, that, in an ac- 
count of the ceremony written by Mr Parish, and published at 
Philadelphia in the Port Folio, the letter of M. Thugut to M. 
Buol de Schauenstein is cited, as containing the same lan- 
guage as that recorded in Mr Morris's Diary. 

After all, we may probably take the following to be the 
true state of the case. The condition of the prisoners at Ol- 
mutz was discussed at Leoben. Bonaparte requested their 
release, which was readily granted, since M. Thugut had 
declared to Mr Morris, that they would naturally be given up 
at the peace. They must not be regarded, however, in the 
light of the prisoners of war, for these were not discharged 
till after the definitive treaty of Campo Formic, whereas La- 
fayette was released a month before the signature of that 
treaty. In this stage of the business, as it would require no 
sacrifice on the part of the Austrian government, there being 
no published stipulation with the French negotiator, it was con- 
venient for them to give it the air of a favor to the United 
States, and to make the most of it in that shape. Had it come 
a year, or even six months earlier, it would have borne strong- 
er marks of sincerity.! 



* General Washington's letter to the Emperor of Austria, soliciting 
the liberation of M. de Lafayette. 

f Sir Walter Scott says, in speaking of the liberation of Lafayette ; 
'Finally, on the nineteenth of December, 1795, this last remaining re- 
lic of Louis (the Princess Royal) was permitted to leave her prison and 
her country, in exchange for Lafayette and others, whom, on that 
condition, Austria delivered from captivity.' lAfe of Napoleon, Vol. 
II. Chap. 5. 

Here are 'two remarkable errors ; first, as to the time of liberation, 
it being stated a year and nine months too early ; and, secondly, as to 
the reason and mode of release.

CHAPTER XXIV. 

MR MORRIS COMMENCES ANOTHER TOUR TO THE SOUTH OF GERMANY. 

FHANCFORT, RATISBON, MUNICH. COUNT RUMFORD. MR MORRIS RE- 
TURNS TO ALTONA. DUKE OF ORLEANS. HIS CONCEALMENT IN SWIT- 
ZERLAND. LETTERS FROM THE COUNTESS DE FLAHAUT TO MR MORRIS 

CONCERNING HIM. THEY TRAVEL 'TOGETHER TO HAMBURG. THE 

DUKE'S TRAVELS IN NORWAY AND SWEDEN. HIS CORRESPONDENCE 

WITH MR MORRIS. HIS VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES. 

As soon as this ceremony was over, and he had finished the 
necessary preparations, Mr Morris commenced another tour 
into Germany. He went by the way of Hanover and Cassel 
to Francfort. Here he found the Dutchess of Cumberland, 
with whom he had become acquainted at Dresden, and who 
entertained him with much curious matter about the private 
histories of some of the Royal Families of Europe. From 
Francfort he proceeded to Ratisbon, where he met other old 
acquaintances, in the circle of the Princess de la Tour et Tax- 
is. The charms of this society retained him two or three weeks. 
At Munich he was received with marked kindness by his coun- 
tryman, Count Rumford, who was at that time enjoying the 
glory of his high reputation as a civil economist, and as having 
been successful in his great and humane projects for improv- 
ing the capital of Bavaria, and ameliorating the condition of 
the people. 

' Munich, December 3lst. I go to the Count Rumford's. as I 
had promised yesterday, and he tells me his situation here as to 
the confidence reposed in him by the Elector. He brought 
him into his views of reform by holding out, that history never 
fails to do justice to sovereigns, recording their acts of bene- 
ficence, and branding them for the neglect of their important 
duties. According to the Count, it is from the love of honest 



460 LIFE OF 

fame that the Elector has been stimulated to the amelioration 
and embellishment of his country, to which he had but little 
personal attachment ; and, being without heirs, and not too well 
disposed to his successor, could not from any regard to pos- 
terity be led into the labor and vexation of reform. He states 
to me how by degrees, since the commencement of the four- 
teenth century, the existing nobles, or rather ennobled, who are 
by no means descendants of the ancient nobility, all of whose 
privileges, with a single exception, have by purchase or escheat 
merged in the Ducal Crown, have arrogated, from the weak- 
ness of the chief, privileges and exemptions to which they are 
not entitled, and under the name of the States oppress and de- 
fraud the people, so that at length the abuses are become 
equally numerous and enormous, from whence has resulted 
the impoverishment and depopulation of this excellent country. 
Among the abuses, he mentions as one, that on his arrival here 
there was a regiment of cavalry, which had five field officers 
and only three horses. 

' The Elector's Ministers are so much sold to the States, 
that in his own private Chancery he could not get during six 
weeks a paper copied which he was to sign. The States, in 
the mean time, were informed of its contents and came for- 
ward with an impeachment against the Ministers, who had 
framed it, for high treason. The Elector, whom he describes 
as timid, being imformed that they were arrived in procession 
to present the address containing this impeachment, rode out 
by Rumford's advice a hunting to gain a day. Rumford im- 
mediately went into the Chancery, and threatened the Secre- 
tary, that if this paper were not copied and on the Elector's 
table ready for his signature by eight o'clock next morning, he 
should lose his place. The Secretary represented the impos- 
sibility, for it was not yet begun. Rumford ordered in the 
clerks, and caused it to be distributed among the number ne- 
cessary, and then reiterated his threat with the addition, that if 
it were not ready at eight he should be no more Secretary at 
nine. To the Elector's surprise this paper, which, addressed 




GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 461 

to the States, demonstrated the nullity of the claims they made, 
and pointed out their various and manifest usurpations, was 
ready at the hour, and was immediately signed and transmit- 
ted ; so that their impeachment (calculated to prevent the 
blow, seeing that the Elector could not sign and transmit the 
work of one accused as a traitor) lost its object. Next day, 
by Rumford's advice, the Elector, as Vicar of the Empire, 
ennobled the. Minister, who was of plebeian extraction, for his 
important services rendered to the pnblic. 

' January 4th, 1798. This morning I go to Court, and af- 
terwards dine at the Count de Gortz's, Minister of Saxony. 
Then go to see Count Rumford, who reads to me the result 
of some calculations he Jias been making this day. The Elec- 
tor confirmed what he had told me, respecting the expense of 
the English garden. From what a servant says to him in de- 
livering a message, I find that he has given orders to prepare 
for our reception in the work-house tomorrow. Monsieur de 
Wernick calls on me in the evening, and we read together 
part of a printed account made by Rumford of his four years' 
administration of the army. Notwithstanding this account, 
which is perfectly clear and correct, certified after full exam- 
ination by the Council to whom it was submitted for that pur- 
pose, his enemies circulate busily the whisper of mal-adrninis- 
tration. 

( January 5th. This morning, at half an hour after nine, 
Count Rumford calls and we go out together. We arrive at 
the work-house and see the kitchen, which is wonderful. In 
general, the regularity, cleanliness, and economy of this house 
surpass anything I ever saw. The poor, who are maintained 
here, are employed busily, and have cheerful countenances. 
These people earn their living, and they are happy. Long 
may he be happy, who has made them so. I taste the soup 
given to the poor. It is very good ; and I see the crowd sit 
down to eat it with good appetites. The portion of bread, he 
tells me, is generally taken home by them for their supper. 
There are about one thousand people fed here, at the annual 
39* 



LIFE <HT 



expense of about four hundred guineas, including everything. 
The contrivances to save cloth, linen, leather, &c. in making 
clothes, the arrangements to prevent fraud, and to keep the 
accounts for the regiments, are all admirable. We go from 
hence to a hospital for old poor people, from whence there is 
a fine view of the town. The chambers here are so warm 
that 1 cannot stand them. We then go round another part of 
the town, pass through a corner of the English garden, and 
come to the magazine and arsenal. We then go lo the can- 
non foundery, which is also a very fine establishment. The 
boring is performed as at Woolwich. He has invented can- 
non, which are directed by means of a screw at the breech, 
and which have lateral lines of direction. He tells me that 
on experiment it is found, that two bullets go much straighter 
than one, and the reason he gives for it seems good, namely, 
that the hinder one pressing forward wedges the other a little, 
so that neither can rebound from side to side with a zigzag in 
the bore, the effect of which must be to throw it out of the 
line of direction, and this must be the case with a single ball, 
as it cannot exactly fit the bore. 

'January 6th. Dress and go to Court, where I dine. 
Mention to the Elector, who converses with me on my yester- 
day's excursion, that his Highness ought to have consigned to 
some record the state in which he found this country, lest pos- 
terity should, on seeing the improvements, doubt the situa- 
tion in which he found it. This is like flattery, but, in the 
first place, it is founded in fact. Secondly, it is no small in- 
stance of benevolence, to have labored for the amelioration of 
a country, for a successor whom he dislikes. Neither of these, 
however, though they justify, would have iuduced this obser- 
vation. I meant to encourage him in the pursuit of laudable 
objects , and, if anything I can say should have a tendency to 
produce that effect, it is well said. At dinner I sit next to the 
Electress, who has a clear, ready comprehension, and a good 
share of genius. She is not happy, and is well content that 
her dissatisfaction should be known. After dinner, the Elec- 



GOUVEHNEUR MORRIS. 

'tor inquires about Lafayette, and I set his character in what I 
think the fair light. 

' Go from Court to see Count Rumford, and sit with him a 
good while. He reads to me his day's labor, in which he has 
reasoned himself into a belief that the life is, as Moses says, in 
the blood, and that it consists, which Moses does not say, in the 
operation of heat and cold, and in the movement, which, as a 
fluid, must be produced in it by the distribution and succession 
of those accidents. My solution of all such abstruse questions 
is, that things are so or so, because God pleases that they 
shall be so.' 

The remainder of the winter and spring Mr Morris passed 
at Ratisbon, Studgard, and Francfort, but chiefly in this last 
city. Here he was joined by his friend, M. Leray de Chau- 
mont, with whom he returned to Altona in June. 

This tour to the south of Germany, which had occupied nine 
months, seems to have been undertaken from the combined 
motives of business, instruction, and pleasure. As usual, he 
mingled much with society, and was everywhere alive to the 
scenes around him, and eager in the pursuit of his favorite 
study of men, as their passions are developed, and characters 
moulded, by the varied forms of social and political existence. 
In politics, as in everything else, he preferred experiment to 
theory ; and the knowledge obtained by observation, though 
bought with trouble and sacrifice, he considered worth its 
cost. He was now again stationary at Altona. 

The deep interest, which Mr Morris had taken in the con- 
dition of the Dutchess of Orleans and her family, during the 
first part of his residence in Paris, was not diminished as their 
misfortunes increased. The young Duke of Orleans, (the 
present King of the French,) driven by a decree of arrestation 
from his command in the army, and from his country, had tak- 
en refuge in Switzerland. Here he had been for several 
months concealed from the world, even from the knowledge 
of his own family, till circumstances induced him to change 
his place of residence, with the view of seeking an asylum in the 



464 LIFE OF 

United States. Among others, whom the horrors of the revo- 
lution had compelled to fly from their country, and who had 
sought a retreat in Switzerland, was the Countess de Flahaut, 
often noticed heretofore in the selections from Mr Morris's 
Diary, and one of his earliest friends in Paris. Her husband 
had died in the early stages of the revolution, and she had 
fled first to England, and then to Switzerland. In the lit- 
tle town of Bremgarten, near Zurich, she met the Duke of 
Orleans, and was the first to inform Mr Morris of his situation, 
in the following letter received by him at Hamburg. 

THE COUNTESS DE FLAHAUT TO MR MORRIS. 

' Breragarten, Switzerland, January 27th 1795. 

'Sir, 

' I have seen in Switzerland the young Duke of Orleans. 
He has had a serious quarrel with Madame de Sillery, from 
whom he has received very bad treatment. But say nothing 
of this, for if she knew he divulged it, she would persecute 
him even in his concealment. He is now entirely estranged 
from her and her principles, and has even taken his sister from 
her charge, and put her under the care of the Princess de 
Conti, his aunt. 

' Since he left the army his conduct in regard to his mother 
has been perfect. When he arrived with Dumouriez at the 
Austrian army, the Archduke and the Prince of Coburg pro- 
posed to him to enter into the service of the Emperor, retain- 
ing his rank and appointments of lieutenant general. He re- 
fused, although without money, and without knowing what 
would become of himself, telling them that he was unwilling 
to expose his mother and brothers, and that he could not serve 
against his country. He immediately departed, in company 
with an aid-de-camp, and travelled through Germany in a 
miserable little cabriolet. Being persecuted in Switzerland by 
the extreme partisans both of Aristocracy and of Jacobinism, 
he separated from his aid-de-camp, and, with a single ser- 
vant, who followed him from the time of his emigration, (the 



GOUVERNEUil MOHKIS. 465 

same who courageously gave his horse to Dumouriez) he 
wandered on foot among the mountains, spending no more 
than thirty sous a day for the food, lodging, and other necessa- 
ries required by them both. 

' At length, not having more than thirty francs in the world, 
he returned to M. de Montesquieu,* who afforded him relief, 
and found a place for him as a professor in a college, where 
he taught geometry in the German language, without its ever 
being known, either to the masters or scholars, who he was. 
So much was he beloved in this situation, that M, de Salis, 
(a violent Aristocrat, of great influence in Switzerland, and 
who would have driven him away if he had known him,) was 
struck with the deportment of the young professor, and offer- 
ed him the place of preceptor to his children. When I spoke 
to him of this retreat, he said to me, that he would willingly 
die for his mother and brothers, and he believed the more he 
kept himself concealed, the greater would be the chance of 
their safety. I am well persuaded, if he had pursued any oth- 
er conduct, the horrible Robespierre would have massacred 
them all. In his manner of dress, he adopts the habit of his 
ancestor, Henry the Fourth. He is melancholy, but gentle 
and unassuming, and his whole ambition is to go to your 
America, there to forget the grandeur and the sufferings of his 
youth. But he has nothing in the world. Can you not ren-

conduct, his veneration for her, and his hatred of Madame de

subsistence, where are his brothers, and any little details re-

Mr Morris's reply to this letter has not been found, but it 
would seem, that he approved the plan of the Duke of 
Orleans for going to America, and offered him such assistance 
as he might require. At the same time, he sent to the Coun- 
tess de Flahaut a draft on a banker in Basle, for one hundred 
louis d'ors, to defray the expenses of their journey to Hamburg. 
The person, whom she designates as her cousin in the follow- 
ing letter, is the Duke of Orleans. 



* It may here be stated, that in none of this correspondence are the 
signatures of the writers attached to the letters, and frequently the 
name of the place is not mentioned. This caution was practised to 
guard against the risk of the letters being read by other persons, and 
the names of the parties being thus detected. The post offices at that 
time had a treacherous practice of opening lettera for political objects. 
A very large portion of the lettera received by Mr Morris, while in 
Europe, from his constant correspondents, are without signatures. 
These, together with the dates and names of places, are always sup- 
plied by him on the envelope of each letter. 

The Countess de Flahaut was the authoress of the celebrated novels 
under that name in the French language. Her pen was thus employ- 
ed in Switzerland, and, in one of her letters to Mr Morris, she speaks 
of a new Roman, from the sale of which she expected to recruit her 
exhausted funds. She afterwards married J. M. de Souza-Botelho, 
who was for some time the Portuguese Ambassador at the Court of 
Prussia, and afterwards in France. He is the same M. de Souza, by 
whose munificence, and under whose superintendence, was pub- 
lished the splendid Paris edition of the LUSIAD of Camoens, the chef 
d'Kuvre of modern typography.

THE COUNTESS DE FLAHAUT TO MR MORRIS. 

' Bremgarten, February 24th, 1795. 
'Sir, 

* A thousand thanks for your kind and consoling letter of the 
sixth instant. I shall depart as soon as possible. Think not 
that it will be with the delay, that I should return to Paris. I 
have only happiness now in prospect, and no guillotine to fear. 
My cousin will go with me ; but it is necessary, that you should 
know his situation. Hamburg is full of people, to whom he is 
known, and whom he would wish never again to see. In the 
first place, Madame de Sillery is at Altona, and out of respect 
to his mother he desires to avoid her. Moreover, he cares 
not to embroil himself with so mischievous a person, for a wri- 
ter like her is always to be dreaded. Her books are full of 
cruel detractions against all the persons, to whom she is under 
the highest obligations. Again, there is General Valence 
three leagues from Hamburg, with a niece of Madame de Sil- 
lery. And then a certain M. Rivry, aid-de-camp of M. de 
Valence, is at Hamburg. Independently of the regards, which 
my cousin entertains for his family, he has personal reasons 
for desiring never to meet any one of these people. 

' You see, therefore, my friend, it will be necessary for him 
to have a little retreat quite secluded. And as for me, the 
smallest lodge, far away from the town, will be most agreea- 
ble, for I have absolute need of air, and my strength will not 
allow me to go far to seek it. Besides, the more I shall be 
retired, the more incognito will my cousin remain. But 
above all things shun Altona. 

' I must also give you some account of the pecuniary situa- 
tion of my cousin. His father had many transactions with 
Walekiers, and he is the only agent, who has treated him with 
fidelity. All the others plundered and deceived him. There 
are even now in England two deposits amounting to thirty- 
five thousand pounds sterling, of which no account can be ob- 



468 LIFE OF 

tained. He intends to prosecute the affair ; and there are ma- 
ny other particulars respecting these plunderers, of which I am 
not permitted to write. Walekiers alone has been perfectly 
generous and disinterested. So far from being indebted to his 
father, he is his creditor ; and yet, he now sends him a remit- 
tance of twenty-five louis a month, to be returned when he 
shall again come into possession of his property. After this, 
you will see, that it is impossible to keep Walekiers ignorant 
either of his retreat, or his journey. But, he is the only per- 
son, who will be informed of them. Hence you can converse 
with him or not on the subject, as you may think proper. He 
desires not to lodge with Walekiers, on account of the compa- 
ny he would meet there, although Walekiers has made him 
every possible offer to receive him at his house. But he 
wishes to associate with a man of reputation, like you, the 
friend of his mother. You will understand all this better, when 
we shall have an opportunity to converse. 

' It will be fifteen days before T shall be able to commence 
the journey. In that time I must send your bill of exchange 
to be negotiated at Basle, for such a thing cannot be done in 
this small village. A carriage is also to be repaired for my 
cousin, but that will not take long, as it is almost new. We 
shall then set off, I and my English servant woman, and he 
and the faithful servant, of whom 1 have spoken. Adieu, my 
excellent friend ; I cannot find words to express how sensib'e 

I am of your goodness. 

' THE COUNTESS DE FLAHAUT.' 

' P. S. The twenty -five louis a month from Walekiers 
have only commenced since his arrival in Hamburg, that is to 
say, within a month, and may be stopped at any moment, 
since they depend on the fortune and the will of M. Wale- 
The enclosed letter is from my cousin.' 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 469 

THE DUKE OF ORLEANS TO MR MORRIS. 

' Bremgarten, February 24th, 1795. 
'Sir, 

{ I accept with much pleasure the offers you make me. 
Your kindness is a blessing I owe to my mother, and to our 
friend. I am sure, that my excellent mother will be somewhat 
consoled, and more tranquil, to know that I am near you, in 
your happy country. I am very ready to labor to acquire in- 
dependence. Hardly had I entered upon life, when the great- 
est misfortunes assailed me, but, thanks to God, they did not 
overwhelm me, too happy in my reverses, that my youth 
had not given me time to become too much attached to my 
station, or to contract habits difficult to be broken, and that I 
was deprived of my fortune before I could either use or 
abuse it. 

' Your excellent friend has the goodness to undertake to 
send you many particulars respecting my present condition, 
which are tedious enough, but of which you ought to be in- 
formed. I hope, Sir, my confidence will afford you another 
proof of all those sentiments of esteem and friendship, which 
you inspire in me. 

L. P. D'ORLEANS. 

In compliance with the request of Madame de Flahaut, in 
her letter of the twenty-seventh of January, Mr Morris wrote 
to the Dutchess of Orleans, informing her of the situation of 
her son, and of his intended departure for America. He re- 
ceived from the Dutchess the following answer. 

' Your letter has caused me a happiness, which I cannot ex- 
press. Ah ! if seas must separate me from one so dear, 
what an alleviation, what peace, will my perfect confidence in 
your friendship and interest secure to me ! I need not speak to 
you of my gratitude ; it Was before established ; but judge to 
what degree it filled my afflicted breast, upon the reception 
of your touching and amiable letter. 
VOL. i. 40 



470 LIFE OF 

' Indeed, I was very sure that he, who, alas ! is deprived 
of every support, which nature gave him, would find in you a 
true and useful friend. I pray you to continue to him your 
interest and your counsels. I hope you will always be able 
to tell me, that he has conducted himself well, and that you 
are satisfied with him. I shall then be certain, that this 
young man, so interesting to me, so dear to my heart, ever 
does what is best. 

' It will afford me a solace necessary to my existence, and 
it will be sweet to contract such great obligations to one, 
whom I esteem so much, and whose friendship I return 
with rny whole heart.' 

Meantime the wanderers at Bremgarten commenced their 
journey, about the tenth of March, and travelled slowly 
through Germany towards Hamburgh. Madame de Flahaut's 
health was so delicate, that she could not endure the fatigue of 
rapid motion. When they arrived at Brunswick, it was re- 
ported, that the road between that place and Hamburg was 
thronged with emigrants, some of whom would unquestionably 
recognise the Duke of Orleans, should he encounter them 
on the way. To guard against such an accident, it was 
thought best for him to perform the route as speedily as pos- 
sible, and without stopping. This was too great an effort for 
his fair companion, and she was left behind at Brunswick. 
The Duke, and his friend, M. de Montjoye, who accompanied 
him in his succeeding travels, reached Hamburg undiscover- 
ed. Madame de Flahaut arrived and joined them shortly af- 
terwards. 

The next step was to procure a place of retreat. This 
was first effected at Nieuenstadt, in the neighborhood of the 
city. If we may judge from a note of the Countess de Fla- 
haut to Mr Morris, they found themselves but indifferently 
accommodated in this retirement. 

' There is no such thing, my dear friend, as arranging 
matters in this house. Yesterday evening we asked for sup- 
per, and the man said he would not furnish it under double 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 471 

i 

the price already agreed upon Besides, he answered my 
cousin rudely, and had the malice to tell the woman of the 
house, that we did not intend to remain with her, when no 
such hint had been given to anybody. In short, he has been 
guilty of such language and conduct, that my cousin told 
him we had no more need of him. For Heaven's sake send 
us something to eat, or we shall perish by a famine. I be- 
seech you to come and see us, for never were prisoners in a 
dungeon more desolate than we are. To make an end of us, 
my cousin had a violent fever yesterday, and as for me, I am 
freezing to death.' 

Such an appeal as this, of course, was not neglected, and 
accommodations more befitting were sought out. But the 
Duke's project of a voyage to America was changed, soon after 
his arrival in Hamburg, probably because Mr Morris had re- 
solved to remain longer in Europe, as the first idea was to 
make the voyage with him. A new scheme, of a temporary 
nature, was substituted in its place. To hide himself from the 
world, the Duke determined to pass the summer in travelling 
to the north of Europe. He left Hamburg for Denmark early 
in the spring, and as soon as he had crossed the Sound, he 
wrote to Mr Morris. 

' Gottenburg, May 15th, 1795. 

< Sir, 

* You see by the place where I date my letter, that I have 
not resisted the temptation of visiting Sweden. It was not ea- 
sy to pass so near this kingdom, without making the tour of it, 
and I do not repeni doing so, for in a commercial view, this 
city merits the attention of a traveller. 

* I felt much joy on my arrival, in finding a little billet from 
my mother, which she sent me through the channel of a French 
Priest, a refugee in Switzerland, whom I believe I have men- 
tioned to you. By the same opportunity she wrote a charm- 
ing letter to my sister, of which I received a copy. This Abbe 
sent me word, at the same time, that my mother is very much 
better, and that her health improves daily. I have heard from 



472 LIFE OF 

my little sister, who is also much hetter. Pardon, I pray you, 
these details. I give them to you, only because I know the 
strong interest you take in everything, that relates to my hon- 
ored mother. Believe me, Sir, it is impossible to feel more 
deeply than I do, the lively concern which you are so kind as 
to take in my fate ; and, I pray you, receive my assurances of 
the very ardent and sincere affection, with which you inspire 
me. 

' L. P. D'ORLEANS.' 

From Gottenburg he pursued his course through Norway 
and Lapland to the North Cape, travelling much of the way 
through those wild and unfrequented regions on foot. He re- 
turned by way of Tornea, the gulf of Bothnia, and Stockholm. 
Mr Morris next heard from him at Lubec, whence he wrote 
on the 2d of January. ' I have returned from my travels,' 
said he, ' in perfect safety. They were rather longer than I 
at first expected, but then I have been to the North Cape, and 
should have gone farther, had such a thing been possible.' 
The Duke took up his residence at Frederickstadt, in Holstein, 
where he remained seven or eight months. Meantime his 
northern rambles had exhausted his funds, and left him desti- 
tute and in debt. When this was made known to Mr Morris, 
he placed a credit for him of fifteen hundred pounds in Lon- 
don. For this seasonable relief the Duke returned his grate- 
ful acknowledgements. His scheme of an American tour was 
at length revived. 

< Frederickstadt, August 30th, 1796. 

'Sir, 

' I have just received a letter from my mother, which orders 
me to undertake a voyage to your country, and announces to 
me, that this voyage will ameliorate her situation and that of 
my connexions. I shall therefore depart with all haste. My 
brothers, too, will sail for Philadelphia. This is certain, for 
the Directory sent me officially my mother's letter, and of 
course had knowledge of it. 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 473 

* I have already informed you, that I wrote to Mr Parish to 
ask him to give my sister a letter of credit for three hundred 
pounds, out of the fifteen hundred. He sent me word that 
the sum, which he then had at my disposal was only four hun- 
dred pounds, that he could not deliver it in small sums, nor 
without my receipt. Consequently I sent him my receipt for 
four hundred pounds. I have transmitted one hundred to my 
sister, and kept three hundred for myself. I shall set off im- 
mediately for Hamburg, where I shall embark in the first ves- 
sel. Adieu. I have little time, and embrace you in great 
haste. 

C L. P. D'ORLEANS.' 

Mr Morris was now on his travels in Germany, but as soon 
as he received this intelligence of the Duke's intended depart- 
ure for America, he wrote to his correspondents in New York, 
giving him an unlimited credit during his wanderings in the 
United States. The Duke de Montpensier, and the Count de 
Beaujolais, arrived in America from Marseilles, and joined 
their brother. 

THE DUKE OF ORLEANS TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

New York, November 21st, 1796. 
< Sir 

( I once more answer your letter of May llth, fearing that 
my former communications have not reached you. As I re- 
ceive no letters from Hamburg, I have reason to think this 
will have the same fate. For the rest, I cannot say enough to 
you of the obliging reception we have met with from your 
friends. 

'We owe you many thanks, and we return them to you 
most cordially, for the credit you have been pleased to give us 
here. You are undoubtedly informed, that we have availed 
ourselves of it for the sum of three thousand dollars, which, ad- 
ded to one of a thousand dollars, taken up at the time I received 

40* 



474

your letter, amounts to four thousand dollars, for which we 
are indebted to your kindness. 

' I can no longer congratulate you, as I did a shcrt time 
since, on the good news we received. It has all passed away 
like a dream. In the midst of this general calamity, \ve have 
at least the consolation, the satisfaction, of knowing, that our 
beloved mother is away from that wretched country, and safe 
from all danger. This alone is a full compensation for all the 
rest. She will certainly feel deeply your conduct towards us, 
and will doubtless do all that is requisite to discharge our debt 
to you. Adieu. Ever yours, 

<L. P. D'ORLEANS.' 

The three brothers continued in America, travelling in dif- 
ferent parts of the United States, and in the West Indies, till 
after the return of Mr Morris from Europe. He received 
them several times in his own house at Morrisania. When 
they arrived in England, the Duke of Orleans wrote to him, 
and the correspondence was continued for a time, though it 
seems to have been dropped in the latter years of Mr Morris's 
life. After the restoration, however, he wrote a congratulatory 
letter to the Dutchess on that event.* 



* The above mentioned loans of money to the Duke of Orleans re- 
mained unpaid for a long time, but were at length fully reimbursed, 
with interest, in two separate payments ; the first, of about thirty -two 
thousand francs, in 1816 ; and the remainder, of thirty-eight thousand 
francs, after Mr Morris's death, in 1818. The whole amount of prin- 
cipal and interest, which was paid by the Duke of Orleans, was some- 
what more than thirteen thousand dollars.

CHAPTER XXV. 

MR MORRIS'S VOYAGE TO AMERICA. ARRIVAL IN NEW YORK. HE RE- 
TIRES TO MORRISANIA. CHOSEN TO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED 
STATES. ENGAGED IN A CAUSE AT THE BAR WITH HAMILTON. PRESI- 
DENTIAL ELECTION. PART TAKEN BY HIM AS A SENATOR. HIS TOUR 

TO CANADA. HIS POLITICAL OPINIONS. ORATIONS AND POLITICAL 

WRITINGS. GENERAL MOREAC. MADAME DE STAEL's PROPOSED VISIT 

TO THE UNITED STATES. 

HAVING brought his complicated affairs to a close in Europe, 
Mr Morris began seriously to think of revisiting his native 
country. Amidst the infinitude of relations he had contracted, 
both of friendship and business, it was no easy matter to ar- 
range them all, and to sever attachments, which time and inti- 
macy had cemented, but which were never again to be re- 
newed. By degrees, however, this was accomplished, and he 
sailed from Hamburg for New York, on the fourth of October, 
1798. A more tedious, protracted, disagreeable, and comfortless 
passage, it has seldom been the lot of luckless voyager to en- 
dure. When they had been fifty-seven days at sea, the cap- 
tain held a council with the mate, into which he asked Mr 
Morris, to consult on the state of affairs, and determine what 
was to be done. It was agreed, from a series of probabilities, 
that the actual position of the ship was somewhere near the 
east end of Long Island, but the provisions of the crew had 
run short, and the weather was precarious. A stiff north- 
wester would drive them off to the West Indies, and in such a 
catastrophe, they would all be in danger of perishing for want 
of food. The question for the council to decide was, whether 
they should steer directly for New York, or make the nearest 
port in Rhode Island. Like men of prudence, they gave a 
unanimous voice for the latter, and in two days they were 
safely moored in the harbor of Newport. 



476 LIFE OF 

But here a new set of calamities sprang up. A drunken 
pilot was to be dealt with ; the captain grew impertinent, sur- 
ly, and obstinate ; snow storms and gales of wind troubled the 
air and the sea ; and ten dismal days and nights were con- 
sumed in vain attempts to escape from the smooth waters of 
Narraganset Bay, and get fairly upon the ocean again. At 
length a packet came along, bound to New York. Mr Morris 
resolved at least to have the satisfaction of exchanging one 
floating prison for another, and went from the ship to the pack- 
et. Here matters were little mended, except that the captain 
was in better humor. A stormy day and a dreary night were 
spent in beating around Point Judith, with eminent peril of ship- 
wreck. They were next tossed to and fro in the Sound, 
obliged to put into New London one night, and anchor under 
the lee shore of Long Island another. At last, twenty-three 
days from the time he first saw the coast of Rhode Island, he 
arrived in New York, making a voyage of eighty days from 
Hamburg; a commentary worth preserving on the present 
splendid establishments of packets and steamboats, in the great 
commercial centre of the New World. 

It was with no light emotions of joy, that he received the 
cordial greetings of his friends, who flocked around him as soon 
as his arrival was known. Just ten years had elapsed, since 
he sailed from the Capes of Delaware, and it was now gratify- 
ing to discover, that time and distance, those potent aids to 
forgetfulness and insensibility, had not weakened the ties of 
old attachments, nor dissolved the charm of early friendships. 
' It seems,' said he, ' as if I were not an unwelcome guest in 
my native country.' The gratulations and hospitality of friends 
detained him some days in the city, and then he went to Mor- 
risania, and took up his residence on his own domains. 

To this stage of his existence he had long been looking for- 
ward with pleasing anticipations, and had resolved to pass the 
remainder of his days in tranquil retirement, on the spot conse- 
crated by the tombs of his ancestors, and the endearing associa- 
tions of childhood. The first object of his care was to put his 



GQUVERNEUR MORRIS. 477 

estate in order, which had been little improved by ten years of 
imperfect culture. He next set himself about a more formidable 
undertaking. The old house, venerable as it was in its age, 
and attractive from the reminiscences it revived, was neverthe- 
less ' leaky and looked runious.' In short, it held out few 
promises of contented enjoyment to a man, whose habits had 
taught him to value the elegances, as well as the more sub- 
stantial comforts of life. He determined to erect a new one. 
Nature had fully accomplished her part, in affording him one 
of the finest sites in the world, embracing a beautiful variety of 
grounds, a prospect of intermingled islands and waters, and in 
the distance the broad expanse of Long Island Sound. The 
plan of his house conformed to a French model, and, though 
spacious and well contrived, was suited rather for conveni- 
ence and perhaps splendor within, than for a show of architec- 
tural magnificence without. Finished, however, according to 
his taste, it answered the ends of its design, being the home of 
his after life, the scene of a generous hospitality, and of the full 
measure of happiness, which fancy and hope had pictured to 
him in the vista of coming years. 

These affairs of building and improvements afforded him a 
busy occupation. In the mean time another sphere of action 
was prepared for him. He was chosen by the legislature of New 
York to supply a vacancy in the Senate of the United States. 
He accepted the appointment upon the principle, that it was 
every man's duty to conform to the wishes of his fellow citi- 
zens, who should select him unsolicited to fill a responsible 
and important office. As soon as he arrived from abroad, his 
friends beset him on this point, but he took care ' to let them 
know early his intention to lead a private life, not meaning to 
embark again on the stormy ocean of politics.' Such resolu- 
tions have been often formed, and as often broken. Mr Morris 
writes in his Diary, that Lafayette deceived himself, when at 
the height of power in Paris he said he was weary of public 
life, and meant to retire. If we may judge from all examples, 
perhaps from human nature, every man who talks thus, deceives 



478 LIFE OF 

himself. Who retires from a political career, till his race is 
run ; till he is at the top of ambition's rickety ladder, or till des- 
pair whispers the unwelcome truth, that he can mount no high- 
er ? Who refuses an office, that carries. with it power, conse- 
quence, or emolument ? Nay, who can be expected to refuse 
such an office ? Who ought to refuse it ? Offices must be held 
by somebody. When we hear men talk of shunning office, of 
retiring from high public stations, of rejecting splendid offers 
in prospect, and of despising power and influence, we may lay it 
down as a general rule, that such men deceive themselves. 

Before Mr Morris took his seat in the Senate, he was en- 
gaged as counsel in a remarkable law case, which was argued 
at Albany. A few brief hints in the Diary afford nearly all 
the information that I have been able to procure, except the 
report contained in the first volume of Johnson's Cases, and 
which touches only on the matter of law. 

4 Mb 'any, February 6th, 1800. Go to the Court of Errors. 
Hamilton concludes forcibly. Harrison opens the law, and so 
does Burr. On our side Troup makes a short good speech. 

( February 8th. In the Court of Appeals Mr R. Living- 
ston speaks on our side. I follow him. 

1 February 10th. Finish my argument, which has, I observe, 
produced considerable effect. 

4 February llth. Attend the Court of Errors, and hear the 
arguments of the adversary. Hamilton is desirous of being 
witty, but goes beyond the bounds, and is open to a severe 
dressing. 

( February ]%th. The adverse counsel conclude. Colonel 
Burr is very able, and has I see made considerable impres- 
sion. I had an opportunity to retort on Hamilton, which I did 
not use, and am on the whole well pleased that I did not.' 

This cause attracted notoriety at the time, from the brilliant 
constellation of talents comprised in the counsel on both sides. 
As the arguments were not reported, nothing now remains to 
give any idea of the display of those talents. There is a ven- 
erable and imposing tradition, both in Albany and New York, 






GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 479 

that talks loudly, but vaguely, on the subject, and which, like 
the responses of the Delphian prophetess, leaves you to gather 
a meaning of high import and wide interpretation. It seems 
well established, however, that uncommon power of reasoning 
was elicited, and that the rencounter of wits, particularly be- 
tween Hamilton and Morris, was sustained with an agility and 
keenness, highly edifying to the audience. These freedoms 
are said to have run to a latitude, which was too great even 
for the indulgence of friendship, and which caused a temporary 
coldness. If so, it was short, and soon forgotten. The part 
acted by Morris in this cause gained him much credit, espe- 
cially on account of the talent and adroitness he discovered, in 
a set contest with the giants of the day, after having been so 
long unused to the habits of the bar and forensic debate. 

He joined the Senate in Philadelphia on the second of May, 
but they adjourned a fortnight afterwards, to re-assemble the 
next session at Washington. The interval was chiefly occu- 
pied by Mr Morris in a tour to Canada and Niagara, of which 
he has given a lively and minute description in a long letter to 
Mr Parish. One object of his journey was to explore a large 
tract of new lands, which he possessed on the southern borders 
of the St Lawrence and Lake" Ontario. In November he pro- 
ceeded to Washington, and was present at the opening of the 
Senate. 

Being now 'fairly seated in the National Legislature, he must 
of necessity range himself in the ranks of one of the two great 
parties, into which the political forces of the nation were at 
that time divided. From the first origin of these parties he 
had been absent from the country, and of course had no per- 
sonal entanglements with either. Considering the tenor of his 
sentiments, however, we should expect to find him, where he 
actually appeared, under the banners of the Federalists. 
There he took a stand, and there he maintained it to the end 
of his life ; sometimes, perhaps, with a zeal that outstripped 
prudence, but always with an honesty of purpose, a fearlessness 
of responsibility, and an ingenuous hearty good will, that com- 



480 LIFE OF 

manded the respect of his opponents, and deserved from 
friends and foes the praise of high minded patriotism. 

As soon as Congress assembled in Washington, the ruling 
topic that absorbed all minds was the approaching presiden- 
tial election. The two rival candidates, Jefferson and Burr, 
being both democrats, the federalists were reduced to a perplex- 
ing dilemma, and compelled to resort to what they considered 
a choice of two evils. The results are well known. As the 
election devolved on the House of Representatives, without the 
intervention of the Senate, Mr Morris kept aloof from the 
strife as much as possible, and only expressed his opinion 
when it was desired. He differed from his party, however, 
on this point, and approved the choice of Mr Jefferson. Writ- 
ing to Hamilton, some time before the election, he observes, 
' the object with many is to take Mr Burr, and I should not be 
surprised if that measure were adopted. Not meaning to enter 
into intrigues, I have merely expressed the opinion, that since 
it was evidently the intention of our fellow citizens to make 
Mr Jefferson their President, it seems proper to fulfil that in- 
tention.' He then speaks in the following honorable and pat- 
riotic language. ' Having declared my determination to sup- 
port the constitutionally appointed administration, so long as 
its acts shall not in my judgment be essentially wrong, my 
personal line of conduct gives me no difficulty, but I am not 
without serious apprehensions for the future state of things.' 
Personally he was well disposed to both candidates, and the 
reason of his preference sprang from a disinterested motive, 
that could have no aim but the public good. His sentiments 
are explained in his letters to Hamilton. After the election 
he was on friendly terms with Mr Jefferson, though op- 
posed to him toto c<zh in all measures of politics. 

During the three years of Mr Morris's service in the Senate 
of the United States, he was a strong pillar in the federal par- 
ty, thoroughly imbued with their policy and principles, and 
generally uniting in their acts. The occasions on which he 
made conspicuous efforts, were in the debates on the repeal 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 481 

of the internal taxes, on the judiciary establishment, and on 
Ross's resolutions for taking possession of New Orleans. 

He was opposed to the discontinuance of internal, or direct 
taxes, and he argued with his usual ingenuity to prove this 
mode of raising a revenue preferable to that of duties on impor- 
tations. They are collected at less expense, and are less oner- 
ous on the people, by saving the expenditures incident to 
levying duties, before the articles reach the consumer ; they 
prevent the crime of smuggling ; and, in short, they are the 
means of diffusing money widely throughout the country, in- 
stead of its being confined in the hands of merchants and deal- 
ers in commodities. Money will go to the place of demand, 
and where it is wanted for taxes, there it will be found, and in 
the progress of circulation will be converted to its beneficial 
uses. He did not disapprove duties on imports ; he would 
have them laid with discrimination, but he would collect the 
greater portion of the revenue through the medium of internal 
taxes, and by no means abandon a system of such essential 
importance to the welfare of the country. 

Just before the close of Mr Adams's administration, it is 
known that a law was passed by Congress, making changes 
in the judiciary establishment, increasing the number of Circuit 
Courts, and adding new judges. These judges were nomina- 
ted by the President, confirmed by the Senate, and commis- 
sioned. They accordingly entered upon their duties. At the 
next session of Congress, under the succeeding administration, 
a bill was brought forward to repeal this act, suspend the new 
judges, and restore things again to their old footing. Wearing 
the aspect of a party measure, it was debated with great 
warmth by the democrats in favor of the repeal, and by the 
federalists in solid phalanx on the other side. 

Mr Morris made two speeches on this occasion, which 
may perhaps be considered the most favorable specimens of 
his senatorial eloquence. Whether from the excitement of 
party, or from whatever cause, he had wrought himself up to 
the conviction, that the subject involved principles of infinite 
VOL. j. 41 



482 LIFE OF 

moment to the future existence of the government. He saw 
in the repeal of this act a precedent, which would be a sanc- 
tion to any encroachment upon the constitutional charter, or 
any ' excess of capricious legislation.' The advocates of the 
repeal argued that the act was unnecessary, that no additional 
judges were wanted, and that the expense was a waste of 
the public treasure. These points, touching the merits and 
expediency of the bill, he combated in detail. But the weight 
of his argument was mainly directed to the constitutional 
bearing of the question. He insisted, that the judges were 
appointed during good behavior, and entered upon their office 
in that belief, that Congress had no power to suspend them, 
except by impeachment for misdemeanor, that a law of ab- 
rogation, or expulsion, would be essentially an ex post facto 
law, a violent and unqualified breach of the Constitution. 
Such were his views, and he enforced them by a rare felicity 
of illustration, and cogency of reasoning. The repeal passed, 
nevertheless, and he was accustomed to mourn, as long as he 
lived, over the deadly wound, which the Constitution had re- 
ceived by this rash tampering with the judiciary. 

In the affair of Spanish aggressions, and the proposed seizure 
of New Orleans, he went the full length of Mr Ross's resolu- 
tions. His speech is elaborate, copious in matter, and pointed 
ins tyle. Spain had committed outrages hostile to our national 
honor and interests ; justice demanded a reprisal ; negoti- 
ation was hopeless ; nothing remained but force ; nature had 
made the Mississippi an appendage to the United States, and 
it must one day belong to them ; now was the time to secure 
the possession ; it was justified by the principles of right, ur- 
ged by sound policy, and commanded by national self-re- 
spect. 

Such being Mr Morris's doctrines, it is not wonderful, per- 
haps, that he should approve the Louisiana treaty, although 
generally condemned, by the opponents to the administration, 
as a democratic measure, set on foot to answer party views, 
and portending ruinous consequences to the couoiMtry. 
Morris saw it in another light. He regarded the ceded ter- 






GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 483 

ritory as of vast importance to the United States, and believed 
it could never be obtained on better or more honorable terms. 
From the first promulgation of the treaty, therefore, he gave 
it the hearty support of his approbation and counsels. 

The term for which he had been chosen, as a Senator from 
New York, expired on the 4thof March, 1803. A change 
of parties in the legislature prevented his being re-elected. 
This was the last scene of his political life. The remainder 
of his days were passed at Morrisania, in that retirement, 
which fancy had delineated in such captivating colors, and 
for which he had made substantial and tempting preparations. 
An ample fortune, numerous friends, a charming retreat, and 
a tranquil home, were the elements of his happiness, and fill- 
ed up the measure of his hopes. 

A large part of the year 1803 was occupied in travelling. 
In July he made a jaunt through the New England States. 
Early in August he commenced a northern tour, on a visit to 
his wild lands, and to Canada, from which he did not return 
till the middle of November. The following is a description 
of his passing the rapids of the St Lawrence on this tour. 

' October 2lst. We are off early, and soon after are envel- 
oped in a thick fog, so that we cannot see ten paces from the 
boat. In this condition we descend the Rapid, called the Co- 
leau du Lac. This is not pleasant, nor quite safe. We learn 
by the sound when we have passed it, and then feel our way 
towards the village of the Cedars. Before we reach it, we 
must go out to avoid a rocky point, which is shoal for a con- 
siderable distance, with a stream rapid enough to bilge us, 
should we strike the rocks ; and if we do not, immediately on 
passing it, pull to the shore, we shall be sucked into the Rap- 
id of the Cedars, which is difficult with the clearest light, and, 
of course, dangerous in the dark. We are so fortunate as to 
reach the village without accident ; and, having staid there till 
the fog clears away, take a pilot, for we are told that the riv- 
er is so low, that the most experienced navigators get a 
pilot at this place. Ours conducts us well, and finds all his 



484 LIFE OF 

skill necessary, for being obliged to shoot the Cascades to take 
in some of our boatmen, who had gone thither on foot, we not 
only ship some water, but get a tolerable thump on our stern. 
It is indeed a severe pitch. We now cross the lake St Cfare 
and go to Cahnawaga to get an Indian pilot for the Lachine 
Rapid. The weather in this trjtjet is charming, and the view 
of the country very fine ; but, as we proceed, a light easterly 
wind renders it raw and unpleasant. The weather also be- 
comes cloudy, and our Indian pilot will not go to-night. He 
says the passage is dangerous, and stopped up by grounded 
rafts into the bargain, so we stand over to the village of La- 
chine. 

' October %2d. At half past nine set off for Montreal. The 
Lachine Rapid is the most difficult in the river, and the ef- 
fects of the drought are far more sensible here than at the Ce- 
dars, because they have there only the water of the St Lawrence, 
which flowing from the lake Ontario rises and falls but little. 
Even now it is not diminished above three feet from its high- 
est swell ; but below the Cascades, the Ottawa or Grande Ri- 
viere, falls into the St Lawrence, and in medium seasons gives 
an equal, but in the freshes a greater supply of water, so that 
below its mouth the parameter of the river is equal to a column 
of water at least double that, which the St Lawrence alone 
usually supplies. At present the Ottawa gives hardly any. 
This Rapid then is scarcely passable. The pilot points out 
one rock never before seen above water, and now at least two 
feet above the surface. To mend the matter, a raft has 
grounded, and is wedged between two rocks in the only chan- 
nel. We discover this untoward circumstance when we are 
so far advanced, that it is not possible to return, or materially 
to check our advance, which is at the rate of a tolerable gal- 
lop. Our pilot, though much alarmed, preserves some pre- 
sence of mind, and does the best which the state of things will 
permit. He runs close to, and even grazes, the raft. Thus 
we take the swell, which is occasioned by the stoppage, and 
bound over the rock. To have struck in this place would have 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 485 

cost us our baggage at least. Having thus leaped the barrier 
of Lachine, we glide on smoothly and shoot with ease the 
Saut Normand, and get fairly housed a little before noon at 
Dillon's hotel.' 

From this date Mr Morris's retired habits of living afford but 
few materials for biography. Two or three months of each 
year he commonly devoted to travelling, either on short ex- 
cursions of pleasure, or journeys to his new lands, in which 
he had a large property invested, and which accordingly re- 
quired his attention. The rest of the time he passed at Mor- 
risania, occupied in cultivating his farm, receiving the social 
visits of his friends and acquaintances, reading, and a wide 
correspondence on politics and business. 

Although he had wholly given up public life, and, consider- 
ing the tenor of his political views, he had no expectation of 
being brought forward again by the people, since there was 
little prospect of a change of parties, yet his mind was active, 
he was watchful of events, scanned public measures with 
acuteness, and took a lively concern in all that was passing. 
To Robert R. Livingston, soon after that gentleman's return 
from his mission to France, he wrote as follows. 

' When you speak of my indifference, you do not sufficiently 
consider my situation. I never sought, avoided, or resigned 
an office, but continued at my last post to the latest moment ; 
and was then replaced by a gentleman, who was, I presume, 
more worthy of the public confidence. It becomes me, in 
submission to the will of my fellow citizens, to doubt of my 
talents ; for I cannot, neither can they, doubt my integrity. 
I am connected with the members of my party by their worth, 
and by their kindness. If I could for a moment suppose they 
harbored designs unfriendly to our country, that moment the 
connexion would be dissolved. But I have all the evidence, 
which the nature of the case admits, that their views are hon- 
orable, just, and patriotic. 1 believe this also of many among 
your party, and among your present adversaries. It is my 
wish, that every such man were numbered in our fold, that so 
41* 



486 LIFE or 

we might stand and fall together. 1 shall not, however, preach 
politics in the vain hope of making converts, for a mind cooled 
by the winters of half a century has no disposition to become 
a moral Quixote. It is my duty to accept with resignation 
what the will of God has offered, and this becomes less diffi- 
cult, from a conviction, that few men or things are worth one 
anxious thought/ 

Much might be said of Mr Morris's political opinions, of 
their nature, complexion, and tendency, particularly as devel- 
oped during the last years of his life. But these are expressed 
with so much clearness and precision in his published letters, 
that a commentary of this sort is not required, and would be 
more tedious than edifying. If his opinions after the embargo, 
and through the war, were to have a name, they might per- 
haps come under the designation of ultra-federalism. It must 
however be kept in mind, that his political views were essen- 
tially his own, and that, although he chose to range himself in 
the line of the Federalists, he did not pretend to act with them 
in all respects as a party. On the contrary, he was opposed 
to some of their prominent measures. Hence it would be aa 
error to confound any speculations, dogmas, or statements in 
his writings with federalism, as recognised by the party at that 
time ; or to consider the party responsible for them, as coming 
from a leader in their ranks. He carried into politics, as into 
everything else, his bold and independent turn of thinking, and 
on all subjects he was accustomed to express his opinions 
with prompt decision, a fearless freedom, and an indifference 
to public censure or applause. He was often consulted by 
members of Congress, on the important questions before that 
body, and his correspondence will show with what unreserve 
and fulness he uttered his sentiments and counsels. 

He filled up some of his leisure hours in writing for the 
newspapers, generally on political topics, but sometimes on 
those of a critical or literary cast. Now and then he descend- 
ed to satire and humor, both in prose and verse. The larger 
part of these effusions may be found in the New York Even- 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 487 

ing Post, the Examiner) and the United States Gazette. 
Through these channels he presented to the world his opin- 
ions on passing events, and sent out the shafts of his eloquence, 
wit, and argument against the policy and doings of the ruling 
party, the political doctrines of the Jeffersonian school, and 
the war administration of Mr Madison. Several of his essays 
in the Evening Post are signed AN AMERICAN, which, it will 
be recollected, was his early revolutionary signature. 

At different times Mr Morris was called to address the pub- 
lic, by the desire of numbers of his fellow citizens. Not long 
after his return from Europe, he pronounced an Oration on 
the Death of Washington, at the request of the corporation of 
the city of New York. Again, it was his melancholy and 
painful task to address the concourse of assembled mourners, 
at the funeral of Hamilton, whose untimely death was deplor- 
ed by a nation in tears, and which to him had caused the loss 
of a most intimate and valued friend. He also delivered an 
Oration in Honor of the Memory of George Clinton, a patriot 
of early times, and a name high on the list of the eminent 
founders of American freedom. These performances are 
marked by some of Mr Morris's striking attributes of concep- 
tion and style, but they can hardly be numbered among the 
happiest specimens of his compositions. They abound in ex- 
pressive imagery, are rich in the resources of fancy, and not 
destitute of his usual vigor of thought and pointed language ; 
but his efforts to reach the heart, to move the feelings, are 
sometimes overstrained, and seldom successful. The tone of 
his eloquence, and his mental characteristics, seem to have 
been better suited to the bar, or the senate, than to a popular 
audience. The strength of his understanding, and the adroit 
use of his inventive powers, might carry conviction, where 
they would fail to kindle into life the gentler passions, and his 
imagination, ever brilliant and ever fertile, might adorn an ar- 
gument, when it would labor without effect to touch the chords 
of sympathy. His oration, on the Restoration of the Bour- 
bons, attracted much notice at the time, from the tenor of 



488 LIFE Of 

its political sentiments. In its literary execution, it partakes 
of many of the excellences and some of the faults of the au- 
thor's style. The thoughts are condensed, the language stu- 
died and terse, running a little too much into declamation and 
a measured rotundity of periods, but never feeble or diffuse. 
It was translated into French, and published in Paris. 

The two discourses before the New York Historical Socie- 
ty, of which he was President, are worthy of his reputation, 
and favorable testimonials of his talents and of the variety and 
compass of his attainments. Among the valuable contribu- 
tions of that society to the historical lore of the country, these 
discourses claim a conspicuous place, especially as containing 
the reflections of a statesman on the early and progressive for- 
tunes of New York, and on the utility of history, as a field of 
study and a source of knowledge. 

The following account of a conversation with General Mo- 
reau. at Morrisania, is curious, considering the subsequent 
fate of that distinguished and unfortunate officer. 

'November 10th, 1807. Gen eralMoreau comes to breakfast. 
Walk with him, and endeavor to dissuade him from his project- 
ed journey to New Orleans. He is at length shaken, and 
would renounce it, if his preparations were not too far ad- 
vanced. I persist, and, at length, render it doubtful in his 
mind. I am certain this journey will be imputed by many evil 
meaning men to improper motives. He treats the chattering of 
idlers with contempt. But I tell him, that such idlers form a 
power in republics. That he must not suppose himself as free 
here, as he would be in an absolute monarchy ; that his rep- 
utation makes him a slave to public opinion ; that he cannot 
with impunity do many things here, which would be of no 
consequence in a country, where he was surrounded by spies 
in the service of government ; because there, the Ministers 
having convinced themselves, that his views are innocent, and 
his conduct irreproachable, he might safely laugh at the sus- 
picions both of the great vulgar and of the small ; but here, 
where the same modes of knowing what men do are not 






GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 489 

adopted, every one is at liberty to suspect, and will decide 
rashly on appearances, after which it may be impossible to 
deracinate the ideas hastily, lightly, and unjustly assumed. 

1 In the course of our conversation, touching very gently 
the idea of his serving (in case of necessity) against France, 
he declares frankly, thai when the occasion arrives, he shall 
feel no reluctance ; that, France having cast him out, he is a 
citizen of the country in which he lives, and has the same 
right to follow his trade here, as any other man. And as it 
would be unjust to prevent a French hatter, whom Bonaparte 
might banish, from making hats, so it would be unjust to 
prevent a French General from making war. I assent to 
the truth of this observation, not because I believe it true, but 
because I will not impeach the reasons he may find it conve- 
nient to give to himself for his own conduct, should he hereaf- 
ter be employed in our service.' 

After Mr Morris's return from Europe, he held frequent 
communications by letter with M. Necker, till the time of that 
eminent person's death, and to a much later period with his 
daughter, Madame de Stae'l. These related chiefly to matters 
of business, which were too intricate and extensive to admit of 
an exposition in this place. A few facts, however, are requi- 
site to render some parts of Mr Morris's published corres- 
pondence intelligible. 

In November, 1794, a transaction occurred atCopet, between 
M. Necker on the one part, and M. Leray de Chanmont and 
Mr Morris on the other, by which the former advanced about 
thirty-eight thousand dollars to the latter, receiving their bonds 
payable at long terms in the United States, and secured by 
lands in that country. This operation was entered into by 
M. Necker for the advantage of Madame de Stae'l, and was 
in due time accomplished according to the terms of the agree- 
ment. In the progress of this affair Madame Stae'l had become 
acquainted with the sales of new lands in the United States, 
and, forming a high opinion of their value, she prevailed on 
her father to appropriate twenty thousand dollars of the money 



490 



LIFE OF 



he had set apart for her, in the purchase and improvements of 
those lands. A negotiation to this effect had been arranged 
with M. Leray de Chaumont, and was to be closed immedi- 
ately, when Madame de Stae'l received a letter from the Duke 
de Liancourt, then travelling in the United States, which con- 
tained representations that seemed to her discouraging. The 
day before the papers were to be signed, she wrote the follow- 
ing note to M. Leray de Chaumont, who was then at Copet. 

'November 6th, 1796. 

'Sir, 

' I am afraid you will find me very troublesome, but as I 
regard you more in the light of a guide than of a contractor, 
and since it is owing much more to your personal character, 
than to all the calculations in the world, that I confide the for- 
tune of my children to you, I do not hesitate to speak to you 
freely of my particular interests. I have seen a letter from 
the Duke de Liancourt, written in America, and another from 
a well informed American merchant, which unite in dissua- 
ding any one from going to America, or making purchases 
there. They are of a kind to frighten the Swiss from these 
speculations. The writers do not say, that they know where 
the lands of A. are situated. They add, moreover, that Mr 
T.'s lands sell for two piasters an acre. Are these lands near 
yours ? I pray you to solve the difficulties, with which I am 
embarrassed, and the more, as this affair of four thousand acres 
is a signal act of kindness on the part of my father. It is of 
real value only as it regards my children, and, in the mean 
time, it is depriving my father of a part of his revenue. These 
motives, which your delicacy will perfectly comprehend, urge 
me to request that my doubts may be removed, before the 
conclusion of any definite agreement. A thousand kind 

compliments. 

' NECKER DE STAEL.' 

To this note M. Leray replied, that the information she had 
received did not alter his good opinion of the proposed bar- 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 491 

gain, nor of the benefits she would derive from it ; but if she 
was thus fearful and hesitating at the outset, she might easily 
imagine the anxieties to which she would probably be expos- 
ed during a lapse of years, 1 while the affair was in operation, 
and that he did not wish to insist on her completing the con- 
tract. M. Necker waited on him, however, the next day, 
and apologized in the name of his daughter for her hesitancy 
and apprehensions, at so late a stage of the business, and the 
agreement was immediately concluded. 

This was the beginning of an interest invested by Madame 
de Stael in the lands of the United States, which continu- 
ed under various forms till the end of her life. The lands 
selected in fulfilment of the above contract were situated in 
the northeastern part of Pennsylvania, and were unluckily 
comprised in the tract, which was involved in the controversy 
between that State and Connecticut. This rendered the title 
precarious, and M. Leray made other arrangements in regard 
to the contract, satisfactory to M. Necker and his daughter. 
Meantime Madame de Stael effected another purchase of 
twenty-three thousand acres in the State of New York, St 
Lawrence County, chosen by the directions of M. Necker, as 
advised, or approved, by Mr Morris. This bargain was like- 
wise made with M. Leray. In his letter of instructions to 
Madame de Stael on this occasion, M. Necker says, ' Al- 
though my daughter has not experience in affairs, she has a 
native judgment, which will supply the want of it, and she is 
called to treat with a man of integrity, who will watch over 
my interests as over his own ; and I do not hesitate to give her 
powers to arrange and finish this affair with M. Leray, and I 
consider whatever she shall do as if done by myself.' This 
transaction was four years before the death of M. Necker. 
Another purchase was afterwards made by Madame de Stael 
herself. M. Leray was the immediate agent in these con- 
cerns, but Mr Morris was consulted, as being a friend to the 
parties, possessing lands in the neighborhood of those of Ma- 
dame de Stael, and well acquainted with their value and the 



492 LIFE OF 

mode of improving this kind of property. Hence the corres- 
pondence, both of the father and daughter, with Mr Morris 
on this subject. 

It was for a long time Madame de Stael's intention to visit 
the United States, and to establish one of her sons here in the 
charge of these lands. In her letters to Mr Morris, she often 
speaks of the voyage as in prospect, and soon to be perform- 
ed. * If I were only twenty-five years old,' said she, ' instead 
of thirty-five, I believe that I should come and see you.' To 
this Mr Morris replied, ' Then you think me fit only for the 
society of young ladies. Be persuaded, I beseech you, of the 
contrary. Believe, too, that the age of reason is that, which 
is suitable for travelling. Greater advantage is obtained from 
it, and less risk incurred. Building castles in the air is a di- 
verting folly. Building them in the United States would be 
a ruinous folly. Labor is too expensive. But to set up a lit- 
tle summer establishment in a new country, which is rapidly 
advancing ; to pass there from three to five months of the fine 
season ; to remain four months more either at Philadelphia or 
New York ; and to spend the remainder of the year in travel- 
ling ; this I consider a mode of life by no means repugnant to 
common sense.' The next year she wrote as if her resolu- 
tion was taken, and she would soon depart. In his answer Mr 
Morris says ; ' I flatter myself, then, that next spring you will 
sail for America. For this purpose about the middle of April 
you can embark at Nantes with your son for New York. As 
soon as you arrive, you will come to Morrisania, partake what 
our dairy affords, and refresh yourself. In the beginning of 
July you shall set out to visit your lands, and the interior 
country ; and return by the middle of September, to repose af- 
ter your fatigues, to gather peaches, take walks, make verses, 
romances, in a word to do whatever you please. When my 
hermitage shall have lost its attractions, you shall establish 
yourself in the city, where, by the aid of a good cook, you 
will contrive to live very welh* Here, as elsewhere, people 
amuse themselves with discussions, bons mots, slandering their 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 493 

neighbors, and the like. Life is everywhere much the same 
in the long run. In all places the senses are of some account ; 
the rest depends on the cast of mind, the view we take of 
things, the art of being occupied, and, finally, on friendship, 
whose sentiments endear our existence and banish ennui." 1 

About the same time Madame de Stae'l wrote also to M. 
Leray ; ' I understand you have managed your lands with 
great skill, and that you have a fine establishment. I cannot 
imagine a more noble career than yours, and if I had not my 
European habits, I should delight to become an inmate at 
Leraysville. 1 should there find, I am sure, a most agreeable 
residence, and our friend Morris would bring back Paris to 
my recollections. Commend me to him, I pray you, and for- 
get not the protection of friendship, which you have kindly af- 
forded me, since I have been deprived of the protector, who 
honored and sustained my life. Adieu, my dear friend, we 
shall meet next year on the banks of some river.' But the 
meeting never took place. Madame de Stael's European at- 
tachments and pursuits threw perpetual obstacles in the way 
of her projected voyage, till declining health deprived her of 
the courage to meditate and the strength to execute such an 
enterprise. Her son formed other views, and after her death 
the lands were sold. 

The following extract from a letter to Madame de Damas, 
dated December 1st, 1809, will give some insight into Mr 
Morris's habits of living and thinking at that time. 

' Agreeably to your wish, we have talked of you much, we 
have thought of you still more, and sincerely wished, that you 
and yours were with us. We have not indeed the gayeties of 
Paris, nor the pleasures of France, but we breathe freely a 
wholesome air. You ask what is my situation, my health, and 
employment. I answer, that my establishment is pleasant, and 
though expensive, not beyond the means which I ought to 
possess, and which time will either bring or take away. My 
health is excellent, saving a little of the gout, which at this 
moment annoys me. I can walk three leagues, if the weather 
VOL. i. 42 



494 LIFE OF 

be pleasant, and the road not rough. My employment is to 
labor for myself a little, for others more ; to receive much 
company, and forget half those who come. I think of public 
affairs a little, read a little, play a little, and sleep a great deal. 
With good air, a good cook, fine water and wine, a good con- 
stitution, and a clear conscience, I descend gradually towards 
the grave, full of gratitude to the Giver of all good ; and, be- 
seeching him to grant to my fellow creatures what he has gra- 
ciously and abundantly bestowed on me, I rely on providence 
as well for what remains here, as for what may happen here- 
after. 

' In answer to this letter tell me the same things of yourself, 
and it will add much to my felicity. Be persuaded, that, in 
spite of our feeble efforts and empty vows, events in this world, 
and in the thousands of worlds, which roll through the regions 
of space, will pursue the course marked out by Omnipotence. 
Every inferior intelligence, the greatest as well as the least, is 
but an instrument in his hand. How vain, then, the pride, the 
power, and the glory of man ! How idle the care of those, 
who think they regulate the affairs of a little portion of the lit- 
tle planet, on which they chance to exist for a moment ! How 
weak the wish to play a splendid part on this transient theatre, 
and how insensate the attempt to supplant those, who are bus- 
kined to terrify or amuse ! Adieu.' 

On the twenty-fifth of December, 1809, Mr Morris was 
married to Miss Anne Carey Randolph, a lady accomplished 
in mind and person, and belonging to one of the ancient and 
most respectable families in Virginia. To this connexion, 
although formed late in life, he often refers in his private 
correspondence, as a source of continued satisfaction and hap- 
piness. More than two years after his marriage, he wrote to 
his intimate friend, Mr John Parish, then at Bath in England ; 
' Perhaps some wind may yet waft you over the bosom of the 
Atlantic, and then you shall become acquainted with my wife, 
and you shall see that fortune fortune ? No, the word be- 
fits not a sacred theme, let me say the bounty of Him, 



GOUYERNEUR MORRIS. 495 

who has been to me unsparingly kind, gilds with a celestial 
beam the tranquil evening of my day.' On the sixth of 
July, 1816, he wrote again to Mr Parish as follows. 'I lead 
a quiet, and, more than most of my fellow mortals, a happy 
life. The woman, to whom I am married, has much genius, 
has been well educated, and possesses, with an affectionate 
temper, industry and a love of order. Our little boy grows 
finely, and is generally admired. The sentiments of a father, 
respecting an only child, render his opinions so liable to suspi- 
cion, that prudence should withhold them. You may, then, 
opening your mind's eye, behold your friend, as he descends 
with tottering steps the bottom of life's hill, supported by a kind 
companion, a tender female friend, and cheered by a little 
prattler, who bids fair, if God shall spare his life, to fill in 
due time the space his father leaves. He will, I trust, be- 
queath a portion larger than his heritage of wealth and fame. 
Nevertheless, looking back I can with some little self compla- 
cency reflect, that I have not lived in vain ; and at the same 
time look forward with composure, at the probable course of 
future events. At sixty-four there is little to desire, and less 
to apprehend.'

MR MORRIS FIRST SUGGESTS THE IDEA OF THE CANAL BETWEEN LAKE 

ERIE AND THE HUDSON. HIS SERVICES IN EFFECTING THAT WORK.

CONCLUDING REMARKS. 

WE are now to consider Mr Morris's agency in originating 
the idea, and projecting the plan, of the Erie Canal. So 
much has been written on this subject, and so many rival 
claims to the honor and credit of first suggesting, or progres- 
sively effecting, this magnificent enterprise, have been put for- 
ward and tenaciously maintained, that it is almost invidious to 
single out a name from so worthy a list, as demanding a mark- 



496 LIFE OF 

ed pre-eminence. It is comforting to reflect, however, that 
there is merit enough for them all, and that the awarding of 
his just share to one, need not detract from what may fairly 
belong to any or all of the others. The project of an improved 
water communication, between the Hudson and Lake Ontario, 
by way of the natural streams and the carrying places, for the 
advancement of the Indian trade, appears to have been thought 
of some time before the Revolution ; but the splendid concep- 
tion of connecting the vast waters of Erie, and the upper 
Lakes, with those of the Atlantic through the channel of the 
Hudson, is of more recent origin, and may undoubtedly ba 
ascribed to Gouverneur Morris. It would, truly, be pre- 
sumptuous to say, that no such thought ever crossed any per- 
son's mind, till it flashed upon his, yet, as far as testimony has 
weight, it is demonstrable, that he was the first to give shape 
and consistency to the thought, or make it known to the world. 
A few facts will be enough to establish this point. 

In a letter to Dr Hosack, replying to certain queries re- 
specting the Erie Canal, Mr Harmanus Bleecker writes as fol- 
lows. 

' Of the merit of the late Gouverneur Morris, in regard to 
the canals, I have a deep impression. I witnessed with great 
interest his zeal and intelligence, his efforts to inform others, 
and his elevation above the ignorance and prejudice, by which 
the project was condemned as premature and chimerical. 
You know, that he and Mr Clinton were deputed by the Canal 
Commissioners, to attend at the seat of the general govern- 
ment, for the purpose of procuring its aid. In the month of 
January, 1812, they appeared before a Committee of the 
House of Representatives, consisting of a member from each 
State, and Mr Morris made a grand and luminous exposition 
of his views, in relation to the Erie Canal, and several other 
similar projects in various parts of the United States.* It is 



* Mr Bleecker was at that time in Washington, as a member of Con- 
gress from the State of New York. 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 497 

grateful for me now to see how just and enlightened his views 
were, and to think how much he was in advance of those who 
doubted, those who were passive, and those who condemned 
and ridiculed what appeared clear to his discerning mind. 
What he then prophesied is now history.' 

By a living witness it is proved, that Mr Morris, as early as 
the year 1777, promulgated his belief of the practicability of 
connecting, by an inland navigation, the great interior Lakes 
with the Hudson. Our readers will remember his mission in 
that year from the government of New York to General 
Schuyler's army, then at Fort Edward, retreating before Gen- 
eral Burgoyne. He there met the associate of his boyhood, 
Mr Morgan Lewis, quartermaster in the northern army, since 
General Lewis, and Governor of New York. Their evenings 
were passed together, in company with General Schuyler and 
other officers. In a letter to Mr Bleecker, dated May twen- 
ty-sixth, 1828, General Lewis relates the following particulars 
in regard to those interviews. 

'Mr Morris, whose temperament admitted of no alliance 
with despondency, even in the most gloomy periods of the 
war, with which our then situation might justly be classed, 
never doubting the ultimate triumph of our arms, and the con- 
sequent attainment of independence, frequently amused us by 
descanting with great energy on what he termed the " rising 
glories of the Western World." One evening,* in particular, 
while describing in the most animated and glowing terms the 
rapid march of the useful arts through our country, when once 
freed from a foreign yoke ; the spirit with which agriculture 
and commerce both external and internal would advance ; the 
facilities which would be afforded them by the numerous wa- 
ter.^ourses, intersecting the country, and the ease by which 
they might be made to communicate ; he announced, in lan- 
guage highly poetic, and to which I cannot do justice, that at 
no very distant day the waters of the great western inland 
seas would, by the aid of man, break through their barriers 
and mingle with those of the Hudson. I recollect asking him 
42* 



498 LIFE OF 

how they were to break through these barriers. To which 
he replied, that numerous streams passed them through natu- 
ral channels, and that artificial ones might be conducted by 
the same routes.' 

There is a passage in his Diary, while he was travelling in 
Scotland, October, 1795, which furnishes a hint corroborative 
of these views. ' In my route I stopped twice to look at the 
canal, which crosses the Island here, and which this day, for 
the second time, I rode under. First I went to look at a suc- 
cession of locks, which rise immediately after the canal has 
been carried over a river, and saw sufficiently, 1 think, their 
principle and construction. I admire much the execution in 
hewn stone, all in the best style. My second object was to 
see a number of vessels collected, and lading in the highest 
part of the canal, some brigs and sloops. On inquiry, I 
find that those, which draw only seven feet and a half of 
water, can go through. Also, that there are twenty locks, 
each of eight feet ; so that the whole rise is one hundred 
and sixty feet. When I see this, my mind opens to a 
view of wealth for the interior of America, which hitherto I 
had rather conjectured than seen.' It is probable, that his 
idea of a canal for vessels, between the Hudson and Lake Erie, 
which he maintained for some time, was derived from this in- 
spection of the Caledonian Canal. 

But a more remarkable testimony is contained in his letter 
to Mr Parish, written in January, 1801, a few weeks after he 
had returned from a tour to Canada, and up the St Lawrence 
and Lake Ontario to Niagara Falls and Lake Erie. 

* In turning a point of wood,' he writes, ' the Lake (Erie) 
broke on our view. I saw riding at anchor nine vessels, the 
least of them above a hundred tons. Can you bring your 
imagination to realize the scene ? Does it not seem like ma- 
gic ? Yet this magic is but the early effort of victorious in- 
dustry. Hundreds of large ships will, at no distant period, 
bound on the billows of these inland seas. At this point com- 
mences a navigation of more than a thousand miles. Shall 
1 lead your astonishment up to the verge of incredulity ? I 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 499 

will. Know then that one tenth of the expense, borne by 
Britain in the last campaign, would enable ships to sail from 
London through Hudson's River into Lake Erie.'' 

Here is a declaration, as clear and positive as it could be 
made by language, that his view extended to a communication 
between the Hudson and Lake Erie, not by the route of Lake 
Ontario, but direct, for he speaks of a ship navigation, which 
it is by no means likely that even his fancy would have dream- 
ed as practicable, through a canal around the Falls of Niagara. 

This statement is also remarkably confirmed by a conver- 
sation, which took place between him and several other persons 
at a dinner party in Washington, not many days after the above 
letter to Mr Parish was written. The company consisted of 
gentlemen from different parts' of the Union, and among them 
was Mr Robert Morris. The locality of the seat of govern- 
ment came under discussion, and various opinions were ex- 
pressed. Mr Robert Morris at length called out, ' Gouver- 
neur, what would they think, if we were now in Convention, 
and should propose to establish the seat of government at New- 
burgh on the Hudson?' Gouverneur Morris, apparently drawn 
out by this question, went into the subject, and remarked upon 
the many and great advantages, which would have resulted 
from such a location. He extolled its beautiful site, its cen- 
tral position, its accessibleness to the sea, and the ease with 
which it could be protected from the approach of an invading 
enemy. ' Yes,' said he, ' this would have been the place 
for the seat of government, and the members of Congress 
could have come from all parts by water.' ' Come by wa- 
ter, Mr Morris ! ' exclaimed the company, * but how ? ' 
* Why, by tapping Lake Erie, and bringing its waters to the 
Hudson.' ' How could you bring them ? ' ' By an inclin- 
ed plane.' ' But that would be too expensive.' ' Well, 
then,' said he, 'there is a water-table, which can be found.'*

Mr K. K. Van Rensselaer, who was present and heard the converse-

Again, Mr Simeon De Witt, who, at the time to which he 
refers, had already been many years surveyor general of the 
state of New York, writes to Mr William Darby, ' The mer- 
it of first starting the idea of a direct communication between 
Lake Erie and Hudson River, unquestionably belongs to 
Gouverneur Morris. The first suggestion 1 had of it was from 
him. In 1803 I accidentally met him at Schenectady. We 
put up for the night at the same inn, and passed the evening 
together. Among the numerous topics of conversation, to 
which his prolific mind and discursive imagination gave birth, 
was that of improving the intercourse with the interior of our 
State, He then mentioned the project of tapping Lake Erie, 
as he expressed himself, and leading its waters in an artificial 
river directly across the country to Hudson River.' Mr 
Geddes, one of the principal surveyors and engineers of the 
Erie Canal, has declared, that these facts were communicated 
to him in 1804 by Mr De Witt, and that they were the first 
hints he had ever received of such a project. Mr Stephen 
Van Rensselaer, who was from the beginning one of the 
Canal Commissioners, says, in a letter recently written, ':! con- 
sider Mr Morris the father of o*ur great canal, and every re- 
port and memorandum of his should be preserved for posteri- 
ty, who will render to him the honor he merited. 'f 



tion. It may be observed in further explanation, that, in the Conven- 
tion for forming the Constitution of the United States, Gouverneur 
Morris had prepared a proposition for establishing the seat of govern- 
ment at Newbugh, which he was dissuaded from presenting by Rob- 
ert Morris, who thought it would lead to discussions unfavorable to 
harmony and union, by touching upon sectional interests, and stirring 
up local feelings. 

f Much of the above testimony, and many other particulars relating 
to the same subject, may be found in Dr Hosack's valuable Life of De 
Wilt Clinton ; in a pamphlet, entitled Fads and Observations in Re- 
lation to the Origin and Completion of the Erie Canal ; and in the 
compilation of the Laws, Reports, and Official Documents on the Cham- 
plain and Erie Canals, published at Albany, 1825, in two volumes. 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 501 

Abundance of collateral evidence might be adduced, tend- 
ing to the same point, but this is enough. We believe no 
person can read these statements, with a mind wholly unbias- 
ed, and not feel the force of a perfect conviction, that the idea 
of a canal from Lake Erie to Hudson River, by an interior 
route, was original with Mr Morris, and that he was the first 
to suggest it. These proofs are too strong, too direct, and 
too consistent, to admit of being parried or invalidated. If 
the whole could be traced to ah insolated occurrence, or to 
the recollection of a single person, there might be room to 
suspect error or misapprehension. But as the evidence now 
comes before us, it is derived from different sources, fixed at 
different times and places, proceeding through channels hav- 
ing no relation to each other, and yet essentially confirming 
the same fact. It would be difficult to collect human testi- 
mony in a manner less exposed to uncertainty, or from its 
character demanding more implicit faith. 

Mr Morris was chairman of the Canal Commissioners, from 
the time of their first appointment in March, 1810, till wiihin 
a few months of his death. Within this period four reports 
were made on the subject to the legislature of New York, the 
three first of which were from his pen.* He also went with 



* The fourth report was drafted by Mr Morris, but it was suppressed 
by the Commissioners, and another substituted in its place. Dr Ho- 
sack quotes remarks from the manuscripts of Thomas Eddy, one of the 
Commissioners, written in no very kindly spirit towards Mr Morris, 
and containing, besides, some errors of importance. Mr Morris wns 
unable to meet the Comrnisio tiers in New York to consult on the re- 
port, and at their request the draft was sent to them. Mr Eddy says 
this was the draft of the 'third report,' and moreover that it was 
returned to Mr Morris, after the Commissioners had read it, ' with re- 
spectful observations proposing amendments.' In the first place, it 
was the draft of the fourth report that was thus sent to the Commis- 
sioners ; and, in the next place, it was never returned at all, nor has it 
since been found. 

To show that Mr Eddy's impressions, in regard to Mr Morris at this 
time, were not exactly of the complexion, which might be supposed 
from the perusal of his notes, published by Dr Hosack, (Life of Clinton, 



502 



LIFE OF 



Mr Clinton on a special mission to Washington, for the pur- 
pose of obtaining aid from the United States towards the con- 
struction of the Erie Canal. The report detailing the partic- 
ulars of this mission was written by him, as also the draft of a 
bill, intended for the adoption of Congress, granting lands for 
a magnificent system of inland navigation throughout the Uni- 
ted States. The bjll was never brought up, nor was the ap- 
plication to Congress attended with any success. There were 
too many divided intetests in that body, if there had not been 
other obstacles of perhaps greater moment, to permit them to 
legislate on so grand and comprehensive a scale, as that con- 
templated in Mr Morris's bill. The object was to provide 
for connecting the principal waters of the United States by ca- 
nals, and to assign a proportionate quantity of new land to 
eacii State, as a fund for effecting these works within their 
respective limits. 

During the six last years of Mr Morris's life, his thoughts 
and his time were incessantly occupied with this business of 
the Erie Canal, not more in discharging his duties as a com- 
missioner to their full extent, than in devising preliminary and 
incidental means for advancing the enterprise. He sought 



p. 271,) it will be enough to cite a passage from one of his letters. 
After the draft had been submitted to the Commissioners, Mr Morris 
thought he had reason to be dissatisfied with Mr Eddy's proceedings 
in the matter, and hinted this in a letter to them. Thereupon Mr Ed- 
dy wrote him an explanation, dated March 15th, 1816, at the conclu- 
of which he says ; 

'I most extremely regret, that my meaning and intentions should be 
BO expressed, as to induce thee to suppose me capable of harboring 
sentiments the least disrespectful, or in any way showing a want of 
attachment to thee. I have received so many proofs of thy affectionate 
regard and kindness, that I cannot forbear endeavoring to do away 
from thy mind any unpleasant feelings towards me. I can only add, 
that my esteem for thee and my desire to retain thy friendship are not 
of a common kind, and that the warmest wish of my heart is, that thou 
mayest enjoy every blessing in this life, and everlasting happiness in 
the next. This is the sincere prayer of thy affectionate friend,' 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 503 

knowledge from able and skilful engineers, from the results of 
long experiments in other countries, from the aids of science, 
and from personal observation. He examined minutely all 
the surveys, that were made from time to time, entered into 
complicated calculations on the motion, pressure, absorption, 
and evaporation of water, as depending on the quality of the 
soil and position of the canal route ; he formed estimates, not 
less complicated and difficult, respecting the cost of excavations, 
embankments, aqueducts, and lockage ; in short, there were 
no details, which he did not thoroughly investigate, and sub- 
ject to the scrutiny of his judgment. His two first reports 
to the legislature are very able documents, indicating at the 
same time a profound knowledge of the subject, and an un- 
common enlargement of mind and foresight. Mr Bleecker 
has well and truly observed, that ' what he then prophesied is 
now become history.' His remarks on the internal commerce 
of the United States, as connected with the Atlantic and with 
Canada, and as ultimately affecting our national improvement 
and prosperity, are the dictates of wisdom, the fruits of a la- 
borious inquiry concerning the physical structure and resour- 
ces of the country, and of a deep search into the causes, 
which carry forward the intercourse, growth, and refinement 
of society. 

His original idea was that of a canal on an inclined plane, 
provided a uniform descent could be found, which he believed 
not improbable. By this plan the expense of locks, and the 
delay in passing through them, would be saved. Some oth- 
er advantages he also supposed would attend it. But after 
the surveys were completed, he saw its impracticability, and 
abandoned his scheme. When he wrote his second report, he 
seems still to have harbored the belief, that sections of the 
canal might be constructed on that principle, and connected 
by locks at the necessary points. No doubt this was practi- 
cable, but the general opinion turned against its expediency. 
Those, who opposed the canal, either from ignorance, preju-

dice, interested motives, the spirit of party, or any other 
cause, raised a clamor about this unluckly suggestion of an 
inclined plane, which operated unfavorably to the Commis- 
sioners, and especially to Mr Morris, with whom it was known 
to have originated. But it was a clamor without any just 
grounds. The scheme was held out only while the surveys 
were going on, and no attempts were ever made or advised 
for putting it actually in execution. It was a subject of in- 
quiry, and as such it contributed to waken public attention, 
elicit discussion, draw out facts, and excite interest. When 
the surveys were finished, the face of the country understood, 
and all requisite knowledge obtained, the notion of an inclined 
plane vanished from the mind even of its author, and there it 
ended. 

In the midst of these useful labors for the public, and the 
busy pursuits of his private affairs, the earthly career of him, 
whom we have followed through the scenes of a varied and 
eventful life, was drawing fast to a close. His health had 
retained its usual vigor, assailed only by occasional attacks of 
his early and tenacious malady, the gout, till he was seized 
with a sudden illness, which proved mortal, and caused his 
death on the sixth of November, 1816, in the sixty-fifth year 
of his age. His faculties remained unimpaired to the last, 
and he was fully acquainted with the fatal tendency of his dis- 
order, for several days previous to his dissolution. His mind 
was tranquil and collected. He conversed freely, sometimes 
cheerfully, with those around him, till he expired. His re- 
mains were interred on his own estate at Morrisania.* 

In his person Mr Morris was tall, well proportioned, and of 
a commanding figure ; his features oval, regular, handsome and

expressive ; his demeanor frank and dignified. His charac- 
ter has been sketched by Madame de Damas, a French lady, 
with so discriminating a hand, that some of the lineaments of 
her portrait may justly claim a place in these pages. Madame 
de Damas was intimately acquainted with Mr Morris, during 
his residence in France. She took refuge in his house at 
Sainport, at the time of the bloody horrors in the Capital, and 
was dragged from that sanctuary to prison, against the remon- 
strance of the American Minister, but was ultimately released. 
In her sketch of the character of a benefactor, some allowance 
should probably be made for the warmth of gratitude, and the 
range of fancy natural to a gifted female pen. But she de-

scribes impressions, the result of a close and continued obser- 
vation, and in their spirit they are doubtless correct. 

' I attempt to delineate the character of a man,' says Madame 
de Damas, ' who so little resembles other men, that one should 
hardly say anything of him, which has already been said of 
them. Like others, however, he has virtues, defects, and tal- 
ents, but their nature, their use, mixture, and results, form a 
whole entirely different from anything I have seen. Were I 
called upon to distinguish him by a single trait, I should say, 
he is good. They, who do not well understand the meaning of 
these words, may not be satisfied ; but as for me, who include 
much in the term goodness, and who have seen the exercise 
of this virtue in every action of Mr Morris's life, I repeat, that 
it is this, which gives him the first place in all honest hearts, 
and entitles him to their lasting admiration and gratitude. The 
love of order is his strongest passion, the rule of all his acts, 
the aim of all he utters. A true philanthropist by the natural 
impulse of his soul, he considers every object under the pos- 
sibility of its becoming useful. His penetrating, elevated, 
quick, and luminous mind, is never idle, and he constantly 
employs his numerous and diversified attainments, either in 
doing good, or inspiring in others the love of goodness. I 
have never known a person to approach Mr Morris, whatever 
might be his intentions, circumstances, or situation, who did 
not on leaving him find himself enriched by his gifts, or enlight- 
ened by his counsels; who did not feel grateful for some sooth- 
ing consolations, a profitable hint, or a kind reception. 

' He is charged with some faults by his friends. So much 
enlargement of soul may not Be compatible with a quick sen- 
sibility, yet one cannot help regretting, that reason and wis- 
dom should assume a control so powerful over his feelings. 
Brought up with the almost rustic freedom of a republican 
country, he is remarkable for great simplicity of manners, sus- 
tained by a nobleness, which has its seat in his soul, but ting- 
ed with a slight shade of self complacency. If I eulogize him,

seek not to weaken defects, which, after all, may be no other 
than qualities litile in fashion with us. We call him self com- 
placent, because it is our custom to expect, that every one 
will abase himself to procure elevation, and that merit shall 
wait for its place to be assigned, instead of taking it. Mr 
Morris knows his proper station, and assumes it ; sacrificing 
no person to himself in secret design, and in reality sacrificing 
himself to no other ; thus, inattentive to the petty tokens of 
complaisance, which self-love dictates in our social intercourse, 
he sometimes offends those, who expect and demand them, 
He is fond of his ease, does his best to procure it, and enjoys 
it as much as possible. He loves good cheer, good wine, 
good company. His senses, as well as his mind, have a high 
relish of perfection, and strive to attain it. He never eats a 
bad dinner, without a severe censure upon the cook, as he 
never listens to folly without a keen rebuke. A little dissim- 
ulation would save him from many harmless enemies, who are 
not more to be regarded, however, than the small faults, 
which excite their enmity ; but every species of deception, 
from whatever motive, is incompatible with the elevation, in- 
tegrity, and frankness of the man, whom I delineate. 

'One of his most remarkable, and, if I may so say, one of 
his fundamental qualities, is his regard for truth, so constant, 
so absolute, so scrupulous, that it might seem carried to an 
exaggeration, were it not for the importance of its principle. 
Never, under any circumstances, in the excitement of an ani- 
mated story, or in the lively flow of pleasantry, does a word 
escape him, not a single word, that is not strictly conformable 
to truth. He has no conception of the pliancy of truth ; he 
yields to her on all occasions, because nothing is more beauti- 
ful in his eyes than truth ; and because, also, a mind so much 
enlightened by her rays, so capable of discovering her charms 
and extending her reign, is naturally inclined to uphold and 
defend her. 

' At the same time, how superior is he to that puerile vani- 
ty, which pretends to know all things, and to that fear of 



508 LIFE OF 

seeming ignorant, which aims to display universal intelligence. 
He asserts a fact, and shows without ostentation, that it can- 
not be doubted ; again, in the same tone, he confesses his ig- 
norance, when he is as well informed perhaps as most men 
on the subject. No wonder, then, that he should bear with 
an ill grace a doubt, or an objection, in regard to what he 
delivers as the result of his settled conviction. He knows 
his own powers, and, perceiving that his mind runs far ahead 
of his antagonist, he will condemn him as presumptuous, be- 
fore he refutes him as absurd. His refutation is made in few 
words, so clear, so concise, so evident, that commonly it is im- 
possible to reply. But, alas ! the pleasure of being enlighten- 
ed rarely heals the wounds of defeat. 

' If, instead of a simple error, an opinion is ventured in his 
presence offensive to religion, good morals, or sound political 
principles, it is no longer a regard for truth alone, it is the pas- 
sion of virtue, the ardor of justice, the love of humanity, which 
inflame his generous soul. His language, always correct and 
nervous, in whatever tongue he speaks, becomes eloquent, an- 
imated, vehement ; he resists a false principle with as much 
pertinacity, as the crimes to which it leads ; he attacks and 
beats down that immorality, which is destructive of the order 
he loves and maintains ; he combats every sophism dangerous 
to society, with the same warmth of feeling, the same power 
of argument, which have directed his meditations to the happi- 
ness of man, and given him so much zeal, and so many facili- 
ties, for aiding to secure on a solid basis the lasting prosperity 
of his country. 

' Superficial observers, and they are numerous, might be 
acquainted with Mr Morris for years, without discovering his 
most eminent qualities. Such observers must be told what 
to admire. They will never perceive greatness, in things per- 
formed without boast and without effort. They regard Mr 
Morris as a profound politician, the most amiable and the most 
gifted of men, and this is truly no feeble eulogium, but nothing 
really worthy of him will be said by any one, who does not as-

cend to the source of all that is great and excellent in his 
character. The idea of a Deity always present, the habit of 
contemplating him In his works, of imitating his goodness, of 
submitting to his will with that calm resignation, which arises 
from a belief that God can will nothing but what is good ; 
such is the fountain from which his soul derives a confidence 
full of serenity, a boundless charity, and a hope, which he re- 
gards both as a homage and a duty, and which in him seems 
to derive unceasing light from some benignant star, that 
brightens his whole happy disposition. Ever at peace with 
himself, ever attentive to the great laws of the universe, sel- 
dom ruffled in his temper, not suffering men or events to have 
a mastery over his spirit, he is habitually serene, alike ready 
to engage in the most abstruse inquiries, or to join in the trifles 
of social amusement. His imagination inclines to pleasantry, 
and being abundantly gifted with what the English call humor, 
united to what the French name esprit, it is impossible not to 
be delighted by his ingenious combinations, the originality of 
his ideas, the flashes of his colloquial wit, and the good taste 
and natural cheerfulness, which pervade and embellish what- 
ever he says. Though ridicule sometimes provokes his satiri- 
cal mirth, he never extends it to vice ; this would be show- 
ing it a sort of concession ; but he hates vice, he glows with 
an honest indignation at its sight, he would sooner punish than 
ridicule it. 

' He has a fine and disciplined taste for poetry, and is him- 
self a poet ; but it is by mere chance that he recites any of his 
verses, and he has published nothing in that way. His insati- 
able memory retains everything. Shakspeare, Pope, Dryden, 
Milton, have composed nothing beautiful, which is not known 
to him; and, indeed, the poetical temperament is visible in 
his whole conversation. The melodious tones of his voice, the 
variety and justness of its inflexions, the grace and energy of 
his utterance, produce such an agreeable illusion, that I have 
often sought in vain for that, which had so much enchanted me 

43* 



510 LIFE OF 

in the book he had been reading ; it scarecely contained the 
same ideas ; the words wanted the melody and the music. 

' A characteristic trait, which I must not forget, is his fac- 
ulty and habit of applying his mind to a single object, of sud- 
denly collecting the whole force of his attention upon one 
point. It is in this manner, that he learns nothing imperfect- 
ly ; that all his ideas are simple, fixed, complete ; that when 
he converses upon any subject, it would seem as if his thoughts 
have always been occupied upon that alone. How often have 
I seen persons, of different conditions and professions, felicitate 
themselves on having consulted him on a point, which they, 
considered precisely the one in which he was best informed. 
Nature treats only her favorites with such a liberality of 
means. 

'I will yet follow Mr Morris for a moment into the retired 
life of rural solitude, where he is still more at home, and hap- 
pier. Solitude, did I say ? Ah, no, for nowhere is he more 
surrounded, nowhere more beneficent, occupied, active, prod- 
igal of his manifold acquirements, nowhere does he labor more 
or enjoy more. Agriculture becomes the chief science of the 
legislator ; not content with simply honoring and encouraging 
it, he applies to it his closest attention and devoted study, and 
employs in it the discoveries of art. He has neglected none of 
its branches; he manages a farm with the same talent, and with 
more pleasure, than he presides in the councils of state. He 
combines practice and theory, and is a stranger to none of the 
details. The names and qualities of grains, trees, and plants ; 
the divers kinds of culture adapted to each ; the preparation of 
soils, choice of positions, observation of the seasons, the man- 
ner of counteracting their vicissitudes, the means of hastening 
and multiplying products, and of varying them so as to pre- 
serve the fertility of the soil without exhaustion ; in one word, 
from the greatest labors of the harvest, to the attentions re- 
quired by the poorest vegetable, nothing escapes his notice and 
care ; more happy in providing for the increase of a crop, than 
in tra; ing plans by which battles are to be gained; and as con- 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 511 

tented in the midst of the rude peasantry at Sainport, whom 
he instructs and assists, as he ever has heer. in the brilliant cir- 
cles of Versailles and of Paris. 

' Sometimes when I had supposed him engaged in deep 
thoughts on the great principles of social organization, or im- 
parting to his government new lights respecting the political 
state of Europe, I have found that he had spent the morning 
in superintending his tillage, in sowing seeds, or assisting in the 
harvest ; alike simple, useful, and great, whether acting a part 
in the revolutionary struggles of his country, or enjoying life in 
his tranquil retirement at Sainport ; alike active in doing as 
much good as possible, and in obeying that noble precept of 
Marcus Aurelius, " not to leave any interval between one good 
action and another." A legislator in the New World, an Am- 
bassador in France, everywhere a man of genius, possessing a 
wise and enlightened mind, a faithful, fearless, and unchangea- 
ble friend, an indulgent and liberal master, an amiable and so- 
cial companion, a support to the feeble, the resource of the 
indigent, the vindicator of justice, he is the model and the ob- 
ject of love to all good men. 

'As he always appears in his true character, without con- 
cealment or hypocrisy, I may observe, that he puts a value on 
all the conveniences, comforts, and pleasures of life, the advan- 
tages of fortune, the enjoyments of the arts, and the charms of 
society. He conceives it to be following the order of Provi- 
dence to enjoy all its gifts. " To enjoy is to obey." And up- 
on the same principle he submits, with a modest fortitude, and 
sincere resignation, to the ills inflicted by the same hand. But 
where should I stop, if 1 were to reveal all the delicate, gener- 
ous, and magnanimous acts, which I have witnessed, and the 
disclosure of which he would never forgive ? This por- 
trait is perhaps already too long, if compared with other por- 
traits. But with what man is he to be compared, whom I de- 
scribe ? In this kind of composition, some writers seek to force 
admiration by surprise, while others, with a blaze of splendid 
qualities, would conceal defects not less striking ; but I could 



512 LIFE OF 

never do justice to Mr Morris, except by representing him as 
he is, in the accordance of his principles and his virtues. 
Some write, also, to gain applause for themselves, but I have 
only poured out the overflowings of a heart filled with esteem, 
veneration, and gratitude.' 

This picture is highly colored, and in the strain of French 
panegyric, but it is drawn with a skilful hand, and the features, 
though glaring, are unquestionably characteristic and in the 
outline true. The manuscript, from which the above sketches 
have been translated, bears the date of May, 1795, the year 
following that of Mr Morris's leaving France. About four 
years afterwards, when he had returned to America, the por- 
trait was sent to him by the fair authoress herself, at the re- 
quest, as she says, of a mutual friend. It seems proper to in- 
sert here, also, an extract from the letter accompanying it, 
which was written in English, and which shows, that Madame 
de Damas's talent for good writing was not confined to exhi- 
bitions of it in her native tongue. 

1 I enclose a character ,' she says ' written long since, and 
which falls so short of my opinion of the original, that I should 
not have offered it to your perusal, if J. had not earnestly 
required it, as a part of that implicit confidence, that follows 
true friendship. Whatever you may think of that imperfect 
sketch, a paragraph of it I shall particularly insist upon. You 
have allowed me to write with the affectionate freedom of a 
friend ; do not call me bold, or ridiculous, if I pretend to give, 
as I often beg, advice. I am a real friend, proud of the title, 
and I only aim at acting up to it. As such, I will go on to 
urge a subject rather delicate, but in which some part of your 
happiness may be concerned. That point of view gives me 
courage to proceed. 

' This character contains but a few of the many eminent 
qualities, God was pleased to lavish on you, but one slight 
fault I could not help mentioning, and I require your serious 
attention to the part marked with a cross. That cross I have 
traced with a pencil, that it may be easily rubbed off, as I 






GOUVERNECR MORRIS. 513 

trust that little blemish will soon be removed, if you think it 
worth your while to set about it. People of weak minds, and 
many they are, feel the more shocked, at being told of their infe- 
riority, as they cannot help being sensible of it, and the com- 
plaints of a crowd, though consisting of fools, are often hurtful to 
the wise. Mistake me not ; I do not suspect your intention 
is to mortify any body's pride ; I only remark that you do it, 
though unwillingly. A point I would earnestly wish you to ob- 
serve in your conduct is, suaviterin modo,fortiterin re. True 
greatness is generous, and your benevolent soul must be used to 
indulge faults you are free from ; it is your delight to assuage 
or relieve miseries ; there is one I recommend to your notice. 
Such condescension is not inconsistent with dignity, nor is it 
more, in many cases, than to suffer a silly creature to say silly 
things, without expressing your cutting contempt and disap- 
probation. By so doing, you do not correct one, and you ir- 
ritate thousands, who certainly will not allow the rebuke to be 
merited, and will spread their discontent at the manner it was 
delivered. But I grow as tedious as I am impertinent, and 
should tear this to pieces, were I not persuaded your friend- 
ship will forgive what mine has dictated. At all events, I 
offer you a fair opportunity to display the kindness I recom- 
mend, and to prove yourself the most indulgent of men, as per- 
haps you will think me the pertest of women.' 

These are broad hints at a prevailing defect in Mr Morris's 
manners, which, it is believed, neither the counsels, almost 
admonitions, of his friend, nor the weight of his own reflec- 
tions, contributed to remove or diminish. It was an inborn 
weakness, which could only be eradicated by a change of na- 
ture. His acute powers of mind, a thorough consciousness of 
his own strength, and his quick sense of the ridiculous, joined 
to a lofty independence of thought, often betrayed him into a 
forwardness of manner, a license of expression, and an indul- 
gence of his humor, little suited to soothe the pride, or flatter 
the vanity, or foster the self-love, or win the esteem of those 
about him. He might dazzle by his genius, surprise by his 



514 LIFE OF 

novel flights of fancy, amuse by his wit, and confound by his 
arguments, and thus extort the tribute of admiration, but fail 
in gaining the willing applause of love. No man was better 
acquainted with the forms and etiquette of society, none had 
moved more widely in the circles of fashion and rank, or exam- 
ined with a keener scrutiny the deep fountains of the human 
passions, or knew better how to touch the springs of men's 
motives, yet this rare intuition, this more rare experience, and 
this great knowledge, did little towards modifying the tenden- 
cies of his nature, or diverting the first bent of his mind. He 
was sometimes overbearing in conversation. At any rate, when 
he spoke, he expected to be heard. There is an anecdote 
illustrative of this point. At a breakfast table he was in close 
conversation with a gentleman, to whose harangue he had lis- 
tened patiently, till it was his turn to reply. He began ac- 
cordingly, but the gentleman was inattentive, and a bad listen- 
er. ' Sir,' said Mr Morris, ' if you will not attend to my ar- 
gument, I will address myself to the tea-pot,' and went on 
with much animation of tone and gesture, making the tea-pot 
the representative of his opponent, till he had finished his 
replication. 

But this defect, after all, was only a spot on the surface. 
It did not penetrate the substance, nor taint any interior fee- 
ling. It was in fact no more than the excess of some of the 
higher qualities, not duly balanced by others, which are liule 
valued or esteemed. It was independence, frankness, self re- 
spect, without the usual mixture of cautious reserve, forbear- 
ance, and timidity. It was boldness without hypocrisy, con- 
fidence without fear, and dignity without dissimulation. It did 
not touch the heart. The noble and generous virtues bloom- 
ed luxuriantly, and bore rich and abundant fruit. It marred 
no principle. Justice, truth, charity, integrity, honor, held an 
uncontrolled empire in his soul, and never lost their influence 
or authority. 

In his style of living he was fond of a display, which might 
perhaps be called luxury, and, in his travelling excursions, his 



GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 515 

preparations for ease and comfort, particularly for the enjoy- 
ments of the table, commonly attracted notice. But in this 
there were no extremes nor extravagances, no ostentatious pa- 
rade of wealth or grandeur. He had formed a plan of life, which 
he deemed suitable to his disposition, and within his means of 
attainment, embracing all that could gratify reasonable desires, 
and fill up an adequate measure of happiness. This plan he 
pursued methodically, and with a philosophical temperament, 
contented that his wishes were realized and his object gained. 
Although his expenses were on a liberal scale, they were uni- 
form, and his habits of economy were rigid and exact. While in 
Europe he kept a daily record of his expenditures, noting down 
each day in a small book, kept for the purpose, every item of 
expense, even for the most trifling article. Some persons have 
wondered how he accumulated his property, but whoever will 
pursue him through the details of his affairs, and observe with 
what minute attention and unwearied industry he devoted him- 
self to business, and the multiplied and extensive operations 
in which he was concerned for many years, will wonder no 
longer. His financial skill, his talents and knowledge of the 
world, combined with his uncommon opportunities, his power 
of application, his principles and practice of economy, are 
enough, and more than enough, to explain all the mystery that 
could hang over that subject, if it needed any explanation. 
There are many volumes of letter books on matters of busi- 
ness, and wholly in his own hand-writing, which unfold a se- 
ries of enterprises, commercial schemes and transactions in 
various countries, and from which may be gathered a detailed 
history of the sources of his wealth, and the progress of its ac- 
quisition. 

But the chief basis of Mr Morris's property was his success- 
ful speculations in new lands, continued for a long term of 
years. Under favorable circumstances, and at a time when 
these lands bore a low price, he made large purchases, and 
the rapid increase of their value produced great and accu- 
mulating profits upon the first investments. His foresight, 



516 LIFE OP 

knowledge of affairs, and judicious management, promoted his 
good fortune, and enabled him to escape the disasters, which 
befel too many, who entered inconsiderately and deeply into 
land speculations. 

The examples already cited in this memoir bear testimony 
to his noble spirit of generosity. Others might be adduced, 
which, if less extensive, are not less creditable. ' He had 
always a great aversion,' says a gentleman who knew him 
well, 'to speak of his own affairs, except to those whom they 
immediately concerned, and when he rendered a service to 
any one, he kept it still more secret.' His situation in France 
exposed him to numerous calls on the exercise of this virtue. 
Many, who had been his friends, were deprived of their proper- 
ty, and thrown into prison, or, equally destitute, were compelled 
to leave their country, and depend on the bounty of strangers. 
Among those, not a few were relieved by his liberality. To a 
lady of rank, who, as an emigrant from France, had lost every- 
thing, and taken refuge in Berlin, he sent fifty louis d'ors, say- 
ing to her in the letter enclosing the money ; ' Should fortune 
be propitious, you can return the amount, but, if not, allow 
me the consolation of believing, that I have soothed for one 
moment your afflictions.' Besides the instances of this kind, 
the notes of acknowledgment and gratitude, written by vari- 
ous persons in distress, prove the frequency of his acts of 
kindness, the sincerity of his friendship, and the diffusive 
warmth of his benevolence. 

As a politician, Mr Morris will of course be judged differ- 
ently by different persons, according to the origin of their im- 
pressions, and the bias of their sentiments. The decided tone 
of his opinions, and the deep tinge of party, which they im- 
bibed, in common with those of all his countrymen, on one side 
or the other, at a time of great national excitement, will pre- 
vent their being viewed, for the present at. least, with perfect 
impartiality. But his strong attachment to his country, and 
desire to advance its highest honor and best interests, the 
constancy of his efforts to this end, and the rectitude of his 






GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 517 

purposes, will never be doubted nor undervalued. No man ever 
acted less from the influence of selfish aims, or with more 
freedom from disguise, or a more fearless independence. Near 
the close of his life, he lamented the heats and divisions, which 
had inflamed the minds of men, and endangered the internal 
peace and safety of the nation. ' Let us forget party,' said 
he, ' and think of our country. That country embraces both 
parties. We must endeavor, therefore, to serve and benefit 
both. This cannot be effected, while political delusions array 
good men against each other.' These are the counsels of 
wisdom arid experience, the dictates of patriotism, and consist- 
ent with the uniform principles of their author. Regard him as 
we may, the name of Mr Morris must ever hold an elevated 
place on the list of those, whom their country will delight to 
honor for their talents, and as the patriots by whose services 
and virtues its freedom has been achieved, and its glory estab- 
lished.
