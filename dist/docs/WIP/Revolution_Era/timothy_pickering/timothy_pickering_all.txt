HONOURED SIR : It is the common opinion of people 
that to play a game at cards is (almost) an unpardonable 
crime. But what renders it more odious than other diver 
sions ? Is it because more time is spent in it than in other 
diversions ? But why is more time spent ? Because this is 
a pleasanter and more sociable entertainment. And what 
makes it so entertaining in general is, that less pains and 
care need be used than in some other diversions ; whereas 
in playing checkers, instead of unbending the mind, after 
its labour, there is more thought and care to be used, and 
so can be no relief to the tired intellect. Besides, it is 
a dull, unsociable business ; and a stranger would rather 
think they were exercised with a fit of the spleen, than 
a diversion, to see them poring upon a piece of board, 
and looking with as much intenseness of thought as if 
the fate of empires depended upon the right forming 
their plan. 
</p><p>
People are apt to say that cards, as it were, intoxicate 
those that use them, and that thereby they squander away 
their money ; that they are a thief of time ; are apt to raise 
disputes, &c. But what one thing is there which may not 
be used to excess? Are not other diversions subject to 
the same evils, if practised beyond measure and prudence? 
Why then so great an outcry against cards, as if they were 
the only evil? Even the diversion of checkers may be 
abused ; and may persons game and spend their time and 
money at one, so may they at the other. 
</p><p>
I would not forget to acquaint you, Sir, that you were 
misinformed with regard to my playing cards ; and am sorry 
I have been the cause (through the ignorance of that block 
head) of any trouble or uneasiness in the breast of so kind, 
so loving a father, from whom any gentle admonitions, 
reproofs, or advice would be received with that respect 
and regard due to so affectionate a father by your dutiful son, 
</p><p>
TIMO. PICKERING.

SIR : 
</p><p>
An application so late as this will not, I hope, be 
deemed to arise from a want of respect, or be productive of any disadvantage to me ; nor an address in writing 
thought less decent than a personal one. The latter I have 
sometimes supposed most proper, but several reasons determined me to make the former. In that way I can deliver 
my sentiments more clearly; and (if they merit consideration) they may be considered more calmly and deliberately. 
Besides, the request may be granted or denied with more 
ease both to the petitioner and the judge ; for to a benevolent mind it must give pain to refuse even what ought to be 
refused; and a man of liberal and generous sentiments 
would choose rather that his justice or his bounty should be 
manifested in his actions, than in the warmest professions 
of favor or friendship. 
</p><p>
You must, Sir, ere now apprehend the design of this 
letter, if you have never heard that I am desirous of being 
appointed joint Clerk with Mr. Bowditch. This, I find, 
would be agreeable to him, and, if I had his leave, would 
urge it as an argument in my favor. I am sensible, Sir, 
there are other candidates for the office, who have doubtless 
severally importuned your favor in their behalf. But permit me, Sir, to say, that I know but one case in which favor 
can properly take place : that is, where there are two or 
more candidates of exactly similar pretensions, whose qualifications and circumstances are in nothing different. In any 
other case, to ask the office as a matter of favor I should 
think was paying but an ill compliment to the person 
requested to grant it ; for it must impeach either his 
understanding or his justice. The power of conferring this 
office, I take it, is vested in the Judges, not to give them 
an opportunity of gratifying a friend or favorite, but that 
they should place it in such hands as are most likely to do 
the public the best service, by an exact and diligent performance of the duties of it. 
</p><p>
Can you forgive this freedom, Sir? I own it is a style 
unusual from the mouth of a petitioner. But should I 
address an honest man of delicate sentiments with fawning 
adulation and servile importunity ? Or should I be thought 
vain, were I to confess myself incapable of using such contemptible means of supplying my wants? Good Sir, after 
your voluntary, disinterested interposition in my favor in 
a military concern, (for which I sincerely honor and thank 
you,) I should esteem it a gross affront with servile sub 
mission to sue to you for the office as a matter of favor, 
except in the case before mentioned. Here, therefore, both 
for your honor and my own, I choose to rest the matter; 
and with your determination, be it for or against me, I shall 
remain satisfied. I request the office merely to procure me 
a living, not to add to thousands already in possession. In 
my present situation, I must own, I have enough ; but 
without more I shall for ever be excluded from the dearest 
connection in life. Excuse, I pray you, this liberty; and 
believe me to be, with sincere respect, your most obedient 
</p><p>
servant.

SIR : I have just received your letter, dated at Salem

</p><p>
DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
It will he agreeable to you to have an authentic account 
of the recent transactions in this town. 
Last Saturday notifications were posted up in many 
places of the town, by order of the Committee of Correspondence, desiring the inhabitants to assemble at the town- 
house yesterday morning at nine o clock. . . . At eight 
o clock, I received a letter from the Secretary, informing 
me that it was his Excellency the Governor's f desire, that 
I and the rest of the Committee of Correspondence would 
meet him at Colonel Browne's, for he had something of 
importance to communicate to us. We waited on him there 
at nine o clock, as requested. He first asked us if we 
avowed the printed notifications for the meeting of the 
inhabitants at that time. Captain [Richard] Derby, Jr., 
answered in the affirmative. Says the Governor, As you 
assembled the people, tis your duty to disperse them ; you 
are the source, and must abide the consequences. Captain 
Derby replied, Now the people are assembled, they will 
act as they think best. We cannot oblige them to disperse. 
The Governor declared it was an unlawful meeting, for 
the seditious purpose of opposing an act of Parliament. 
Captain Derby answered, Neither we nor the people 
thought we were opposing even an act of Parliament, much 
less the laws of the Province. Says the Governor, I am 
not going to enter into a conversation about the matter, or 
to determine quirks of law; the Attorney-General and 
Colonel Browne (they were present, as well as the Secretary) will inform (or answer) you there. I came here to 
execute the laws, (or acts of Parliament, I forget which,) 
and I am determined to do it. Some other things passed, 
but not material, and the Governor concluded thus: I 
desire you to disperse the meeting of the inhabitants ; if 
they disregard you, the Sheriff will go first; and if they do 
not then disperse, and he needs support, I will support him, 
and the people must abide the consequences. The Governor 
appeared almost the whole time in an indecent passion, and 
uttered the closing sentence with much vehemence. I was 
told by Dr. Holten, yesterday, that the Governor had 110 
rest from the time our notification appeared, scarcely sitting 
half an hour in a day. The Attorney-General and the 
High Sheriff were specially summoned for the purpose, and 
orders were given to the regiment to be in order, who, 
accordingly, equipped themselves as if for battle, and 
marched from their encampment near our fort to the Neck 
gate, where the main body (there are but about three hundred men, and about as many women and children) halted 
and loaded ; then about eighty marched up street, almost 
to brother Williams's. But before this movement of the 
soldiers was known, and whilst we were in at Colonel Browne's, the inhabitants, being assembled at the town- 
house, transacted all the business of the meeting, which 
was merely to choose delegates f for a county meeting to 
be held at Ipswich, on the 6th of September next, and 
were actually broke up before we got to the town-house. 
To-day Colonel Frye, by express orders from the Governor, 
issued a warrant for apprehending the members of the Committee of Correspondence, who ordered the notifications to 
be posted. These were Captain Richard Manning, brother 
Williams, Mr. Jonathan Ropes, Jonathan Gardner, Jr., Mr. Sprague, and myself. Mr. Warwick Palfray was also 
included, though not then present. Captain Derby was 
omitted, being absent through indisposition ; but he had 
expressly desired his brother Gardner to inform the Committee that he was for having a town-meeting. The High 
Sheriff first came and arrested me. I went with him to Frye's. Mr. Sprague came up, and the Sheriff arrested 
him also. Frye told us all that was required was this, 
that we should each recognize in 100, without sureties, 
to appear at the next Superior Court, to be held at Salem 
the first Tuesday in November, to answer to the charge 
against us in the warrant ; which was, for unlawfully and 
seditiously assembling the people without leave from the 
Governor, contrary to the laws and the statute in that case 
lately made and provided. Mr. Sprague asked me what 
was best to be done. I told him I thought we had better 
recognize, which we did. My motives were these : I could 
conceive no prejudice would arise to the cause in complying 
so far. The warrant was issued and executed by lawful 
officers. We need be under no apprehensions of being convicted of any crime, because the juries will be appointed as 
heretofore ; (for I think it clear that no jury can be appointed agreeably to the act, in this county, till next March 
term, and perhaps not till next March twelve months;) or 
if a jury should be packed, (which is scarce possible,) and 
we convicted, we should then have ample reason for a refusal of submission. If we opposed now, and the Governor 
should persist in his attempts to execute the laws, a tumult 
and carnage must ensue ; for the people are exasperated to 
a high degree. These were the reasons I gave the rest of 
the Committee ; and, although they at first thought it would 
have been best to have refused to enter into recognizance, 
yet they appeared entirely to acquiesce, (for the reasons I 
gave,) and I supposed that, when arrested, they would recognize without hesitation. But they have since refused 
before the Justice, Frye, who immediately, I am told, 
posted off to the Governor to inform him of it. They told Frye, however, that they should be ready again to appear 
before him, if summoned. The Governor, I doubt not, 
will pursue the matter ; but I am inclined to think they will 
comply, for the reasons above mentioned, which I shall urge 
this evening at our meeting."

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
The account you gave me this morning of the false tales 
spread abroad in New Hampshire, especially in the remoter 
towns, where correct information is not easy to be had, 
induces me to present to you my correspondence with Governor Sullivan, in which I have stated the circumstances 
respecting my conduct on the day of the battle of <a href='/results.php?city=lexington' rel='city'>Lexington</a>, not a syllable of which, to my knowledge, has ever 
been contradicted ; and which, indeed, numbers yet living of 
my townsmen of Salem know to be true, some of whom are 
Democrats, and would eagerly have seized on any misstatement, if I had made any. 
</p><p>
In page 26 of my letter to Governor Sullivan, I mention the winter campaign of <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a> -77 with the Massachusetts 
militia. The quota of Salem consisted wholly of volunteers. 
Upon notice, the militia assembled in the meeting-house in 
Salem (now Dr. Prince s). I went into the pulpit and 
addressed them, stating the critical situation of our public 
affairs, the necessity of reenforcing the army, the enlistments of the troops then expiring, and that it was at 
such a time of difficulty and danger that the real patriot 
would show his zeal and devotion to his country. I 
then concluded my speech (which was extempore) in this 
manner : 
</p><p>
In urging you, fellow-citizens and soldiers, to volunteer your services on this occasion, I have no thought of 
excusing myself; I will go with you, and partake of all the 
hardships, as well as the dangers, of a winter campaign. 
I then left the pulpit, and marched round the aisles of the 
meeting-house,* and in a few minutes was followed by up 
wards of sixty f of my townsmen (many of them masters of 
vessels) , rather more than the town's quota. The county 
of Essex furnished a regiment of a little more than seven 
hundred men, who marched under my command as Colonel, 
and performed the campaign in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and New Jersey. 
The following questions are obvious to be asked : 
</p><p>
I. If I had shown any signs of cowardice on the day of 
the battle of <a href='/results.php?city=lexington' rel='city'>Lexington</a>, would my townsmen, who were 
with me that day, and others who knew all that passed, 
have turned out as volunteers, the next year, to make a campaign under my command ? 
II. If my conduct was blamable on the day of the battle 
of <a href='/results.php?city=lexington' rel='city'>Lexington</a>, as now, for party purposes, is pretended, 
would the revolutionary government of Massachusetts have intrusted me with various important offices ? 
</p><p>
Now, that government, in the same year, <a href='/results.php?year=1775'>1775</a> , after the 
battle of <a href='/results.php?city=lexington' rel='city'>Lexington</a>, appointed me a Justice of the Peace 
and a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas for the County 
of Essex ; and, what was still more important, they appointed 
me sole Judge of the admiralty or maritime court for the 
Middle District of Massachusetts, comprehending <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, 
Marblehead, Salem, Beverly, Gloucester, and <a href='/results.php?city=newburyport' rel='city'>Newburyport</a> ; 
into which were brought many more prizes taken from the 
British than into the whole State beside. I held these 
offices until I went to the army under <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker met'>General Washington</a>'s 
immediate command, in June, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a> . In the period of less 
than two years that I was Judge of the maritime court, about 
a hundred and fifty prizes were brought in, tried, and condemned. 
</p><p>
In my letter to Governor Sullivan, (page 29,) you will 
see that I was appointed by Congress a member of the Continental Board of War, in conjunction with <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='co-worker'>General Gates</a> 
and <a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='co-worker met'>General Mifflin</a>. This was near the close of the campaign of <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a> . Now take notice, that the late Governor 
Samuel Adams, John Adams, late President of the United 
States, and Elbridge Gerry, now Governor of Massachusetts, 
were the members of Congress present from Massachusetts 
at the time I was chosen one of the members of the Board 
of War. 
</p><p>
Will any man of common sense and common honesty, in any political party called Democratic, require more or better proofs that my conduct on the day of the battle of 
<a href='/results.php?city=lexington' rel='city'>Lexington</a> was not liable to censure ? And what stronger proofs could be offered them in support of my integrity, fidelity, and patriotism? 
Whoever knows, or shall know, these facts, and yet continues to revile me, must be a base and wicked slanderer. 
</p><p>
I am, Sir, your old neighbor and friend, 
</p><p>
TIMOTHY PICKERING.

</p><p>
I received your favor by Dr. One, and read it with much 
satisfaction. Your sentiments and mine respecting public 
affairs do not differ. I am still of opinion that a pacification 
upon honorable terms is practicable. This opinion I declared in the council of war at <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a> last Thursday : 
urging strenuously a forbearance of hostilities, and praying 
that we might act only on the defensive ; at least till the 
other Colonies were consulted. Some declared themselves 
of the same opinion. Others thought that now was the time 
to strike, and cut off the troops before they were reenforced ; 
and then, said they, the day will be our own. As if Great 
Britain could not replace three thousand men, nor land at 
any other place than <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> ! By the way, I do not see what 
mighty advantage can accrue to us by getting possession of 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> ; none, I am sure, which can countervail the loss of 
thousands in storming the town, which will immediately be 
beat to pieces by the men-of-war. I had twenty to one 
rather make an attempt upon the Castle. Notwithstanding the 
warmth of some men, by all I can now learn, the only capital manoeuvre at present will be the enlisting an army, and 
getting it disciplined, ready to oppose any violence which 
shall be offered by those who are inimical to us. And this 
plan I do not find that any one objects against : on the contrary, those judicious, moderate men who have hitherto 
opposed the measure, now think it necessary, and that the 
late expedition of the troops will justify us therein. The 
number agreed on by our Congress as their quota of thirty 
thousand, to be raised in New England, is thirteen thousand 
six hundred men, whom they have already begun to enlist. 
In consequence of this plan, I am persuaded that no immediate attack is intended, either upon <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> or the Castle. 
But, if what is reported to-day be true, I cannot pretend to 
say what the deceitful baseness of Gage and the indignation 
of our countrymen may produce. We are told that he 
assured the inhabitants of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, if they would deliver up 
their arms, he would permit the inhabitants to leave the 
town ; that they have complied with the condition ; and 
that now he refuses to let the people go. But all this 
wants confirmation. 
</p><p>
Josiah <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>, Jr., Esq., is arrived at Gloucester, and 
the Selectmen of that town, in a letter I received this morn 
ing, say he is very ill, and near expiring. Lyde, with 
whom he came, sailed a good while before Callahan, who 
got in some time ago. 
</p><p>
I was this day informed by one of the Derby's, who 
spent the last evening with Callahan, that he, though inclined to Toryism (as the term is), confessed it was in 
vain to deny the distress already arising to Great Britain by 
means of the non-importation. Many of the discharged 
manufacturers have taken to the highways, armed, and the 
jails are filled with them already. 
The harbor of Marblehead is blocked up by a man-of-war ;  ours is yet free. 
</p><p>
P. S. I hope nothing will prevent your communicating to me your plan of a pacification very soon.

DEAR MADAM, 
</p><p>
You as rightly as fully believe that we feel a sincere friendship for each other ; and let it be lasting as 
our lives. I regret the separation which probably must 
soon take place ; but God grant it may be a short one. 
</p><p>
. . . For many years I regarded you with heartfelt affection ; but I must confess (and you will not think my friend 
ship is now less warm and sincere because I confess the 
truth) , that our repeated bickerings (I am sorry to use the 
word, but everything must yield to truth,) had sensibly 
lessened that affection, though it returned with all its force 
when I found we must part; and tis now heightened by
your very obliging, affectionate letter, which I have just 
received and read. Indeed, I formed a wish that you might 
not go, and was casting about in my mind in what manner 
I could provide for your safety and support, when Mr. Robie came in, and interrupted my anxious, but pleasing 
thoughts. When I last carried you to Marblehead, I had 
it in my heart to propose a mutual, cordial forgiveness of 
every thought, word, or look, which had ever borne the 
aspect of severity and unkindness ; but I need not tell you, 
that I am less prone than many to make an ado about such 
matters. I felt all, and perhaps more than I could have 
expressed ; and I entirely believed your feelings were kind 
and friendly as my own. 
You do me justice in believing that I have an aversion 
to cruelty and rage against those called * friends to government, some of whom I esteem highly, because I think them 
possessed of great integrity and worth. 
I agree with you, that a private station is often the post 
of honor ; and I feel not the ambition for titles and high 
places, conspicuous in some men : at the same time, I think 
it my duty not to desert my country in that cause which I 
have hitherto espoused, a cause which I believe to be 
founded injustice, although, in conducting it, many irregularities may have been committed ; a cause which, if given 
up, or the supporters of it be overcome, Liberty itself, I 
fear, will expire ; and at present I do not feel an inclination to survive the liberties of my country. 
</p><p>
But whatever becomes of me, may kind Heaven be your guardian and the guardian of your lovely daughter, whom I pray you to embrace for me.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR,
</p><p>
I cannot forbear expressing my surprise at the principle 
advanced by a certain gentleman, with respect to the appointment of civil officers. To be consistent, he should go 
one step farther ; or, rather, he might be more explicit, and 
say, that unless a man have a brawny arm and the heart of a 
lion, or, in other words, if he possess not the prime qualities of an executioner, he is unfit for a judge! But, for my 
own part, I would choose to bear the reproach of humanity, 
and a tender feeling for my brethren of mankind, especially 
my fellow-citizens, on the point of being exposed to all the 
calamities, the numberless calamities, of civil war, rather 
than, upon opposite principles, be advanced to the highest 
posts, and so possess, with infamy, the reward of savage 
ferocity and barbarism. What does common sense pronounce to be the proper qualifications of a judge ? Are they 
other than these, integrity, ability, and knowledge of the 
law? Who, in searching for a judge, a discerner between 
truth and falsehood, right and wrong, would, before all 
things, inquire for a man of conquering attributes, for a 
hero ? 
</p><p>
With regard to the instance in question, tis true I 
differed in opinion from some others. I said we were not 
prepared for war, and that war to me appeared not unavoidable : hence arose my wishes still longer to forbear avowed 
hostilities. Dr. Warren a man deservedly esteemed and 
honored urged strenuously the pushing into <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> and 
cutting off the troops before a re enforcement should arrive. 
I declared instantly my opinion, that it was then impracticable. I know my opinion did not prevent it ; but it was 
not done. And were I now to say, even now the Colonies 
are unprepared for war, the declaration would not be wholly 
destitute of truth. Ask <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker met'>General Washington</a> : he 11 tell you 
he is obliged to remain most mortifyingly inactive, and 
receive, without reply, the enemy's unceasing insults. This 
he declared to me last week. But, admitting my opinion to 
be unfounded, must I from thence be concluded my country's enemy, or timid friend? Suffer me to mention a fact. 
In 1745, in our House of Representatives, this question was 
agitated : Is it practicable to take Louisburg? It was long 
and calmly debated, and at length determined in the affirmative by a majority of one voice only. What now was to 
be done with the minority ? Should they be expelled the 
House because they were less sanguine than their brethren, 
and be excluded from offices? The cases, I think, are not 
unlike. The question being once determined, the minority 
were as active as their opponents in setting forward the 
expedition ; and, by a remarkable series of fortunate events, 
it happily succeeded. God grant our present enterprise 
may be alike successful ! My efforts have not been wanting, 
to the utmost of my ability ; and, had I been actually a member of the army, I could scarcely have spent more time in its 
service. Since the 19th of April, one month would much 
more than comprise all my labor and attention to my own 
affairs. And a hundred pounds, lawful money, would not 
tempt me again to go through the application and fatigue of 
writing my military treatise. You will, Sir, excuse this 
tedious epistle. I am bound, in justice to myself, to mention 
these things, to show how extremely unreasonable it would 
be to refuse me such offices as I am qualified to discharge for 
the trifling cause referred to, or rather for no cause at all.

I do not say this because I regret my missing a certain appointment. I repeat what I told you, that, whatever I may 
be hereafter, when study and experience have matured my 
judgment, I am at present unfit for that important trust. 
Had the appointment taken place, I think I must have declined it, lest I should by accepting it disgrace myself and 
injure and dishonor my country. For the present is the 
most important period since the Colony was founded ; and 
never was there a greater necessity of filling the offices of 
government with men of integrity, ability, and knowledge, 
both on account of the difficulty of the times, and that our 
adversaries and posterity [may have no ground] for vilify 
ing, stinging reflections ; for sorry should I be to see the 
Colony again reproached, and its senators and leaders 
styled, ignominiously, "Dii minorum gentium."
I do not repeat my petition. You know me ; so do 
others; and your discernment, and sense of the dignity 
becoming freemen, will lead you to expect no servile en 
treaties from me. A slave may present them at the shrine 
of power ; but a liberal mind will reject the offering with 
disdain. 
</p><p>
I am, Sir, with great regard, your obliged friend, &c.

Sir, 
</p><p>
The General. Court of this Colony having, pursuant to 
your request, issued orders for raising upwards of four 
thousand men to serve, in the army that is under your Excellency's immediate command, till the first day of April 
next, and of that number directed that ninety-one be en 
listed in the town of Salem, in consequence thereof the 
militia were mustered and the resolves of the Court read 
to them, and the importance of manning the lines at <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a> and Roxbury was urged ; but, great numbers of the 
inhabitants being at sea, many impressed on board the 
British ships, a considerable number in the American armed 
vessels and privateers, one hundred employed as a sea-coast 
guard, and perhaps double that number already in the army, 
of the residue, two or three only presented themselves to 
serve on the common establishment of the army. We were 
therefore induced to try another method, and the Committee 
of Safety gave the enlisting orders to a worthy man and 
good soldier who had served as a Lieutenant in the army 
the last campaign, and offered a month's pay in advance to 
all who would enlist under him. But this measure also 
proved ineffectual. Hence the persons whose names are 
subjoined, inhabitants of the town of Salem, convinced that 
tis of the last importance to the United Colonies, and essential to the safety of this Colony, to defend the lines at Cam 
bridge and Roxbury, have agreed (as tis not in their power 
to do anything more or better) to form themselves into a 
company of volunteers, to serve in the army till the first 
day of April next without pay ; and they now, Sir, beg 
leave to tender themselves to your Excellency, to be employed as you shall think best ; and pray they may, by the 
bearer, who is one of the company, be made acquainted 
with your Excellency's pleasure.

SIR, 
</p><p>
I esteem it a singular honor done me by your Excellency in offering me the post of Adjutant-General ; and it 
pains me sensibly that I am obliged to decline it. It is an 
honor to which I did not aspire, because I did not account 
myself equal to the important business of the office. Your 
Excellency does not mistake my attachment to the interest 
of the United States. It is sincere and unalterable. But 
my military character, which you are pleased to mention as 
a motive to the appointment, is, in my own estimation, of 
no great account. I have, it is true, studied the rudiments 
of the military art, but have very small, or rather no, pre 
tensions to capacity and skill in the important scenes of 
war, and much fear I should disappoint your Excellency's 
expectations concerning me. 
I have domestic reasons and private concerns which 
powerfully urge my staying at home ; but these I should 
not mention, did they exist alone. But, besides the command of a regiment of militia on the sea-coast, I hold divers 
civil offices, which are sufficient to engage my constant 
attention : those of Judge of one of the maritime courts, 
Judge of the inferior Court of Common Pleas, acting Justice of the Peace, and Register of Deeds for the county of 
Essex. The exercise of these offices I could, without any 
very great inconvenience, quit for a season ; and therefore, 
at the time of making the late levy of militia, as there 
appeared some backwardness in the people, I encouraged 
their engaging, and stepped forth and offered my own personal service. 
Nevertheless, I would for ever abandon all these employments, if I thought myself capable of doing more ser 
vice to my country by acting in the office to which your 
Excellency has been pleased to invite me. But, as I do 
not thus think of myself, and conceive it not difficult to 
find a person not otherwise employed, and, to say the least, 
as able to discharge the duties of the office as I, I must beg 
leave to decline it. 
I am, with the greatest veneration, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
I sent, by the express, an answer to your letter respecting the office of Adjutant-General, and gave what appeared 
to me sufficient reasons to excuse my declining to accept it ; 
but I have since been uneasy lest you should deem them 
otherwise, and that I was too willing, under the civil offices 
I sustain, to shelter myself from the dangers and fatigues 
of war, an opinion which, if it has taken place, I wish 
to remove. 
</p><p>
The case was this : I had concluded to accept the office, 
but, meeting with a number of unavoidable interruptions in 
the way of business, was unable to give my answer to the 
express till the evening, at eight o clock, at which time I 
had directed him to call ; and it was then, in fact, sealed up, 
and ready to be delivered, the same which I now enclose 
to your Excellency. But, the express delaying his coming 
a full hour, I of course continued to revolve the matter in 
my mind, and, upon a review of the reasons on both sides 
of the question, those against my accepting the post, in 
creased by the suggestions of my nearest friend, whose 
happiness and tranquillity of mind lay near my heart, preponderated, and occasioned the answer your Excellency has 
already received. Besides the reasons there given, others 
weighed with me, which I had not time to mention. The 
civil offices I sustain yield me an income that contents me, 
and, in a time of peace, would maintain my family. These 
I must have relinquished, without an expectation of reassuming them. Consequently, had I taken the post of Adjutant-General, and some cause had arisen (an event far from 
impossible) rendering it expedient for me to quit the camp, 
I should have returned divested of the principal means of 
supporting my family. 
</p><p>
Whenever I thought of a military employment, the condition of my eyes was no small discouragement to me. I 
am so near-sighted that I, although placed in the best situation, cannot, with any degree of accuracy, discern the position of a body of men beyond the size of a single regiment. 
It is true, in viewing distant objects, my spectacles help me 
to see nearly as well as people in general do with the naked 
eye ; but they are frail things, and rain or snow beating 
against them (I found in the winter's campaign) so obstructs the vision as to render them almost useless. My 
business as Register of Deeds had, by my absence, got 
behindhand ; it seemed to be daily increasing, and my office 
was not in such order as I wished to leave it in to a successor. These, with the reasons mentioned in my former 
letter, and many others of lesser moment, determined my 
answer in the negative. I regretted the proposal could not 
have been made me while at head-quarters, where I could 
have inquired particularly into the nature and extent of the 
office of Adjutant-General, and thence judged more certainly whether or not I was able to discharge the duties of 
it. The want of such information left doubts on my mind 
that were no small obstacle to my accepting it. 
On the other hand, I am sensible, that to support the 
army is of essential importance ; that, on the failure of it, 
besides the general calamity of my country, every prospect 
of advantage or enjoyment to me must vanish. I have 
been, therefore, ever ready to serve the public to the utmost 
of my power. But perhaps the comforts of civil life, the 
love of ease, the enjoyment of my friends, and the powerful allurements springing from the nearest connection on 
earth, have led me to mistake the object. From a sacred 
regard, therefore, to the interests of my country ; from the 
ardent desire I have to approve myself to your Excellency ; 
from the pain it has given me to deny the request of the 
last of men to whom I would refuse anything, I submit 
the whole matter to your Excellency's determination. If, 
upon a view of all circumstances, you judge it my duty to 
exchange the civil for a military life, I will do it. And 
then, should the office of Adjutant-General (for, from what 
conception I have of it, none would be more agreeable) be 
once more vacant, or any other post or employment present, 
to which you shall deem me competent, I will not again 
confer with flesh and blood, but instantly obey your Excellency's commands. 
I beg your Excellency's pardon for imposing on your 
patience this second long letter. But I feared lest, by my 
backwardness, I might have offended. And I was led to 
make the above tender of my services because your Excellency's good opinion of me, and the urgency of your 
request, have raised me to some importance with myself. 
I am, with the highest veneration and esteem for your 
Excellency, your Excellency's most obedient and most humble servant,

SIR, 
</p><p>
I had the honor to receive your Excellency's letter, 
by Colonel Lee, conferring upon me the office of Adjutant-General. And since, notwithstanding all my objections, 
tis your Excellency's pleasure, I am happy to declare my 
acceptance of it. At the same time, I am constrained, 
from my real feelings, again to express my fears that I shall 
fall short of your Excellency's expectations. Few people 
are competent judges of military abilities ; and most are 
apt to form their opinions very superficially. Hence I have 
as often been mortified as pleased by the favorable sentiments which some have expressed concerning me, conscious 
that many times I did not merit their applause. I know 
not who have recommended me to your Excellency ; I wish 
they may not have judged too favorably of my abilities. 
However, I am determined to exert myself to the utmost 
to serve your Excellency and my country ; and if, after all, 
I fail of executing the office with propriety, seeing I at first 
declined it, partly from an apprehension of inability, your 
Excellency will acquit me of presumption in accepting it at 
your repeated request. My affairs are complicated, but I 
will prepare to attend you with all possible despatch. General Glover accepts the post assigned him, aud we shall 
doubtless go to head-quarters together.

I embrace the first opportunity since my arrival here to 
write you. I am very happy in the General's family. His 
secretaries and aides-de-camp are gentlemen of education, 
and of the most polite, obliging manners. Yesterday General Howe's army decamped, and, from the best accounts, 
are all retired to Amboy, from whence the passage to Staten 
Island is short and easy. What will be their next attempt 
is altogether uncertain ; but I am inclined to think the game 
is nearly over with them. I believe as many as thirty 
deserters from the enemy have come in since my arrival 
here, which was on Tuesday, the 17th inst. 
</p><p>
In the execution of my office, I have received all necessary assistance from Colonel Connor, the late temporary 
Adjutant-General ; and he has very obligingly offered me 
any further aid that I may need. 
</p><p>
If the enemy should continue the war, I am inclined 
to think it may be nearer my home ; for surely they will not 
go far southward at this season. Nothing, I think, can they 
have in view but to distress us ; conquest they must despair 
of. When I left home, I conjectured that one campaign 
after the present would end the war. I now believe this 
one year will finish it. The sooner the better, for the sake 
of the lives, health, and happiness of thousands. And then, 
also, shall I return to enjoy, with my Becky, all the sweets 
of domestic life ; that quiet, ease, and heartfelt satisfaction 
which spring from the sincerest friendship and the tenderest love . . .

... The enemy having entirely quitted Jersey, and the 
General suspecting they might go up the North River, the 
army moved up from Middle Brook, last Thursday, to this 
place, to be nearer to <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>. <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker'>General Sullivan</a>, with his 
division, is gone about twenty miles farther on, to a place 
called Pomptou. What led the General the more to apprehend a movement up the North River was, that the enemy 
from Canada were about to attack <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>. We shall re 
main here till Howe makes some movement. If he goes up 
the river, we shall follow him. If he goes to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> 
(of which I think there is little danger) , we shall go thither. 
But, if he stands off with his fleet to the open sea, we shall 
not know where he is going, and of course be in a great 
quandary which way to steer. Two sailors, by one of whom 
I send this, escaped from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> the day before yesterday. They say the talk there was, among some, that Howe 
was going to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and, among others, that he was going 
to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. We are greatly at a loss to determine 
what his intentions are ; and, since he was disappointed in 
his plan of going to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> by land, we have some 
times suspected that Howe himself was at a loss which way 
to go. But, for my own part, if the enemy make a real 
attack on <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, I shall wonder if Howe does not 
go up the North River. . . . 
</p><p>
P. S. I am so crowded with business, and as yet with 
out an assistant, my friends must excuse me if I do not 
write to them. The General, a week ago, desired me to 
get a deputy ; which I shall do as soon as I can light on a 
good one. . . .

After the enemy left the Jerseys, we had reason to 
apprehend they intended to go to the eastward, or up the 
North River. This induced us to march from Middle Brook 
to <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a>, thence to <a href='/results.php?city=pompton' rel='city'>Pompton</a>, thence within eighteen 
miles of King's Ferry, and thence into Smith's Clove, in a 
route that would carry us to New Windsor, where we should 
have crossed the ferry to <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a>. But, having advanced 
a dozen miles into the Clove, we halted, having reason to 
doubt, from the enemy's movements and the best intelligence we could obtain, whether they were bound up the 
North River or to the eastward, or not. At length we had 
such intelligence as induced the general officers to think 
Howe intended for <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. This intelligence was 
strengthened by a letter, written with Howe's own hand, to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>, in which he says he is going to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. 
But he sent it out by a man who had been confined by him 
in the provost three weeks, and on whom he had no reason 
to rely. In short, it was not doubted but he sent it 
on purpose by such a messenger, that it might fall into 
our hands. The messenger, at the first guard of ours he 
met, delivered it up to the officer, and gave what other 
information he could. We had, before the receipt of 
Howe's letter, come back out of the Clove. We are now 
got back to <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a>, and shall proceed on towards 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> ; for the bulk of the enemy's ships have sailed

On the 28th of July we arrived on the banks of the 
River Delaware, at Cory ell's Ferry, about thirty-two miles 
from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> by land, and there we halted. Last night 
the General and his family arrived here. Yesterday morn 
ing, about half after nine o clock, an express came to the 
General to inform him of the arrival of the enemy's fleet 
at the Capes of the river. Orders were immediately issued 
for all the troops upon the river (being eight brigades) to 
cross with all despatch possible ; two more brigades at <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a>, under <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker'>General Sullivan</a>, and two more from Peeks- 
kill, are to follow as expeditiously as they can. All, we 
trust, will arrive before the enemy can take any decisive 
measures. The militia from this State, Jersey, and Mary 
land will, no doubt, turn out with spirit. The people of 
the city seem to be quite at ease, and not by any means to 
dread the enemy's approach. Fighting there must be, no 
doubt. God grant we may give them an overthrow, which, 
if general, must probably decide the contest. The army is 
in high spirits, and the order to march this way gave universal joy. The General and all the principal officers much 
prefer the enemy's coming here to their going up the North 
River, or to New England. For to this place the army will 
have but little way to march ; and, as it is an event long 
expected, it is presumed the people are better prepared to 
give the enemy a proper reception. However, if they 
should even gain this city, the cause will not be given up 
as lost; the enemy will, I trust, have a great deal more 
work to do before they conquer America. Though we have 
met with many losses, yet even now the inhabitants of 
America seem not to be actuated by a becoming ardor. 
Greater sufferings will show us the necessity of more universally spirited exertions ; and, when they take place, we shall 
undoubtedly, under <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, prevail over our enemies. 
Tis now past noon, and I have heard nothing more of the 
enemy's fleet, except a slight report that they were still at 
the Capes, which, I am inclined to think, is true ; for, if 
they had made any considerable progress, we should 
doubtless have heard of it. So much for news. . . .

... Although our loss in the battle of Brandywine 
was not so great as the enemy s,* yet since then it has been 
much larger; I mean by straggling and desertions, which, I 
am satisfied, have reduced the army more than the bare 
action. After that battle we returned to within seven miles 
of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, rested two nights, cleaned our arms, furnished each man with forty rounds of well-made cartridges, 
then recrossed the Schuylkill, and, after several marches, 
were one day overtaken by a most severe rain. The army 
had just been arrayed for battle, the enemy approaching. It 
was judged best to shift our ground for a position more 
advantageous. It began to rain ; the enemy halted ; we 
marched ten miles in a continual rain and bad roads ; arrived 
late in the evening at Yellow Springs ; men fatigued, arms 
wet, ammunition chiefly spoiled (perhaps three hundred 
thousand cartridges) ; no covering for the men (the tents 
having been sent off when the battle was expected) ; rain 
all night and part of next day ; another march to Reading 
Furnace ; then we returned, and again crossed the Schuylkill in order to obstruct the passage of the enemy, leaving 
one division, under <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='co-worker'>General Wayne</a>, behind, to hang upon 
their rear. The second or third night the enemy fell upon 
Wayne ; they exchanged one fire, close ; pushed bayonets ; 
Wayne retired ; the enemy did not pursue, but retired also. 
Next day Wayne buried fifty-six of his men, and the in 
habitants said the enemy buried twenty-three of theirs, and 
carried off four or five wagon-loads. 
</p><p>
Information that the enemy were proceeding up the Schuylkill on the [west] side induced us to march up like 
wise on this side. We got above them, and then they 
crossed below us at Swedes Ford. We wait for Wayne to 
join us, and McDougall with his brigade from <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>. 
We shall, I expect, unite to-morrow. 
</p><p>
Six o clock P. M. I have just heard that the enemy have 
dropped down to-day within twelve miles of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
The city is open to them. The day before yesterday I pro 
posed, in presence of <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker met'>General Washington</a>, <a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='co-worker met'>General Knox</a>, 
&c., that at least one company of artillerymen and a sufficient number of musketeers should be sent down to garrison 
the fort below the city, which defends the chevaux-de-frise. 
His Excellency assented to the propriety of the measure ; 
yet nothing was done. However, yesterday it was judged 
of the highest importance to garrison that fort. Accordingly, two hundred musketeers and two good artillery 
officers were despatched to cross the Delaware at Bristol. 
Had this step been taken when I proposed it, it might have 
been executed without a circuitous march to Bristol, for 
the enemy had not then crossed the Schuylkill. However, 
I trust it will still be effected with safety. If the fort is as 
tenable as represented, I presume the enemy will not speedily pass the chevaux-de-frise ; and, if Howe is not aided by 
the fleet, he will not long possess <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, I am persuaded. But, from the account given by others, it seems 
that a height on the Jersey shore, a mile from the fort 
(which is near the opposite shore, back of which the large 
meadows are now laid under water) , may be taken possession of by the enemy, from which, by their guns and 
mortars, they may prevent the galleys defending the chevaux-de-frise, and possibly make the fort too warm for our men. 
But surely the fort, at the distance of a mile, must be safe 
from everything but bombs, and I should not fear much from 
them alone. 
</p><p>
To-day it rains. To-morrow morning, at nine o clock, 
we march and join McDougall. Pretty soon, I imagine, we 
shall proceed to attack the enemy, if their post be practicable. Were Howe, with his present force, in New England, 
and <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker met'>General Washington</a> with so many Continental troops 
as he will have when joined by Wayne and McDougall, I 
should not wish for a better opportunity to crush him ; for 
we should have there the best intelligence, and as many 
militia as we desired for a short, bold push ; but here we 
are, in fact, in an enemy's country. I am told upwards of 
sixty-five thousand men are enrolled in the militia of Pennsylvania; yet we have not two thousand in the field, and 
these are of little worth and constantly deserting. After 
the action of the 11th, and the enemy took possession of 
Wilmington, almost all the militia of Delaware State also 
ran home. Some Maryland militia join us to-morrow, per 
haps a thousand men. Many that marched from home have 
deserted. Other militia are coming from Virginia and Jersey, together with a stout and good State regiment from 
Virginia, the latter perhaps now at Lancaster. The Jersey 
militia have been at war a year, are embittered against the 
foe, and have constantly behaved well in Jersey. But be 
fore all the militia arrives, I presume we shall be engaged, 
lest the fleet should get to the city. 
</p><p>
I had heard at home of so much contempt and ridicule 
thrown by the southern gentlemen on the New England 
militia, that I expected something better here ; but no militia 
can be more contemptible than those of Pennsylvania and 
Delaware ; none can be spoken of more contemptuously than 
they are by their own countrymen. And how astonishing 
is it, that not a man is roused to action when the enemy is 
in the heart of the country, and within twelve miles of their 
grand capital, of so much importance to them and the Continent ! How amazing, that Howe should march from the 
head of Elk to the Schuylkill, a space of sixty miles, with 
out opposition from the people of the country, except a 
small band of militia just round Elk ! Such events would 
not have happened in New England. I rejoice that I can 
call that my country. I think myself honored by it. I 
hope I shall not do anything to detract from the applauses justly its due. 
</p><p>
The inhabitants here have, of a long time, been the 
most abominable extortioners ; and where Howe has passed 
they refuse to take paper money. The villains in Chester 
county (between the Schuylkill and the Brandy wine) refuse even to supply our poor wounded men among them 
with necessary provisions, without the solid coin; and our 
surgeons have been obliged to carry provisions to them from 
hence. I feel in some degree reconciled to Howe's entering 
Pennsylvania and <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, that the unworthy inhabit 
ants (of which tis apparent a majority of the State is com 
posed) may experience the calamities of war, which nothing 
but their own supineness and unfriendliness to the American 
cause would have brought on them. Possibly Heaven permits it in vengeance for their defection, that their country 
should be the seat of war. Not that I have a great opinion 
of the morality of the Americans in general ; but there are 
surely none who have not more public virtue than the Pennsylvanians. However, did the event of the contest depend 
on the goodness, the moral virtue, of my countrymen, I 
should despair of success. But, for the justice of our cause 
and the sake of the righteous in the land, I hope, and I 
doubt not, God will in the end grant us victory, and a 
consequent happy peace. Yet perhaps many trials await 
us. All our afflictions have not taught us humility. Every 
species of vice has rather prevailed since the war began. In 
short, look where you will, there is so much evil, that a good 
man would scarcely wish to live, were it not for the pleasures he enjoys in the small circle of his nearest friends. I 
sometimes wonder we are so fond of life, when we almost 
daily meet with something to vex our souls. But, doubt 
less, Shakespeare has assigned the true reason, an uncertain futurity. Yet this should affect none but infidels ; 
and we have good advice, Fret not because of evil men. 
We must do our duty, and await our appointed time till 
our change comes, enjoying what bounties Heaven pleases 
to bestow.

I wish to hear particularly of the state of my father, 
mother, and all my relations. . . .

</p><p>
MY DEAR, MY AMIABLE BECKY, 
</p><p>
Although tis no more than forty-eight hours since I 
wrote you by Mr. Gary, yet yours of the 20th ultimo, this 
day received, excites anew my tenderest feelings, and compels me to begin again. . . . But, pleased as I am with this 
proof of your fond affection, I do not wish you to indulge 
such melancholy thoughts. I know tis difficult to control 
the mind. That little wanderer will often make excursions 
where wisdom would check its career, but strives in vain. 
However, tis commonly in our power to place other objects 
in view than those which lead to misery, such as business, 
amusing books, and the society of friends. All these have 
a natural tendency to withdraw the mind from the pursuit 
of objects which give it pain. But, my dear, the Christian 
rests not here, but seeks and finds relief from other views. 
The Christian grieves not as those who have no hope beyond 
the grave, but looks forward to a glorious immortality, 
where grief and care shall have no place. Let this, my 
dearest, be our support. Often have I experienced its 
powerful aid, when surrounded with difficulties, dangers, 
and distress. Other props have failed, but never my hope 
in Heaven. This, raised and animated by prayer to the 
great Supreme, has often eased my burdened soul. Prayer 
is the natural mode of converse of man with his Maker ; 
and highly should we prize the condescending grace which 
invites us to adopt it. Let gratitude warm our hearts for 
that and all other blessings, and let us never forfeit them by 
inattention or neglect. Let our confidence in God never 
fail or lessen ; for that alone can support us under the 
severest trials. Let us reflect, at the same time, on our 
own ignorance and short-sightedness, which often lead us 
to view those events as most adverse and unfortunate 
which Heaven designs for our best good, if not in this 
world, at least in a better. To the Christian every event 
will prove a benefit : if it be happy, he will highly enjoy 
it; if afflictive, it will brighten his virtues, and lead him 
forward to scenes of bliss without allay. 
Reflections of this kind, my dear, are the suggestions 
of reason and Scripture. But, I confess, tis easier to 
preach than practise the lessons of wisdom. Notwithstanding the glories which, we believe, will in another world be 
displayed, great beyond the power of the human imagination to conceive, and although the path of life is strewed 
with cares, pains, and perplexities, still we are fond of 
living, still content to postpone the enjoyment of exalted 
bliss beyond the grave. Whence arises this attachment to 
life, with all its miseries, especially when set in competition 
with perfect happiness? Is it because the first is present 
and certain, the other absent and unknown? With the 
infidel this may operate forcibly ; but why should it strongly 
affect those who believe their peace is made with Heaven ? 
Or, does it proceed from the corruption of human nature, 
from perverse inclinations? This I cannot admit. A desire 
of life is the strongest of all our passions ; and the Creator 
has, I believe, implanted none in vain. Even this fond love 
of life is necessary to man. Our existence is designed for 
the accomplishment of some noble ends, and tis usually 
lengthened to a certain period. Were we indifferent to life, 
few would live out half their days. Tortured with pain, 
or vexed with disappointment, most would cut the slender thread, and thwart the views of Providence. Hence, 
then, I conclude tis lawful to indulge this fond love of life, 
with all its reasonable enjoyments, only remembering, that 
this world is not our abiding-place ; that life, at longest, is 
but of short duration ; and that we ought to conduct our 
selves as heirs to a better inheritance. 
</p><p>
These reflections on human life need not lessen our happiness while here ; at the same time, they may well serve 
to bear us up in adversity, and prevent our souls being 
weighed down with grief, even at the most distressing 
events. With this view only have I made them. 
November 13th, morning. ... To my surprise (and 
to yours it will be), the Congress, by a resolve passed 
the 7th instant, have chosen <a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='co-worker met'>General Mifflin</a>, Colonel Harrison (<a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker met'>General Washington</a>'s Secretary), and myself to be 
a Board of War; and, for a variety of reasons (which I 
have not time now to mention), I have concluded to accept 
the commission. One reason, however, I will tell you : I 
thought it would give ease to your anxious heart, and relieve 
my friends, particularly my mother, from all distress about 
me. This Board, I take it, will reside where Congress does. 
The office is extensive and important, and therefore my 
acceptance is with diffidence. However, I am determined to 
spare no pains to comprehend and perform the duties of it. 
I ardently hope my associates will accept. <a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='co-worker met'>General Mifflin</a> 
is active, sensible, and of great knowledge in business, and 
my friend Colonel Harrison is one of the worthiest of the 
human race. The salary to each is, I understand, to be two 
thousand dollars a year. This is better than my present 
pay by one quarter. This, to a man without a fortune, 
deserves attention. Not that I am mercenary : everybody 
who has viewed my past life knows the contrary. But 
a wife and child strongly impress my mind with the importance of laying up something. And my views have 
extended farther. When the independency of America is 
established (as I trust it will be), a Board of War will most 
probably still exist. If, therefore, I find myself equal to 
the duties of it, and give satisfaction, I, by accepting now, 
may doubtless secure a permanent support ; and this prospect, when I think of you and your dear babe, gives me no 
small joy. Tis possible the business of the department 
may call me eastward; if not, I imagine you will be 
less impatient to see me, as being removed from the military line. . . . 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dearest! Heaven guard you and your infant boy.

SIR, 
</p><p>
I was honored with your favor of the 8th instant, en 
closing a minute of Congress intimating my appointment to 
the Board of War. This mark of their confidence demands 
my sincere acknowledgments. I accept the commission; 
and, as speedily as the situation of my present affairs will 
admit, shall enter upon the execution of it. 
The business of the department I am not fully informed 
of, but conceive it to be very extensive, and of high importance. As such, I accept the office with diffidence. I 
am personally known to some gentlemen in Congress ; I 
wish they may not have mistaken my abilities. Often an 
opinion has been formed of them, which, however flattering, 
was really a source of mortification to me, from a consciousness that they were rated too high. For nothing, 
therefore, can I engage, but my industry and fidelity ; and, 
if application will enable me to comprehend and execute the 
duties of the office, Congress, I hope, will never have reason 
to regret the appointment with which they have been pleased 
to honor me. I am, Sir," &c.

... Colonel Harrison yesterday went to Reading to see 
<a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='co-worker met'>General Mifflin</a>, being in some doubt whether to accept or 
not. I hope ardently that he will, because he is a sensible, 
a diligent, a most worthy, honest man, with whom I live in 
the greatest harmony, and whose inclinations correspond 
with mine. ... I am aware of the vast importance of 
the office ; and when the intention of Congress to appoint 
Colonel Harrison (the General's [Washington s] first Secretary) and me was first intimated to the General, I was 
surprised, deeming the office above my abilities and knowledge. But the General thought the Congress made a discreet choice, observing (to Mr. Harrison) that those who 
had been in the army could best judge of its wants, and, 
having felt them, would of course most probably provide 
suitable supplies, so far as the means were in their power. 
I suppose the General's approbation was sent to Congress ; 
for, in a few days after, the appointments were made. I 
wondered a little the General should be so ready to part 
with Colonel Harrison, because he was his acquaintance 
before the war, had been with him two years as Secretary, 
very diligent in business, and high in his estimation. 
Nothing but the greater public good could have induced 
him to part with Colonel Harrison. 
With regard to myself, I think I can do as much public 
service in this new office as in that I now hold ; and, at 
the same time, it will be attended with circumstances much 
more agreeable to me. My present business has been one 
continued course of attention and unremitting toil ; for, of 
the five months I have been in the service, during one only 
have I had any assistance. I could have none while remaining in the General's family, because my deputy could not 
also be admitted. The General's family is large, and I 
cannot wonder that he was unwilling to increase it. I only 
wish he had sooner explained his mind. On the 1st of 
September I got a deputy [Lieutenant-Colonel Smith] , and 
then first found that he could not make one of the family. 
This put me in a situation quite disagreeable, and I did not 
expect the deputy would have consented to serve ; but he 
did ; and, to render his situation as tolerable as possible, I 
went to board with him while at Wilmington, for I had 
quarters at a house close by head-quarters ; but this lasted 
only a week, when the army marched. In two or three 
days, the General, observing my absence from table, sent 
one of his aids to tell me that he feared I had mistaken him, 
and that, although he could not admit of an addition to his 
family by my deputy, yet he always wished me to make 
one of it. I told the aide-de-camp (who was my intimate 
friend) I had not mistaken him ; but, as it was inconvenient 
to the General to admit my deputy at the same time, the, 
situation of the latter must be so disagreeable that I could 
not think of separating from him in such manner. -After 
quitting Wilmington, we were so continually shifting ground, 
and in places where houses were thinly scattered round, there 
was no possibility of my deputy's being elsewhere than at 
head-quarters ; but I know his feelings were much hurt by it. 
</p><p>
On the 4th of October, Lieutenant-Colonel Smith was 
wounded, and from that time I have been without help. 
Many wondered I did not get another deputy, or assistant ; 
but, when I told them the reason, they ceased to wonder, and 
confessed the case difficult. But I will not tire you further 
with this detail. Had I remained any longer in the office 
of Adjutant-General, I would, upon our next move, and 
always afterwards, have taken separate quarters, and got a 
deputy. This would have been sometimes very inconvenient, because I came away, you know, altogether unprepared 
to keep a table of my own : however, I should have been 
able to do my business with a vast deal more ease and 
satisfaction, though I must have lived at much greater 
expense. . . . 
</p><p>
My new appointment I revolved in my mind deliberately ; a variety of motives conspired to lead me to accept 
it; and, after concluding that I could serve the public at 
least to as much advantage as in my present office, every 
personal consideration was strongly in favor of my accepting it. A more laborious office, I was sure, I could not 
have ; and the hurry, noise, and bustle of a camp are less 
compatible with one's ease than the quiet and regular 
periods of labor and rest to be enjoyed in the country in 
my new employment. . . . 
</p><p>
... When my friends read this letter, they may wonder 
at the facility with which I contemplate a separation from 
them. Much pleasure, indeed, have I enjoyed in their society, and still wish to enjoy. Nowhere can I expect to find an 
equal kindness and affection. But these considerations yield 
to capital advantages to one's family; and every married 
man knows that a wife and children are more than parents, 
brothers, sisters, and other relatives combined. Besides, 
the business of my department may probably carry me in 
the way of seeing them at least once a year, which is as 
frequently as they see some other branches of the family not 
fifty miles distant ; and I am sure they would hear from me 
as often as they do from them, and oftener. 
</p><p>
I expect, the latter end of this week or the beginning of 
next, to set off for Yorktown, where Congress sits. Millet
will go with me. I gave him full expectation of my serving, 
during the war, in the military line, and that he should be 
with me. He enlisted on that footing only. Were I to 
leave him in the service, I should disappoint and deceive 
him, and render him very unhappy. I shall therefore pro 
cure his discharge, which I think the General will grant 
without difficulty. The bounties Millet has received from 
the State of Massachusetts Bay and from the town I shall 
be ready to refund ; and, then, he will be a cheaper servant 
to me than any I could hire at this time, by far ; and his honesty, care, fidelity, and prudence stand unimpeached. . .

...  You tell me you embraced the opportunity by Mr. Goodhue to write to me, though you had nothing new to 
acquaint me with ; and yet you filled up nearly three pages. 
I often begin to write to you without a single idea in ad 
vance; but my love, ever faithful and alive, suggests at all 
times some things which I conceive you wish to hear besides 
the news of the day, which to me arc always the dullest part 
of my letters. I am always happiest when I am adverting 
to our mutual love and esteem, and to those circumstances 
which particularly respect ourselves and our little son. I 
often contemplate (and it has been my principal enjoyment) 
the bliss we shall feel on our next joyful meeting, though I 
repine deeply that it is probably at such a distance. . . . 
I think on your peculiar state, without father, mother, 
brother, or sister, and wish the more to be ever present 
with you, that in the care, protection, and love of a husband, you may find all these wants more than supplied. I 
am indeed happier than most men would be ; for, though 
you are destitute of, yet I am blessed with, all those dear 
relatives ; and such affection unites the family, that, even in 
my absence, you must experience from my parents, brothers, 
and sisters all the fruits of parental and fraternal love. I 
am deceived if you do not find in them all the kindness 
which is generally to be expected from kindred blood. . . . 
I remember now you have mentioned their kindness, particularly brother Gardner's, who has been at home, has had 
it in his power, and has laid himself out, to oblige you. He 
is a kind-hearted man as lives ; and tears of gratitude this 
moment fill my eyes for the substantial, friendly offices he 
has done you. My sister Gardner, too, with the strictest 
economy, is most obligingly generous. . . .

... This is the fruit of war. Ah ! that greater ills did 
not attend it ! Compared with the distresses of some, ours 
are but slight and temporary inconveniences. We still live, 
and are even happy in the anticipation of future joys, 
while multitudes have fallen by the iron hand of war. How 
many tender, fond connections have been broken by it ! 
How many parents hearts have been rent with grief, 
how many widowed mates, how many spotless virgins (like 
the drooping lilies), have bowed their heads, oppressed 
with sorrow, at the loss of children, husbands, lovers ! 
And, my amiable mate, the possibility that that might be

[December 29th] 
</p><p>
... I remain well, and soon expect a summons from 
Congress to repair to the Board of War at Yorktown ; for, 
contrary to what I had heard, . . . that <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='co-worker'>General Gates</a> 
was gone to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, a friend of mine just from York in 
forms, that Gates had accepted his appointment, and was 
daily expected there, and that upon his arrival the Board 
would be formed. I understand there is a vast field of 
business to be laid open to the Board, so that I despair of 
seeing you till the spring. Then, I hope and expect to re 
turn with you and your boy. . . . The information of my 
friend, above referred to, renders your coming with me in 
the spring still more necessary than I had imagined j for, 
though flour at Yorktown is less than four dollars a hundred, 
and beef but about eight pence, lawful money, [eleven cents 
and one ninth,] a pound, yet the members of Congress give 
thirty-seven dollars and one third a week for their board, 
without a servant, and but middling fare into the bargain. 
This sum would be considerably more than the amount of 
my wages per week ; of course I cannot live in that manner. 
And, as the necessaries of life are so cheap there, tis plain 
this dearness of board must be a most abominable extortion, 
and enhanced chiefly for cooking your food and finding a 
bed. Before I heard this, I had thought of a scheme for living 
at such a moderate expense as would enable me to maintain 
you and our son, as well as myself. This was by taking 
lodgings two or three miles out of town. At that distance 
I imagine I can live at a quarter of the expense ; for I would 
buy my own hay and firewood, and then I should have no 
one to pay extravagantly for feeding my horse or my fire ; 
for Millet can do both, and cook, too, extremely well, if 
need be. And this distance would by no means hinder 
me in the general course of business. On the other hand, as 
I expect close application will be necessary, to ride or walk 
that distance daily will be extremely beneficial, if not necessary, for my health. Now, the principal necessaries of life 
being thus cheap, were you with me to conduct the family 
affairs, the whole might ... be supported at much less, or, 
at least, without greater expense, than I alone at board. ... 
</p><p>
Tuesday morning, December 30th. I might have told 
you, that, since our arrival at this place, which was on the 
20th instant, I have been at my own quarters, separate from 
the General's family, at whose quarters they are exceedingly 
pinched for room ; and, as I am in a house where there is a 
family, Millet borrows such utensils as are necessary for 
cooking. Had I conceived how much satisfaction, quiet, and even leisure, I should have enjoyed at separate quarters, I 
would have taken them six months ago. For at head-quarters there is a continual throng, and my room, in particular, 
(when I was happy enough to get one,) was always crowded 
by all that came to head-quarters on business, because there 
was no other cover for them, we having, for the most part, 
been in such small houses. Besides, at head-quarters much 
business passed through my hands, which is now done by the aides-de-camp, and I get rid of, being absent.
