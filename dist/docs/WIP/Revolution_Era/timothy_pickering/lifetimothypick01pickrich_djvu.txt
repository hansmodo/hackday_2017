PREFACE. 



FROM various causes the Biography of COLONEL 
TIMOTHY PICKERING has been delayed until most of 
his friends and other contemporaries who felt a per 
sonal regard for him have passed away ; but the active 
part which he took, and the important offices which 
he held, first in the American Kevolution, next in 
the Cabinets of President Washington and President 
John Adams, and afterwards as a member successively 
of the Senate and of the House of Kepresentatives 
of the United States, give to the record of his life a 
permanent interest. He was likewise several times 
employed by President Washington on missions to 
treat with different tribes of Indians. Some of his 
official papers, and portions of his private correspond 
ence with eminent men of his day, are of much value 
in relation to the history of the United States ; and 
his efforts to induce the " Connecticut Settlers" in 
the valley of Wyoming to submit to the jurisdiction 
of Pennsylvania connect him intimately with the his 
tory of that State. 

As an ardent Federalist, uttering freely his opinions 
of the conduct and character of his Democratic oppo-

vi PREFACE. 

nents, at times when party spirit was at its height, 
he made political enemies, who were unsparing in 
their slanders and abuse of him for the purpose of 
destroying his influence. The bitter animosities of 
those periods have subsided, having given place to 
new ones, between new political parties ; and the 
present generation and its successors can view his 
character with impartiality. 

This First Volume brings his Life down about 
three years beyond the end of the war of the Revo 
lution. His writings are very numerous, and it is im 
possible for me now to determine how many volumes 
a proper selection from them, with appropriate obser 
vations in relation to them, will occupy. It is my 
intention to proceed in the preparation and publica 
tion of the succeeding volumes as fast as circum 
stances may permit. 

Very often, in giving passages from Colonel Pick 
ering s letters, I can only have recourse to the rough 
draught he retained ; a comparison of which with the 
fair copy sent would no doubt in some instances show 
verbal discrepancies. Grammatical inaccuracies and 
other oversights (which, however, seldom occur), I 
do not hesitate to correct.

LIFE 

OF 

TIMOTHY PICKEBING. 



CHAPTER I. 

Introduction, by his Son, John Pickering. His Birth and Ances 
tors. His Wife. His College Life and his Reminiscences 
of it. Early Letter to his Father. 

IT was the intention of the late John Pickering to 
prepare and publish memoirs of his father, Colonel 
Timothy Pickering, with selections from his writings; 
but, to the lasting regret of his friends, the labors of 
his profession, and the time required for the revision 
of his " Lexicon of the Greek Language," left him but 
little leisure for the accomplishment of his design. He 
wrote a few pages, which follow, beginning with the 
proposed title-page of his work : 

" Memoirs of Colonel Timothy Pickering, of the American Rev 
olutionary Army : With Notices of Distinguished Political Con 
temporaries, during the Administrations of Washington, Adams, 
and Jefferson : With Extracts from his Correspondence. 

Nou civium ardor prava jubentium, 
Non vultus instantis tyranni, 
Mcntc quatit solida. ffor. 

Mihi Galba, Otho, Vitellius, nee beneficio nee injurial cogniti. Tacit. 
He who flatters the dead deceives the living-. Johnson."

anniversary of my father s death, I resume the inter-

I began to make the necessary preparation for the 
work on the anniversary of his birth, July 17th, 1837, 
and now find, before I am aware of the rapid lapse of 
time, that two years and a half have gone by. I might 
still find an apology for delay, perhaps, in the circum 
stance of being still compelled, as I have been through 
the most of my life, to devote my time to the labors of 
my profession, in order to support my family, who have 
the first claim upon me. But I feel deeply the weight 
of that filial duty which demands the performance of 
this task, important in a public as well as private 
view, and I am sure that the members of my family 
will cheerfully submit to such sacrifices as cannot be 
avoided in this case. To my children the character of 
their grandparent will be as dear and as important, in 
some respects, as it has been to myself; and I feel a 
strong conviction that I cannot render a greater service 
to them and their youthful contemporaries, than by a 
faithful exhibition of his public and private life, as an 
exemplar for the conduct and government of their 
own lives. 

"MEMOIRS, &&amp;lt;5. 

"The subject of the following Memoirs, Colonel 
TIMOTHY PICKERING, was born at Salern, in the State of 
Massachusetts, on the 6th day of July, 1745, Old Style 
[17th of July, New Style]. He was a lineal descend 
ant of John Pickering (one of the early colonists), 
who emigrated from Great Britain to America in the

reign of King Charles the First, and who was admitted, 
according to the colonial laws of that period, to be an 
inhabitant, by a vote passed at a- public meeting of the 
town [of Salem], on the 7th day of the 12th month, 
1636, corresponding to February 7th, 1637.* A brief 
account of this first settler, and of his descendants, was 
collected by the subject of these Memoirs, from various 
family papers, in the year 1793, and entered in a 
memorandum-book kept by him, from which the fol 
lowing extracts are made : 

" Family attachment, the interest we naturally 
take in events relative to our ancestors, the curios 
ity (perhaps the vanity) we are disposed to indulge 
in tracing our descent, and the gratification it may afford 
to my posterity, induce me to mark such simple facts 
relative to the family of which I am a member, as have 
come to my knowledge ; though it will amount to little 
more than the noting of their births and deaths. 

" John Pickering [the first settler] was born in Old 
England, about the year 1615. ... He had two sons, 
John and Jonathan. . . . The last-named John Picker 
ing^ was the father of John Pickering, my grandfather. 
. . . He had another son, named William, of whom I, 
when a boy, heard my father relate the following story: 
That in Queen Anne s war (at the beginning of the pres 
ent century) he was. the master, or skipper, of a fishing

t He was married in 1657 to Alice Flint, to whom, it is presumed, the 
following notice has reference : " 1652, Nov. 30th. Alice Flint was presented 
for wearing a silk hood ; but proving herself to be worth 200, she was ex 
cused." FELT S Annals of Salem, p. 188.

vessel ; that off Cape Breton, in calm weather, he was 
attacked by a shallop containing about thirty French 
men. When the enemy approached, the crew were 
for surrendering, being only six or seven in number ; 
but, as they had each a musket, and their vessel was 
fixed with close quarters, William Pickering, the master, 
told them, if they would only load the guns, he would 
fire them all himself. They did so. As the French 
men rowed up astern and came within musket-shot, he 
began to fire out of the cabin windows. They rowed 
the faster; but he continued firing till they got up to 
the stern ; then he shut fast the cabin windows, and 
they all ran forward to the forecastle, in which were 
loopholes. By the time they had reached the fore 
castle, the Frenchmen were climbing up over the stern. 
He renewed his fire, and, in the whole defence of his 
vessel, killed and wounded so many, that the survivors 
took to their shallop, and rowed off as expeditiously as 
possible. This signal act of bravery and good conduct 
procured him great applause, and occasioned his ap 
pointment to the command of the Boston Galley, a 
ship which had been provided and armed by the Prov 
ince of Massachusetts for the protection of its com

ing the same William Pickering, as follows : " Being afflicted with a corn on

taking up a mallet and chisel, struck off the offending toe ! An instance of 
hardihood extremely rare." COLONEL PICKERING S Memorandum- Book. O. P.

John Pickering who came from Old England) made a 
journey from Salem to Connecticut, with a view to find 
land for a plantation on which he might settle ; but, 
returning in the winter season, his feet and legs got 
frozen, which, rendering him a cripple for life, put an 
end to the project.

at Harvard College.

moderation and coolness of his temper and his steadiness of conduct, when 
the country were running, with fanatic zeal, after the celebrated itinerant 
preacher, George Whitefield, whom and whose followers, in a pamphlet or

while he was disposed to apologize for the poor and 
/uninformed. All his actions showed that he deemed 
(VIRTUE alone entitled to respect. He used often to repeat 
the words of Solomon, "The fear of man bringeth a 
snare." 

" Invincibly pursuing the calls of rigid justice, he 
always complained of the wrongs done to widows, and 
orphans, and salary-men, who were deeply injured by 
the depreciation of the paper money of the Province 
of Massachusetts ; an injury which he thought the 
Province bound in justice to repair, and which he 
urged upon all who fell in his way, who had any influ 
ence in the affairs of government. 

" The emancipation of the enslaved Africans was another 
favorite topic * which he dwelt upon whilst he lived ; 
and he lived long enough to see it beginning to take 
place, in fact, in the Province of Massachusetts, soon 
after the commencement of the late Revolution, which 
ended in the establishment of the Independence of the 
United States. It was not until the Constitution of 
Massachusetts was new modelled, in 1780, that in that 
State slavery was abolished, f the judges of the Su

cough.* My mother survived my father several years. 
I saw her, for the last time, in February, 1784. At 
parting she said "she should never see me again;"

in relation to Colonel Pickering himself and his imme 
diate family.

White^who was born at Bristol, in England, on the 
18th of July, 1754. She was the daughter of Benja

became engaged in the British navy. ... In the war 
of that period between Great Britain and France, he 
went to the East Indies, master of the Wei/mouth, a 
sixty-four gun ship [in the fleet of Admiral Cornish]. He 
was at the taking of Manilla from the Spaniards, and 
entitled to a share of the money [four million dollars] 
stipulated to be paid for its ransom; but the cause 
was, it seems, finally abandoned by the British court, 
and no part of the ransom was ever recovered by the 
captors. " f 

Here terminates the portion of this Memoir prepared 
by Jofyn Pickering. 

* Colonel Pickering used to relate with satisfaction the following anecdote : 
When his father, at an advanced age, was setting out young apple-trees, to 
form an orchard, some one asked him why he took that trouble, intimating 
that he was performing a labor from which he would derive no benefit, as in 
all probability he would not live to partake of the fruit. His reply was, " It 
will do somebody good." O. P.

commanded the land forces. " Your own Manilla ransom most dishonorably 
given up. . . . When you returned to Europe you zealously undertook the 
cause of that gallant army, by whose bravery at Manilla your own fortune 
had been established. You complained, you threatened, you even appealed 
to the public in print. By what accident did it happen, that in the midst of 
all this bustle and all these clamors for justice to your injured troops, the

Timothy Pickering was admitted into the Freshman 
class in Harvard College on the 20th of July, 1759, 
being then fourteen years of age, and was graduated in 
1763. The rank which he held in point of scholarship 
is believed to have been creditable to him ; at least in 
his first year (April, 1760), books were given to him 
and to three others of his class, as testimonials of 
merit. It is true he often lamented the little pro 
ficiency he had made in his early years. Thus in 
1777, in a letter to his wife, he says, "I only regret 
that I have so little improved Heaven s invaluable 
gifts, notwithstanding all the opportunities with which 
by a kind parent s care I was so long indulged. In 
deed, I am mortified at nothing so much, in my past 
life, as my neglect of the means in my hands of in 
creasing my knowledge : " but he adds, " Yet I have 
been less idle than many." In fact, to persons conver 
sant with the history of the College, it must be appar 
ent that the failure of the scholars to make gre.at 
advances in learning was owing, in a considerable 
degree, to the imperfect system of education then in 
operation. 

The class of 1763 was remarkable for the number 
of its members who rose to eminence in after life. 
Among them were Samson Salter Blowers, Chief 
Justice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia; Jona 
than Bliss, Chief Justice, and Joshua Upham, Associate 
Justice, of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick ; 
Nathan Gushing, a Justice of the Supreme Court of 
Massachusetts ; and Josiah Quincy. Junior, renowned 

name of the Manilla ransom was suddenly Juried in a profound, and, since 
that time, an uninterrupted, silence ? Did the ministry suggest any motives to

as a whig in the American Revolution. The degree of 
Master of Arts was conferred on Mr. Pickering in 1766.* 
The following letter, written by him, in the eighteenth 
year of his age, and while a member of the Senior class 
at Harvard College, is given as being the earliest speci- 



* From the handwriting and some other circumstances, it is presumed that 
the following reminiscences of his college life were committed by him to paper 
but a short time before his decease : 

" HARVARD COLLEGE. 

" In 1759 there were four public buildings : The Old College [Harvard 
Hall], burnt in the year [1764], Massachusetts, Stoughton,f and Holden 
Chapel. 

" In Old Harvard, the middle room in the lower story, the whole breadth 
of the building, was the hall where all dined in commons. Every scholar 
carried to the dining-table his own knife and fork, and, when he had dined, 
wiped them on the table-cloth. There were six scholars to a mess. The 
standing dish was fresh beef baked, now and then a plain, hard, Indian- 
meal pudding, and a baked plum pudding once a quarter. For supper 
they had their choice, to enter (probably at the beginning of each quarter) 
for meat or pies, or for a pint of milk and a size of bread. For want of room 
in the colleges, I boarded in private houses during the two first years. The 
scholars residing in the colleges provided their own breakfast in their cham 
bers, and their tea in the afternoon. The south-east corner of the lower 
story (of course fronting the yard) was occupied by the butler ; of whom 
were to be purchased bread, butter, eggs, and, I suppose, some articles which 
are now called groceries. But at the commencement of each quarter I carried 
with me, from home, tea, coffee roasted and ground, and chocolate, to supply 
me for the quarter. 

" The north-east corner of the lower story was occupied for a kitchen. 

" Over the buttery was the chamber occupied by the old tutor, always called 
Old Hancock,^ whose mother said he had [a head] big enough for a council 
lor. But it did not abound in brains. 

" In the middle space of the second story, over the dining-hall, was the 
college library, and a few very ordinary articles for a museum. 

" The western chamber was occupied by Professor Winthrop when deliver 
ing his lectures and exhibiting some experiments in Natural Philosophy. The 
other parts of Old Harvard, (including the cocklofts, I believe, which consti 
tuted the third story,) consisted of rooms for the scholars.

men of his composition that has been preserved. 
The amusingly grave answer of his pious father, a 
deacon of one of the churches in Salem, is indicative 
of the religious instruction Mr. Pickering received 
in his childhood and youth ; which, although when 



" Professor Wigglesworth read his theological lectures in the dining-hall. 
I recollect that in one of them he recommended the reading of Archbishop 
Tillotson s works, but with a caution to beware of his heresies. 

" Holden Chapel was a building of one story, in which all the scholars (in 
and out of college) assembled for prayers, morning and evening. On either 
side of the middle aisle were ranges of seats, with backs, (made wholly of 
oaken wood,) and rising one above another to the side walls. The door was 
at the western end, and the pulpit, or raised seat for the President, at the east 
ern end. In this room also were delivered the short declamations which 
were required of scholars after the Freshman year, perhaps three or four 
in the whole collegiate course. 

" The next oldest tutor was Mr. Marsh, who occupied the southern chamber 
of the second story in Stoughton Hall ; the third was Dr. Kneeland, who occu 
pied the north-western room in the second story of Massachusetts Hall ; and 
the fourth was Mr. Thayer (who also occupied some chamber in Massachu 
setts Hall), father of the present Dr. Thayer, of Lancaster. 

"The President s field (lying north of his house and the meeting-house) 
was in grass ; and when mowed, it was the business of the Freshman class to 
make the hay. 

" The building of Hollis Hall was commenced in 1759. The master mason 
was Colonel Dawes, father of the late Judge Dawes, of Boston. 

" The course of education, as it took place in Dr. Kneeland s class (that to 
which I belonged), was as follows : 

"1. Reciting, without translations, Tally s Select Orations, the same 
which had been read at school. 

"2. Some (perhaps six or eight) of the books of Virgil s ^neid, forty 
or fifty lines prescribed for a lesson, recited with oral translations. 

" 3. The Greek Testament we went through. 

" To teach us to reason in syllogisms, we read Brattle s Logic, a pamphlet 
in the Latin language. And at a later period we read, in part, Wollebius s 
Divinity, a duodecimo volume, also in Latin, of which an edition was printed 
in England, and imported, for the use of the College. 

" In the Sophomore year we read Gordon s Geography, an octavo volume 
of moderate size; and we were required to commit to memory, and repeat, 
whole paragraphs, descriptive of different countries, and of any extraordinary 
things they contained. For an instance of the latter, Gordon, on that district 
of Africa called Biledulgerid, mentioned the ostrich, their rapidity in running, 
and their size, saying, They were as tall as men on horseback. A very stupid 
member of the class, shutting up his book, and with a vacant face and monot-

a young man he discarded the more rigid tenets of 
his father, had a marked influence on his conduct 
through life. 

HONOURED SIR : It is the common opinion of people 
that to play a game at cards is (almost) an unpardonable 
crime. But what renders it more odious than other diver 
sions ? Is it because more time is spent in it than in other 
diversions ? But why is more time spent ? Because this is 
a pleasanter and more sociable entertainment. And what 
makes it so entertaining in general is, that less pains and 
care need be used than in some other diversions ; whereas 
in playing checkers, instead of unbending the mind, after 
its labour, there is more thought and care to be used, and 
so can be no relief to the tired intellect. Besides, it is 
a dull, unsociable business ; and a stranger would rather 
think they were exercised with a fit of the spleen, than 
a diversion, to see them poring upon a piece of board, 



onous voice, attempting to recite the passage, uttered these words : The 
inhabitants of Biledulgerid are as tall as men on horseback. * 

" I think it was in the latter part of the Sophomore year, or fore part of the 
next year, we read Locke on the Human Understanding. Of this work also 
we were required to commit whole paragraphs to memory, and to repeat them 
to the tutor. This mode saved hoth the tutor and the scholar the trouble of 
thinking, one to ask and the other to answer questions on the author s 
doctrines. 

" In the third year we began to read Desaguliers s Natural Philosophy, 
the lessons prescribed, and recited (I do not recollect the manner) to the 
tutor. In the third year also, I think, we entered on Euclid s Elements of 
Geometry, and went through the five first books. This was to me a very 
pleasing study, arising from the ingenious arrangement of the problems to be 
solved, all the preceding preparing for the solution of the following. In 
the third, as well as the fourth year, I think, we were admitted to Professor 
Winthrop s chamber, ... to attend his lectures and experiments in Natural 
Philosophy. Mr. Winthrop also attended the class a few times when they 
were learning Arithmetic, Ward s Mathematics, the book prescribed for 
the scholars use. He touched on a few matters rapidly, the subjects, of 



* This anecdote derives its interest from a circumstance which Colonel Pickering seems 
to have omitted inadvertently, being 1 an early notice of the seriousness which character 
ized his classmate, Josiah Quincy, Junior. The student s blunder having provoked a 
general laugh, the tutor exclaimed (in Latin, supposed to be the language of the recita 
tion-room), " Etiam Quincy ridet." 



12 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1763. 

and looking with as much intenseness of thought as if 
the fate of empires depended upon the right forming 
their plan. 

People are apt to say that cards, as it were, intoxicate 
those that use them, and that thereby they squander away 
their money ; that they are a thief of time ; are apt to raise 
disputes, &c. But what one thing is there which may not 
be used to excess? Are not other diversions subject to 
the same evils, if practised beyond measure and prudence? 
Why then so great an outcry against cards, as if they were 
the only evil? Even the diversion of checkers may be 
abused ; and may persons game and spend their time and 
money at one, so may they at the other. 

I would not forget to acquaint you, Sir, that you were 
misinformed with regard to my playing cards ; and am sfrrry 
I have been the cause (through the ignorance of that block 
head) of any trouble or uneasiness in the breast of so kind, 
so loving a father, from whom any gentle admonitions, 



course, very familiar to him, but to the novitiates it was all Greek. We 
derived no benefit from his remarks. 

" Such was the miserable course of education with Dr. Kneeland s class; 
and now I never see Dr. Hedge (since I learned that he was his son-in-law) 
but I think of, and not without some indignant feelings towards, his father-in- 
law, in suffering four years to be in a great measure wasted in reading the 
few books above mentioned, while he was studying and practising physic. In 
some other classes, some of the first books of Homer s Iliad were read. But 
the New Testament was all the Greek, and Cicero s Select Orations and six 
or eight books of Virgil s 2Eneid were all the Latin, we were required to 
learn, for the purpose of acquiring a knowledge of those languages." 

In a memorandum, made by one of Colonel Pickering s friends, of a con 
versation with him in October, 1828, he is represented as saying that he was 
obliged to write syllogisms ; that about twice a year he declaimed short pieces 
of his own writing ; and that this was all the composition in English, and all 
the declamation, that were required of him ; and that at every Commence 
ment the President (Holyoke) made an address in Latin. It is not improbable 
that this conversation led Colonel Pickering to put in writing his recollections 
of the College as above quoted. 

In an old account-book his whole expense at College (not including 
clothing and "the expense at Commencement") is set down at 121 Is. 9d. 
lawful money, equivalent to $406-45. The penalty of the bond given as secu 
rity for the payment of his quarter bills, "viz., the steward s, glazier s, and 
sweeper s bills," was 15 lawful money.

and regard due to so affectionate a father by your duti 
ful son, 

TIMO. PICKERING. 

H. C. [HARVARD COLLEGE], February 14th, 1763. 

His father replied, 

DEAR SON : Serious men of large experience have 
apprehended that the diversion of playing at cards (all 
things considered) is not expedient. Pike and Hayward 
write upon it, as you may see, in their Cases of Conscience 
judiciously resolved. However pleasant the exercise may 
seem to be to many, yet it is found to be of enchanting 
nature. I hope, above all things, you will seek spiritual 
delights, for they are not only most ravishing, but also most 
essential. All mankind naturally most affect things of 
sense ; but how amazing is it, that rational creatures should 
so much affect earthly pleasures, and neglect the pursuit of 
those joys that are eternal ! You know my mind. You 
have now a price in your hand to get wisdom. I hope God 
will give you an heart to improve it. 

We are all in health, through God s goodness, and hope 
these lines may find you so. Let us hear from you in con 
venient time. 

Your affectionate father, 

TIMOTHY PICKERING. 

SALEM, February 18th, 1763. 

Playing at cards would have been a waste of time 
for one so much occupied in public business and so 
fond of reading and conversation as Mr. Pickering was; 
but I have an impression of seeing him once, and only 
once, take a hand at whist.

CHAPTER II. 

Mr. Pickering assists the Register of Deeds. Cultivates Music. 
His Manner of Reading. His Style of Composition. His 
Services in the Militia. Condition of the Militia. He puts an 
End to a disorderly Practice of Firing. Becomes a leading Whig 
in Salem. Vindicates himself from Reproaches of Tories. 

IMMEDIATELY after leaving college, Mr. Pickering 
began to write as a clerk in the office of John Hig- 
ginson, Register of Deeds for the County of Essex, 
assisting him almost constantly for more than two 
years, and occasionally afterwards until 1774. During 
the same period, Mr. Higginson was likewise the Town 
Clerk of Salem; and in the performance of the duties 
of this office he received frequent aid from Mr. Pick 
ering. 

While a young man, Mr. Pickering devoted much 
time to the cultivation of music. He had a nice ear, 
a soft and pleasing voice, and correct taste. It appears 
that he was the owner of a spinet, and that he took 
a few lessons on the violin; and in 1764 and the two 
following years he gave instruction in sacred music 
to classes in Salem and Marblehead. In 1808 he re 
ceived a letter from the Reverend John Gushing, of 
Ashburnham, who graduated at Harvard College one 
year after him, in which the writer, endeavoring to 
bring himself to Mr. Pickering s remembrance, says, 
" I was one who attended upon the instructions of old 
Mr. Manning to learn to sing, when I was junior, and 
near a dozen of my classmates. But we were more 
indebted to you for our instruction than to our master.

You were the first that introduced treble. Epes Sar 
gent and Benjamin Goodhue, with their boy voices, 
sung it, and as well as females." Mr. Pickering was 
fond of simple music, and had an aversion to pieces 
which excited wonder by the mere rapidity and diffi 
culty of execution.* 

The same sensibility to harmony led him to pay 
great attention to his manner of reading aloud, and to 
his style in composition. His hearers, whether he read 
prose or poetry, were charmed with the just modula 
tion of his voice, and, where the passage demanded an 
exhibition of emotion, its expressive intonations; too 
readily, indeed, would a generous or a pathetic senti 
ment choke his utterance and suffuse his eyes with 
tears.f In writing, while he deemed perspicuity to be 
of paramount importance to every other quality in 
style, he aimed at making his periods agreeable to the

* On this point he was sustained by the high authority of Dr. Burney, 
from whose "Present State of Music in France and Italy," (2d edit., vol. iii. 
pp. 108, 109,) he made the following extracts. Mentioning a convent in 
Italy, and the singing of the nuns, Dr. Burney says : " One of them had an 
excellent voice ; full, rich, sweet, and flexible, with a true shake and ex 
pression ; it was delightful, and left nothing to wish but duration." Then he 
adds : " Besides the organ in this convent for choruses, there was an organ 
and harpsichord together, which was likewise played by one of the nuns ; and 
the accompaniment of that instrument alone, with the heavenly voice above 
mentioned, pleased me beyond description ; and not so much by what it did, 
as by what it did not do : surely one cannot hear too much of such a melliflu 
ous voice. All the jargon of different parts, of labored contrivance, and 
difficult execution, is little better than an ugly mask upon a beautiful face ; 
even harmony itself, upon such occasions, is an evil, when it becomes a sov 
ereign instead of a subject." 

t On hearing a discourse in the pulpit indifferently pronounced, he said he 
would willingly excuse a clergyman from writing a sermon, provided he 
would only read well a good one from a printed volume. Doubtless, in most 
cases, a congregation would derive equal benefit from the services of their 
pastor, and at the same time promote his health and comfort, if, instead of 
tasking his brain to produce two original sermons a week, they would be 
content with one original sermon and one selected. 



16 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKEKING. [1769. 

purity of language, force of expression and grammati 
cal accuracy, he was excelled by few of our writers 
whom the American Revolution brought into notice. 

In January, 1766, Mr. Pickering was commissioned 
by Governor Bernard as lieutenant of the fourth mili 
tary company of foot in Salem, in the first regiment of 
militia in the county of Essex; and in May, 1769, as 
captain of the same company. The character of his 
mind disposed him to make himself thoroughly ac 
quainted with the duties of any office which he might 
take upon himself; and, in addition, the critical rela 
tion of the Colonies to the mother country impressed 
upon him the necessity of having a well drilled and 
disciplined militia. Accordingly, he devoted much 
time to the study of the military art. 

In 1769, still a lieutenant, but assuming the character 
of a very old man, he published two pieces signed "A 
Military Citizen." * In them he urges the importance 
of putting the militia of the Province on a better footing, 
and points out means for accomplishing that end. He 
observes, that formerly not one officer in five was tolera 
bly versed in the manual exercise and the simple evolu 
tions. He describes the proceedings which had been 
usual for many years on training-days. The companies 
were called out four days in the year. He says : 

" The men were ordered to assemble at nine o clock ; and 
perhaps by ten they were all mustered. About this time 
also the officers might make their pompous entrance on 
the parade. . . . The men were ordered to form ; and by 
the time this was effected, and the various disputes among 
the men as to their places, according to each man s humor, 
and such like important matters, were adjusted, the clock 

* In the " Essex Gazette" of the 31st of January and 21st of February. 



. 23.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 17 



might strike eleven. Then the roll was called. ... If the 
training-field was not also the place of parade, they wheeled 
their divisions and began their march majestically slow. 
And here the notable achievements of some intrepid sol 
diers must not be passed over in silence. Did any awkward 
or uncommon figure of a man come in sight of these heroes, 
by a sudden excursion they surprised, surrounded, and for 
a while buried him in fire and smoke ; then, with self- 
approving shouts, and breasts glowing with the thoughts of 
their valorous deeds, they made a gallant retreat, and again 
joined the main body. But never did these undaunted 
souls breathe more heroic ardor, than when some harmless 
maid, some modest fair, drawn by the irresistible power 
of curiosity to see these public shows, made her appearance. 
Then the} 7 summoned all their courage, then they exerted all 
their fire, to fill with dire alarms her tender breast. 

"At length they arrived at the place of exercise, and were 
. . . ready for business by half after eleven, or twelve, 
o clock. Then, if any officer of the company had learnt the 
words of command for the manual exercise, they were given 
to the soldiers; and sometimes, perhaps, a posture-master 
was set for their imitation. . . . This sometimes was re 
peated ; and by that time it w r as necessary to dismiss the 
men ; which, after a volley or two, was accordingly done. 
Thus ended the forenoon. 

"The officers, &c., then retired to a tavern, where an 
elegant entertainment was prepared, and wine and punch 
went round. ... By half after three . . . they were tol 
erably recruited ; and by four the men might be again under 
arms, and were exercised as before. At five o clock they 
might return to the parade, or to the officers quarters, where 
the treat, random fire, and reiterated volleys finished the 
exercises of the day. . . . 

"One day was commonly spent in firing at a mark ; and, 
as for the remaining two, the operations were like those 
before described, in the forenoon. But the afternoons 
were more notably distinguished." 

VOL. L 3 



18 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1769. 

Then, he says, a troop of horse charge fiercely a 
body of foot. 

"The foot divide and open a passage for the bounding 
steeds. The horse drive furious through the lengthened 
lane, beset on either side with fire and smoke. . . . Then 
they renew the fight with redoubled ardor. After this a 
third attack closes the dusty scene. The parties retreat to 
eek refreshment." 

To keep such a militia on foot, Mr. Pickering regards 
as an injury to the Province ; a mischievous expense 
of time, of money, and of ammunition, promoting a 
disregard of all order. To correct the evils, he recom 
mends that the officers should acquaint themselves with 
military discipline ; should meet at certain times for 
mutual instruction ; and should inform the sergeants 
of everything belonging to the duty of a soldier and 
to their offices, so that they also may be able to teach. 

"If the methods of teaching prescribed in the Norfolk 
Exercise be observed, particularly to do it at first in small 
parties, where the motion of every man may be seen and 
every error corrected, they will make a surprising progress 
in a short time. And as the men will by this means be fully 
employed, they will have neither time nor inclination to 
commit the many disorders before mentioned. . . . 

"These are observations founded in fact and experience. 
. . . The officers and sergeants of the several companies [in 
Salem], it seems, have taken pains to acquaint themselves 
with all the parts of exercise most necessary for a militia to 
understand, to wit, the manual exercise and most usual evolu 
tions. And the effects are answerable. Their militia, I have 
been told, is the best in the Province, and perhaps in Amer 
ica ; not only for their military skill, but also for their good 
order and regularity of behavior. But I am further informed, 
that these officers have not stopped here, but still continue 



JEr. 23.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 19 

to meet frequently for conversing about, and perfecting 
themselves in, military matters, that they may the better 
discharge the duty of their offices. . . . And [the fore 
going method] may now be practised with greater success 
than ever, as the militia officers have an opportunity of see 
ing regular troops ; from whom, by an attentive observation, 
they may gather many useful hints, to facilitate their in 
structing the militia; (and fas est et ab hoste doceri.)" 

He observes, that it behooves men of fortune, weight, 
and figure, more than others, to countenance military 
exercises; to take offices in the militia; and this, in 
order to do their country service, and not, as many 
did, merely to obtain titles of honor ; that the neglect 
of gentlemen accepting commissions, however, to qual 
ify themselves to perform their duties, " makes room 
for the operation of one provision in tbe Militia Act, 
in case of alarm; for at such a time the chief officer 
... of each regiment, tben within the limits of it, is 
under no necessity ... to go forth with his regiment 
... to meet the enemy, but may appoint, by writing 
under his hand, some fit person to take his place a 
prudent provision ; " * and that, in consequence of the 
unconcern of men of influence and abilities about 
offices in the militia, commissions have sometimes de 
scended into the lowest hands, and in such cases the 
militia becomes truly contemptible. 

He farther observes : 

"While the French had footing in North America, we 
were perpetually harassed by them, and by the Indians 
through their instigations. But the attacks made by these 
were in the Indian manner ; and, to cope with them, no other 
discipline was necessary than being good marksmen and 
dexterous in skulking behind trees and bushes. ... In the 

* Provincial Act of 1699, 12 William III., c. 1. 



20 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1770. 

late war, Great Britain and the Colonies, with their united 
force, have entirely subdued the French in North America. 
Yes, (God be praised !) we have at length, after many suc 
cessless efforts, expelled those eternal disturbers of our 
peace as well as of the peace of Europe." 

In a future war with Great Britain, he says, France 
will most likely make attacks against our seaports, and 
her regular troops must be met by a well-disciplined 
militia, until succor shall arrive from the mother 
country. 

Although Mr. Pickering makes France the ostensible 
enemy to be opposed by a well-disciplined militia, the 
irritation then prevailing here against Great Britain, 
and the significant Latin quotation, sufficiently intimate 
that he was sounding notes of preparation in view of 
a possible conflict with the mother country, in defence 
of the rights of the American Colonies. 

The " military skill " and the " good order " of the 
Salem militia, which received the commendation of Mr. 
Pickering when writing anonymously, it will readily 
be imagined, were due in a great measure to his own 
exertions. 

The disorderly practice, above mentioned, of firing 
towards individuals, was suppressed through much 
effort on the part of Mr. Pickering, as related by him 
in an article in the "Essex Gazette" in 1770. His chief 
object in that article, however, it will be seen, was to 
vindicate himself from a virulent Tory attack upon 
his conduct and character. Certain pieces, signed 
" Nauticus," published in that paper,* giving an unfa 
vorable "sketch of the behavior and disposition of 
those people [in Salem] called Tories," were ascribed, 
but erroneously, to him. A reply appeared under the 

* September 4th and 18th, and October 9th, 1770. 



2Ei. 25.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 21 

signature of "Y.," in which, addressing "Nauticus," 
(meaning Mr. Pickering,) the writer says : 

" There was a time when the friends of government were 
your friends ; and, if your opinions are since changed, be 
not ashamed to confess, that to popular favor you look for 
subsistence. To stem the torrent of political detraction, 
and boldly to avow sentiments which derive honor to you 
only from their truth, in compensation for the malevolence 
of party, was once your boast; but the prospect is now 
changed ; empty praise was your reward ; sincerity brought 
no emolument; and Nauticas found, to his sorrow, that, 
in these degenerate days, to be good was not to be 
great. . . . You will not blush to declare, that, allured by 
a consideration which influences the greater part of man 
kind, and none more than the herd of clamorous patriots, 
you espoused a contrary cause. . . . The dread of shame 
was an obstacle which I congratulate you on having sur 
mounted ; . . . you may now enjoy the wished-for applause, 
arid reap the virtuous satisfaction of having bartered hon 
esty for interest. ... I leave you for ever to the uninter 
rupted possession of that happiness which can result from 
a consciousness of having stooped to the lowest fraud for 
the vilest purpose, sincerely wishing you every reward that 
divine or human justice shall annex to successful perfidy." * 

Giving an absurd construction to a remark of " Nau- 
ticus," this writer also accused him of atheism. 

Mr. Pickering, having evidence that these reproaches 
were aimed at him, answered them under his own name, 
examining the principles, pretensions, and conduct of 
the Tories, so far as he thought it necessary for his 
own vindication.-}- He says : 

"The Tories, the better sort, the friends of government, all 
which terms denote but one party in Salem, are possessed 
with this false notion, that among more than a thousand

22 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1770. 

Whigs iii this town, there is but one of abilities sufficient to 
write the pieces signed Nauticus : else why are they so un 
willing to believe me ? since I have positively denied my 
being the author. But, though my private asseverations 
have not been fully credited, possibly an open, public decla 
ration will ease their doubting minds. I therefore, in this 
public manner, declare, that I am not the author of the 
pieces signed * Nauticus ; neither was I directly or indi 
rectly concerned in writing them or any of them." 

In conjecturing the reason which induced "Y." to 
enter the lists with "Nauticus/ Mr. Pickering says: 

" It appears to be this : * Y. , firmly believing that I was 
the author of the first piece signed l Nauticus, and being 
conscious that eveVy material fact therein related was true, 
in revenge for my supposed boldness, determined to form a 
character completely infamous, and then palm it upon the 
world as an exact portrait of my mind and actions." 

To the allegation that he had surmounted "the dread 
of shame," he replies : 

" As there never was a moment in nay life in which I did 
not glory in the cause of liberty, . . . that cause in which 
the body of the people in Salem, in this Province, and in 
all America, are so zealously engaged, shame for espousing 
it could not possibly exist." 

On " Y. s " imprecation, that " Nauticus " may enjoy 
"every reward that divine or human justice shall an 
nex to successful perfidy," he remarks : 

"This is the coup de grdce, the completion and per 
fection of another wish openly pronounced by a Tory. 
Understanding that two brothers * had been a little unwell, 
It is a pity, says he, they had not both died; they 
are a couple of worthless fellows ! And what could in- 

* Mr. Pickering and his brother, John Pickering, Junior. 



yET.25.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 23 

duce him to frame this wish? The brothers had never 
hurt a hair of his head, nor spoken of him one disre 
spectful word. It could proceed only from a hellish 
spirit of revenge, because they had virtue enough to disre 
gard the opinions of the great, (who are not always wise,) 
when they thought them incompatible with the liberty and 
happiness of the people ; and because the Tories had not 
been able (according to their hopes) to amass all knowledge 
and learning to themselves.* But this was a vain, ridicu 
lous expectation ; for, if the people are not scholars and 
eloquent orators, they can think justly, and act firmly and 
vigorously, with the spirit of men and of Englishmen. 
Similar to these was another wish of a Tory, I wish to the 
Lord the whole town of Boston might sink this moment. 
(He had just heard they had passed, or were about to pass, 
some firm resolves.) These kind expressions of love to 
their neighbor, for the causes above assigned, the fre 
quent practice of the better sort in all nations, together 
with the declaration of another Tory, * that too many persons 
among us had liberal educations, afford the strongest 
presumption, that, if it were in their power, the Tories 
would deprive the people of knowledge, and reduce them 
to a state of absolute ignorance ; ignorance being truly the 
mother of slavery, though not of devotion." 

Mr. Pickering comments on the arrogance and affec 
tation of the Tories in calling themselves friends of 
government, and asks, 

"For whom was government instituted? Was it solely 
for the aggrandizement of those few, who, by some for 
tunate accident, have been bred in a manner which the 
world calls genteel ? or to protect the lives, liberty, and 
property of the body of the people? Is government 
supported by the better sort 9 On the contrary, has not 

* Mr. Pickering and his brother seem to have been almost the only persons 
in Salem, of a college education, who took a prominent part in Whig meas 
ures before the commencement of the Revolution. 



24 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1770. 

every attack on the laws and constitution proceeded from 
that class? The very phrase, * friends to government is 
invidious, and carries with it an impudent insinuation that 
the whole body of the people, the pretended friends to gov 
ernment excepted, are enemies to government; the bare 
suggestion of which is as ridiculous as it is false. Let us, 
for instance, examine this town. There are in Salem about 
five thousand inhabitants ; and, among this number, perhaps 
forty or fifty of all ranks, sexes, and ages, whom the Whigs 
call Tories, and who distinguish themselves by the terms 
better sort and friends to government. This pitiful number 
being deducted, the remaining four thousand nine hundred 
and fifty are called the scum of the town, the dregs of the 
people. . . . Now, can any person of common sense be 
lieve, that this whole town, forty or fifty excepted, would 
be glad to be reduced to the wretched condition I have just 
mentioned, without government, laws, or order? But per 
haps it will be said that this is not the meaning of the Tories 
when they . . . declare that the body of the people are 
enemies to government, and that all they intend by it is, 
that the people are unwilling to submit to the powers that 
be. Why, this, I believe, is part of their meaning, and in 
one sense it is true ; and then the case will stand thus : 
Americans, unwilling to put on the chains of slavery which 
have been forged for them in the five or six last years, have 
vigorously opposed the diabolical designs formed against 
them, and for this have been called rebels and enemies to 
government. Though it is my firm belief the king has not, 
in any part of his dominions, subjects more loyal than the 
inhabitants of the British Colonies. The Tories among them, 
on the contrary, (being better bred,) have ever stood ready 
... to do what should be thought a decent and respectful 
compliance with the benevolent designs of a wise and vir 
tuous ministry, concerning the freeborn sons of America ; 
and for this have been styled friends to government. But 
they have not been so very obedient and submissive for 
nothing. We may hence be able to solve the question, . . . 



^T. 25.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 25 

how it comes to pass, that, with but few exceptions, all 
those among us who, for five or six years past, have been 
candidates for, or possessed of, offices of honor and profit, 
have shown themselves such zealous * friends to govern 
ment. . . . 

" These, then, are the men, and this the cause, I am said 
to have deserted. And now, admitting that I was once a 
friend to both, and that these * friends of government were 
once my friends, will any honest man will any free 
American blame me for deserting them ? I trust not. 
And, if I am not to blame, then there can be no necessity 
of imputing my desertion to sinister views. . . . 

"But &lt; Y. all along takes for granted, as a fact, what I by 
no means admit. He supposes that once I entirely adopted 
the political opinions of the Tories. But this I utterly 
deny. ... It is true, when we have had accounts of the 
rising of mobs, and of their cruel treatment of some per 
sons, I have expressed my disapprobation of them, and 
been provoked with the excessive timidity, the pusillanim 
ity, of others, who have apprehended themselves in danger 
from them. I have said I would sooner perish on the spot, 
than fly before a headlong mob attacking me without cause ; 
that a few deaths would rouse the real friends to gov 
ernment, and procure solid peace and tranquillity. Also, 
by my accidental situation for three or four years past, I 
frequently fell into the company of the friends of govern- 
ment, and a considerable share of the conversation turned 
upon the wicked, selfish motives of some popular leaders, 
in their opposition to government; (substitute governor 
and ministry ; ) and if what they [the * friends of govern 
ment ] said was true, (and I knew nothing to the contrary,) 
their [the leaders ] motives, I confess, were bad enough; 
and I could then, and so I can now, brand every person 
acting from such motives only, with the name of villain. 
And what then? Does all this prove, that I was at any time 

inclined tamely to acquiesce in every imposition a c t 

m y [corrupt ministry] should please to lay upon

us ; or that I thought the circular letter of the House of 
Assembly of the Province was of an inflammatory nature, 
tendin^ to create unwarrantable combinations, and that the 

o 

House ought to have rescinded the vote which gave rise to 
that letter ; * or that the associations of the merchants and 
people to prevent the importation of British goods was 
illegal and unjustifiable? f Are not the cause of American 
liberty, and the pretended patriotism of its advocates, two 
entirely distinct things? It is true, by often hearing both 
so artfully blended together, at a time when I thought but 
little about the matter, I was sometimes held in suspense ; 
but I never disapproved of the measures above mentioned. 
... If, therefore, I have at no time in my life adopted 
the political opinions of the Tories, it is too obvious to 
remark, that I could not change them, and take up other 
opinions, although all the offices and all the honors and all 
the riches of all the Tories in Salem were to be my reward 
for so doing. . . . 

" But there is not only no foundation for * Y. s charges 
against me, but my whole life, since I appeared on the 
public stage, has been a contradiction to his slanderous 
assertions. I appeal to the whole town, I appeal to the 
Tories themselves, whether, as an officer of the militia for 
five years past, (in which capacity alone I have had an 
opportunity to stem the torrent of popular prejudices, 
boldly to avow sentiments which could derive honor to me 
only from their truth, and to prove that the civium ardor 
prava jubentium could not shake me from my deliberate 
purpose,) whether, I say, in that capacity, I have not 
manifested an utter disregard to mere popular opinions, 
even though they were riveted and strengthened by imme 
morial custom. I will instance in the article of firing. It 
had been the custom in Salem from my earliest remem 
brance, and for fifty or perhaps a hundred years before, to

fire at the officers, under the senseless notion of doing them 
honor. And, not content with this, some would fire at all 
sorts of persons ; and it gave them singular satisfaction 
to make women the objects of their dangerous diversion. 
Nor did strangers escape the hazard and inconvenience of 
their inhuman, inhospitable sport. This base custom I set 
myself to oppose and destroy. The practice appeared to 
me so foolish and unreasonable, that, young and inexperi 
enced as I was with the manners of men, I had no concep 
tion of any difficulty attending the execution of my design. 
Yet I had no sooner begun to exert myself for that end, 
than I had, not the soldiers only, but almost the whole town 
upon my back. I was reproached with being a stiff, obsti 
nate, severe, precise fellow, afraid of gunpowder, a coward, 
and I know not what. Many who did not approve, but 
condemned, the firing, thought, as it had been the practice 
time out of mind, that I was to blame in opposing it. 
But none of these things moved me/ Unintirnidated by 
all the obloquy cast upon me, I still persevered in my de 
sign. I found the practice I was endeavoring to eradicate 
was condemned by many thinking, judicious people. That 
strengthened my hands ; and by degrees I learned to bear 
unmerited reproach without uneasiness ; and at length my 
endeavors, seconded by some of my brethren, have been 
crowned with success, to the no small comfort and quiet of 
the town. That I have not relaxed in my endeavors to form 
an orderly, well-disciplined militia, maugre all opposition, 
the whole town is witness. And the last training-day affords 
a fresh proof, that I have not sought, that I do not seek, pop 
ularity by falling in with the prevailing humor and inclination 
of the people, when that humor and inclination militate with 
truth, with reason, and, in the instance referred to, with the 
rules of the military art. What happened on that day is 
well known in the town, and need not be related.* 



* On some occasion a soldier in Mr. Pickering s company saluted him by 
firing at his feet ; whereupon Mr. Pickering struck him with the flat of his 
sword. It is merely a conjecture that this was " the instance referred to." 



28 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKEKING. [1770. 

" In fine, those who are most intimately acquainted with 
me know, that, at the expense of popularity, and though 
loaded with reproach, I have, with undeviating constancy, 
pursued those measures which I thought and declared to be 
necessary for forming a militia which should answer the end 
of its establishment ; that my ruling principle was to serve, 
and not to please, the militia. But now, if, by proceeding in 
this manner and on this principle, I have at length obtained 
an approbation of my conduct, who can be so unjust, who 
can be so cruel, as to rob me of the only reward of all my 
labor that is in the power of my fellow-citizens to bestow ? 
Yet, in defiance of all these facts, &lt; which were not done in 
a corner, the writer whose signature is &lt;Y. has, with 
wanton malice, declared to the world, that for the sake of 
popular favor I have set at nought my honor, my con 
science, and my God. 

"But some transactions, during this period, for accom 
plishing the design above mentioned, deserve to be related, 
as they will tend to show the vanity and affectation of the 
Tories in pretending they are better and firmer friends to 
government than their neighbors, the Whigs. 

"About a year and a half ago, some strangers, one of 
them a woman, and all on horseback, were passing through 
the town on a training-day morning, just as the soldiers 
were assembling. They were fired at, and thereby, and 
by various motions and flourishes of the guns, their horses 
were excessively frighted, insomuch that the woman was 
in imminent danger of her life. This gross insult was so 
highly resented by some gentlemen, by-standers, that they 
made a regular complaint to a magistrate [a Tory] , praying 
that the offender might be dealt with according to law. 
But 4he complaint was rejected, with some strange answers 
which I have forgot; but the conclusion was, (as the person 
told me who presented it,) the times won t bear it ; or, 
in other words, it having been an old custom, he [the 
magistrate] should displease the people. About the same 
time, a complaint was presented to another magistrate [a 



&T. 25.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKEKING. 29 

Tory] against another person, for the like offence, by one 
who is now aWhig, whatever the Tories may think he was 
then.* But this also was rejected for a reason similar to 
the former. Another reason, it is true, was added, but, in 
my humble opinion, a very frivolous one. 

" To these instances of denial of justice I might add one, 
of the actual violation of the laws by some of the * friends 
of government. But as Nauticus has, in his first essay, 
given a particular account of it, I shall only mention the 
chief circumstances of the affair, viz. : * A committee of 
trade from Boston, coming to Salem to take the minds of the 
people in trade there respecting the importation of goods 
from Great Britain, a person was procured by some of the 
friends to government to carry a message to said committee 
(in order to terrify and oblige them to leave the town) in 
these words, or to this effect, viz. : &lt;That thirty or forty 
men were assembled, and were corning to tar and feather 
them ; and a letter was also sent them importing the same 
thing. As the offence was committed against strangers, the 
Selectmen thought it their prudence and duty to make 
inquiry into the matter, that the offender might be brought 
to justice. For this they were, by one of the * friends of 
government, called informers; and their complaints to the 
magistrates were utterly disregarded. Upon this I shall 
only remark, in the words of an excellent writer, that the 
great as well as the little vulgar are liable to catch the 
spirit of mobbing. 

"I would not have it understood that all who are called 
Tories deserve the same character. . . . Some of them, 
who are in office, discharge their trusts with ability and 
fidelity ; and I congratulate the public for the happiness it 
enjoys in that respect. . . . But I think it cannot be 
thought unreasonable to demand of the Tories, that they 
for the future claim no pre-eminence above their fellow- 
citizens, the Whigs, who are the body of the people, by

the only friends to laws and good government; . . . 
that they no longer treat with contempt the united voice 
of a whole continent, nor pretend that the measure almost 
universally adopted for the preservation of the liberties of 
America, was rash, imprudent, unjust, oppressive, till they 
clearly and plainly show it to be so, and point out a better ; 
that the friends to government, instead of studiously 
avoiding to appear in town-meetings, for the future give 
their attendance, and, in the debates concerning any public 
matters, give their opinions freely ; which, if done with 
moderation, and with a view to prevent any false steps and 
imprudent resolutions, I dare to say they will be heard with 
attention, and, if their proposals are not adopted, at least 
they will be treated with respect. Will the true patriot, 
the real friend to government, because his opinion in pol 
itics has been once disregarded, withdraw himself from the 
community of which he is a member, and, without even 
giving his advice, suffer his fellow-citizens, (at whose pro 
ceedings/ he says, he is alarmed, ) by their hasty, impolitic 
measures, to plunge themselves and their country into irre 
trievable ruin ? No ! &lt; He is the true patriot, whose love 
for the public, is not extinguished, either by their insensi 
bility or ingratitude, but [who] goes on with unwearied 
benevolence in every public-spirited attempt. "

CHAPTER III. 

Mr. Pickering admitted an Attorney at Law. He instructs Militia 
of Marblehead. Applies to be appointed Clerk of the Courts in 
the County of Essex. Elected to Municipal Offices. His 
Controversy with the Rev. Dr. Whitaker. His Controversy 
with Dr. Latham and others about Inoculation for the Small 
pox. His Letter to the Rev. Mr. Weeks. 

AT the December term of the Court of Common 
Pleas for the County of Essex, in 1768, Mr. Pickering 
was admitted an Attorney at Law. I have not been 
able to ascertain with what barrister or counsellor he 
pursued his legal studies ; perhaps with William Pyn- 
chon. He practised but little at the bar, and did not 
attain to distinction as an advocate; and the various 
claims upon his time and attention, as well as his own 
statements, preclude the idea of his having made him 
self a well-read lawyer. Writing, November 19th, 1 773, 
to one who sought his professional services, he says, 

" I thank you for your good opinion of me, and readiness 
to intrust me with the care of your affairs mentioned in your 
letter of the llth instant. I should be unworthy of that 
confidence, if I did not confess to you, that I do not pre 
tend to an accurate knowledge of the law, and that several 
years are elapsed since I applied myself to it ; for your 
sake, therefore, and my own honor, I decline engaging in a 
matter which may be involved in the intricacies of the law." 

In 1771, a militia company in Marblehead made ap 
plication to Mr. Pickering to instruct them ; to whom 
he replied, that it would be advisable, in the first place, 



32 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1772. 

to examine whether there were a sufficient number 
of a determined resolution to persevere in the exer 
cise till they should attain to some good degree of 
perfection ; in which case he would assist them ; other 
wise it would not be worth while for the company or 
for himself to make a beginning.* 

In the following characteristic letter to Andrew 
Oliver, one of the Justices of the Court of Common 
Pleas for the County of Essex, Mr. Pickering expressed 
a desire to be appointed a joint Clerk, with Mr. Bow- 
ditch, of the courts in that county. He had previously 
made up a portion of the records of the Court of Com 
mon Pleas and of the Court of Sessions. He failed, 
however, of obtaining the appointment. 

" SALEM, July 8th, 1772. 
SIR : 

" An application so late as this will not, I hope, be 
deemed to arise from a want of respect, or be produc 
tive of any disadvantage to me ; nor an address in writing 
thought less decent than a personal one. The latter I have 
sometimes supposed most proper, but several reasons de 
termined me to make the former. In that way I can deliver 
my sentiments more clearly; and (if they merit considera 
tion) they may be considered more calmly and deliberately. 
Besides, the request may be granted or denied with more 
ease both to the petitioner and the judge ; for to a benevo 
lent mind it must give pain to refuse even what ought to be 
refused; and a man of liberal and generous sentiments 
would choose rather that his justice or his bounty should be 
manifested in his actions, than in the warmest professions 
of favor or friendship. 

" You must, Sir, ere now apprehend the design of this 
letter, if you have never heard that I am desirous of being 
appointed joint Clerk with Mr. Bowditch. This, I find, 

* An article by the late Samuel Swett, Esq., in the "Boston Daily Adverti 
ser," states that the militia of Marblehead were in fact drilled by Mr. Pickering.

would be agreeable to him, and, if I had his leave, would 
urge it as an argument in my favor. I am sensible, Sir, 
there are other candidates for the office, who have doubtless 
severally importuned your favor in their behalf. But per 
mit me, Sir, to say, that I know but one case in which favor 
can properly take place : that is, where there are two or 
more candidates of exactly similar pretensions, whose quali 
fications and circumstances are in nothing different. In any 
other case, to ask the office as a matter of favor I should 
think was paying but an ill compliment to the person 
requested to grant it ; for it must impeach either his 
understanding or his justice. The power of conferring this 
office, I take it, is vested in the Judges, not to give them 
an opportunity of gratifying a friend or favorite, but that 
they should place it in such hands as are most likely to do 
the public the best service, by an exact and diligent per 
formance of the duties of it. 

"Can you forgive this freedom, Sir? I own it is a style 
unusual from the mouth of a petitioner. But should I 
address an honest man of delicate sentiments with fawning 1 

o 

adulation and servile importunity ? Or should I be thought 
vain, were I to confess myself incapable of using such con 
temptible means of supplying my wants? Good Sir, after 
your voluntary, disinterested interposition in my favor in 
a military concern, (for which I sincerely honor and thank 
you,) I should esteem it a gross affront with servile sub 
mission to sue to you for the office as a matter of favor, 
except in the case before mentioned. Here, therefore, both 
for your honor and my own, I choose to rest the matter; 
and with your determination, be it for or against me, I shall 
remain satisfied. I request the office merely to procure me 
a living, not to add to thousands already in possession. In 
my present situation, I must own, I have enough ; but 
without more I shall for ever be excluded from the dearest 
connection in life. Excuse, I pray you, this liberty; and 
believe me to be, with sincere respect, your most obedient 

servant.

34 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1772-77. 

In 1772 and the five following years Mr. Pickering 
was elected one of the Selectmen and of the Assessors 
of the town of Salem, and, in 1774 and the two follow 
ing years, the Town Clerk. 

On the 18th of May, 1773, the inhabitants of Salem 
chose him one of a committee of five persons to con 
sider what was proper to be done respecting a commu 
nication from the town of Boston on the State of the 
Rights of the Colonists. A report was made on the 7th 
of June, being a long letter, draughted by him, to the 
Boston Committee of Correspondence.* The report 
asserts the right of towns, in their corporate capacity, 
to meet and represent the grievances which affect the 
community, and them as parts of it, and to endeavor 
to get them redressed. 

On the llth of June, 1773, the town voted that 
the Selectmen should be requested and directed, if 
occasion should happen, to act as a Committee of Cor 
respondence till the town should choose a special com 
mittee for that purpose. On the 17th of May, 1774, 
such a committee was chosen, consisting of nine per 
sons, Mr. Pickering being one of them. On the 13th 
of March, 1775, thirty persons, including him, his 
brother John, and his brothers-in-law George Williams 
and Israel Dodge, were chosen a Committee of Safety. 
On the same day a committee of five, including him, 
was chosen, on minute men and the mounting of field- 
pieces. The persons on the Committee of Corre 
spondence, elected the 13th of March, were on the 
llth of July made a Committee of Safety and Cor 
respondence. Again, on the 16th of October, thirty 
persons were chosen a Committee of Safety and

Gazette " of June 14th.

Correspondence, Mr. Pickering being the one first 
named. In March, 1776, he was chairman of a Com 
mittee (consisting of fifteen persons) of Correspondence. 
Inspection and Safety. Being a more correct and able 
writer than most of his associates on these committees, 
and being always ready to perform more than his share 
of any labor, the burden of corresponding with other 
towns fell, of course, chiefly upon him. 

These qualities gave him a prominence in some of 
the local quarrels in Salem and its vicinity; while 
his exertions to reform abuses exposed him to much 
calumny. 

The Third Church in Salem, of which Mr. Pickering, 
his father, and three of his brothers-in-law were mem 
bers, invited, by a unanimous vote, the Rev. Nathaniel 
Whitaker, D. D., of Norwich, Connecticut, to become 
their pastor. Dr. Whitaker was desirous of changing 
the form of their church government from Congrega 
tional to Presbyterian; to which change the church 
gave a qualified assent, reserving to the church and to 
each member, in case of controversy, the right of 
appeal to an ecclesiastical council from the vicinity, 
and to each person the choice of being judged by the 
"brotherhood," rather than by the minister and elders. 
In accordance with these terms, Whitaker was settled 
as their minister in 1769 ; but he soon exhibited an 
arrogant and domineering temper, and departed from 
the spirit of his engagement. In consequence, dissen 
sions arose in the church, and fourteen members mani 
fested a desire, and claimed the right, of returning to 
unmixed Congregationalism. A long controversy, with 
crimination and recrimination, was carried on orally and 
in written correspondence, and at length in the news 
papers, between Whitaker, on the one side, and Mr. 



36 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1774. 

Pickering, in behalf of the disaffected members, on the 
other. The advantage in argument was decidedly 
with Mr. Pickering. The result of the controversy 
was, that the connection of himself and others with 
the church was dissolved in the latter part of 1774 or 
beginning of 1775: he had, however, as early as 1772, 
ceased to attend public worship under Whitaker s min 
istry, being not only disgusted with the conduct and 
character of the man, but also disliking his Calvinistic 
doctrines and his style of preaching. 

At that time the Trinitarian controversy had not 
engaged the attention of Mr. Pickering. He had been 
brought up in the belief of the doctrine of the Trinity, 
and never heard the truth of it called in question 
until after he had joined the army in 1777; when one 
day he was startled by the remark of the late Peter S. 
Du Ponceau, on some questionable statement, that " he 
would as soon believe the doctrine of the Trinity." 
This induced Mr. Pickering to read on the subject, 
and he thereupon became, and continued through life, a 
Unitarian. Without bigotry, he was a reverent believer 
in Christianity, never trifling with things sacred. 

In October, 1772, Mr. Pickering asked for a dismis 
sion from Whitaker s church, (the certificate of which 
dismission, in the usual form, would have operated as 
a recommendation of him to f other churches;) but it 
was not granted, Whitaker objecting that he had not 
given reasons for his request, although at the same 
time a dismission was granted to other persons, and no 
reason demanded. Mr. Pickering inquires, * 

"Why this partiality, Doctor? Was it from a tender 
concern for me, lest Mr. Dunbar s church should refuse me 

* In a " Supplement to the Essex Gazette " of March 15th, 1774. 



JET. 28.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 37 

admission, unless I came recommended from you as sound 
in the faith 9 On the contrary, Doctor, do you not know, 
if Mr. D unbar and his church were as great bigots about 
points of faith as some I could name, that a recommenda 
tion of me as sound in your faith would be a fatal bar to my 
admission there ? Did any one object to my moral char 
acter ? Did not you acknowledge that it stood fair ? " 

Subsequently a hearing before the church was ap 
pointed in the case of a dispute between Whitaker and 
one of the members of his church, and, at the earnest 
request of the latter, Mr. Pickering consented to attend 
the meeting. He says, 

" Before this, Doctor, I had been importuned, by many 
of the brethren, to lend them my assistance under the diffi 
culties subsisting between you and them. I thought they 
had been injured, and assured them they should have it. 
As soon as the meeting was opened, (January 15th, 1773,) 
you addressed yourself to me, and said I had (at such a 
time) asked for a dismission, and you desired to know 
whether I would not renew my request. I told you I had, 
at the time referred to, satisfactory reasons for my request; 
but now had very good ones for omitting to renew it. You 
urged the matter with some warmth, wishing, no doubt, 
now to have me dismissed ; but, finding me immovable, you 
dropped the dispute." 

In a long article in the " Essex Gazette " of March 
8th, 1774, Whitaker mentions the disaffection of "Mr. 
Tim. Pickering, Jun., and his connections, among whom 
he is, as it were, all in all." He also says, 

" It is easy to make men offenders for a word, and fix on 
such instances of frailty as are common to men, especially 
when under great trials and abuses : of these they may find 
many in me, and perhaps may magnify them into great 



38 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1774. 

crimes ; and even for these I desire to be humbled, as well 
as for greater faults which lie out of their sight." 

He had complained to the elders of his church, that 
Mr. Pickering had made allegations against his temper 
and conduct. In Mr. Pickering s reply * is the follow 
ing passage : 

" You tell the world, Doctor, you have two credible wit 
nesses to prove that I said I would not take a dismission 
from your church till I had got my will, or would tarry 
there to plague you, or words to that effect/ Considering 
the manner in which, from undiscerning men, you some 
times extort confessions, I am not surprised at your saying 
you have such witnesses. But if, instead of two witnesses, 
you had two hundred, I should not fear to declare I never 
uttered the words above mentioned. But the phrase i till I 
had got my will indicates such a sentiment as never yet 
found place in my heart, and therefore, I am confident, never 
dropped from my tongue. I have told you already for what 
reasons I declined taking a dismission. They are the true 
reasons. And tis not in your power, Doctor, to prove 
aught against me which shall induce the public to doubt my 
sincerity in the declaration. You, and perhaps some other 
readers, may charge me with vanity for what I have just 
been saying. But, Doctor, I am ashamed of, I despise, the 
deep confessions of heinous sins, without naming one, which 
are ever at the tongue s end with some men, who intend, 
no doubt, by this false humility, to impress on the mind of 
the hearer a strong sense of the meekness and contrition 
of their hearts. These confessions are the offspring of 
gloomy, and sometimes of wicked, minds, and inculcated 
as the highest duty by priests of the like cast ; in conse 
quence of which, many are induced to make them, even 
though they belie their own consciences in so doing. But 

* In a " Supplement to the Essex Gazette" of March 15th, 1774. 



MT. 28.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKEKING. 39 

I would not, Doctor, presume to suggest this was your case 
in your public confession, printed in the last Gazette, where 
you say, that, besides frailties common to men, you are 
guilty of greater faults, which lie out of their sight." 

A subject in which the people of Salem were deeply 
interested inoculation for the small-pox occasioned 
another controversy between Dr. Whitaker and Mr. 
Pickering, in which both parties indulged themselves 
in personal reflections.* 

In September, 1773, the small-pox broke out in 
Salem. Subscriptions to the amount of 1000 were 
made, by a number of the inhabitants, for the purpose 
of erecting a hospital, which was to be entirely under 
the regulation of the town ; and the subscribers were 
to be reimbursed out of the fees paid b}^ the patients. 
The hospital was built accordingly, and Mr. Pickering 
was chosen one of the overseers. Previously to this 
time, Richard Sutton, in England, had laid claim to 
improvements in the mode of inoculation and treat 
ment of the disease, for which he was made a baronet ; 
and James Latham, surgeon to the King s (or Eighth) 
Regiment of foot, professing to be connected with Sut 
ton, was now practising the " Suttonian Inoculation," at 
Livingston s Manor, " New York Government," and had 
acquired extensive reputation from dispensing there, 
and in other parts of America, " the advantages of the 
above easy and successful method of inoculation." 
According to this method, the incision was made with a

40 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1774 

lancet dipped in the small-pox virus, without a thread ; 
and it was pretended that, in the treatment of the dis 
ease, the use of mercury was avoided. In compliance 
with the general wish of the inhabitants of Salem, Mr. 
Pickering went, in November, to the Province of New 
York, and engaged the services of Latham for the hos 
pital. At that time he thought the Suttonian to be 
the best method of inoculation. A writer, however, 
in the " Essex Gazette," * freely declared- his opinion, 
that it was a mere imposture, and that Latham and 
other Suttonians, by their bold pretensions to a mighty 
secret, to a most extraordinary method of inoculation, 
were basely practising upon the credulity of the com 
munity, in order to fill their pockets ; and he com 
mended the practice of Dr. Hall Jackson, who was 
inoculating in the hospital belonging to Marblehead. 
In an answer to this piece, which Mr. Pickering wrote 
for a Suttonian advocate, but which expressed his own 
sentiments at the time, he says, "Dr. Latham, I am 
told, is to attend Salem Hospital. I am content, there 
fore, to rest the merits of the cause upon the event," 
Abiding by this test, he changed his opinion of La 
tham s practice, and conceived it to be his duty to 
expose it as an imposture. In consequence, he wrote 
and published a piece signed "A Lover of Truth." f It 
was soon well known, however, that he was the author, 
a fact which he took no pains to conceal. He thus 
became involved in a newspaper controversy with 
Latham and his friends, who treated him with much 
asperity and personal abuse; to whom he replied, 
under the same signature of "A Lover of Truth," 
with more moderation, but yet with a sufficient degree 

* Of November 2d, 1773. 

t In the "Essex Gazette" of February 15th, 1774. 



JET. 28.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKEKING. 41 

of severity. The following passage, in his fourth num 
ber,* testifies to his public spirit and disinterested 
benevolence : 

"But who could imagine that P. H., of all men, would 
charge me with a breach of trust? Has he forgot his zeal 
ous attempt to apply a fund established for inoculating the 
poor, to raise the fees of Dr. Latham? to raise them above 
the sum for which he had agreed to attend the hospital, a 
sum already far beyond his merit? and so to pervert the 
good, the benevolent, the charitable designs of its founders? 
And must I, must others, be called narrow and contracted 
because we refused assent? Are my subscribing more 
largely to the hospital, according to my ability, than many 
others, and spending nearly the whole of three months in 
its service without a farthing s reward, indubitable proofs 
of a contracted mind? If not, on what do P. H. and his 
associates ground their bold, injurious assertion? Is it on 
this, that I have been less disposed than they to acquire 
the name of generous, by lavishing the public money? to 
expose the patients to the most unreasonable extortion? 
and to grind the face of the poor to supply myself with 
the means of riot and extravagance? Or on this, that a 
large portion of my life has been spent in the service of 
my friends, my fellow-citizens, and my country, without 
other reward than the actions themselves could yield to a 
benevolent mind? If these things will not support the 
charge, I am ignorant where they will fix it." 

In his fifth and last address to the public, as "A 
Lover of Truth," ) he writes, 

" The important points which, for the safety of my fellow- 
citizens and countrymen, I have endeavored to establish, are 
these :

" 1. That, notwithstanding all insinuations and assertions 
to the contrary, mercury is the basis of the Suttonian 
method of inoculation. 

" 2. That the pretensions of the Suttonians to new and 
immensely valuable discoveries in the art of inoculation, 
beyond all that was known, not in Europe only, but even 
in America, were barefaced lies ; and, therefore, 

" 3. That the Suttonians are a company of impudent im 
postors, and ought, of consequence, to be marked out to the 
public as objects of its just abhorrence and contempt. 

"4. It appeared to me highly important, that Dr. La 
tham in particular, as Button s chief craftsman in America, 
and whose practice had been attended with such fatal mis 
chiefs, should be painted in such striking colors, that even 
the most simple, by his vain boastings, might no more be 
deluded." 

These strong allegations were sustained by satisfac 
tory proofs. Mr. Pickering was ably supported by two 
of his friends, the Eev. Asa Dunbar, who published 
an article signed " A Friend to the Public/ * and Dr. 
Joseph Orne, who published one or more pieces, under 
the signature of " Marcellus." f Though Mr. Pickering 
was aware, when he began the attack on the Suttonian 
method, that he was on the unpopular side of the 
question, J yet he seems not to have anticipated the 
outpouring of vituperation and scurrility which were 

* " Essex Gazette," March 15th, 1774. 

f In the course of the controversy it was intimated, that any substantial 
improvement in inoculation, as practised by Sutton, had been derived from 
this country; and "Marcellus" says, "The success of American inocula 
tion has given the amazing reputation which the art deserves and enjoys."

Inoculation. 

I " A Friend to the Public " (the Rev. Mr. Dunbar) says, " The Lover of 
Truth, therefore, in administering this discipline, though he has been incon 
sistently accused of seeking popularity, is engaged in an undertaking, which, 
when he began to write, was almost as unpopular as religion itself." 



MT. 28.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 43 

lavished upon him; and he was chagrined to find it 
more difficult to change the public opinion than he had 
imagined, Latham continuing to be upheld by many of 
the most influential inhabitants of Salem. The follow 
ing extracts from his correspondence, on this same 
subject, show his habits of thinking at that time, and 
how grateful to him was the encouragement he received 
from his friends. 

To his cousin, the Eev. Mr. Weeks, the Episcopal 
clergyman at Marblehead, he wrote, 

" SALEM, March 2d, 1774. 

"... You may remember, a meeting of the subscribers 
to our hospital was notified in the last week s Gazette. 
My intention in this was, by a true representation of 
Latham s conduct, to get him cashiered. But Prince, I 
suppose, from the little ceremony with which I have long 
treated his dear crony and brother doctor, suspected my 
design, and mustered the whole posse of Lathamites, the 
Curwens, the Pickmans, the Yanses, the Kouths, the Spar- 
hawks, and others of less blustering note. ... A full 
meeting was what I desired. But I little expected to stand 
alone. For, though I had many well-wishers, who had as 
thorough a contempt for Latham as I, yet some of them 
never speak in public, and others who do (Mr. Pynchou 
and Mr. Goodale in particular) were silent as the seats 
they sat on ; and scarcely ten words were spoken against 
the impudent impostor, but by me. . . . After some 
other matters were despatched, Latham was brought upon 
the carpet, and many fine things were spoken in his praise. 
He was a gentleman, a man of sense, honor, and integrity ; 
twas he who &lt; would do most credit to the hospital ; nay, 
one of the herd, who is apt to make fine speeches, declared, 
4 that on him the salvation of the hospital depended. My 
answers sufficiently intimated the contrary to be true. . . . 
Curwen said, that pains had been taken to hurt Latham s 
character, evidently meaning by me. I then informed the 



44 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1774. 

subscribers, that, so far from endeavoring to hurt Dr. 
Latham, I had concealed many stories I heard, on my jour 
ney, to his discredit ; because, as people s hearts were set 
upon him, I was unwilling to throw any discouragements 
in the way ; and I then supposed him well enough qualified 
for an inoculator. * What are these stories ? said one and 
another. * Let us hear them. So I rehearsed them. But 
they were made light of. And yet some, or one, of his 
adherents asked why they were not told at first. And I 
have heard, since the meeting, repeatedly, that I am up 
braided for concealing those very things, which, after they 
were made known, and after all or most of Latham s im 
postures and lies had been clearly detected, did not prevent 
his being more firmly established, so far as the vote of the 
subscribers, with only one or two dissenting voices, could 
do it. Such absurd, such unreasonable conduct would 
once have surprised me greatly ; and I must confess I was 
disappointed ; for I had heard so much fault found with 
Latham, that I had no conception of a possibility of his 
being so strongly supported. Nor would he have been, but 
for his extensive fame, which, though acquired by such dis 
honest means, numbers were not ashamed to discover their 
readiness to turn to their own emolument. . . . Since I 
entered on the public stage, (which was in my twentieth 
year,) and observed the conduct of mankind, I have seen 
such, almost daily, examples of inconsistency ; of a blind 
attachment to established customs, however absurd and 
mischievous, and for attempting to eradicate which I have 
incurred the reproaches of the people ; so much craft ; so 
general a pursuit of wealth and honor, by any means ; so 
much pusillanimity; so much of that fear which, as the 
wise man says, bringeth a snare, that I blame myself 
for being surprised at any event which depends on such 
dishonest, such precarious principles ; and which yet, to 
the disgrace of humanity, and in contempt of the pure and 
rational religion they so zealously profess to admire, seem 
to actuate the minds of most men. From these considera- 



. 28.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 45 



, and also because my designs to serve my fellow- 
citizens have been so often frustrated, or their execution has 
so far fallen short of my intention and my ideas of perfec 
tion in those cases, through the perverseness of men, even 
of those who would receive at least a partial benefit, I have 
sometimes been almost sick of the world. For though, by 
being often calumniated, I have learned to bear unmerited 
reproach, and may say with truth of my malicious adver 
saries, that their shafts fly harmless, yet it is perhaps 
impossible for the most heroic absolutely to escape uneasi 
ness. I do not now feel the least pain from the notoriously 
false charges and vile suggestions against me in the last, 
and in this week s paper ; yet, on the first perusal, I was, 
for a few moments, in some degree unhappy. Nothing 
but the uniform, inflexible rectitude of my conduct has 
supported me. Here, indeed, I have reason to triumph. 
Every considerable instance of opposition during my life 
has eventually disgraced my opposers. Latham s zealous, 
bigoted, interested abettors are already seized with shame 
and remorse, and confess their errors. I feel more sensibly 
than ever, that TRUTH is great and irresistible; and I enjoy 
all the pleasures of a complete victory, allayed only by a 
reflection on the piteous situation of my principal hero. 

"As there is an end of poor Latham, if our hospital 
should be continued we must seek a physician. I have no 
thought of any but Dr. Jackson, and am informed he is 
ready to attend on very generous terms. At our March 
meeting, which, I suppose, will be next Monday sennight, I 
expect a strong opposition to its continuance ; but moderate 
fees for the physician might have considerable influence on 
the middling and poor people. I should be glad, therefore, 
to know the terms on which Dr. Jackson, in the frankness, 
the generosity, and the humanity of his disposition, would 
consent to attend. 

" Dr. Latham s punishment, though severe, yet I trust 
you will judge no more than adequate to his offences. With 
my first piece he was continually tormented. Some of the

Beverly patients told Dr. Orne, that he was often storming 
about it, and walked the platform several nights in mere 
rage ; and he told Colonel Fowle I was l a damned rascal. * 
If he was so stung then, what must be his resentment now? 
If we were in the army, I should expect the fashionable 
compliment. Whether I shall escape, even here, is a mat 
ter of some doubt with me. But, though I should be 
unwilling to hazard my life with a villain, and think it the 
highest absurdity to put honor in the balance with a brawny 
arm, or to measure truth with the length of a sword, and 
should, therefore, refuse a challenge ; and although life is 
upon the whole agreeable, and I could wish to live for 
many years to come, }^et death is not the most frightful 
monster ; for he who is afraid to die ought to be afraid to 
live, and must, in fact, be in constant terror. But neither 
death nor life does much distress me. Few are the bands 
which tie me down to earth, and the principal happiness 
which here can be enjoyed springs from the social inter 
views and cordial amity of friends." 

To the Rev. Asa D unbar he wrote as follows, on 
the 14th of March, 1774, addressing him as "my best 
friend/ and commending him for his disdain of impos 
ture and deceit, and as belonging to a class of persons 
sometimes called imprudent, because they dare to think 
for themselves, and to speak what they think. 

" This imprudence sometimes runs them into difficul 
ties, through the perverseness of mankind. But, to use 
the words of Dr. Mead, &lt; the consciousness of doing right 
is beyond all praise, (I add, and superior to censure,) carry 
ing with it its own reward ; and this he always enjoys who 
consults the public good, and, by his actions, shows that he 
thinks he is born, not for himself, but for the whole world. 

* Mr. Pickering was much amused by one of his expressions, namely, 
" Damn the Lover of Truth. " 



MT. 26.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 47 

Such sentiments have enabled me, times without number, 
calmly to bear unmerited reproach. Such sentiments roused 
the Lover of Truth to action. You know the consequence. 
But your approbation, the approbation of a mind so enlight 
ened, of a virtuous, brave, and independent spirit, is suffi 
cient to console me for the contempt of half mankind. 
This may look like flattery : but I speak my sober senti 
ments. To-morrow you give the world a noble testimony 
of the motives and manner of my writing*.* When I read 
it, my heart expanded with grateful joy." 

The foregoing letter to Mr. Weeks intimates the 
possibility of a challenge from Dr. Latham. From the 
following laconic epistles, it may be inferred that, 
if violence was not designed, it was at least appre 
hended : 

" SALEM HOSPITAL, March 19th, 1774. 

" To CAPTAIN PICKERING. 

" SIR : I beg you will do me the favor to meet me at 
Mr. Goodhue s tavern, next Monday, about half an hour

what time after five o clock, in the afternoon, you can be

this request, I shall be able to give you a further answer. 
At present, I can only assure you that 

" I am, Sir, 

" TIMOTHY PICKERING, JR." 

These controversies, although of little interest at the 
present day, were, no doubt, permanently useful to 
Mr. Pickering, as exercises contributing to give him a 
facility in composition, and as discipline fitting him to 
bear, with more equanimity, the undeserved reproaches 
of political opponents at subsequent periods of his life. 
One of his antagonists, after the excitement respecting 
Latham had subsided, testified his regret for the pain 
he must have given Mr. Pickering by the harsh stric 
tures he had made concerning him ; but Mr. Pickering 
told him they had caused him very little uneasiness. 
At this statement, the gentleman expressed surprise, 
for Mr. Pickering s severe remarks, he said, produced 
quite a different effect upon him. " Yes," said Mr. 
Pickering, " and I will tell you the reason : my pen 
was pointed with truth."

CHAPTEE IV. 

Address from Salem to Governor Gage on the Boston Port Bill. 
The Governor s Answer. Mr. Pickering s Interviews with the 
Governor. Arrest of Members of the Salem Committee of 
Correspondence. Mr. Pickering elected Register of Deeds ; 
also, a Colonel in the Militia. Colonel Leslie s Expedition to 
Salem to seize Cannon. 

WHILE taking a prominent part in these local contro 
versies, Mr. Pickering was not inactive in concerns of 
greater magnitude, affecting deeply all the British Colo 
nies in America. The Boston Port Bill, by which that 
port was shut against commerce, and the seat of gov 
ernment was transferred from Boston to Salem, went 
into operation on the 1st of June, 1774. An Address, 
written by him, and signed by one hundred and 
twenty-five inhabitants of Salem, and on the 18th of 
June presented by him to Governor Gage, will be 
given below. But, as a preliminary, I quote a passage 
relating to it,* which I presume is from the pen of 
Edmund Burke : 

" The day after the dissolution of the Assembly, a most 
pathetic, but, at the same time, firm and manly, Address 
was presented, from the merchants and freeholders of the 
town of Salem, to the Governor. We cannot forget that 
this town was now become the temporary capital of the 
Province, in the place of Boston ; and that the General 
Assembly, the Courts of Justice, the Custom House, and, 

* Annual Register for 1775, pp. 8, 9.

50 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1774. 

so far as it could be done by power, the trade of that port, 
were removed thither; so that they were already in pos 
session of a principal share of those spoils, which, it was 
supposed, would have effectually influenced the conduct of 
that people, and thereby have bred such incurable envy, 
jealousy, and animosity, between the gainers and sufferers, 
that the refractory capital, finding herself abandoned, and 
being left alone to ruminate upon her forlorn situation, 
would soon be reclaimed, and brought to as full a sense of 
her duty as of her punishment. 

" Whether this opinion was founded upon a thorough 
knowledge of human nature in general, or took its rise 
from particular instances, which were extended in specula 
tion to the whole, may, perhaps, in a certain degree, be 
determined from the following generous sentiments of the 
inhabitants of Salem. They say, * We are deeply afflict 
ed, &c.* 

" The whole Address is remarkable for the propriety with 
which it is conducted, and the justness of its sentiments. 
They treat the Governor with the highest respect, and hope 
much from his general character, as w r ell as from his con 
duct in a former government ; they express the strongest 
attachment to the mother country, the deepest concern for 
the present unhappy troubles, and the most fervent wishes 
for a speedy and happy reconciliation, to obtain which they 
are willing to sacrifice everything compatible with the safety 
and dignity of British subjects." f 

* Here are recited the second paragraph of the Address, and the first sen 
tence of the third, as printed below. 

t In Almon s " Remembrancer," Vol. II. p. 22, the Address is published with 
these remarks : ... " Though this was prior to the commencement of 
our publication, yet, as it hath been highly commended for the sound sense it 
contains, the dignity of the sentiments, the noble, manly, and sober spirit of 
the expressions, an obliging correspondent has desired it may be preserved 
in this work. . . . Our readers will thank us for exhibiting it as a piece 
of generous disinterestedness also, and an honorable contrast to the conduct 
of some towns in this kingdom, and in Ireland, who endeavored, with an un 
feeling and savage avarice, to enrich themselves with the wreck of the New 
England fishery." See also Ramsay s " American Revolution," Vol. 1. 124. 



^T. 28.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 51 

The following is the Address. 

" MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 

" We, who are merchants and freeholders in the town of 
Salem, beg leave to present to you our dutiful respects on 
your appointment to the government of this Province. The 
universal tribute of thanks and applause paid you for the 
wisdom, mildness, and exact regularity of your conduct in 
another command, cannot fail to excite the most just expec 
tations that this Province will enjoy the happy fruits of your 
benignity. 

" We are deeply affected with a sense of our public calam 
ities ; but the miseries that are now rapidly hastening on 
our brethren in the capital of the Province greatly excite 
our commiseration ; and we hope your Excellency will use 
your endeavors to prevent a further accumulation of evils 
on that already sorely distressed people. 

" By shutting up the port of Boston, some imagine that 
the course of trade might be turned hither, and to our 
benefit; but Nature, in the formation of our harbor, forbids 
our becoming rivals in commerce to that convenient mart : 
and, were it otherwise, we must be dead to every idea 
of justice, lost to all the feelings of humanity, could we 
indulge one thought to seize on wealth and raise our for 
tunes on the ruin of our suffering neighbors. But, so far 
from receiving a benefit, we are greatly injured by the 
shutting up the harbor of Boston, as it deprives us of a 
market for much the largest part of our West India imports ; 
and there is not a town in the Province but will feel the 
ill effects of it. Permit us, then, Sir, to apply to your 
clemency and justice to afford us every alleviation in your 
power, and to procure for us every possible relief from this 
extensive mischief. 

" We account it the greatest unhappiness that this Prov 
ince, which has ever been foremost in loyalty to the Kings 
of Britain, in its efforts to defend their territories and 
enlarge their dominions, should be the first to feel our 
Sovereign s severest displeasure. Our fathers fled from 



52 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1774. 

oppression, braved every danger, and here began a settle 
ment on bare creation. Almost incredible are the fatigues 
and difficulties they encountered to subdue a dreary wilder 
ness, filled with savage beasts, and yet more savage men ; 
but, by their invincible resolution, they rose superior to 
them all, and, by their astonishing efforts, greatly facili 
tated the settlement of the other British Colonies in Amer 
ica. Yes, Sir, we speak it with grief, the sons are checked 
and dishonored for exhibiting proofs of their inheriting some 
portion of that spirit which, in their fathers, produced such 
astonishing effects. 

" A happy union with Great Britain is the wish of all the 
Colonies. It is their unspeakable grief that it has, in any 
degree, been interrupted. We earnestly desire to repair 
the breach. We ardently pray that harmony may be re 
stored. And, for these ends, every measure compatible 
with the dignity and safety of British subjects we shall 
gladly adopt. 

" We assure your Excellency we shall make it our con 
stant endeavor to preserve tha peace and promote the wel 
fare of the Province ; and hereby we shall best advance the 
interest of our Sovereign. 

" In these times, the administration of government must 
be peculiarly arduous and difficult ; but yours we wish may 
be as easy as the nature of things will possibly admit, and 
the event happy ; and that your public labors may be 
crowned with the noblest reward, the voluntary, disin 
terested applause of a whole free people." * 

* The Governor made the following answer. 

"GENTLEMEN : 

" I thank you for the obliging expressions towards me contained in your 
Address, and be assured it will always afford me sincere pleasure to be of use 
to the inhabitants of this town, or any individuals in the Province. 

" I feel, as well as you, the inconveniences that the inhabitants must suffer 
from shutting up the port of Boston, and should be glad if they would co 
operate with my endeavors to extricate themselves from them ; but, without 
their assistance, I can take no step towards their relief. I am sorry that the 
people of that capital should have given such repeated provocations to the 



^T. 29.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 53 

Mr. Pickering also draughted an address to the Gov 
ernor, from the Court of Common Pleas and the Court 
of Sessions. 

Subsequently, in a printed letter to Governor Sulli 
van, dated April 22d, 1808, (page 23d,) Mr. Pickering 
says, 

" Another incident it may not be improper to mention. 
While the seat of government remained at Salem, I re 
ceived a note from the Secretary of the Province, informing 
me that the Governor wished to see me at the Secretary s 
house. I went, and was introduced to Governor Gage. 
Taking me into another room, he entered into conversation 
on the then state of things the solemn league and cove 
nant, and the non-importation agreements. In the conclu 
sion, the General said, * Well, there are merchants who, 
notwithstanding all your agreements, will import British 
goods. I answered, They may import them, but the 
people will use their liberty to buy or to let them alone. 

On the 20th of August, 1774, the following notice 
was given to the inhabitants of Salem : 

" The Committee of Correspondence desire the merchants, 
freeholders, and other inhabitants of this town, to meet at 
the town-house chamber next Wednesday, at nine o clock in 
the morning, to appoint five or more deputies, to meet at 
Ipswich, on the 6th of September next, with the deputies 
which shall be appointed by the other towns in this county, 
to consider of, and determine on, such measures as the late 

King and the British nation, as to force them to take the present measures in 
support of their authority. Great Britain is equally desirous as yourselves 
of a happy union with this, as well as every other, Colony, and, inheriting the 
spirit of her ancestors, finds it necessary to support her rights, as the su 
preme head of her extended empire. She strives not to check that spirit 
which you say you inherit from your fathers, but to inculcate that due obe 
dience to the King, in his Parliament, which your fathers acknowledged.

acts of Parliament and our other grievances render neces 
sary and expedient. 

" SALEM, August 19th, 1774." 

Some of the proceedings consequent upon this no 
tification are detailed in the following letter from Mr. 
Pickering to his brother-in-law,* Paine Wingate : 

" SALEM, August the 25th, 1774. 

" DEAR SIR : 

" It will he agreeable to you to have an authentic account 
of the recent transactions in this town. 

" Last Saturday notifications were posted up in many 
places of the town, by order of the Committee of Corre 
spondence, desiring the inhabitants to assemble at the town- 
house yesterday morning at nine o clock. . . . At eight 
o clock, I received a letter from the Secretary, informing 
me that it was his Excellency the Governor s f desire, that 
I and the rest of the Committee of Correspondence would 
meet him at Colonel Browne s, J for he had something of 
importance to communicate to us. We waited on him there 
at nine o clock, as requested. He first asked us if we 
avowed the printed notifications for the meeting of the 
inhabitants at that time. Captain [Richard] Derby, Jr., 
answered in the affirmative. Says the Governor, As you 
assembled the people, tis your duty to disperse them ; you 
are the source, and must abide the consequences. Captain 
Derby replied, Now the people are assembled, they will 
act as they think best. We cannot oblige them to disperse. 
The Governor declared it was an unlawful meeting, for 
the seditious purpose of opposing an act of Parliament. 
Captain Derby answered, Neither we nor the people 
thought we were opposing even an act of Parliament, much

less the laws of the Province. Says the Governor, I am 
not going to enter into a conversation about the matter, or 
to determine quirks of law; the Attorney-General and 
Colonel Browne (they were present, as well as the Secre 
tary) will inform (or answer) you there. I came here to 
execute the laws, (or acts of Parliament, I forget which,) 
and I am determined to do it. Some other things passed, 
but not material, and the Governor concluded thus: I 
desire you to disperse the meeting of the inhabitants ; if 
they disregard you, the Sheriff will go first; and if they do 
not then disperse, and he needs support, I will support him, 
and the people must abide the consequences. The Governor 
appeared almost the whole time in an indecent passion, and 
uttered the closing sentence with much vehemence. I was 
told by Dr. Holten,* yesterday, that the Governor had 110 
rest from the time our notification appeared, scarcely sitting 
half an hour in a day. The Attorney-General and the 
High Sheriff were specially summoned for the purpose, and 
orders were given to the regiment to be in order, who, 
accordingly, equipped themselves as if for battle, and 
marched from their encampment near our fort to the Neck 
gate, where the main body (there are but about three hun 
dred men, and about as many women and children) halted 
and loaded ; then about eighty marched up street, almost 
to brother Williams s. But before this movement of the 
soldiers was known, and whilst we were in at Colonel 
Browne s, the inhabitants, being assembled at the town- 
house, transacted all the business of the meeting, which 
was merely to choose delegates f for a county meeting to 
be held at Ipswich, on the 6th of September next, and 
were actually broke up before we got to the town-house. 
To-day Colonel Frye, by express orders from the Governor, 
issued a warrant for apprehending the members of the Com 
mittee of Correspondence, who ordered the notifications to

56 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1774. 

be posted. These were Captain Richard Manning, brother 
Williams, Mr. Jonathan Ropes, Jonathan Gardner, Jr., Mr. 
Sprague, and myself. Mr. Warwick Palfray was also 
included, though not then present. Captain Derby was 
omitted, being absent through indisposition ; but he had 
expressly desired his brother Gardner to inform the Com 
mittee that he was for having a town-meeting. The High 
Sheriff first came and arrested me. I went with him to 
Frye s. Mr. Sprague came up, and the Sheriff arrested 
him also. Frye told us all that was required was this, 
that we should each recognize in 100, without sureties, 
to appear at the next Superior Court, to be held at Salem 
the first Tuesday in November, to answer to the charge 
against us in the warrant ; w r hich was, for unlawfully and 
seditiously assembling the people without leave from the 
Governor, contrary to the laws and the statute in that case 
lately made and provided. Mr. Sprague asked me what 
was best to be done. I told him I thought we had better 
recognize, which we did. My motives were these : I could 
conceive no prejudice would arise to the cause in complying 
so far. The warrant was issued and executed by lawful 
officers. We need be under no apprehensions of being con 
victed of any crime, because the juries will be appointed as 
heretofore ; (for I think it clear that no jury can be ap 
pointed agreeably to the act, in this county, till next March 
term, and perhaps not till next March twelve months;) or 
if a jury should be packed, (which is scarce possible,) and 
we convicted, we should then have ample reason for a refu 
sal of submission. If we opposed now, and the Governor 
should persist in his attempts to execute the laws, a tumult 
and carnage must ensue ; for the people are exasperated to 
a high degree. These were the reasons I gave the rest of 
the Committee ; and, although they at first thought it would 
have been best to have refused to enter into recognizance, 
yet they appeared entirely to acquiesce, (for the reasons I 
gave,) and I supposed that, when arrested, they would rec 
ognize without hesitation. But they have since refused 



^Ei. 29.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 57 

before the Justice, Frye, who immediately, I am told, 
posted off to the Governor to inform him of it. They told 
Frye, however, that they should be ready again to appear 
before him, if summoned. The Governor, I doubt not, 
will pursue the matter ; but I am inclined to think they will 
comply, for the reasons above mentioned, which I shall urge 
this evening at our meeting." 

Colonel Frye became alarmed by the excitement 
caused by the arrests made under his warrant, and, in 
the " Essex Gazette " of September 13th, and " Salem 
Gazette " of September 16th, appeared the following 
paragraph, signed by him, but draughted by Mr. Pick 
ering : 

"In consequence of an express order from Governor Gage, 
I issued a warrant, grounding it upon the late act of Par 
liament for altering the Constitution of this Province, against 
seven gentlemen, members of the Committee of Correspond 
ence in Salem, for causing the inhabitants of the town to 
assemble for the purpose of choosing delegates for the late 
county meeting held at Ipswich ; in consequence whereof, 
two of them were arrested, and gave bond to appear at the 
next Superior Court to be held at Salem, to answer for their 
so doing. These two bonds I have this day freely, of my 
own accord, delivered up to the persons who gave them, 
and have recalled the warrant. Further, I declare that I 
will not accept of any commission under said act of Parlia 
ment, nor do anything, either in my public or private capaci 
ty, to carry it into execution. And therefore hope to be 
restored to that friendship and regard with my fellow-citi 
zens and countrymen which I heretofore enjoyed.

memorandum, " T. Pickering said if the acts were 
put in force, we should wade in blood first, or to that 
effect." 

After the decease of John Higginson, the Register 
of Deeds for the county of Essex, Mr. Pickering sent 
a printed circular, dated September 27th, 1774, to the 
freeholders of the several towns in the county, pro 
posing himself as a candidate for the office. Among 
other things, he says, 

" I am happy in the friendship of many gentlemen in 
sundry towns in the county, who have heretofore made me 
acquainted with their own sentiments, and assured me I 
might expect the united suffrages of their townsmen. In 
such cases, their kind information and assistance may su 
persede the necessity of this application, but perhaps not ren 
der it improper. I suppose it is known to some freeholders 
in each town in the county, that I have a long time assisted 
Mr. Higginson in his office ; and, of course, it may seem 
probable that I am sufficiently acquainted with the business 
of it ; but this is a point in which you ought to be satisfied 
by other evidence than my own. If, Gentlemen, you obtain 
this satisfaction, you will confer on me a great and lasting 
obligation by giving me your votes. ... To determine 
your votes, Gentlemen, you will think yourselves bound to 
be furnished with something better than the promises of a 
stranger, and as such I must consider myself to most of 
the freeholders in many towns in the county. In these 
cases, I ground my request entirely on the testimonies of 
gentlemen acquainted with my character, and whose probity, 
honor, and judgment are well known. Their declarations 
concerning my qualifications and past behavior will, at this 
time, best determine the freeholders respecting the pro 
priety or impropriety of giving me their suffrages ; as, if I 
shall be so happy as to obtain them, my future conduct 
must show whether I really deserved them, and whether I 
shall merit a repetition of the favor." 



JET. 29.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 59 

The following letter to the freeholders of Essex, 
draughted, apparently, by Richard Derby, Jr., accom 
panied Mr. Pickering s circular. It was signed by four 
of the Selectmen, and by six members of the Commit 
tee of Correspondence, of Salem. 

" SALEM, September 27th, 1774. 

" GENTLEMEN, 

" As, by the death of Colonel Higginson, a vacancy has 
taken place in the office of Register of Deeds for this 
county, and warrants have been issued for the election of a 
successor, we think it will be agreeable to you to be in 
formed, that Captain Timothy Pickering, Jr., (who has a 
freehold in the county, as the law requires,) will undoubted 
ly have the votes of the freeholders of this town ; and we 
can, with pleasure and sincerity, recommend him as a person 
in every respect well qualified to discharge that important 
trust, more especially as he has, for some years past, been 
thoroughly conversant with the business of that office. 
This town, well convinced of his abilhry and assiduity, have 
elected him into the most important town offices ; and, im 
mediately on Colonel Higginson s resigning the office of 
Town Clerk, he was elected to supply his place, and has 
discharged that and his other offices entirely to the satisfac 
tion of the town. And, should you now give him your 
suffrages for Register of Deeds, we have no doubt you also 
will soon be convinced that your favor was properly be 
stowed, and that, by intrusting him with that important 
office, you will in the best manner have provided for the 
safety of those writings on which the titles to your free 
holds are founded. 

" Hoping you will concur with us in sentiment, we are, 
Gentlemen, your friends," &c. 

In October, Mr. Pickering was elected Register of 
Deeds, probably without opposition, as, on a reelection 
in 1776, " all the votes were for him." He resigned 



60 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1775. 

the office about the end of M^y, 1777, in consequence 
of his acceptance of the office of Adjutant-General of 
the army of the United States. 

At a meeting, on the 13th of February, 1775, of the 
officers of the several companies in the First Regiment 
of militia in the county of Essex, Mr. Pickering was 
elected Colonel. He was commissioned accordingly, 
under the royal government, and again, on the 14th 
of February, 1776, by " the major part of the Council 
of the Massachusetts Bay." * He held this office until 
some time after he had joined the army of the United 
States, in 1777. 

On the 26th of February, 1775, Colonel Alexander 
Leslie, with a portion of the Sixty fourth Regiment of 
infantry, was despatched by General Gage from Castle 
William, in Boston harbor, for the purpose of destroying 
some cannon at that time in the North Fields in Salem. 
By internal evidence, and the circumstances of the 
case, I am led to think that Colonel Pickering was the 
author of the following contemporary account of the 
expedition in the " Essex Gazette " of Tuesday, Feb 
ruary 28th, 1775.f 

" Last Sabbath the peace of the town was disturbed by 
the coming of a regiment of the King s troops, the particu

ing,) the decks were covered with soldiers, who, having 
loaded, and fixed their bayonets, landed with great de 
spatch, and instantly marched off. Some of the inhabitants, 
suspecting they were bound for Salem to seize some mate 
rials there preparing for an artillery, despatched several 
messengers to inform us of it. These materials were on 
the north side of the North River, and to come at them it 
was necessary to cross a bridge, one part of which was 
made to draw up for the convenience of letting vessels 
pass through. The inhabitants kept a lookout for the ap 
pearance of the troops. The vanguard arrived, and took 
their route down in town as far as the Long Wharf, perhaps 
to decoy the inhabitants thither away from the place to 
which the main body were destined. The main body ar 
rived soon after, and halted a few minutes by the town- 
house. It is said inquiry was immediately made by some 
of the officers for a half-brother [John Sargent] of Colonel 
Browne, the Mandamus Councillor. Be this as it may, he 
was very soon whispering in the Colonel s ear, in the front 
of the regiment ; and when he parted from the Colonel, the 
regiment marched oft* with a quick pace in a direct course 
for the North Bridge ; just before their entrance upon which 
the draw-bridge was pulled up. The regiment, however, 
pushed forward till they came to the draw-bridge, not ob 
serving (as it seemed) that it was drawn up. The Colonel, 
who led them, expressed some surprise, and then, turning 
about, ordered an officer to face his company to a body of 
men standing on a wharf on the other side the draw-bridge, 
and fire. One of our townsmen* (who had kept alongside 
the Colonel from the time he marched from the town-house) 
instantly told him he had better not fire ; that he had no 
right to fire without further orders. And if you do fire/ 
said he, you will be all dead men. The company neither 
fired nor faced. 

" The Colonel then retired to the centre of his regiment, 

* Captain John Felt. 



62 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1775. 

assembled his officers, and held a consultation ; which being 
ended, the Colonel advanced a little, and declared he would 
maintain his ground, and go over the bridge before he 
returned, if it was a month first. The same townsman 
replied, he might stay there as long as he pleased ; nobody 
cared for that. The half-brother before mentioned (it is 
said) made towards the bridge, but, seeing the draw-bridge 
up, says, &lt; It is all over with us. He has since disappeared. 
Meanwhile, two large gondolas, that lay aground (for it was 
low water), were scuttled, lest they should cross the chan 
nel in them. But, whilst one gentleman,* with his assistants, 
was scuttling his own gondola, a party of about twenty sol 
diers jumped into it, and, with their bayonets charged against 
our unarmed townsmen (some of whom they pricked), 
compelled them to quit it; but, before this, a sufficient hole 
had been made in the bottom. This attack of the soldiers, 
and some other occurrences, occasioned a little bickering ; 
but, by the interposition of some of the inhabitants, the dis 
pute subsided. 

" At length, some gentlemen asked the Colonel what was 
his design in making this movement, and why he would 
cross the bridge. He said he had orders to cross it, and 
he would cross it if he lost his life, with the lives of all his 
men ; and now (or before) asked why the King s highway 
was obstructed. He was told it was not the King s road, 
but the property of the inhabitants, who had a right to do 
what they pleased with it. Finally, the Colonel said he 
must go over ; and if the draw-bridge were let down, so 
that he might pass, he pledged his honor he would march 
not above thirty rods beyond it, and then immediately 
return. The regiment had now been on the bridge about 
an hour and a half; and, everything being secured, the in 
habitants directed the draw-bridge to be let down. The 
regiment immediately passed over, marched a few rods, 
returned, and, with great expedition, went back again to

Marblehead, where they embarked on board the transport 
without delay. 

" The regiment brought with them lanterns, hatchets, 
pickaxes, spades, handspikes, and several coils of rope. 

" When all the circumstances are considered, there can 
remain no doubt that the sole purpose of this manoeuvre 
was to steal away the artillery materials before mentioned. 
In the first place, the regiment was taken from the Castle, so 
that the inhabitants of Boston might be prevented giving us 
any intelligence. The transport arrived at Marblehead a con 
siderable time before the regiment was landed ; but the men 
were kept snug under hatches. As soon as the inhabitants 
of Marblehead had got to meeting, the troops landed, and 
pushed on their march to Salem, and proceeded to the very 
spot where the materials for the artillery were lodged. But, 
meeting with this sad rebuff, and finding their plot was dis 
covered, they then made a retreat. Tis regretted that an 
officer of Colonel Leslie s acknowledged worth should be 
obliged, in obedience to orders, to come on so pitiful an 
errand. 

" Various reports were spread abroad respecting the 
troops. The country was alarmed ; and one company ar 
rived in arms from Danvers just as the troops left the town. 
We immediately despatched messengers to the neighboring 
towns, to save them the trouble of coming in ; but the 
alarm flew like lightning (and fame doubtless magnified 
the first simple reports), so that great numbers were in 
arms, and some on the march, before our messengers 
arrived." 

If the above narrative has been rightly attributed 
to Colonel Pickering, it may be presumed that he wrote 
likewise the following vindication of it, printed in the 
succeeding "Essex Gazette" of March 7th: 

" The account published last week in this paper, ... of 
the march of the Sixty-fourth Regiment (in Draper s true

account tis called a detachment of the Sixty-fourth Regiment ; 
but we are informed only fifteen or twenty of the men re 
mained at the Castle *) , is, in Mills and Hicks s paper, said to 
contain several falsehoods, f In answer to this charge, we 
say, that we endeavored to collect a true state of the facts by 
inquiring of those who were eye and ear witnesses. In the 
hurry and alarm, there might be a misapprehension in some 
things ; but there was no intention to detract from Colonel 
Leslie s courage, honor, or prudence, or deviate from the 
straight path of truth ; but, to establish the latter, we are con 
strained to make a few remarks on Draper s account, and on 
that published by Mills and Hicks. The latter declare, they 
are authorized to say, that the Colonel never ordered any 
part of the troops to fire, but that he was not prevented 
from giving any orders he should have thought necessary 
by the threat of the townsman, as they say was insinu 
ated in our account. The townsman, and others of the 
inhabitants, men of undoubted veracity, still say they are 
absolutely certain that the Colonel talked about firing on 
the people; and the townsman (who stood within two 
yards of him) declares that the Colonel, turning to an 
officer near him, expressed himself in this manner : You 
must face about this division (or company) , and fire upon 
those people. This, and this only, occasioned the towns 
man to make a reply (with a loud voice, for his resentment 
was kindled by the order to fire) in these words, as exactly 
as he can now recollect : Fire ! You had better be damned 
than fire ! You can have no right to fire without further 
orders. We added, in our account, The company neither 
fired nor faced. Whether it were prudence, or want of

three hundred men," to embark, &c. Proceedings of the Essex Institute, Vol.

orders or disposition, or any other motive, that prevented 
an act so manifestly unjustifiable as this would have been, 
we could not tell. We related a simple* fact, that * the 
company neither fired nor faced. 

" Mills and Hicks go on : l Nor is there the least truth 
in what is asserted of the Colonel s having pledged his 
honor, as he absolutely insisted on going over the bridge. 
No other answer to this will be required, than the declara 
tion of the clergyman * referred to in Draper s account. 
These are his words : * Concerned for the welfare of my 
townsmen, I addressed Colonel Leslie, and desired the sol 
diers under his command might be restrained from pushing 
their bayonets. He told me they were much insulted, and 
intimated to me his determination to pass over the bridge, 
but concluded with saying, if the inhabitants would lower 
the bridge, he would give his word (and, I am pretty cer 
tain, his honor) that he would not march above fifty rods. 
For the sake of those who are strangers to the clergyman, 
we add, that he is a gentleman of unimpeached veracity, 
virtue, and honor, and universally respected by the inhab 
itants for his manly, prudent, and judicious conduct on the 
occasion. 

" The declaration, that * no half-brother of a Mandamus 
Councillor, or any other person, in Salem, whispered or 
spoke to Colonel Leslie while he was in the town of Salem, 
is very extraordinary. Even Draper admits that the clergy 
man conversed with him. But we know that at least two 
other persons spoke to him, though in a strain somewhat 
different from that attributed to the half-brother. Tis a 
fact, that the half-brother was in the front of the regiment, 
whispering or talking with an officer, who, the inhabitants 
naturally concluded, was the commanding officer of the regi 
ment ; for at that time Colonel Leslie was known to very 
few. This half-brother afterwards walking with one of 
the inhabitants (while the soldiers were on the bridge), 
they had some conversation to this effect : * Tis all over 

* The Rev. Thomas Barnard, Jr. 
VOL. I. 9 



66 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1775. 

with them, said the half-brother. What is over? said his 
companion. He replied, &lt; The bridge is drawn up. What 
then ? rejoined th other. The half-brother then whispered, 
1 They were going after the cannon. It must be granted 
that these circumstances (especially when connected with 
others known to the inhabitants) might very justly raise 
their suspicions that he was the informer. If he is not in 
any measure guilty, we wish his innocence may appear. . . . 

" Tis said, also, that the people, discovering Colonel 
Leslie s intention to ferry a few men over in a gondola as 
soon as it could be got afloat, jumped into her, and with 
axes cut through her bottom ; that Colonel Leslie, seeing 
this, ordered a party to drive them out of her. Some of the 
people, however, having obstinately refused to quit her, the 
soldiers were obliged to use force. Strange language this, 
a gentleman obstinately refused to quit his own gondola ! 
And, notwithstanding the hurry and bustle, the other gon 
dola was not scuttled till leave was expressly given by the 
owner. Yet, for doing it, the blood of the inhabitants must 
be drawn. We did not know till now who gave this violent 
order, and are sorry to find it was Colonel Leslie. The 
people suspected, not discovered, his intention to ferry over 
his men in the gondolas ; and could not conceive that the 
soldiers had any other right to interrupt their work in cut 
ting the bottoms, than the right of arms ; which frequently 
regards neither law nor property, when standing in the way 
of their designs who wield them. 

" The minds of the people are not likely to be soothed by 
such actions as we have been speaking of. We have been 
cautioned to avoid hypocrisy. Without hypocrisy, it may 
be said, that the serious are justly offended that an uproar 
and disturbance were occasioned on a day of public worship, 
and even whilst one congregation was assembled. But this 
Sabbath-day expedition well agrees with proclamations * for 
the encouragement of piety and virtue." 

* This must refer to General Gage s proclamation of July 21st, 1774, in the 
" Salem Gazette " (a different paper from the " Essex Gazette ") of July 29th. 



^T. 29.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 67 

The writer omits the names of persons implicated 
in the resistance to the King s troops, which seems to 
have been done by design, to avoid rendering any indi 
vidual a conspicuous mark for the resentment of the 
British government. 

Dr. Holmes quotes President Stiles s manuscripts 
to the effect, that Leslie pledged his honor, that, if the 
draw-bridge were let down, he would march but thirteen 
rods over it, and return ; and that Colonel Pickering, 
with his forty brave men, faced the King s troops.* 
Mr. Endicott produces respectable evidence to prove 
that there were no armed men on the north side of the 
bridge, and that Colonel Pickering w r as on the south 
side.f A few years before his death, Colonel Pickering, 
in referring to the passage in Holmes, observed that 
" thirteen rods " should have been " thirty rods." I do 
not recollect that he pointed out any other error, and 
my impression has been that he was on the north side 
of the bridge, with a number of men armed with 
muskets. The men in Danvers and Marblehead were 
assembling in arms, and, from the irritation previously 
existing, it might reasonably be expected, that, in the 
town of Salem, containing five thousand inhabitants, as 
many as thirty or forty men would repair with their 
arms to the bridge. In the two articles above quoted, 
and ascribed to Colonel Pickering, the presence of 
armed citizens is not mentioned. Dr. Charles Pickering, 
his grandson, relates a conversation with a very intelli 
gent old lady, the late Mrs. Thomas Sanders, in which 
she said, Mr. Barnard, in interceding with Colonel Leslie 
not to fire, told him that the people were, as he saw 
them, unarmed, but they knew where they could pro-

cure fire-arms in a few moments, and every individual 
knew how to use them. The " unarmed " people, Dr. 
Pickering says, may have been those on the south side 
of the draw ; but Mrs. Sanders left on him the impres 
sion, that the only fire-arms on the ground were in the 
hands of the British troops. 

I do not deem it important to the reputation of 
Colonel Pickering, or of Salem, to maintain that, in a 
moment of so sudden and great excitement, he organ 
ized a military opposition to Colonel Leslie. It is suffi 
cient, that he and many of his townsmen went to the 
bridge with promptness, and acted with the resolution 
and prudence demanded by the circumstances, in mak 
ing the first resistance in the American Revolution, 
after the arrival of General Gage, to a body of British 
troops.*

A FEW weeks after Leslie s excursion to Salem, Lieu 
tenant-Colonel Smith, with a larger body of troops, was 
sent from Boston, in another direction, for the purpose 
of destroying military stores collected in the town of 
Concord. They left Boston on the 18th of April, 1775, 
at night, and, on arriving early the next morning at 
Lexington, came upon a body of militia, on whom they 
fired, killing eight men and wounding others ; after 
which they proceeded to Concord. 

Colonel Pickering s relation to the battle of Lexing 
ton was afterwards made the subject of misrepresenta 
tion by his political adversaries, when, for party purposes, 
his character was to be held up to reproach. 

On the 19th of April he was in his office (the 
Registry of Deeds), in Salem, when Captain Epes, of 
Danvers, came in, between eight and nine o clock in the 
morning, and informed him that a man had ridden 
into Danvers and reported, that the British troops had 
marched from Boston to Lexington and had attacked 
the militia. Epes was the commander of a company be 
longing to Colonel Pickering s regiment, and he asked 
for orders. Danvers being nearer than Salem to the 
scene of action, Colonel Pickering gave him a verbal 



70 LITE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1775. 

answer, that the Danvers companies should march 
without waiting for those of Salem. 

Colonel Pickering went immediately to the centre of 
the town, and soon the Selectmen and other leading 
gentlemen assembled there, at Webb s tavern, in School 
Street, since called Court Street. He was himself chair 
man of the Selectmen, and a member of the Committee 
of Safety. A short consultation ensued. Those who 
knew the distance of Lexington from Salem, and its 
situation relative to Boston* (of which Colonel Picker 
ing " had no personal knowledge, and but an indistinct 
idea " f), observed, that there was no probability of the 
militia of Salem being able to fall in with the British 
troops before they would have returned to Boston, and 
that the marching of the Salem companies would, there 
fore, be useless. Nevertheless, it was deemed expedient 
that they should assemble and begin their march, and 
for this sole reason, that it would be evidence to 
their fellow-citizens, that the inhabitants of Salem were 
of one mind with them, and disposed to cooperate in 
every measure which the common safety required. The 
four companies of Salem marched accordingly, muster- 



* At that period the road from Salem to Charlestown and Boston, and to 
Lexington, lay through Medford. Salem lies north-easterly and Lexington 
north-westerly from Boston. The consecutive distances from Salem, as given 
in the almanacs of that time, are, to Danvers, two miles ; Newell s, in Lynn, 
seven; Maiden, six; Medford, three; Boston, four; in all, twenty-two miles. 
But, in tracing the road on Borden s Map of Massachusetts, I estimate the dis 
tance from Salem to Medford to be about fifteen and a quarter miles, thence 
to Winter Hill about one and a quarter, and thence to Bunker Hill about two 
and a quarter. By the same map I make Lexington about seven miles from 
Medford, about twenty-two from Salem, about eleven from Boston, and about 
nine and a half from Charlestown Neck. Cambridge lies westerly of Charles- 
town, and the roads from Cambridge and Medford converged, uniting at 
Charlestown Neck.

JEi. 29.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 71 

ing, on the occasion, nearly three hundred men ; but, so 
strong was the impression, that to proceed under an idea 
of falling in with the British troops would be fruitless, 
that the companies were halted perhaps twenty minutes 
soon after passing the Bell tavern, in Danvers, expect 
ing every moment information that the British troops 
had returned to Boston. But, after a short consulta 
tion among the officers and some prominent citizens in 
the ranks, it was determined to push forward until they 
should receive definite intelligence. At Ne well s tavern, 
in Lynn, the men halted just long enough to refresh 
themselves with drink. They then proceeded, without 
stopping, until they reached Medford, where they gained 
the first certain information that the British troops 
were on their return, and this by a route which showed 
their intention to get to Boston by the way of Charles- 
town. Colonel Pickering then hastened the march 
of his men on the great road from Medford to Charles- 
town, in expectation of falling in with them. When he 
had reached the top of Winter Hill, he saw them march 
ing in order on the road from Cambridge to Charles- 
town, and also saw the smoke of musketry discharged 
at them by some scattered militia from so great a dis 
tance as to be of no avail. The British troops whom 
he saw did not return a single shot; the militia ap 
peared to be entirely out of their reach. On the first 
sight of the British troops, he halted his companies, and 
ordered them to prime and load, in full expectation 
of coming to an engagement. While they were in the 
act, or at the moment of its completion, a person ar 
rived with a message from General Heath, the superior 
otlicer on the field, that the British troops had artillery 
in their rear, and could not be approached by musketry 
alone, and that the General desired to see Colonel 



72 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1775. 

Pickering. Leaving the companies in that position, 
he went across the fields with the messenger, and met 
General Heath somewhere on the ground between the 
Cambridge and Medford roads to Charlestown.* 

During the short time that he was with General 
Heath, he saw the British troops ascending Bunker 
Hill the hill on the left of the road to Charlestown, 
after passing the low neck between Mystic and Charles 
rivers. It was then about sunset. As soon as the 
British troops gained Bunker Hill, they formed in a 
line opposite to the Neck, and General Heath judged 
that any attempt upon them in that position would be 
idle. The next day they entered Boston. Colonel 
Pickering returned to the Salem militia, and led them 
back to Medford, where they remained that night, 
mounting a guard at the bridge. The next day they 
returned to Salem. 

The British troops who first marched to Lexington, 
and thence to Concord, were eight hundred grenadiers 
and light infantry, the flower of the royal army ; and 
on their return they were reenforced at Lexington by 
a detachment of nine hundred men, with two field- 
pieces, under Lord Percy. Of these numbers, two 
hundred and seventy-three were killed, wounded, and 
taken prisoners, leaving a regular force of fourteen 
hundred effective men.f 

The party calumny against Colonel Pickering was, that 



* Colonel Pickering says that Heath, in 1807, did not remember this inter 
view, and had even forgotten his person. Letter to Sullivan (April 22d, 
1808, p. 25.) In his " Memoirs," however, Heath says that when it " had 
become so dusk as to render the flashes of the muskets very visible, ... an 
officer on horseback came up from the Medford road, and inquired the cir 
cumstances of the enemy." Colonel Pickering must have been this officer, 
though on the march from Salem to Winter Hill he was on foot. 

t Ramsay s "History of the American Revolution," Vol. II. pp. 187, 189. 



MT. 29.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 73 

he had a fine regiment of seven hundred men, but that 
he was dilatory in his march, owing to timidity, or to 
partiality to the British ; otherwise he might have inter 
cepted the British troops before they ascended Bunker 
Hill, and, " worn down as they were by fatigue, and 
exhausted of ammunition," * he might probably have 
destroyed them or compelled them to surrender. 

Now, the Memorial of the town of Salem (extracts 
from which are given below) proves conclusively, 
that he had with him fewer than three hundred men, 
and that there was no censurable delay on the march. 
If the British were worn down with fatigue, how much 
better was the condition of his men ? They were not 
accustomed to long marches; and their muskets and 
cartridge-boxes, carried so many hours in a hot day, 
must have become exceedingly burdensome, whereas the 
British regulars were habituated to similar exertions. 
Their march was nearly as long as that of the detach 
ment under Lord Percy. They had had no food 
from the beginning of their march. Even if Colonel 
Pickering might by possibility have intercepted the 
British troops, and if he might have conjectured that 
they were much fatigued, he certainly could not know 
that their ammunition was exhausted. Neither is this phrase 
to receive a strictly literal interpretation. Dr. Gordon 
and General Heath say they had only " a round or two ; " 
but this small quantity, in the. hands of some twelve 
hundred regulars, together with the two field-pieces, 
would, I apprehend, give them the superiority over 
three hundred militia, for the short time the conflict 
could have lasted. 

I subjoin, as a complete vindication as well of Colo-

nel Pickering as of the officers and men under his 
command, portions of the above-mentioned Memorial 
of the town of Salem, dated the 10th of August, 1775, 
when the facts were fresh in the memory of the in 
habitants.* This document appears to have escaped 
the recollection of Colonel Pickering when adverting 
to this subject in his letter of April 22d, 1808, to Gov 
ernor Sullivan ; f neither has it been referred to by 
those who have censured his conduct. 

"To THE HONORABLE THE GENERAL COURT 

OF MASSACHUSETTS BAY. 

"The town of Salem humbly showeth, that, many calum 
nies and misrepresentations having been made and industri 
ously propagated concerning the conduct of the town upon 
and since the 19th of April last, in consequence of which its 
character has been greatly injured and some of its inhabit 
ants insulted and abused, the town thinks it a point of duty 
to take effectual steps to vindicate its innocence, and pro 
cure a redress of those grievances, which are too many and 
too heavy any longer silently to be endured, and therefore beg 
leave to give the following detail of facts : 

"On the 19th of April, very soon after authentic intelligence 
arrived of the barbarous deeds of the King s troops at Lexing 
ton, the inhabitants mustered in arms, and near three hun 
dred marched off, and directed their course according to the 
intelligence they were continually receiving on the road of 
the situation of the troops ; but, though they inarched with 
as much despatch as was possible, consistent with their being 
fit for action after so long a march as they must necessarily 
make, yet they arrived in sight of the troops not till the last of 
them were marching up Bunker s Hill. Why the inhabitants 
of Salem should be so highly censured for their conduct 
on this occasion, the town cannot conceive. Thousands of 
men, nearer, much nearer, the scene of action, either stayed

at home or arrived no sooner than the Salem militia. From 
Milton and its environs, in particular, the militia got as far 
as Cambridge only, at the same time that the Salem militia 
arrived at Charlestown ; yet, by a strange and unaccounta 
ble partiality, the inhabitants of Salem only are reproached ; 
and the multitudes near at hand, who never stirred an inch, 
or, though they lived but at half the distance, arrived as late 
as the Salem militia, are entirely excused. In short, it is 
most absurdly declared by many, that, if the Salem militia 
had not been negligent and pusillanimous, the King s troops 
must have been entirely cut off; that is, fewer than three 
hundred men could have done infinitely more in one or two 
hours, than the whole body of militia assembled had been 
able to perform that day." 

The Memorial then specifies, with the circumstances, 
the instances in which two British ships of war, sta 
tioned off the port of Salem, had been permitted to 
purchase small quantities of fresh beef and veal for the 
use of the officers, " about which some people have 
made such a clamor, as though the King s troops had 
from Salem a constant supply of fresh meat," and a 
few articles of food had been taken to Americans in 
Boston ; and it concludes as follows : 

"This, may it please the Honorable Court, is a brief, 
though faithful, narrative of facts ; hence it may be judged 
how injuriously the town of Salem has been treated. The 
town cannot forbear to express its astonishment. What 
could occasion the reproach so liberally thrown upon us? 
What motives could be imagined sufficient to tempt us to 
neglect the duty we owe to ourselves, our posterity, and 
our country? What proofs have we given of our insensi 
bility, that we should neither dread the curses of slavery, 
nor feel the blessings of liberty? What could we have 
done more than we have done, to secure the latter to our 
selves and all our dearest connections ? When the balance 



76 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1775. 

of public affairs was most doubtful, when neither money 
nor the means of payment were provided, and the senti 
ments of the Continent were unknown, then Salem fur 
nished every needful supply in its power, as soon as the 
army s wants were known ; how readily, and to how great 
amount, the Committee of Supplies and the Treasurer can 
inform. We have continued these supplies, and the town 
is drained. What more remains for us to do ? 

"Such, may it please the Honorable Court, having been our 
conduct, as the town has been publicly injured and defamed, 
we may justly pray for a public vindication by the Honora 
ble Court, without which our wrongs will be continued, and 
probably increased. 

" A true copy : 

" TIMOTHY PICKERING, JR., Town Clerk." 

"In a legal and full town meeting at Salem, the 10th of 
August, 1775, the foregoing petition having been repeatedly 
read and deliberately considered, Voted (without one neg 
ative voice), That the Town approve of the same, and that 
the Town Clerk deliver an attested copy thereof to the Rep 
resentatives of the town, to be presented to the General 
Court. 

"Attested: TIMOTHY PICKERING, Jr., Town Clerk." 

On this Memorial, the Council, in concurrence with 
the House of Representatives, passed a Resolve, 

" That notwithstanding many ungenerous aspersions have 
been cast on said town, there is nothing appears to this 
Court, in the conduct thereof, inimical to the liberties and 
privileges of America ; but, on the contrary, in many in 
stances, its exertions have been such as have done its 
inhabitants much honor, and been of great advantage to 
the Colony." 

On the supposition, however, that Colonel Pickering 
might by possibility have been "alert enough" to en 
counter the British troops, his steady opposition to the 



JET. 29.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 77 

oppressive measures of the British government, and his 
services in the field during the Revolution, prove that 
the alleged tardiness was owing neither to timidity," 
nor (as suggested in Mrs. Warren s History*) "to a 
predilection in favor of Britain." The tardiness, if any, 
was caused by his belief that an attempt to intercept 
the British troops would be unavailing. But it is not 
improbable, that the censure has been occasioned by 
his very energy and activity, which brought him so 
near to the British troops that the community felt a 
disappointment in his just failing to meet them. Had 
he marched his men as far only as Maiden, it is pre 
sumed that he would have escaped all blame.f 

In November, 1776, an act was passed by the General 
Court of Massachusetts, providing that one quarter part 
of all the able-bodied male persons within the State 
(with certain exceptions), from sixteen years and up 
wards, should, either by voluntary enlistment, lot, or 
draft, be appointed and held in readiness, armed and 
equipped, to inarch at a minute s warning, to serve for 
a term not exceeding three months from the time of 
their march from home, within and for the defence of 
any of the United States, when they should be called out 
to reenforce the Continental army. The respective 
Brigadier-Generals were to form the men into com 
panies, as nearly as might be, of sixty-eight men, and 
the companies into battalions, making, as nearly as 
might be, ten companies to a battalion, and to appoint 
field officers, according to their rank in the militia, to 
command them.

Pickering. 



78 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1775. 

In pursuance of this act, the militia of Salem were 
assembled in the meeting-house of the First Parish on 
the 5th of December. The proceedings on the occa 
sion, and the part which Colonel Pickering took in 
them, are related by him in the following letter to 
Mr. Jacob Dodge, an intelligent farmer, who once lived 
near him in Wenham, but had become an inhabitant of 
New Boston, in New Hampshire, at the date of the letter. 
Colonel Pickering s object in writing to Mr. Dodge is 
to vindicate himself against the charge of misconduct 
in respect to the battle of Lexington. 

"WENHAM, April 6th, 1812. 
SIR, 

" The account you gave me this morning of the false tales 
spread abroad in New Hampshire, especially in the remoter 
towns, where correct information is not easy to be had, 
induces me to present to you my correspondence with Gov 
ernor Sullivan, in which I have stated the circumstances 
respecting my conduct on the day of the battle of Lexing 
ton, not a syllable of which, to my knowledge, has ever 
been contradicted ; and which, indeed, numbers yet living of 
my townsmen of Salem know to be true, some of whom are 
Democrats, and would eagerly have seized on any misstate- 
ment, if I had made any. 

"In page 26 of my letter to Governor Sullivan, I men 
tion the winter campaign of 1776-77 with the Massachusetts 
militia. The quota of Salem consisted wholly of volunteers. 
Upon notice, the militia assembled in the meeting-house in 
Salem (now Dr. Prince s). I went into the pulpit and 
addressed them, stating the critical situation of our public 
affairs, the necessity of reenforcing the army, the enlist 
ments of the troops then expiring, and that it was at 
such a time of difficulty and danger that the real patriot 
would show his zeal and devotion to his country. I 
then concluded my speech (which was extempore) in this 
manner : 



JET. 29.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 79 

" In urging you, fellow-citizens and soldiers, to volun 
teer your services on this occasion, I have no thought of 
excusing myself; I will go with you, and partake of all the 
hardships, as well as the dangers, of a winter campaign. 

" I then left the pulpit, and marched round the aisles of the 
meeting-house,* and in a few minutes was followed by up 
wards of sixty f of my townsmen (many of them masters of 
vessels) , rather more than the town s quota. The county 
of Essex furnished a regiment of a little more than seven 
hundred men, who marched under my command as Colonel, 
and performed the campaign in New York and New Jersey. 

" The following questions are obvious to be asked : 

"I. If I had shown any signs of cowardice on the day of 
the battle of Lexington, would my townsmen, who were 
with me that day, and others who knew all that passed, 
have turned out as volunteers, the next year, to make a cam 
paign under my command ? 

" II. If my conduct was blamable on the day of the battle 
of Lexington, as now, for party purposes, is pretended, 
would the revolutionary government of Massachusetts have 
intrusted me with various important offices ? 

"Now, that government, in the same year, 1775, after the 
battle of Lexington, appointed me a Justice of the Peace 
and a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas for the County 
of Essex ; and, what was still more important, they appointed 
me sole Judge of the admiralty or maritime court for the 
Middle District of Massachusetts, comprehending Boston, 
Marblehead, Salem, Beverly, Gloucester, and Newburyport ; 
into which were brought many more prizes taken from the 
British than into the whole State beside. I held these 
offices until I went to the army under General Washington s 
immediate command, in June, 1777. In the period of less 
than two years that I was Judge of the maritime court, about

place." Boston Gazette (December 9th, 1776). 



80 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1775. 

a hundred and fifty prizes were brought in, tried, and con 
demned. 

" In my letter to Governor Sullivan, (page 29,) you will 
see that I was appointed by Congress a member of the Con 
tinental Board of War, in conjunction with General Gates 
and General Miffliu. This was near the close of the cam 
paign of 1777. Now take notice, that the late Governor 
Samuel Adams, John Adams, late President of the United 
States, and Elbridge Gerry, now Governor of Massachusetts, 
were the members of Congress present from Massachusetts 
at the time I was chosen one of the members of the Board 
of War. 

" Will any man of common sense and common honesty, 
in any political party called Democratic, require more or 
better proofs that my conduct on the day of the battle of 
Lexington was not liable to censure ? And what stronger 
proofs could be offered them in support of my integrity, 
fidelity, and patriotism? 

" Whoever knows, or shall know, these facts, and yet 
continues to revile me, must be a base and wicked slanderer. 

" I am, Sir, your old neighbor and friend, 

" TIMOTHY PICKERING." 

On the morning of the 20th of April, while Colonel 
Pickering was at Medford, he received notice that a 
number of militia officers, assembled at Cambridge, 
desired to see him ; and he went thither. General 
Joseph Warren was among them. They were consult 
ing on the proper course to be pursued in consequence 
of the hostilities of the preceding day. A few days 
afterward, he wrote to his brother-in-law, Paine Wingate, 
stating, among other things of some interest, the opin 
ion expressed by him at that meeting : 

" SALEM, April 26th, 1775. 

" I received your favor by Dr. One, and read it with much 
satisfaction. Your sentiments and mine respecting public 



JET. 29.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 81 

affairs do not differ. I am still of opinion that a pacification 
upon honorable terms is practicable. This opinion I de 
clared in the council of war at Cambridge last Thursday : 
urging strenuously a forbearance of hostilities, and praying 
that we might act only on the defensive ; at least till the 
other Colonies were consulted. Some declared themselves 
of the same opinion. Others thought that now was the time 
to strike, and cut off the troops before they were reeiiforced ; 
and then, said they, the day will be our own. As if Great 
Britain could not replace three thousand men, nor land at 
any other place than Boston ! By the way, I do not see what 
mighty advantage can accrue to us by getting possession of 
Boston ; none, I am sure, which can countervail the loss of 
thousands in storming the town, which will immediately be 
beat to pieces by the men-of-war. I had twenty to one 
rather make an attempt upon the Castle. Notwithstanding the 
warmth of some men, by all I can now learn, the only capi 
tal manoeuvre at present will be the enlisting an army, and 
getting it disciplined, ready to oppose any violence which 
shall be offered by those who are inimical to us. And this 
plan I do not find that any one objects against : on the con 
trary, those judicious, moderate men who have hitherto 
opposed the measure, now think it necessary, and that the 
late expedition of the troops will justify us therein. The 
number agreed on by our Congress as their quota of thirty 
thousand, to be raised in New England, is thirteen thousand 
six hundred men, whom they have already begun to enlist. 
In consequence of this plan, I am persuaded that no imme 
diate attack is intended, either upon Boston or the Castle. 
But, if what is reported to-day be true, I cannot pretend to 
say what the deceitful baseness of Gage and the indignation 
of our countrymen may produce. We are told that he 
assured the inhabitants of Boston, if they would deliver up 
their arms, he would permit the inhabitants to leave the 
town ; that they have complied with the condition ; and 
that now he refuses to let the people go. But all this 
wants confirmation.

CHAPTER VI. 

Colonel Pickering rejects Advice to join the Tories. His " Plan of 
Discipline for a Militia." Appointed to Judicial Offices. He 
and others form themselves into a Volunteer Company, and, 
through him, tender their Services to General Washington. 
Chosen a Representative for Salem. Salem ready for a Declar

AMONG the early friends of Colonel Pickering was 
Mrs. Higginson, the wife of John Higginson, the Regis 
ter of Deeds for the county of Essex. Mr. Higgin- 
son died in 1774, leaving her a widow, with their 
only child, a daughter. She was a woman of a superior 
understanding ; and, entertaining sentiments in favor 
of the government of Great Britain, and expressing 
them with more freedom than prudence, she rendered 
herself unpopular. In consequence, she thought her 
self obliged to leave the country, and took refuge in 
Halifax, Nova Scotia. There, disdaining to -be depen 
dent on charity, she opened a school for the support of 
herself and her daughter; but, in 1782, before the ter 
mination of the Revolutionary war, they returned to 
the neighborhood of Salem, choosing to subject them 
selves to persecution from a few malevolent or narrow- 
minded Whigs, in preference to remaining in exile. 
Soon after the peace, they established a school in Sa 
lem, which enjoyed a high reputation for many years, 
first under their joint care, and subsequently under 
that of Miss Higginson alone, who survived her mother. 
For both of them Colonel Pickering cherished through 



84 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1776. 

life a most affectionate regard. Mrs. Higginson wrote 
to him, from Marblehead, in April, 1775 (probably after 
the battle of Lexington), as follows : 

" As I fully believe our long acquaintance has produced a 
sincere and lasting friendship for each other, notwithstand 
ing our widely differing in sentiment as to politics, you 
will, I hope, forgive my troubling you. It has appeared 
plain to me, that you, from the native goodness of your 
heart, never thought things would be carried the lengths 
they are. I, who have lived longer in this wicked world, 
and seen so much of it, have ever been fearful of what is 
now like to take place. I cannot but say, I am anxious for 
all my friends, and particularly for you, and, as I judge 
you have a fair opening, wish you to make a handsome 
retreat in season. You never can fall in with the cruelty 
and rage against the friends to government, many of whom 
you are personally acquainted with and esteem. I would, 
therefore, beg you to recollect what passed when you re 
turned me here Friday last, and weigh well the matter. 
The post of honor is a private station. " 

Colonel Pickering wrote an answer, dated Salem, 
May 2d, 1775. 

" DEAR MADAM, 

"You as rightly as fully believe that we feel a sin 
cere friendship for each other ; and let it be lasting as 
our lives. I regret the separation which probably must 
soon take place ; but God grant it may be a short one. 
. . . For many years I regarded you with heartfelt affec 
tion ; but I must confess (and you will not think my friend 
ship is now less warm and sincere because I confess the 
truth) , that our repeated bickerings (I am sorry to use the 
word, but everything must yield to truth,) had sensibly 
lessened that affection, though it returned with all its force 
when I found we must part; and tis now heightened by

your very obliging, affectionate letter, which I have just 
received and read. Indeed, I formed a wish that you might 
not go, and was casting about in my mind in what manner 
I could provide for your safety and support, when Mr. 
Robie came in, and interrupted my anxious, but pleasing 
thoughts. When I last carried you to Marblehead, I had 
it in my heart to propose a mutual, cordial forgiveness of 
every thought, word, or look, which had ever borne the 
aspect of severity and unkindness ; but I need not tell you, 
that I am less prone than many to make an ado about such 
matters. I felt all, and perhaps more than I could have 
expressed ; and I entirely believed your feelings were kind 
and friendly as my own. 

" You do me justice in believing that I have an aversion 
to cruelty and rage against those called * friends to govern 
ment, some of whom I esteem highly, because I think them 
possessed of great integrity and worth. 

" I agree with you, that a private station is often the post 
of honor ; and I feel not the ambition for titles and high 
places, conspicuous in some men : at the same time, I think 
it my duty not to desert my country in that cause which I 
have hitherto espoused, a cause which I believe to be 
founded injustice, although, in conducting it, many irregu 
larities may have been committed ; a cause w 7 hich, if given 
up, or the supporters of it be overcome, Liberty itself, I 
fear, will expire ; and at present I do not feel an inclina 
tion to survive the liberties of my country. 

"But whatever becomes of me, may kind Heaven be your 
guardian and the guardian of your lovely daughter, whom I 
pray you to embrace for me." 

In 1775., Colonel Pickering published a duodecimo 
volume of about one hundred and fifty pages, with 
copper-plate engravings, entitled "An Easy Plan of 
Discipline for a Militia." It was not a mere com 
pilation, but a work containing many suggestions, the 



86 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1775. 

result of his own observation and reflection.* Previ 
ously to its publication, Major Joseph Hawley, then a 
member of the Provincial Congress, wrote to him, under 
date of Cambridge, February 3d, 1775, 

" I hope that I shall have the pleasure of seeing you here, 
with the work, the very beginning of next week. I men 
tion that time because I apprehend that the session is likely 
to be short ; and I have conceived so highly of the general 
utility of the performance, and of the immediate great ad 
vantages that will accrue therefrom to the militia, as that it 
would be extremely afflictive to me to return home without 
assurance that the public would forthwith receive the benefit 
of your generous efforts to serve them. I am vastly mis 
taken if your plan will not be so fully approved by common 
sense, as that it must infallibly take, and certainly balk all 
the attempts of envy to disparage it. . . . 

" I am, Sir, with great and most sincere esteem," &c. 

In a letter dated Water town, January 10th, 1776, 
Samuel Phillips, Jr., (subsequently the founder of Phil 
lips Academy, at Andover,) exhibits an instance of his 
patriotism and of his liberality. He says, 

" I have only time to thank you for your favors, and ex 
press my satisfaction on the prospect of the public s being 
served so materially as I think they must be by a recom 
mendation of your Plan of Discipline/ Be this as it may, if 

* He devised an expeditious method of sizing a company, which, he says, 
was "particularly adapted to a militia, for whom a size-roll, as used in the 
army, would be of little service, on account of the perpetual changes of the 
persons or sizes of the men. ... It was first published in 1769, in the 
Essex Gazette of October 24th, whilst the troops were in Boston, and 
was, I am informed, immediately adopted by one or more of the regiments in 
sizing the main guard, which, being composed of men taken from every com 
pany in the regiment, is in a situation similar to that of the militia, with re 
spect to the continual change of persons." Plan of Discipline, p. 68, 
note. Another method is practised now, suited to a different mode of forming 
a company.

my life is spared, you shall not be at one farthing s expense 
on account of any failure in the sale. Should the commu 
nity be so blind as not to avail themselves of so important 
improvements as you have put in their power, I shall be 
proud to be any way accessory to the preventing a burden 
falling on any person by means of his exertions for the 
general good, especially when such exertions were attended 
with no small expense." 

On the 4th of March, 1776, Colonel Pickering an 
swered Mr. Phillips : 

" I cannot sufficiently acknowledge your goodness mani 
fested in your letter of January 10th. Such an instance of 
unexampled generosity will for ever demand my gratitude. 
You might well suppose I had not received that letter, 
seeing I neglected to answer it. But, believe me, dear 
Sir, that I was neither insensible of the obligations laid on 
me by such a favor so kindly offered, nor wanting in respect 
to the noble, generous, amiable author of it. I speak my 
sober sentiments, for I love you too well to flatter you, and 
I hope you think me too honest to be capable of it." 

By a Resolve of the Council and the House of Rep 
resentatives of Massachusetts Bay of May 1st, 1776, 
reciting that u the Plan of Military Discipline/ lately 
published by Timothy Pickering, Esq., appears to this 
Court to be well adapted to the use and practice of a 
militia, as it contains all the motions in the manual 
exercise that are necessary and useful, and is not, like 
the Sixty-fourth, Norfolk and others, clogged with many 
superfluous motions, which only serve to burden the 
memory and perplex the learner ; and as it also con 
tains many useful manoeuvres, &c., not published in tbe 
Sixty-fourth," it was ordered, that this " Plan of Dis 
cipline " should, for the future, be used and practised by 
the militia of the Colony. In the same year the book 



88 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1776. 

passed to a second edition. It was superseded by the 
work afterwards published by Baron Steuben ; but so 
late as March 4th, 1799, General Epaphras Hoyt, of 
Deerfield, who had written a treatise for the instruc 
tion of the militia of Massachusetts, sent a copy of his 
work to Colonel Pickering, with the remark, "It is 
with pleasure I acknowledge my indebtedness to the 
Elements of Evolutions and Principles of Manoeuvres 
in your Plan of Discipline for a Militia. Of these I 
have made free use," &c. 

Although Colonel Pickering was not a well-read 
lawyer, the legal knowledge which he had acquired, 
his practical good sense, industry, and application to 
business, (to say nothing of his zeal on the side of the 
Colonies in their contest with the mother country,) rec 
ommended him to the government of the Province for 
judicial offices. In September, 1775, he was commis 
sioned as a Justice of the Peace ; and, as such, he took 
his place in the Court of Sessions. In the same autumn 
he was appointed a Justice of the Inferior Court of 
Common Pleas for the County of Essex. After the 
July term in 1775, the sittings of this Court were sus 
pended until July term in 1776, at which, and the suc 
ceeding term in September, he sat on the bench. On 
the 12th of December, 1775, he was commissioned and 
sworn as the sole Judge of the maritime court* for 
the counties of Suffolk, Essex, and Middlesex. This 
was an office of high responsibility ; for, as a great 
many privateers were fitted out by merchants and 
others in the counties of Suffolk and Essex, the cases 
brought before the Court for adjudication were numer- 

* Under a statute of Massachusetts, passed in 1775, entitled " An Act for

America."

ous, and in some of them property to a large amount 
was in question.* 

It seems that Colonel Pickering, being a candidate 
for appointment to some judicial office, was objected 
to on account of his remarks at the meeting of militia 
officers at Cambridge, just after the battle of Lexing 
ton.^ In consequence, he wrote the following letter to 
his friend Dr. Samuel Holten : 

" SALEM, October 16th, 1775. 

DEAR SIR, 

" I cannot forbear expressing my surprise at the principle 
advanced by a certain gentleman, with respect to the ap 
pointment of civil officers. To be consistent, he should go 
one step farther ; or, rather, he might be more explicit, and 
say, that unless a man have a brawny arm and the heart of a 
lion, or, in other words, if he possess not the prime quali 
ties of an executioner, he is unfit for a judge! But, for my 
own part, I would choose to bear the reproach of humanity, 
and a tender feeling for my brethren of mankind, especially 
my fellow-citizens, on the point of being exposed to all the 
calamities, the numberless calamities, of civil war, rather 
than, upon opposite principles, be advanced to the highest 
posts, and so possess, with infamy, the reward of savage 
ferocity and barbarism. What does common sense pro 
nounce to be the proper qualifications of a judge ? Are they 
other than these, integrity, ability, and knowledge of the 
law? Who, in searching for a judge, a discerner between 
truth and falsehood, right and wrong, would, before all 
things, inquire for a man of conquering attributes, for a 
hero ? 

"With regard to the instance in question, tis true I 
differed in opinion from some others. I said we were not 
prepared for war, and that war to me appeared not unavoid-

able : hence arose my wishes still longer to forbear avowed 
hostilities. Dr. Warren a man deservedly esteemed and 
honored urged strenuously the pushing into Boston and 
cutting off the troops before a re enforcement should arrive. 
I declared instantly my opinion, that it was then imprac 
ticable. I know my opinion did not prevent it ; but it was 
not done. And were I now to say, even now the Colonies 
are unprepared for war, the declaration would not be wholly 
destitute of truth. Ask General Washington : he 11 tell you 
he is obliged to remain most mortifyingly inactive, and 
receive, without reply, the enemy s unceasing insults. This 
he declared to me last week. But, admitting my opinion to 
be unfounded, must I from thence be concluded my coun- 
trv s enemy, or timid friend? Suffer me to mention a fact. 
In 1745, in our House of Representatives, this question was 
agitated : Is it practicable to take Louisburg? It was long 
and calmly debated, and at length determined in the affirma 
tive by a majority of one voice only. What now was to 
be done with the minority ? Should they be expelled the 
House because they were less sanguine than their brethren, 
and be excluded from offices? The cases, I think, are not 
unlike. The question being once determined, the minority 
were as active as their opponents in setting forward the 
expedition ; and, by a remarkable series of fortunate events, 
it happily succeeded. God grant our present enterprise 
may be alike successful ! My efforts have not been wanting, 
to the utmost of my ability ; and, had I been actually a mem 
ber of the army, I could scarcely have spent more time in its 
service. Since the 19th of April, one month would much 
more than comprise all my labor and attention to my own 
affairs. And a hundred pounds, lawful money, would not 
tempt me again to go through the application and fatigue of 
writing my military treatise. You will, Sir, excuse this 
tedious epistle. I am bound, in justice to myself, to mention 
these things, to show how extremely unreasonable it would 
be to refuse me such offices as I am qualified to discharge for 
the trifling cause referred to, or rather for no cause at all. 



^T. 30.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 91 

I do not say this because I regret my missing a certain ap 
pointment. I repeat what I told you, that, whatever I may 
be hereafter, when study and experience have matured my 
judgment, I am at present unfit for that important trust. 
Had the appointment taken place, I think I must have de 
clined it, lest I should by accepting it disgrace myself and 
injure and dishonor my country. For the present is the 
most important period since the Colony was founded ; and 
never was there a greater necessity of filling the offices of 
government with men of integrity, ability, and knowledge, 
both on account of the difficulty of the times, and that our 
adversaries and posterity [may have no ground] for vilify 
ing, stinging reflections ; for sorry should I be to see the 
Colony again reproached, and its senators and leaders 
styled, ignominiously, Dii minorum gentium. 1 * 

" I do not repeat my petition. You know me ; so do 
others; and your discernment, and sense of the dignity 
becoming freemen, will lead you to expect no servile en 
treaties from me. A slave may present them at the shrine 
of power ; but a liberal mind will reject the offering with 
disdain. 

"I am, Sir, with great regard, your obliged friend," &c. 

Soon afterward Dr. Holten wrote the following : 

" WATERTOWN, November 3d, 1775. 

"I congratulate you, Sir, on your appointment as a Justice 
of the Court of Common Pleas for the County of Essex, and 
one of the Quorum for said county ; and when it is fully 
known to you the part I took in your favor, I make no 
doubt you will consider me as a true friend, and acting 
upon no other principles than to promote the welfare and 
prosperity of my country." 

Colonel Pickering replied, November 15th, 1775, 



* See Hutchinson s " History of the Province of Massachusetts Bay," Vol. 
II. p. 3.

" I thank you for your kind congratulations on my ap 
pointment to the offices you mention. I have at no time 
doubted your being my real friend. But (as you intimate) 
every act of friendship ought to be exercised in perfect 
consistency with the welfare and prosperity of one s coun 
try ; and, if I should ever so far mistake my talents as to 
request an employment incompatible with those supreme 
considerations, tis my wish that my friends may as stren 
uously oppose it, as in other cases I could pray them to 
espouse my interest." 

Colonel Pickering wrote the following letter to 
General Washington, and was himself one of the vol 
unteers therein mentioned 5 as is shown by the Gen 
eral s answer. 

" SALEM, January 31st, 1776. 

Sra, 

"The General. Court of this Colony having, pursuant to 
your request, issued orders for raising upwards of four 
thousand men to serve, in the army that is under your Ex 
cellency s immediate command, till the first day of April 
next, and of that number directed that ninety-one be en 
listed in the town of Salem, in consequence thereof the 
militia were mustered and the resolves of the Court read 
to them, and the importance of manning the lines at Cam 
bridge and Roxbury was urged ; but, great numbers of the 
inhabitants being at sea, many impressed on board the 
British ships, a considerable number in the American armed 
vessels and privateers, one hundred employed as a sea-coast 
guard, and perhaps double that number already in the army, 
of the residue, two or three only presented themselves to 
serve on the common establishment of the army. We were 
therefore induced to try another method, and the Committee 
of Safety gave the enlisting orders to a worthy man and 
good soldier who had served as a Lieutenant in the army 
the last campaign, and offered a month s pay in advance to 
all who would enlist under him. But this measure also 



JET. 30.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 93 

proved ineffectual. Hence the persons whose names are 
subjoined, inhabitants of the toAvn of Salem, convinced that 
tis of the last importance to the United Colonies, and essen 
tial to the safety of this Colony, to defend the lines at Cam 
bridge and Roxbury, have agreed (as tis not in their power 
to do anything more or better) to form themselves into a 
company of volunteers, to serve in the army till the first 
day of April next without pay ; and they now, Sir, beg 
leave to tender themselves to your Excellency, to be em 
ployed as you shall think best ; and pray they may, by the 
bearer, who is one of the company, be made acquainted 
with your Excellency s pleasure." 

An answer was returned by General Washington, 
under date of Cambridge, February 1st, 1776. 

"SIR, 

" Your favor of yesterday I received, and am sorry to 
hear that the quota of militia which the town of Salem was 
to furnish, by resolve of the Honorable General Court, 
cannot be had. 

"The generous tender of services made by you, Sir, and 
the rest of the volunteers, claims a return of my sincere 
thanks. Should I have an occasion to call upon them, I 
shall do it; at present, I wish them to continue at Salem, 
and to hold themselves in readiness. 

"I am,"&c. 

The town of Salern, in May, 1776, voted to send 
Representatives to the General Court, to be chosen 
by differently colored balk; and Colonel Pickering was 
chosen in that singular mode ; but such an election 
was held to be void; On the 4th of June he was 
reflected in due form of law. The town, in advising 
their Representatives, say, that, if Congress shall de 
clare the independence of the Colonies, " we are ready 
to abide bv the decision."

CHAPTER VII. 

Colonel Pickering volunteers a second Time. Marches a Regi 
ment of Militia to the State of New York. It becomes a Part 
of General Heath s Command. Heath s Inefficiency. Various 
Incidents of the Expedition. 

IN 1776, July 4th and 13th, it was resolved by the 
General Assembly of Massachusetts Bay, that the Com 
missary appointed to furnish the sea-coast men stationed 
at Salem be directed to furnish the company of ma- 
trosses, to be raised and stationed at Salem, with all 
necessaries agreeably to the sea-coast establishment, 
and that this company be under the order and direction 
of Colonel Pickering, and, in case of his absence from 
Salem, of Major Joseph Sprague. 

In a preceding chapter * it is stated that a regiment 
of militia, numbering a little more than seven hundred 
men, furnished by the county of Essex, was placed 
under the command of Colonel Pickering, and was 
called into actual service, and that it performed the 
campaign in the States of New York and New Jersey. 
The following narrative of the expedition is taken from 
Colonel Pickering s journal and letters. 

He left Salem on the 24th of December, and, by the 
way of Boston, Walpole, and Attleboro , arrived at 
Providence on the 26th. 

In a letter to Mrs. Pickering, dated Providence, De 
cember 27th, he writes, 

* Chapter V. pp. 78, 79. 



fflT.31.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 95 

"I arrived here yesterday about eleven o clock, A. M., 
and was surprised at meeting Dr. [Archelaus] Putnam, who, 
with the rest of the Salem company, I supposed, had been 
far beyond Providence ; but I found General Lincoln had 
stopped them, and he yet detains us till he receives orders, 
from the Assembly of our State, either to proceed or stay 
here. The latter will be extremely agreeable to us, if 
compatible with the general good ; and, considering the 
proximity of the enemy (they being several thousand strong 
at Rhode Island), it appeared to me, from what the General 
remarked on the state of matters, that he judged it would 
be expedient that about three thousand of the Massachusetts 
militia should tarry here." 

"Journal. The 28th, at evening, received General Lin 
coln s orders to march my regiment for Danbury the next 
day at noon (Sunday) . I gave orders accordingly to the 
captains, and the regiment marched between twelve and 
one." 

On the 30th he set off with General Lincoln and his 
aids-de-camp, and Brigadier-General Moulton and Brig 
ade-Major Burnham. Passing through Coventry, Wind- 
ham, Hartford, &c., they arrived on the 2d of January, 
1777, at Danbury, where Colonel Pickering remained 
until the 13th. On the 2d, at Southbury, they heard 
of the capture of the Hessians at Trenton. 

TO MRS. PICKERING. 

"DANBURY, January 12th, 1777. 

"Until this morning I expected to go into the Jerseys, 
but have received orders to go to North Castle, about 
twenty-seven miles from Danbury, towards New York. . . . 
Part of my regiment are gone to Peekskill, but are to go 
down to North Castle, to which place I have ordered those 
companies of my regiment now here. I go myself to-mor 
row morning by sunrise, in company with Mr. [Francis] 
Cabot, for North Castle. 



96 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1777. 

"I arrived at Danbury on Thursday night, the 2d of 
January, in company with General Lincoln, who, going on 
the next day for Peekskill, directed me to tarry here, to 
forward the militia as they arrived. Two companies in my 
regiment are not yet come in Danvers and Marblehead. 

" I have been most kindly entertained here at the house 
of Mr. John McLean, a wealthy, worthy, sensible Scotch 
man, most zealously attached to the public cause of America, 
and who, with a degree of indignation, mentions the in 
gratitude of his countrymen and other foreigners, who have 
made their fortunes in America, and yet are now opposing 
its best interests, the essential interests of the country sub 
dued and cultivated by those men whose children those 
ungrateful wretches are now striving to subject to the yoke 
of tyranny. This good man I shall ever remember with 
respect and love." 

TO MRS. PICKERING. 

"BEDFORD [N. Y.], January 14th, 1777. 

" Yesterday I walked from Danbury to this place twenty 
long miles in company with Mr. Cabot and two other 
gentlemen. I am now within about six miles of our head 
quarters at North Castle, where, I am here informed, Gen 
eral Heath is arrived, and is to command. My regiment, 
with a number of other Massachusetts regiments, are ordered 
to North Castle. In my next, perhaps, I shall be able to tell 
you something of our operations. God grant us success, 
and restore me with honor to my beloved." 

"Journal.* -- Tuesday, January 14th. Walked from 
Bedford to North Castle, about six miles. About four o clock 
marched with four companies of my regiment thence to 
Tarrytown, about ten miles. According to general orders, 
formed van, flank, and rear guards. Reached Tarrytown 
between eight and nine o clock. No barracks provided, nor 
barrack-master to find them ; but was obliged to ramble from

&lt;ffi T 31.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 97 

house to house till after ten, when the companies were cov 
ered. Invited by the General [Lincoln] to keep at his 
quarters, which I did ; now, with him, for the first time 
since I marched, lodging on the floor. Wednesday and 
Thursday, the rest of my regiment got in, and the whole 
were furnished with ammunition and provisions for an ex 
pedition to Kingsbridge and its environs. 

"Friday, January 17th. The regiments (LovelPs, 
Thacher s, Frost s, and mine, there being no more with 
General Lincoln) completed their preparations for the ex 
pedition, and the three latter were ordered to parade at 
Dobbs s Ferry, ten miles from Kingsbridge, at eleven o clock 
at night, with the wagons, one to one hundred men. 
Lovell s regiment marched over in the afternoon to join 
General Heath s division. The regiments paraded punctu 
ally, and about twelve at midnight the whole marched off, 
my regiment leading, followed by one piece of artillery, 
brass six-pounder, commanded by Captain Fleeming (a 
Yorker), and then by Colonel Thacher s regiment. Colonel 
Frost s formed the van, flank, and rear guards. It was a 
cold, uncomfortable night. We reached Colonel Phillips s, 
within about three miles of Kingsbridge, about four o clock 
in the morning, which obliged us to halt an hour, that 
we might not arrive too soon. Then we marched on and 
reached the grounds towards Kingsbridge at broad daylight 
on Saturday morning. Saw some men coming out of a 
house, supposed to be soldiers ; and by the General s order 
I detached two companies (Ward s and Evans s) to inter 
cept them and any others the} might find. But they were 
a little too late, and strangers to the ground, without a 
guide ; otherwise they would have surprised another party 
of thirty or forty, whom they saw running away, and who 
left their blankets, &c., in their barracks, which our soldiers 
afterwards took awa} r ; and there and at other places, in the 
course of the day, they picked up considerable plunder. 
As soon as I had detached those two companies, by the 
General s orders I ascended the hills, followed by Captain 

VOL. I. 13 



98 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1777. 

Fleeming with his six-pounder, and advanced towards 
Spiten-Devil Creek, but had no guide, and knew not where 
to find it. Halted, advanced, and halted. The General left 
me, I knew not when, and went over to Valentine s Hill. I 
saw him not again till night. Between eleven and twelve 
at noon, received a written order from him, directed to 
Brigadier Moulton or me, to go to Spiten-Devil [Creek] with 
my regiment. I accordingly advanced again, but without a 
guide who could give us a just description of the route we 
were to take. Advanced with a small party to reconnoitre ; 
discovered a few of the enemy near Kingsbridge, but saw 
no body of our troops on the other side to cooperate with us ; 
and, after waiting some time, till towards sundown, hearing 
nothing further of the General, the men having had no 
sleep nor refreshment for the day, except a little frozen 
meat and bread, I retired ; and in retiring met Chaplain 
Thaxter, with a message from the General for my return 
with my regiment and the artillery. The General ordered 
the troops to find cover for the night where they could, in 
the woods, or by retiring to the nearest houses, after a 
proper guard was drawn out to remain on the hills north 
ward of Fort Independence. 

"In the forenoon a person came from Valentine s Hill, 
and informed that Colonel Thacher s regiment had gained 
possession of one fort, and had from thence fired on Fort 
Independence. But the fort gained proved afterwards to 
be only a poor work which the enemy abandoned, and which 
our troops then entered. In a word, the proceedings of 
the two divisions at the southward under Generals Heath, 
"VVooster, Parsons, and Scott, were fruitless. Fort Inde 
pendence General Heath summoned to surrender, but his 
demand was disregarded. 

" Pursuant to the General s [Heath s] orders, the troops 
retired, except Colonel Frost s regiment, which encamped 
in the woods. General Lincoln and aids-de-camp, divers 
other officers, and myself, went to Colonel Phillips s, where 
we were entertained with the greatest politeness. The 



MT. 31.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 99 

Colonel is reported a Tory, and, as such, has been secured, 
but discharged on his parole. Nevertheless, whether it was 
policy, benevolence, or good breeding, a more agreeable 
reception I never met with. 

"Sunday Morning, January 19th. I returned to the for 
mer day s grounds, and in the forenoon rode over with Gen 
eral Lincoln and Brigadier Moulton to confer with Generals 
Heath, Wooster, Parsons, &c. They concluded that it was 
practicable only to forage ; having received information, by 
a deserter, that the enemy at Fort Independence and Kings- 
bridge were greatly reeuforced. Then we returned to our 
quarters. The regiments were mustered, and their baggage 
put up, in order to march over towards General Heath s 
division, to facilitate the execution of the intended plan ; 
but, before night, General Heath sent an express to desire 
General Lincoln to make no movement, some interesting in 
telligence from General Washington rendering it expedient, 
as he said. We retired to quarters. General Lincoln, and 
son, and myself erected a hut with rails and straw, and 
lodged in the woods. This afternoon the wind got round 
to the southward, and the weather moderated. 

" Monday, January 20th. A pleasant day. Detached 
one hundred and sixty of my regiment, to be joined with 
detachments from Lovell s, Thacher s, and Frost s, in the 
whole, five hundred men, for an expedition to be executed 
this day ; but Generals Heath, Parsons, &c., came over, and, 
with General Lincoln, reconnoitred, and found their scheme 
impracticable. I was appointed to command the detach 
ment, with Lieutenant-Colonel How of Thacher s regiment, 
and Major under me. 

"Tuesday, January 21st. Two field-pieces, covered by 
a hundred musketeers, were ordered to the hill near Spiten- 
Devil Creek, to fire a few shot at the enemy near Kings- 
bridge, which was done, without doing any execution. 
The enemy returned the fire from a small field-piece, but 
they always overshot us. I went as a spectator. The dis 
tance was, I judged, about half a mile from the enemy. 



100 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1777. 

They also fired several shot at us frorn the fort, or battery, 
northward of Fort Washington (which also was in sight, 
and distant, it is said, from Kingsbridge about four miles), 
at the distance, I judge, on a straight line, of about two 
miles. These were eighteen-pound shot, very well thrown. 
One struck and rebounded. As it rose we discovered it, 
and saw it moving slowly through the air, about fifty yards 
from us, till it pitched again, about seventy yards from 
where it struck first. At this time a party was ordered on 
fatigue in a neighboring wood, to make chandeliers and 
fascines for a breastwork to open on Kingsbridge, distant, 
perhaps, half a mile. Afterwards we returned to our quar 
ters, a new hut, nicely built, and covered with oak-leaves 
and brush, under Mr. Thaxter s direction. 

"Wednesday, January 22d. Paraded my regiment at 
daybreak. In the evening, having made a large fire before 
our hut, some sparks flew upon our roof, covered with oak 
leaves, and in a minute the whole was in flames ; but we 
lost none of our baggage. This obliged us to find a house 
for the night ; so we retired to General Moulton s quarters, 
and lodged on the floor. I slept well, and was recovered 
a little from a cold I caught on Saturday. 

"Thursday, January 23d. In the afternoon I detached 
three captains, four subalterns, seven sergeants, seven cor 
porals, and one hundred and sixty privates, from my regi 
ment, to be joined with detachments from Thacher s and 
Frost s regiments, making, in the whole, about four hundred 
rank and file, to parade at four o clock next morning. I 
was directed to take the command of them, if my health 
would permit. I was not well of my cold, but I did not 
decline the command. This afternoon there was a skirmish 
between a party of Generals Heath s and Wooster s divisions 
and the enemy, southward of Fort Independence. A small 
number of the Americans were killed and wounded. 

" At ten o clock in the evening, received information that 
the detachments made in the afternoon were discharged, the 
matter being over for which they were intended. It began 
to snow in the evening. 



^E T . 31.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 101 

"Friday, January 24th. The snow fell last night about 
three or four inches deep, and this morning it rained hard, 
by which the soldiers were generally wet, in their huts, 
through to their skins. General Lincoln sent Major Pop- 
kin, one of his aides-de-camp, to General Heath, for orders 
relative to the removing the troops, it being impossible for 
them to continue in their present situation, either with com 
fort and a possibility of preserving their health, or safety, 
for their arms were wet and their ammunition would soon 
be spoiled. Major Popkin was gone four hours, being 
detained that General Heath might get intelligence from 
his advanced posts, and in endeavoring to persuade him to 
consent that General Lincoln s division might retire to their 
old quarters at Tarrytown and Dobbs s Ferry, to shift and dry 
their clothes, and refresh themselves, after their fatigues ; 
but General Heath would consent only that they should 
retire about two and three miles to the nearest houses. But, 
notwithstanding, General Lincoln, upon considering the 
uncomfortable condition of his troops, and uselessness of 
their arms and ammunition, from their being so much wet, 
consented that we should proceed towards our old quarters, 
and in the mean time went to General Heath to induce him 
also to consent, saying, as he left me, that, if General Heath 
would not consent to a necessity so urgent, he must send an 
express to stop us. We accordingly began our march ; but 
such had been the fatigues and distress of the men from cold 
and want of cover for the week past, that the impatience of 
great numbers carried them off without orders, and it was 
not without much difficulty that I could collect any to form 
a body capable of action, to secure our retreat. Indeed, the 
arms and ammunition in general were so damaged by the 
rain, that we could have made but a feeble resistance, had 
the enemy sallied. Tis true the storm rendered a sally im 
probable ; besides, we moved off in silence. 

" On the march, about half way between our late camp and 
Tarrytown, the Brigade-Major, Burnham, brought me Gen 
eral Heath s positive orders to march to Miles Square. But it 



102 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1777. 

was absolutely impracticable to execute them. A large pro 
portion of the men had by this time arrived at their quarters, 
and full three fourths of my regiment were ahead of me, and I 
on foot, with my pack and large blanket at my back (which I 
chose to carry, that I might know what soldiers endured, and 
to make them more easy, seeing I endured the same fatigues) . 
"Besides, had my regiment been then embodied and under 
command, I should hardly have attempted to turn them about, 
to face, in the afternoon, a driving south-east storm of rain, 
when they had been wet to their skins many hours, and, for 
the reasons already mentioned, they could have yielded little 
assistance to General Heath, had we obeyed his orders. 
Indeed, it appeared to me to be downright cruelty to order 
them there, especially as no important advantage was held 
up to view to compensate the soldier s fatigue, nor, indeed, 
any reason mentioned, but the saving General Heath and his 
division the trouble of turning out of the houses they at 
that time occupied, and retiring to others a little more 
remote from the enemy ; for, as to the enemy s taking pos 
session of the ground he and we quitted, it was ridiculous to 
urge that as a reason for our tarrying ; for, if we could not 
drive them from the naked hills, how could he expect to 
take Fort Independence, and destroy Kingsbridge, that is 
open to the fort ? against which that he might try his twenty- 
four-pounder and howitz, General Heath also urged us to 
stay. These were his reasons for the orders he gave for 
our staying in our miserable huts, in cold and rain and 
snow, or of retiring only two or three miles to houses, where 
we had neither clothes to shift ourselves, nor any refresh 
ment save beef and flour ; for, when we left Tarrytown, a 
week before, we had orders to take only our blankets and 
axes, and the two days provisions we had cooked, General 
Lincoln expecting but a short expedition. We did not even 
take our camp-kettles ; and the troops, being detained, suf 
fered a good deal from the want of them, eating their beef 
roasted (many without salt) on the coals, or held in the fire 
at the end of a stick sharpened and run through the slices. 



MT. 31.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 103 

Indeed, we were so lucky at this time as to get hard bread, 
a quantity of which had been prepared for the expedition ; 
but this was soon gone, and for two thirds of the week flour 
was dealt out, which the soldiers made, some into cakes, 
and some into dumplings, boiled with their meat ; for we 
at length had sent for our camp-kettles. 

" We continued our route to our old quarters at Tarry- 
town and Dobbs s Ferry. 

"Thus ended our week s expedition. After enduring a 
variety of hardships, we returned, doing nothing and getting 
nothing but the paltry booty of a few blankets, about 
forty, a box of candles, a parcel of osnaburgs, and about 
forty small arms, all not making a single wagon-load. 

"The expedition was disgraceful.* We were to take 
Fort Independence, not by storm, for the whole army was 
militia, and the work was ditched, fraised, and surrounded 
by an abatis; not by regular approaches, for we had not 
a single intrenching tool ; not by cannonade, for we had 
only three six-pounders. And yet, on the first morning we 
arrived, General Heath, with ridiculous parade and ground 
less, vain expectation, sent in a summons, demanding the 
surrender of the fort ! The garrison must have been fools 
and arrant cowards to have regarded it. They did not 
regard it. After arriving at Morristown, I understood that 
part of the plan was to have taken New York itself, f 

"The only fruit of the expedition, besides the trifling 
plunder above mentioned, was the carrying oif some forage 
from West Chester and the manor of Fordham, the fora 
gers being covered by Heath s and Wooster s divisions, and 
countenanced by ours. But, had the counsels of the com- 
mander-in-chief (General Heath) been decisive, and meas 
ures proper and effectual taken to execute them : had the 
only practicable measure (unprovided as we were with 
necessaries, and after the failures of the first morning) been

pursued, foraging; all the wagons of the army might 
have been employed, and the whole forage carried off in 
three days, and the troops returned to their quarters. And 
apparent advantage hence arising would have made them 
more contented, even if their fatigues had been greater than 
they were ; for the soldiers, constantly struggling with many 
difficulties and fatigues, and yet seeing no benefit arising, 
were angry and impatient. 

"It seems the design of the expedition was, if possible, 
to take Fort Independence, destroy Kingsbridge, carry off 
forage, and alarm the enemy, so as to draw off from or pre 
vent their reenforcing their army in the Jerseys.* But Fort 
Independence is not taken ; Kingsbridge is not destroyed ; 
the enemy has been but little alarmed, for it is now pretty 
clear they have not lessened their forces in the Jerseys, nor 
increased them at Fort Independence or Kingsbridge ; at 
the latter they have been induced to throw up a little re 
doubt. We have, as before mentioned, carried off some 
forage. 

"Saturday, January 25th, 1777. Continued at Tarry- 
town and Dobbs s Ferry ; the men cleaning their guns, and 
changing and drying their ammunition, and drying their 
clothes. 

"Sunday, January 26th. Remained still at Tarry town, 
and ordered the regiment to assemble in the afternoon to 
attend divine service ; but about one o clock received orders 
to march immediately to Colonel Phillips s. This, it ap 
peared to me, would be extremely inconvenient ; for, as my 
regiment lay cantoned through a space of four miles, it must 
take so long a time to transmit orders to the several com 
panies and for them to get ready, that I supposed we could 
not reach the place of our destination till nine o clock at 
night, and then we must hunt for quarters in unknown 
houses. Besides, although I had given timely notice the 
day before to the commissary, and he had promised me he

would have the provisions ready in the morning, yet it was 
night before they arrived ; by which means most of my 
regiment had no victuals for the day. Issued orders for the 
regiment to parade near Dobbs s Ferry at two o clock, Mon 
day morning, intending to be at Colonel Phillips s by broad 
daylight. But some companies did not parade in season, so 
that it was near seven o clock when the regiment arrived at 
Phillips s. There, the moment I arrived, Brigadier Moul- 
ton s orders were delivered me, directing me to march to 
Tippet s Hill, near Spiten-Devil Creek. I proceeded up 
wards of two miles, and halted where we must turn off to 
the right to go to Spiten-Devil Creek, collected the field 
officers and captains, and told them that Captain Jackson, 
with his company of the train with a six-pounder, was to 
have come with us from Tarrytown, but had not obeyed his 
orders ; that Brigadier Moulton, in his orders, said he should 
follow me with Colonel Thacher s regiment, but had not 
done it ; that, therefore, if we advanced to Tippet s Hill, it 
might be in the power of the enemy to cut off our retreat ; 
and then put the question, whether we should alone ad 
vance to Tippet s Hill. They were unanimous in their 
opinion that we ought not to proceed any farther. I had 
previously sent guards to the most commanding eminences. 
"At length General Lincoln arrived. I informed him of 
the reason of my halting. He entirely approved of my con 
duct, and added, that he had no intention that my regiment 
should proceed alone. Soon after our arrival where we 
halted, some of my sentries discovered half a dozen light- 
horsemen by Colonel Cortland s, between us and Fort In 
dependence, for which place they soon scampered away. 
Thacher s regiment arrived ; and four companies of mine 
were ordered to advance to Tippet s Hill to see that the way 
was clear, and to watch the enemy. When Captain Jackson 
eairie up, he was ordered, with his piece, to Tippet s HilJ ; 
but his horses tired by the way. So he returned, and all 
of us (it now being almost dark) retired to Colonel Phillips s, 
and the nearest houses round about and beyond his. I,

with Colonel Morrill, Dr. Putnam, and the Salem company, 
put up at Colonel Phillips s. We were kindly entertained. 
We remained here quietly the next day, Tuesday, January 
28th, the succeeding night and following day, Wednesday, 
January 29th, and supposed we should abide there the third 
night ; * but in the evening, about six o clock, after it had 
been snowing several hours, I received General Lincoln s 
orders to parade my regiment at eight o clock, and march 
to our old quarters at Dobbs s Ferry and Tarry town. The 
orders came so late, my regiment was so scattered, and 
some of the wagoners being out of the way, it was past ten 
before we marched. It was warm, and snowy, and I did 
not arrive at my quarters till after two in the morning, and 
was as much fatigued as with the march of the 24th instant 
in the rain, although I now marched but eleven miles. 
After I had refreshed myself, at near four in the morning 
I lay down in my blanket and slept till day, about two 
hours and a half. Yet, notwithstanding the fatigue and so 
little sleep, I felt myself well and sprightly through the 
day, Thursday, January 30th." 

In a letter of January 30th to Mrs. Pickering, having 
mentioned these two marches, he adds, 

" With a pack at my back both times. Yet I was but 
little wearied, and out-travelled multitudes of the common 
soldiers. My toils make me hungry. I eat meat two, and 
generally three, times a day, yet find no inconvenience there 
from. At dinner I rarely get anything but bread and meat ; 
in the morning they are qualified with tea, coffee, or choco 
late. This is a specimen of my manner of living." 

And on February 2d he writes, " Cheese, butter, and 
milk are rarely to be met with." j 

* The Colonel and his lady, particularly the latter, evidently began to be 
weary of us after the first night, although they continued to treat us politely, 
and fed the Doctor and me at their own table. When we departed, I thanked 
them for their hospitality. The Colonel said they were obliged to me."

Journal. "Friday, January 31st. Remained quiet at 
Tarry town. In the evening received orders to march my 
regiment, with bag and baggage, the next day, to the houses 
next beyond White Plains, on the road to New York. 
Issued orders accordingly. But, the regiment being posted 
in scattered houses through an extent of six miles, it was 
impossible to notify them in such season as for them to get 
read} to march early. It was two in the afternoon of Sat 
urday when we began our march, and we arrived at our 
new quarters in the evening. I dropped the companies as 
we passed, the first at about seven, and the last about 
eleven, miles from Tarry town. I attended the quartering 
the whole before I went to my own lodgings, which were 
near the centre of the cantonment, at Mr. Griffin s, a house 
on a hill, about a quarter of a mile from the road, the same 
house which General Howe made his headquarters last sum 
mer, after the battle at White Plains, from whence it is 
distant about two miles. The old gentleman has no child 
of his own, but a second wife ; whose former husband (Du- 
zenborough) died at about forty years of age. A few years 
before his death he weighed upwards of three hundred and 
eighty pounds, and at his death was supposed to weigh four 
hundred. He was about six feet high, and died of exces 
sive fat. 

"Mr. Griffin informed me that Colonel Carr, of the 
Twenty-ninth Regiment, was brought to his house from the 
battle of the White Plains, and died there of his wounds, 
and in the very bed-room where I lodged. 

" Sunday, February 2d. Remained quiet at Mr. Griffin s, 
in the manor of Scarsdale." 

In a letter dated "Manor of Scarsdale, two miles 
south of White Plains, February 2d," to Mrs. Pickering, 
he says, 

" I am informed by General Lincoln, that there are three 
thousand tons of hay and grain on the lauds round about

here, as computed by the New York Committee, which it 
is intended to cart off, to prevent their falling into Howe s 
hands ; and the Massachusetts and Connecticut militia are 
to furnish guards to secure the persons employed in doing 
it, or, in the military phrase, to cover the foragers. This 
being the business, and of considerable importance, I 
imagine we may remain here ten days or a fortnight. 
"Where we shall go then, I know not. I, a few days since, 
thought we should have been called into the Jerseys ; but it 
will be so late when we have finished our present business, 
that it will seem hardly worth while, for half our time of 
service is already expired. 

"Since we left Danbury (January 13th), we have been 
almost continually on the move, and I have gone through 
as much fatigue as almost any person in my regiment ; yet 
I am as well and hearty as ever I was in my life." 

The letter was accompanied with cuttings of the 
black Burgundy grape for his brother, of which he 
says, "An excellent fruit, and so hardy that the vine 
will bear our winters without extraordinary pains. . . . 
I am very desirous of having the grape propagated 
among us." * 

Journal. " Monday, February 3d. Still at Mr. 
Griffin s. . . .

General Heath.

vates, to be joined by detachments from Thacher s regiment

Valentine s house, about a mile on this side the fort, and to 
take one Williams, a Tory, who gave the garrison informa 
tion of our first approach on the 17th of January. The 
detachments assembled ; but, like other enterprises under 
the direction of our commander-in-chief (G. H.) [General 
Heath], the design was not prosecuted. 

"Thursday, February 6th. The detachment from my 
regiment returned, most of them in the morning, having no 
provisions to continue out during the day (indeed they 
could have done no service by continuing). The detach 
ment from Captain Ward s company only, remained with 
Colonel Enos (who was to command the whole), and took 
a tour with him to New Rochelle. They returned at night, 
fatigued and hungry." 

In a letter to Mrs. Pickering, dated " Manor of Scars- 
dale, about thirteen miles eastward from Kingsbridge, 
Friday, February 7th, 1777, evening," he wrote, 

. . . "Yet think not, from my impatience to see you, 
that I am discontented with my service. It is for you that 
I wish to return ; and but for you I know not whether I 
should not devote myself to the military service of my 
country while it should remain in arms. Not that I am 
fond of war : &lt; Peace is my dear deliyht. But the avarice, 
the ambition and tyranny, of a few fellow-mortals drive 
peaceful men to arms. 

" I am just informed by a messenger from General Lin 
coln, that we are shortly to march to the Jerseys, to join 
General Washington. I wish we had done it a month ago. 
W r e are all sick of the insignificant expedition this way under 
the direction of General Heath. His management has con 
firmed the opinion I ever entertained concerning him. He 
has, in the estimation of every discerning man, acquired 
nought but disgrace. I speak my mind freely ; you know 
I am apt to do it. And, if my own conduct should be as 
unworthy, I will not blame the world for reproaching me

with it. But I trust in God I shall do my duty. Join, my 
dear life, my other self, join your prayers with mine, to the 
Great Supreme, the Lord of Hosts, that He, in the hour 
of danger, in the day of battle, should I be called to it, 
would support and protect, me ; or, if I fall, that it may be 
with honor to myself and advantage to my country. And 
then, O Parent in heaven ! be a father to the fatherless, 
and the widow s God ! My amiable girl, be not discour 
aged. Heaven WILL protect me, and restore me to your 
arms. How often (you have heard me remark) have I 
thought many events against me ! Yet, by those means, 
God, in whom I trusted, hath blessed me beyond my wishes. 
My engaging in the war grieved you to the heart. But 
doubt not that it will eventually add to our mutual 
felicity. . . . 

" When my ears are blessed with the news of one pro 
pitious event,* I shall be at ease. 

Journal. "Friday, February 7th, evening. At half- 
after eight o clock, received of the Brigade-Major the 
following order from General Lincoln (who received the 
order from General Heath not till seven o clock) , to wit : 
4 Colonel Pickering s Regiment will furnish three captains, 
three subalterns, nine sergeants, nine corporals, and one 
hundred and ninety-one privates, including those who are 
for the foraging guard, to be paraded at sunrise to-morrow 
morning at Ward s. Colonel Pickering will take the com 
mand of those from General Lincoln s division. North 
Street, near White Plains, February 7th, 1777. 

" I was more angry than surprised, that General Heath 
should issue an order so unreasonably late, to be executed 
the next morning by sunrise, although my regiment was 
cantoned through a space of five miles, which he well knew. 
But it was of a piece with his other proceedings. I directed

the adjutant immediately to make out the details for the 
detachment, and deliver them to the several captains, which 
he did. I marched from my quarters just after daylight (it 
was cloudy), and arrived with the detachment at Ward s 
about twenty minutes, or, at most, half an hour, after sun 
rise, distant from my quarters about five miles. There I 
found Lieutenant-Colonel How, of Thacher s Regiment, 
with a detachment of about one hundred and forty privates, 
besides officers. About nine o clock, Major Wilcox, of the 
Connecticut militia, with near a hundred men, joined us. 
Their orders were similar to my own, only to parade at 
Ward s at sunrise. Our detachments, united, formed a body 
of about four hundred and thirty or four hundred and forty, 
including officers. Here we waited impatiently, expecting 
further orders, and the coming of wagons to forage, which, 
it was intimated to me by the Brigade-Major, was intended. 
But after thus waiting till eleven in the forenoon, and receiv 
ing no orders, and the wagons not coming (saving those of 
my regiment, which came by my direction) , Colonel How 
and Major Wilcox asking what should be done, I replied, 
that in my opinion we should be justified if we returned to 
our quarters ; that it was a lowery day, and sometimes 
rainy, which might discourage the foragers, and prevent 
their coming ; nevertheless, as I had no doubt it was in 
tended to forage, if it was agreeable to them, we would 
march back ; and, if we met the foragers, or received further 
orders, well ; we would proceed accordingly ; otherwise, 
return to our quarters. They approved the proposal. I 
marched, and was followed by Colonel How. But Wilcox s 
detachment, I afterwards found, stayed at Ward s. After 
retiring about a mile and a half, we met Mr. Tompkins, one 
of the directors for foraging, with the following orders : 

" HEAD-QUARTERS KINGSTREET, February 8th, 1777. 
" &lt; SlR, 

" You are to take the command of the troops that are to 
parade at or near the house of Stephen Ward this morning, 
designed to cover the foragers, and to burn such forage and

grain as the committee of the Convention of the State of 
New York may think proper to direct. 

" * You are to keep your detachment in good order, strictly 
forbid and prevent plundering and every species of insult 
and abuse. You are not to allow, in any case, any house 
to be fired, or even barn, unless specially ordered to do the 
latter by the committee. 

" You are carefully to cover the foragers, and keep out 
guards and scouts for your own security. The committee 
will determine the limits within which you are to destroy 
the foraare. You will be careful not to exceed them. 

o 

" I am, Sir, your humble servant, 

&lt;W. HEATH, M. G. 

" The Commanding Officer of the Foraging Party 
parading at or near Stephen Ward s. 

" These orders were delivered to me sealed up (about 
half after eleven o clock) , with the following indorsement : 



" The committee are of opinion that it will not answer 
this day to burn any forage, and have sent Mr. Tompkins 
to pilot the troops under your command to such places as 
will be best adapted for covering the foraging teams which 
are this day employed in carting forage from New Rochelle. 

" By order, 

" W. DUER. 

" * 8th February, 10 o clock. 

" Having read these orders, I led back the troops to 
Ward s, and thence proceeded with the whole, conducted 
by the guide, to the places best adapted for covering the 
foragers, where we remained till near four in the afternoon, 
when Mr. Tompkins directed us into a cross-road, so as to 
fall in the rear of the teams. We proceeded accordingly ; 
but he afterwards came to us and said the teams he found 
sufficiently guarded, and that we need not wait; upon 
which we returned to our quarters.* 

* While we waited for the foragers, their director rode up to the corner 
where we waited ; but, in an instant, suspecting us to be enemies, started and 



j T . 31.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 113 

" The march to Ward s finished our trifling, inconsequen 
tial expeditions under General Heath. I recollect not one 
where the measures were timely and duly taken for execu 
tion. In the last, Mr. Tompkins informed me it was intended 
to go to Frog s Point, a good way beyond Fort Indepen 
dence, in order to bring off and destroy such forage as the 
committee should think proper; but, as this would leave 
the enemy in our rear, the committee expected General 
Heath would have furnished them with seventeen hundred 
men, that the enemy might not have it in their power to 
cut off their retreat; and the want of this, more than the 
foul day, I suppose, induced the committee to write me as 
they did. 

"After we had been loitering several days in the environs 
of Fort Independence, and broken the carriages of two 
six-pounders by firing a few ineffectual shot ; after the 
first and best time for taking the fort, when the troops were 
fresh, the regiments full, the men in spirits, and the enemy 
under some surprise, was lost; after the enemy, from our 
inactivity, began to despise us ; after they had had an 
opportunity of getting one or two twelve-pounders into 
their fort, to build a redoubt at Kingsbridge, and to get in 
the best manner prepared, General Heath sent to Peeks- 
kill for a twenty-four-pounder and a howitz, with balls and 
shells. He tried both. With the twenty-four-pounder, it 
seems, one man was killed in the fort, and the head of a 
puncheon of rum knocked in ; but with the third shot the 
carriage broke. A few shells were thrown, and broke in 
the air, as I think I was informed. Soon afterwards the 
whole army retired from ten to fifteen miles from the 
enemy, as is before mentioned. 

" A day or two before we left W 7 hite Plains, a party of 
Yorkers went in the night down towards the fort, and con 
cealed themselves in a house, in order to trepan some of 
the light-horse, who daily made excursions six miles from 

rode off. I called and assured him we were friends, and after a little parley 
he was convinced. The matter afforded us a little diversion."

the fort. The light-horse came out as usual, and the am 
buscade killed one, took his horse, and wounded another; 
and a second horse, it was said, in running off, broke his 
neck. 

" Sunday, February 9th. Went to General Lincoln s 
quarters. He gave me orders to march my regiment next 
Tuesday morning, at eight o clock, from White Plains to 
King s Ferry (over the North Kiver) , and to join General 
Washington with all possible despatch. I issued orders 
accordingly."

COLONEL PICKERING S journal and letters go on to 
detail the incidents of the march of his regiment 
until its time of service expired, and of his journey 
home to Salem. 

Journal. " Monday, February 10th. The regiment 
drew four days provisions for their march, and cooked two 
of them. 

"Tuesday, February llth. A thick snow-storm, which 
continued all day, and prevented our march. The snow 
fell five or six inches deep. I supposed also that Colonel 
Thacher s regiment, which marched on Monday, would not 
march from North Castle in the snow, and so, if we marched 
that day, we should find no barracks at night ; and my con 
jecture was right, Colonel Thacher himself having left 
North Castle on Wednesday, only about an hour before I 
arrived there ; and two of his wagons I overtook on the 
road thither. 

" Wednesday, February 12th. Marched with three com 
panies from White Plains at half after eight o clock, and 
arrived at North Castle church, distant fifteen miles from 
my quarters, at a little after one o clock, afternoon ; and all 
my regiment came up by three, and went to such houses as 
they could find for barracks. Some of the wagons did not 
get up till near night. Just after sunset I hired two horses, 



116 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1777. 

and set off with Mr. Cabot to go to Crump Pond, eight 
miles and a half, to find Colonel Thacher, to know when his 
regiment would be out of my way, and to inquire where 
my regiment could find cover the next night ; got back just 
after eleven at night, cold and hungry. Went to bed (on 
the floor, w r ith my blanket) about twelve ; slept about four 
hours between that and full day. The landlord, an Irish 
man, blunt, but hospitable." 

Colonel Pickering wrote to his wife from North 
Castle the 12th of February, 

"I continue in good health, and hope to return so ... 
the beginning of April. Nevertheless, if the General 
[Washington] should desire my regiment to tarry a little 
while, I trust I shall not refuse to gratify him and serve 
my country." 

Journal. " Thursday, February 13th. Marched by 
half after eight in the morning for Crump Pond, or Hanover, 
and the companies went to quarters, scattered through a 
space of five miles, some companies and men of Thacher s 
regiment being in our way. Ordered the companies to march 
the next day, by nine o clock at farthest, for Peekskill. 

" Friday, February 14th. Not being able to get any 
thing else, I ate a piece of bread and drank some water, and 
set off (on horseback) before sunrise for Peekskill, sus 
pecting I should find Thacher s regiment in my w r ay ; and 
so it turned out. Colonel Thacher told me his provisions 
for his regiment could not be drawn as ordered, and that 
caused his delay. He further said he could get no hay at 
the Quartermaster-General s stores, and that some of his 
men were obliged to go back for want of quarters, and 
others made fires in the woods among the snow. For these 
reasons I sent orders for my regiment to stop and retire to 
their quarters at Hanover. But some were so advanced 
that they chose to try to find new quarters, which they 
effected; others retired. Waited on General McDougall, 



JEx. 31.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 117 

and asked his advice respecting the march of my regiment, 
and told him of the difficulties about provisions, which he 
said he would endeavor to remedy. Eode back to Hanover 
in the afternoon, and gave orders for the march of the 
regiment. 

" Saturday, February 15th. The regiment marched to 
Peekskill, and found Thacher s still there. Drew two days 
rations, but obliged to wait for them till afternoon before 
the whole were served; and, Colonel Thacher s men not 
being out of the way, many of my companies were obliged 
again to retire for quarters. I gave them orders to be at 
Peekskill next morning as early as possible, by nine o clock 
at farthest, to cross the river. 

" Evening. Heard Colonel Thacher s regiment had at 
length crossed the river. Peekskill is a small village, in a 
low vale, between two large hills, and contains, perhaps, 
forty small dwelling-houses. 

" Sunday, February 16th, ten o clock. The companies 
that retired not yet arrived ; but others, lying between 
Peekskill and the ferry, were now beginning to cross the 
river. One o clock, all the companies being arrived save 
one, and that not being likely to come up soon, I left Peeks- 
kill and went down about five miles to King s Ferry ; 
about three, crossed the river, and went to Colonel Hay s, 
about three miles from the ferry, (he is a commissary for 
troops,) where I found Brigadier Moulton and Major Burn- 
ham, Colonel Lasher and lady, Mr. Thomas Smith and 
lady, and Mr. John Smith. The Smiths are brothers to 
Mrs. Hay and to the celebrated William Smith, author of 
the History of New York. Here I supped, and spent a 
cheerful evening. 

"Monday, February 17th. Met with some difficulty in 
procuring baggage-wagons, for of those impressed by the 
Assistant Quartermaster few appeared ; but Ward s and 
Moody s companies being at length furnished, they marched, 
after the others, for Ramapo, about fourteen miles distant. 
Captain Marsh s got over the river this day, drew provisions, 



118 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKEKING. [1777. 

and marched on. I followed them, in company with 
Quartermaster North, and reached Ramapo before night. 
Several companies stopped between this place and Kakiyat. 
From the river to Ramapo you meet only with scattered 
farmers houses, some of logs, but generally of stone. 

"Tuesday, February 18th. Reached Pompton Plains, 
about sixteen miles from Ramapo. The whole road was 
plain, between a ridge of mountains on the north and hills 
to the south. 

" Wednesday, February 19th. Went with the companies 
within about five and six miles of Morristown, where I was 
informed the regiment could easily find cover; intending 
the next day to march in, in regimental order. But, the 
houses being filled with troops, I was obliged to order the 
captains to find cover a little way back, which they did ; 
and I went forward myself to Morristown, to General Lin 
coln. I informed him of my situation, and asked his orders 
for the next day. He directed me to march to Morrislovvn, 
draw provisions, and take quarters within four or five miles 
of the town. I returned and gave orders accordingly to 
the regiment. This night I retired through a wood with 
Captain Ward and mess, about half a mile from the road, to 
one Copperthwait s, a house never occupied by soldiers ; 
a hospitable landlord, and a handsome, modest landlady, a 
native of Taunton, in Massachusetts Bay. 

"Thursday, February 20th. Went to Morristown,* and 
stopped a little while at General Lincoln s quarters, where 
I found the landlord (a Yorker) very obliging, as well as 
his lady. Here was Major Bland, a Virginian, who com 
manded six troops of Virginia light-horse, an excellent 
corps, I was informed. The Major appeared to be a man 
of sense, knowledge, and stability, every way calculated to 
make an excellent officer. 

" Friday, February 21st. We marched to Bound Brook, f 

" * This is a pleasant town, and has in it a considerable number of large, 
well-built houses, in good repair." 

" f About eight miles from Morristown is the house where General [Charles] 
Lee was taken. I went up and viewed it." 



JEr. 31.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 119 

seven companies getting in before night. The other three 
companies arrived the next day. Quartermaster Staits led 
us to quarters ; but the houses were so scattered that the 
regiment was, as usual, extended four miles ; the company 
on the right (Captain Ward s) about eight miles from Bruns 
wick, and five miles from the landing where the enemy lay. 
My quarters were at Leffert Sebrun s, a good old farmer, 
where I found great cleanliness, a good house, and hos 
pitality. . . . Bound Brook is so called from its lying by 
a large brook which divides Somerset and Middlesex coun 
ties. Its proper name, I am told, is Bridge water, and it 
contains, perhaps, eighty small dwelling-houses within the 
compass of a mile, intermixed with a few large ones, two 
stories high ; but the buildings in general are much de 
cayed, not more than one in ten being in tolerable order. 
The land is very level in the village, and for many miles 
eastward, southward, and westward, but yet well wooded. 
Southward of the village runs Raritan River, which goes 
down to Brunswick, and so to the sea. Tis fordable, as I 
am informed, almost anywhere, except in freshets. North 
ward of the village runs a mountain, covered with wood, 
that extends north-eastward a good way towards Quibble- 
town ; and at the foot of this mountain runs Bound Brook. 
Its two branches, uniting near the village, empty themselves 
into Raritan River. 

" Saturday, February 22d. Rode with Brigadier-Gen 
eral Warner about a mile and a half down towards Bruns 
wick, by the side of Raritan River; and, going to a little 
rising ground, I discovered the Hessian sentry. They 
keep their advanced guard about three miles from Bound 
Brook. 

" Sunday, February 23d. From eight in the morning to 
three in the afternoon, was travelling all over the village, 
with Colonel Sparhawk and Lieutenant-Colonel Carter, to 
see if their regiments could not be stowed closer, to make 
room for some companies of mine that were too for separated 
from the rest. We made way for three companies. 



120 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1777. 

" Between six and seven, was sent for by General Lin 
coln. He, General Warner, and Colonels Sparhawk and 
Carter, were assembled. It was proposed to send one 
detachment of three hundred, to be covered and supported 
by another of three hundred, to surprise the Hessian 
guard. About eight, got the detail for my regiment. 
At ten, or soon after, the companies were assembled, 
and the detachments turned out and formed into four 
companies. They proceeded immediately after the de 
tachments from the other regiments, and, having joined 
them, the whole marched, and, I am informed, arrived at 
the ground a little above the Hessian guard, about two 
o clock in the morning. The sentries saw and fired at 
them ; upon which the detachment ran on towards the 
guard-house, and, having come near it, received a volley 
from the guard. Our people returned the fire, and the 
guard fled. It seems they were but about thirty in num 
ber. Major Broughton went forward on the run alone a 
gunshot from the detachment, and took two wagon-horses 
with their tackling, and a Hessian, who was tackling them 
(it was afterwards found, by the prisoner s information) 
to carry off a field-piece. Another Hessian was taken, 
with nine cattle. The detachments immediately returned. 
The guide conducted the first detachment in such manner as 
to fall a full gunshot or more above the guard-house. He 
was to have led them below it ; in which case, perhaps, the 
whole advanced guard might have been taken. But it was 
strong moonlight, though cloudy, and a body of men might 
have been seen at a considerable distance. This possibly 
might have defeated the plan, had the detachment been 
rightly conducted. It was owing to Major Broughton s 
uncommon (though, perhaps, in this case, imprudent) bold 
ness, that anything was taken. 

" Monday, February 24th. A severe snow-storm; and 
I, being appointed field-officer of the day, was obliged to 
be out in the worst of it. At one o clock next morning, 
set out, with Mr. Norris, to go the grand round, to visit 



^ET. 31.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 121 

all the guards and sentries. It was five before we got to 
our quarters. For four hours we were wading about in the 
snow, a considerable part of the time almost up to our knees ; 
and, as we had to cross fields, and get over fences, frequently 
above our knees. It ceased to snow between three and 
four o clock in the morning of the 25th ; so that it snowed 
near four and twenty hours fast, and more snow fell than 
had fallen at any one time during the winter. 

"Tuesday, February 25th. In the afternoon, as soon 
as I had received the reports of the captains of the several 
guards, I reported to the General what they reported, and 
what occurred to me respecting the guards and sentries in 
going the round. Some sentries were remiss, but generally 
[the sentries were] vigilant. 

"Wednesday, February 26th. Ascended the mountain 
back of my quarters. Tis pretty high, and, the country all 
round for many miles being level, you have an extensive 
prospect ; and in summer it must be extremely beautiful. 
You will see, all round, the green fields and woods, waving 
grain, and winding glades and streams. 

"Thursday, February 27th. Eode with General Lincoln 
to view the grounds on the left of my regiment, to deter 
mine where the guards may be posted to most advantage. 

" Friday, February 28th. Went again to the mountain, 
and viewed the country round. Quibbletown was in full 
view at the east, distant about three miles ; and W T C saw the 
steeple of Brunswick church above the tops of the trees. 
Some mountains eastward reared their heads. I am in 
formed they lie near Newark, distant twenty miles. Between 
me and them the country appeared level ; and on other 
quarters no mountain or considerable hills appeared but at 
a great distance.

" March 1st, Saturday. Dr. Putnam, in the fore 
noon, brought me a billet, of which the following is a 
copy : 

" DEAR SlR, 

" As our battalion is so unfortunate as not to have a 
doctor, and, in my opinion, dying for want of medicine, I 
beg that you will come down to-morrow morning, and visit 
the sick of my company. For that favor you shall have 
sufficient satisfaction from your humble servant, 

" JAMES PIGOT, 

" Captain of the Eighth Battalion of Pennsylvania. 
" QUIBBLETOWN, February 28th, 1777. 

" I desired the Doctor by all means to visit them, and 
administer such medicine as was needed, it being probable 
that the regimental box would more than last my regiment. 
The Doctor was very ready to go, and went. It seems that 
this battalion expected- a physician to attend them; but he 
stopped at a hospital to take care of the sick. They were 
raised about the Ohio, and had travelled near five hundred 
miles, as one of the soldiers (who came for the Doctor) in 
formed me ; for about one hundred and sixty miles over the 
mountains, never entering a house, but at night building 
fires and encamping on the snow. Considerable numbers, 
unused to such hardships, have since died. The Colonel 
and Lieutenant-Colonel are among the dead. 

"The Doctor returned, and told me he found the battalion 
in cold, shattered houses, and very nasty, to which causes 
he partly now imputed their diseases. Both these causes it 
was greatly in their power to remove, the latter entirely ; 
but they had been careless. They importuned the Doctor 
to visit them again to-morrow. 

" Sunday, March 2d. Last evening received two letters, 
one from my brother, the other from my wife, giving me 
the agreeable tidings of the birth of a son, &c. Attended 
public worship at Bound Brook, where the minister of 
Woodbridge (who had fled and left all to the enemy) for 



2Ex. 31.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 123 

this time officiated, and preached a plain, good sermon, from 
Psalm xliv. 4." 

Colonel Pickering wrote to his wife from Bound 
Brook, March 2d, 1777. Referring to his letter dated 
at North Castle, February 12th, he says, 

"I was then on my way to join General Washington, 
whom I expected to see at Morristown the Sunday follow 
ing ; but it was Wednesday before I reached the town ; and, 
for want of room, and because some of my companies were 
a good way in the rear, the regiment did not get in till 
Thursday. It was owing chiefly to another regiment of 
militia, which, having orders to march from White Plains 
before us, and marching, in fact, two days before us 
(though one was stormy, and we both lay still), was yet 
always in our way, by their dilatory marches ; and we could 
not pass them ; for then, the houses being so scattered, my 
regiment could not have found cover. After advancing two 
different days, we were obliged to retire again to find quar 
ters. ... I am uncertain when we shall be discharged. 
I find the greater part of my regiment have set their faces 
eastward ; so that, if General Washington desires us to stay 
till the first of April, I am afraid few will tarry. My en 
deavors, however, shall not be wanting to persuade them 
to stay." 

Journal. "Monday, March 3d. At half after eight in 
the morning set off with General Lincoln for Morristown, 
where we arrived about one o clock ; but we were detained 
by the way on account of a letter delivered the General 
from General Washington, to send in to General Howe by 
a flag. I took this opportunity (the first that had pre 
sented) to write to Commissary Loring about Captain 
[Addison] Richardson and Lieutenant [Gibsons] Clough, 
of Colonel Hutchiuson s regiment, prisoners taken at Fort 
Washington, to know if they were yet prisoners, that I 
might send in the parcels of money I had for them, and 
requested an immediate answer. 



124 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1777. 

" On our arrival at Morristown we waited on General 
Washington. General Lincoln mentioned his business, re 
specting the pay and discharge of the Massachusetts militia. 
I presented the steel sword-hilt, which the General said he 
accepted as a singular mark of respect, and desired me to 
call upon him, on my return home, for a letter of compli 
ments to the donors. Then General Lincoln and I retired ; 
for the General was engaged in business. He first invited 
us to dine with him, which we did with a great deal of 
pleasure. A quarter after five we left the General s, and 
went about four miles, to General Moulton s quarters, on 
our way to Bound Brook. At a quarter past seven in the 
evening, General Lincoln and I proceeded for Bound Brook, 
where we arrived about eleven at night, having rode forty 
miles this day. 

" Tuesday, March 4th. A detachment of better than 
two hundred men (eighty from my regiment) went down 
towards the enemy, to cover a foraging party. They got 
forage and returned. 

" Wednesday, March 5th. Being field-officer of the day, 
set off to go the grand round twenty minutes after eleven 
at night, and was more than four hours in visiting all the 
guards and many of the sentries. The latter were all alert. 

" Thursday, March 6th. A general fast through the 
Jerseys, by order of Governor Livingston, pursuant to the 
recommendation of Congress. 

"Friday, March 7th. Received most urgent orders from 
the General to remove the sick, and the heavy and spare 
baggage of my regiment, a few miles, back of the moun 
tains. Assembled my captains and consulted them. Cap 
tain Ward agreed to go early to-morrow morning to find 
houses for the reception of the sick and the baggage. 

"Saturday, March 8th. Another detachment sent to 
cover the foragers, part (about forty) from my regiment. 
They loaded their wagons and returned. 

"Sunday, March 9th. Attended public worship. The 
minister of Bound Brook preached from Judges v. 9. He 



MT. 31.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 125 

declared his approbation of the conduct of the Massachu 
setts troops stationed here, and applauded them in general 
for their orderly and peaceable behavior. His compliment 
more especially regarded the two regiments which were 
here two months, Sparhawk s and Whitney s. 

" Monday, March 10th, to Saturday, March 15th. Noth 
ing remarkable. On Saturday arrived Mr. Hiller and Mr. 
Page. The latter brought me a letter from my wife. 

"Sunday, March 16th. Afternoon, four o clock, having 
completed the regimental pay abstract (which, with exam 
ining the muster-rolls of the companies, their abstracts, the 
wagoners accounts, and giving them orders, had employed 
me the last half of the preceding week) , and got the Gen 
eral s [Lincoln s] certificate to it, I set out for Morristown, 
and arrived at Brigadier Moulton s quarters (about four 
miles on this side of it) at half after six, taking the short 
est route over Dead River. Lodged with the Brigadier. 

" Monday, March 17th. Went to Morristown, got my 
abstract examined by Mr. Palfrey, P. M. G. [Paymaster- 
General] , and a warrant from General Washington for the 
money, by ten o clock, which was immediately paid, to the 
amount of eighteen thousand forty-two dollars and a third. 
In the afternoon I returned to Bound Brook. 

" Tuesday, March 18th. A foraging party (one com 
pany detached from my regiment) went and got eight 
wagon-loads of hay and cornstalks at the same place where 
the Hessians took three loads the day before ; which occa 
sioned a skirmish each day. Yesterday one man was wound 
ed near the knee, a flesh wound ; but the ball lodged, and 
was cut out by Dr. Putnam. This day two were wounded, 
one in the neck, the other in the knee ; both the balls 
lodged, and were cut out. Major Broughton commanded 
the party. His horse received a ball just over the eye, 
which obliged the Major to dismount. 

" Wednesday, March 19th, Thursday, March 20th. 
No thi ng remarkable . 

"Friday, March 21st. Two companies only of my regi- 



126 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1777. 

ment remaining, and their time of service expiring to-mor 
row night, the General gave me leave to go to Morristown 
to-morrow, as I had business to transact there relative to 
the regiment, the Major remaining to command those com 
panies. 

" Saturday, March 22d. Went to Morristown. Finished 
my business with the Paymaster, and drank tea at headquar 
ters, General Washington and his lady being of the company, 
and then took leave of the General. 

" Sunday, March 23d. Not being able yesterday to see 
the Quartermaster-General, went to his office this morning, 
and did not finish business with him till about noon ; when I 
immediately set off for home, and reached Pompton Plains 
about sunset or a little after, stopping at my old hospitable 
landlord s, Peter Van Ness, with whom I lodged on my 
march into the Jerseys. He lives back in a field about a 
quarter of a mile eastward from Pompton church, and 
twenty miles from Morristown. 

" Mondajr, March 24th. Having been unwell near a 
week, and weary with yesterday s march, I did not rise so 
early as I intended, and so did not get away from Van 
Ness s till about half after six. I then marched on to Pond 
church (a hexagon, one story high, of stone), about six 
miles, and then about seven miles to a mill ; just before I 
came to which, Mr. Rapalya, the son, of Long Island, 
now resident in the Jerseys, overtook me, and, after some 
conversation, strongly importuned me to get a horse to 
carry me to the river. I complied, and, by this mill, 
engaged a man to carry me forward. We rode three or 
four miles, and stopped at Sovereign s [Sufiern s] tavern. 
Here we were confirmed in our intention of going to New 
Windsor, to cross the North River there, the enemy s ships 
blocking up King s Ferry. So we mounted again, and soon 
entered what is called Smith s Clove, which is a rough, nar 
row valley (dove, in Dutch, signifies valley), of near twenty 
miles in length, between rocky mountains, some of which 
present the most hideous precipices. Stopped, after riding 



Mt. 31.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 127 

four miles, at Sloot s, and dined in company with Colonel 

, an acquaintance of Mr. Rapalya s, who last year 

commanded a New York battalion. Set off again, and 
reached, towards night, Smith s tavern, about fifteen miles 
from Sloot s. Here I was obliged to part with my horse, 
the man being unable to carry me any farther. Meeting 
here with John Smith (with whom I had spent an evening 
at Colonel Hay s) , who, as well as Rapalya and I, was bound 
to Fishkill, I set forward in order to procure other horses, 
to accompany them, but did not succeed. However, whilst 
I was making inquiry, along came an honest Irishman, of 
Orange County, who had, last campaign, been in the service 
under Brigadier-General George Clinton, of that county, 
and, seeing me with the badge of a field-officer, and on foot, 
most kindly offered me his horse, and insisted upon my 
riding, saying it gave him pleasure whenever he could 
oblige a friend to liberty ; that he had been a soldier him 
self, and I had much farther to walk than he. So he got 
off, and I mounted, and drove on with an easy pace, he 
walking nimbly and running in order to keep up ; nor could 
I persuade him to ride till we had travelled about six miles, 
when we were within a mile of Paddy McDanieFs tavern, to 
which I walked, and there lodged. 

" Tuesday, March 25th. Set off a little before sunrise, 
and walked to New Windsor, about five miles, where I 
waited an hour and a half for the ferry-boat to come over 
from the Fishkill side ; but we had a fair wind, and crossed 
over in twenty minutes, about two miles. Landed and 
walked up about four miles to the entrance of Fishkill 
town, where, meeting Bradley and Lancaster, two of my 
regiment wagoners, I paid them off. This detained me 
some time, so that it was past eleven o clock before I pro 
ceeded on my journey. I walked about ten miles, and 
dined ; then went on, and about three quarters after six 
reached Patterson s tavern, near Morrison s store, about 
twenty-four or twenty-five miles from Fishkill Landing. 
Here I lodged. 



128 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1777. 

" Wednesday, March 26th. About eight o clock in the 
morning I set off for Daubury, in the route advised by 
Patterson, but found, on my arrival at Mr. McLean s (which 
was at one o clock) , that it led me a length of sixteen or 
seventeen miles, instead of thirteen by the shortest road. 

" Thursday, March 27th. Tarried at Danbury, expect 
ing Major Broughton and Dr. Putnam would arrive by 
night, with my great-coat, boots, &c., to enable me to ride 
home. After noon Brigadier Moulton came in, and told 
me the Major and Doctor had gone the other road home, 
by the way of Springfield. 

" Friday, March 28th. We set off from Danbury about 
half past nine in the morning, and reached Waterbury at 
night, about thirty miles. 

"Saturday, March 29th. Arrived at Hartford about 
four in the afternoon, thirty miles. 

" Sunday, March 30th. About nine, left Hartford and 
rode to Fellows s, in Bolton, fourteen miles ; then to 
Knapp s, in a corner of Willington, thirteen miles ; then 
ten miles to Kendall s, in Ashford ; all good houses; in 
all, thirty-seven miles this day. 

" Monday, March 31st. Left Kendall s about six in the 
morning (it was rainy), and rode to Woodstock to break 
fast ; then to Oxford, and oated ; then to Sutton, and dined 
late at Elliot s ; then to Wood s, in Westborough, and 
lodged ; forty miles. 

"Tuesday, April 1st. Eose at three quarters after four, 
and set off at six in the morning, and rode twelve miles, to 
a tavern in Framingham, where I breakfasted ; thence to 
Mr. Dunbar s, at Weston, eight miles ; thence to Med- 
ford, and then home, thirty miles; in all, fifty miles 
this day." 

Colonel Pickering s reputation, and his recent visits 
at headquarters, made so favorable an impression, that, 
before he reached home, General Washington wrote 
a letter offering him the post of Adjutant-General, 



JET. 31.] LITE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 129 

which he declined at first, but afterward accepted. 
This subject occasioned the following correspond 
ence : 

TO COLONEL PICKERING. 

" HEAD-QUARTERS, MORRISTOWN, March 30th, 1777. 

SIR, 

" The office of Adjutant-General being vacant by the 
resignation of Colonel Reed, and the power of appointing 
a successor with me, I am induced, from the good opinion 
I entertain of your attachment to the interests of the United 
States, and your military character, not only to make a 
tender, but most heartily to wish your acceptance of it. 
It will give me much pleasure if the offer meets your con 
currence ; and, if it should, I must request that you will 
delay no time in repairing to head-quarters, the arrange 
ment of the new army and the good of the service requiring 
that the post should be immediately filled. The pay, I 
presume, you are acquainted with ; but, lest you should not 
be, I think proper to mention that it is a hundred and 
twenty-five dollars per month. 

" Should circumstances put it out of your power to ac 
cept it, an event I hope not to happen, and which would 
give me concern, you will be pleased to send the express 
with the enclosed letter to Colonel William Lee. Other 
wise, you will retain, and return it to me upon your arrival, 
which I trust will be in a few days. 

" I am, Sir, your most obedient servant, 

"G? WASHINGTON." 

TO GENERAL WASHINGTON. 

" SALEM, April 9th, 1777. 
SIR, 

" I esteem it a singular honor done me by your Excel 
lency in offering me the post of Adjutant-General ; and it 
pains me sensibly that I am obliged to decline it. It is an 

VOL. i. 17 



130 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1777. 

honor to which I did not aspire, because I did not account 
myself equal to the important business of the office. Your 
Excellency does not mistake my attachment to the interest 
of the United States. It is sincere and unalterable. But 
my military character, which you are pleased to mention as 
a motive to the appointment, is, in my own estimation, of 
no great account. I have, it is true, studied the rudiments 
of the military art, but have very small, or rather no, pre 
tensions to capacity and skill in the important scenes of 
war, and much fear I should disappoint your Excellency s 
expectations concerning me. 

" I have domestic reasons and private concerns which 
powerfully urge my staying at home ; but these I should 
not mention, did they exist alone. But, besides the com 
mand of a regiment of militia on the sea-coast, I hold divers 
civil offices, which are sufficient to engage my constant 
attention : those of Judge of one of the maritime courts, 
Judge of the inferior Court of Common Pleas, acting Jus 
tice of the Peace, and Register of Deeds for the county of 
Essex. The exercise of these offices I could, without any 
very great inconvenience, quit for a season ; and therefore, 
at the time of making the late levy of militia, as there 
appeared some backwardness in the people, I encouraged 
their engaging, and stepped forth and offered my own per 
sonal service. 

" Nevertheless, I would for ever abandon all these em 
ployments, if I thought myself capable of doing more ser 
vice to my country by acting in the office to which your 
Excellency has been pleased to invite me. But, as I do 
not thus think of myself, and conceive it not difficult to 
find a person not otherwise employed, and, to say the least, 
as able to discharge the duties of the office as I, I must beg 
leave to decline it. 

" I am, with the greatest veneration, 

" Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

" TIMOTHY PICKERING, JK." 



MT. 31.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 131 

TO GENERAL WASHINGTON. 

" SALEM, April 14th, 1777. 
" SIR, 

"I sent, by the express, an answer to your letter respect 
ing the office of Adjutant-General, and gave what appeared 
to me sufficient reasons to excuse my declining to accept it ; 
but I have since been uneasy lest you should deem them 
otherwise, and that I was too willing, under the civil offices 
I sustain, to shelter myself from the dangers and fatigues 
of war, an opinion which, if it has taken place, I wish 
to remove. 

" The case was this : I had concluded to accept the office, 
but, meeting with a number of unavoidable interruptions in 
the way of business, was unable to give my answer to the 
express till the evening, at eight o clock, at which time I 
had directed him to call ; and it was then, in fact, sealed up, 
and ready to be delivered, the same which I now enclose 
to your Excellency. But, the express delaying his coming 
a full hour, I of course continued to revolve the matter in 
my mind, and, upon a review of the reasons on both sides 
of the question, those against my accepting the post, in 
creased by the suggestions of my nearest friend, whose 
happiness and tranquillity of mind lay near my heart, pre 
ponderated, and occasioned the answer your Excellency has 
already received. Besides the reasons there given, others 
weighed with me, which I had not time to mention. The 
civil offices I sustain yield me an income that contents me, 
and, in a time of peace, would maintain my family. These 
I must have relinquished, without an expectation of re- 
assuming them. Consequently, had I taken the post of Adju 
tant-General, and some cause had arisen (an event far from 
impossible) rendering it expedient for me to quit the camp, 
I should have returned divested of the principal means of 
supporting rny family. 

" Whenever I thought of a military employment, the con 
dition of my eyes was no small discouragement to me. I 
am so near-sighted that I, although placed in the best situa- 



132 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1777. 

tion, cannot, with any degree of accuracy, discern the posi 
tion of a body of men beyond the size of a single regiment. 
It is true, in viewing distant objects, my spectacles help me 
to see nearly as well as people in general do with the naked 
eye ; but they are frail things, and rain or snow beating 
against them (I found in the winter s campaign) so ob 
structs the vision as to render them almost useless. My 
business as Register of Deeds had, by my absence, got 
behindhand ; it seemed to be daily increasing, and my office 
was not in such order as I wished to leave it in to a suc 
cessor. These, with the reasons mentioned in my former 
letter, and many others of lesser moment, determined my 
answer in the negative. I regretted the proposal could not 
have been made me while at head-quarters, where I could 
have inquired particularly into the nature and extent of the 
office of Adjutant-General, and thence judged more cer 
tainly whether or not I was able to discharge the duties of 
it. The want of such information left doubts on my mind 
that were no small obstacle to my accepting it. 

" On the other hand, I am sensible, that to support the 
army is of essential importance ; that, on the failure of it, 
besides the general calamity of my country, every prospect 
of advantage or enjoyment to me must vanish. I have 
been, therefore, ever ready to serve the public to the utmost 
of my power. But perhaps the comforts of civil life, the 
love of ease, the enjoyment of my friends, and the power 
ful allurements springing from the nearest connection on 
earth, have led me to mistake the object. From a sacred 
regard, therefore, to the interests of my country ; from the 
ardent desire I have to approve myself to your Excellency ; 
from the pain it has given me to deny the request of the 
last of men to whom I would refuse anything, I submit 
the whole matter to your Excellency s determination. If, 
upon a view of all circumstances, you judge it my duty to 
exchange the civil for a military life, I will do it. And 
then, should the office of Adjutant-General (for, from what 
conception I have of it, none would be more agreeable) be 



JET. 31.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 133 

once more vacant, or any other post or employment present, 
to which you shall deem me competent, I will not again 
confer with flesh and blood, but instantly obey your Excel 
lency s commands. 

" I beg your Excellency s pardon for imposing on your 
patience this second long letter. But I feared lest, by my 
backwardness, I might have offended. And I was led to 
make the above tender of my services because your Ex 
cellency s good opinion of me, and the urgency of your 
request, have raised me to some importance with myself. 

" I am, with the highest veneration and esteem for your 
Excellency, your Excellency s most obedient and most hum 
ble servant, 

" TIMOTHY PICKERING, JR." 

To this letter General Washington replied : 

" HEAD-QUARTERS, MORRISTOWN, April 25th, 1777. 

SIR, 

" I am favored with yours of the 9th and 14th instant. 
Upon the receipt of the first I had no hopes of seeing you 
in the department which I wished ; but by the latter I am 
pleased to find, that, upon a full reconsideration of the mat 
ter, you had determined to accept of the office of Adjutant- 
General, provided it had not been disposed of. I am obliged 
to you for the free manner in which you unbosom yourself 
to me, and must own that the inducements, both of a civil 
and domestic nature, which influenced you upon the first 
view, were weighty and hard to overcome. Colonel Lee 
came immediately here on the receipt of the letter which 
you forwarded to him, but expressed great diffidence of his 
ability to execute the proposed office, and candidly recom 
mended you in preference to himself. As I can, therefore, 
yet confer the office upon you, without giving the least 
offence to Colonel Lee, I now confirm my first offer, and 
shall expect to see you wherever the head-quarters of the 
army may be, as soon as the situation of your private affairs 
will admit, which I hope will not be long, as I can assure 



134 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1777. 

you your presence will be much wanted ; indeed, it is so 
much so at this time, that this important office is in a man 
ner unexecuted. The reason of your hearing nothing of 
this matter when you were here was, that at that time it 
was expected and intended that General Gates was to re- 
assume the office of Adjutant-General; but, his presence 
having been afterwards deemed by the Congress necessary 
to conduct the army at Ticonderoga, I was obliged to look 
round for some other, and you were recommended as the 
properest person for the purpose. 

" I am, Sir, your obedient servant, 

" G? WASHINGTON." 

TO GENERAL WASHINGTON. 

" BOSTON, May 7th, 1777. 
SIR, 

"I had the honor to receive your Excellency s letter, 
by Colonel Lee, conferring upon me the office of Adjutant- 
General. And since, notwithstanding all my objections, 
tis your Excellency s pleasure, I am happy to declare my 
acceptance of it. At the same time, I am constrained, 
from my real feelings, again to express my fears that I shall 
fall short of your Excellency s expectations. Few people 
are competent judges of military abilities ; and most are 
apt to form their opinions very superficially. Hence I have 
as often been mortified as pleased by the favorable senti 
ments which some have expressed concerning me, conscious 
that many times I did not merit their applause. I know 
not who have recommended me to your Excellency ; I wish 
they may not have judged too favorably of my abilities. 
However, I am determined to exert myself to the utmost 
to serve your Excellency and my country ; and if, after all, 
I fail of executing the office with propriety, seeing I at first 
declined it, partly from an apprehension of inability, your 
Excellency will acquit me of presumption in accepting it at 
your repeated request. My affairs are complicated, but I 
will prepare to attend you with all possible despatch. G.en-

eral Glover accepts the post assigned him, aud we shall 
doubtless go to head-quarters together. 

" I am, Sir, your most obedient servant, 

" TIMOTHY PICKERING, JR." 

In reference to this appointment, General Washing 
ton wrote to the President of Congress : 

" MOKRISTOWN, May 24th, 1777. 

SIR, 

" I beg leave to inform Congress, that, immediately after 
the receipt of their resolve of the 26th of March, recom 
mending the office of Adjutant- General to be filled by the 
appointment of a person of abilities and unsuspected attach 
ment to our cause, I wrote to Colonel Timothy Pickering, 
of Salem, offering him the post in the first instance, and 
transmitting, at the same time, a letter for Colonel William 
Lee, whom Congress had been pleased to mention, to be 
delivered to him in case my offer could not be accepted. 
This conduct, in preference of Colonel Pickering, I was 
induced to adopt from the high character I had of him, both 
as a great military genius cultivated by an industrious atten 
tion to the study of war, and as a gentleman of liberal edu 
cation, distinguished zeal, and great method and activity in 
business. This character of him I had from gentlemen of 
distinction and merit, and on whose judgment I could rely. 
When my letter reached Colonel Pickering, at first view he 
thought his situation in respect to public affairs would not 
permit him to accept the post. That for Colonel Lee he 
sent immediately to him, who, in consequence of it, repaired 
to head-quarters. By Colonel Lee I received a letter from 
Colonel Pickering, stating more particularly the causes, 
which prevented his accepting the office when it was offered, 
and assuring me that he would in a little time accommo 
date his affairs in such a manner as to come into any mili 
tary post in which he might be serviceable and thought 
equal to. 

" Here I am to mark with peculiar satisfaction, in justice 



136 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1777. 

to Colonel Lee, who has deservedly acquired the reputation 
of a good officer, that he expressed a distrust of his abili 
ties to fill the appointment intended for him ; and, on hear 
ing that Colonel Pickering would accept it, he not only 
offered, but wished, to relinquish his claim to it in favor 
of him, whom he declared he considered, from a very 
intimate and friendly acquaintance, as a first-rate military 
character, and that he knew no gentleman better, or so 
well, qualified for the post among us. Matters being thus 
circumstanced, and Colonel Lee pleased with the command 
he was in, I wrote to Colonel Pick*ering on his [Lee s] 
return, who accepted the office, and is daily expected. In 
this business, I beg Congress to be assured, though Colonel 
Lee was postponed in the first instance, their recommenda 
tion had its due weight; and that no motive, other than a 
regard to the service, induced me to prefer Colonel Picker 
ing. His acknowledged abilities and equal zeal, without 
derogating from the merits of Colonel Lee, who holds a 
high place in my esteem, gave him a preference ; and I 
flatter myself the cause will be promoted in his appoint 
ment, especially as we shall have two good officers in lieu 
of one, who, I am persuaded, will do honor to themselves 
in the line in which they move." *

Colonel Pickering resigns his Civil Offices, and prepares to go 
to Head-quarters as Adjutant-General. Movements of the 
British and American Armies. Colonel Pickering s Injunctions 
to his Wife respecting their Son. Outrages committed by 
British Troops. Morgan s Riflemen. Lord Stirling attacked. 
The Abilities of Howe and Burgoyne compared. Arrival

COLONEL PICKERING, having determined to accept the 
office of Adjutant-General, presented to the Council of 
Massachusetts Bay the following petition, which, with 
the proceedings thereon, though they may now be 
considered as rather amusing, and as making too much 
of an inconsiderable matter, were probably viewed 
at the time in a different light* The fact, that the 
shops in so large a town as Salem could not furnish the 
materials for a set of shirts, is a serious indication how 
much the inhabitants of the State must have suffered 
from the scarcity of imported goods. 

" To the Honorable the Council of the State of Massachusetts 

Bay, Timothy Pickering humbly showeth, 

" That some time in March or April, 1776, two Continental 

soldiers of Colonel Little s regiment being found in Salem 

offering linen for sale, one of the Selectmen of that town, 

* The state of feeling then existing in Salem may, in some degree, be 
inferred from a clause in an agreement, dated April 28th, 1777, for the occu 
pation for one year of "the half house, garden, and appurtenances" where 
Colonel Pickering lived : " Only, if the inhabitants of Salem are driven by 
the enemy from, or generally leave, the town, and said Pickering quits the 
said house, from that time the rent is to cease."

suspecting the goods were stolen, gave information thereof 
to your petitioner, who issued a warrant, by virtue of which 
they were apprehended ; and, upon examination, there being 
clear evidence of their guilt, your petitioner caused them 
to be committed to prison ; but afterwards released them, at 
Colonel Little s request, to join their regiment then ordered 
to New York, he engaging to see them properly taken care 
of; that, about a year since, your petitioner caused all the 
goods found on them to be advertised in the Boston news 
paper, but no owner appeared ; and your petitioner having, 
at the request of his Excellency, General Washington, ac 
cepted a post in the Continental army, which he will join 
with all possible despatch, and the Honorable Daniel Hop 
kins, Esq., to whom the care of disposing of the stolen 
goods aforesaid was committed, being now under inocula 
tion for the small-pox, your petitioner prays your Honors 
to empower the Honorable Mr. Derby, or some other gen 
tleman in the town of Salem, to sell the goods aforesaid 
immediately (they having been advertised several weeks) ; 
and that your petitioner may be allowed to purchase two 
pieces of the linen (or enough to make him one dozen of 
shirts) , as he knows not where else to procure it, and has 
no time to spare, his immediate attendance at head-quarters 
being pressed for by the General." 

"In Council, May 6th, 1777. Read, and ordered that the 
prayer of said petition be granted, and that the Honorable 
Daniel Hopkins, Esq., be directed to empower Mr. Nathan 
Brown, keeper of the jail in the town of Salem, to deliver 
two pieces of linen to Colonel Timothy Pickering, he paying 
for the same at the rate fixed by a late Act of the General 
Court, first being appraised by the Honorable Richard 
Derby, Esq., or such others as he shall appoint. 

" JOHN AVEKY, Deputy Secretary" 

In consequence of joining the arrny, Colonel Pick 
ering was under the necessity of resigning his civil 
offices; but he hoped to be re-instated in them in case

he should survive the war. He therefore addressed the 
following letter to the freeholders of the county of 

Essex : 

" SALEM, May 31st, 1777. 

" GENTLEMEN, 

" Being appointed to a post in the army of the United 
States, I am obliged to quit the civil offices I hold in this 
State, and, among the rest, the Eegistry of Deeds for the 
county of Essex. My absence will probably be during the 
war. This renders it necessary that a Register be chosen 
in my stead ; but, if I should survive the war, I shall return 
divested of all those employments which are absolutely 
necessary for the support of my family. For this reason, 
I am very desirous that my successor as Register of Deeds 
should be one to whom it would not be inconvenient to 
resign the office, if, on my return, I should need it for my 
maintenance. My brother John Pickering, Jr., is such an 
one ; and I earnestly wish he may be elected. He has con 
sented to take the office if the freeholders shall please to 
give him their votes. It would be improper in me, as a 
brother, even to hint at his qualifications ; and it is un 
necessary, as he has the happiness of being personally known 
by many of the gentlemen freeholders in each town in the 
county." 

. His brother was chosen accordingly, and by succes 
sive elections he held the office until 1806. 

Colonel Pickering left Salem on the 2d of June, and 
arrived at head-quarters, at Middlebrook, New Jersey, 
on the 17th. The next day his appointment as Adju 
tant-General was announced by a general order issued 
at head-quarters. 

He wrote to Mrs. Pickering, on the 14th, from Peeks- 
kill, 

"I arrived here last night, and shall, as soon as possible, 
go on to head-quarters. From the authentic intelligence 



140 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1777. 

received here, General Washington s army is not so strong 
as I wished, and supposed it was from accounts received 
at home. Howe doubtless intends a movement towards 
Philadelphia, and that very soon ; and at present General 
Washington is not able to oppose his march. However, I 
hope the reinforcement going from hence, and that may 
come from the southward, with the addition of the Pennsyl 
vania and Maryland militia (which I cannot but suppose 
must turn out on this pressing occasion) , will enable General 
Washington to prevent the enemy s getting possession of 
Philadelphia. 

" This, my dear, will doubtless be a warm campaign, and 
in it I may probably be frequently exposed to danger ; but 
I hope God will preserve me, and at the same time enable 
me, in defiance of everything dangerous and difficult, to per 
form my duty. You remember who * congratulated me on 
the birth of a son, to transmit (as he, with his usual 
gayety and romanticness, expressed it) * my name and hon 
ors to future generations. I am not so vain as to imagine 
my name will long survive my exit. Nevertheless, by 
God s favor, neither you nor your son shall ever blush that 
I was your husband and his father. I wish to live to make 
you happy, to educate our offspring, and to serve my coun 
try. But, whether living or dying, God s will be done. 
He orders every event in infinite wisdom, and it becomes his 
creatures cheerfully to acquiesce. One thing, my dearest, 
let me enjoin upon you ; and, if I see you not again, regard 
it as my dyiny speech, Not to spoil our little son by too much 
fondness. An only child, an only son, is oftener injured 
by the ill-judged indulgence than the severity of a parent. 
Let him be taught obedience and modesty, at the same time 
that he is treated with the affection which becomes a mother. 
If his life be spared, let him have the best education in your 
power ; a liberal one, if you possess the means, and he 
should discover a capacity of receiving much benefit thereby, 
but not otherwise. For, my dear, I have seen at college

^T. 31.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 141 

such miserable geniuses, that not all the powers of earth 
could ever make them scholars ; and their parents made 
themselves and sons ridiculous by sending them thither. 
It were much better to instruct such children in merchan 
dise, farming, or some mechanic art. 

"I have written, my dear, as I have, because we know 
not the event of things future. But let it not grieve you. 
Remember, that I am still alive and in health ; that we have 
a wise and prudent general ; that in the most desperate en 
gagements there are many chances in favor of life ; and, 
above all, that the Lord of Hosts, in infinite wisdom, de 
cides the fate of nations. And He, I trust, will save the 
American States from tyranny and oppression, and, as the 
means to effect that end, will crown our arms with wished- 
for success. We may probably suffer by our slackness in 
forming our army ; but I doubt not we shall finally be 
victorious." 

The following extracts are taken from a brief journal 
kept by him, and from his letters. But of both he 
says, in a letter of October 22d, 1777, to his brother, 

" I write them in haste through necessity, and frequently 
so long after any event of importance, that I can write no 
news, unless by mentioning our affairs in more modest 
terms. Many writers, I find, exaggerate. I intended always 
to give the mere truth. But I have not been able to keep 
a regular journal. I am now a month behind, and more 
hurried than ever." 

Many of his most important letters on the events 
of the war were addressed to his brother-in-law, Mr. 
George Williams. Unfortunately, they have not been 
preserved. 

Journal. "Wednesday, June 18th, 1777. A flag be

Salem, a prisoner taken at Fort Washington, and now 
supposed to be at Long Island. 

"On the 17th, nine deserters arrived at head-quarters; 
three of them Germans from Rhode Island, two British 
grenadiers and two battalion men from Brunswick (one 
of the battalion men was a Courlander, and brought off his 
wife and child) , and two of the new levies from Kings- 
bridge. 

" On the 19th, three more deserters came in from Bruns 
wick, one a British soldier, and two of the new levies. 

"On the 18th, two lieutenants of grenadiers, taken by the 
Jersey militia, were brought to head-quarters, and twelve 
privates were taken the same day. 

" On the 19th, General Howe decamped with the greatest 
precipitation from Millstone [New Jersey] , and retired to 
Brunswick, his troops burning seven or eight houses on 
their way, and having plundered all the houses where they 
had been.* Extreme caution marked the whole of Howe s 
conduct. That part of his army which had advanced to 
Middle Bush and Millstone had no tents, but lodged in 
booths. They threw up eight or nine redoubts, but com 
pleted only one ; three of them encompassed Howe s quar 
ters. They began to retire to Brunswick about one in the 
morning, and the whole were in motion by eight o clock. 
They left some pots, kettles, blankets, &c., behind them. 
When Howe first advanced, the Jersey militia turned out, 
and have acted with great spirit and bravery. This day, 
(June 19th), about two hundred of Colonel Morgan s rifle 
men were ambushed by about a hundred and fifty of the 
enemy, and received their whole fire ; which, however, hurt 
not a single man. The riflemen returned the fire. The 
enemy fled, leaving eight men dead on the field. 

"June 22d. The rear-guard of General Howe s army 
left Brunswick in the morning. Several detachments were 
ordered to fall on their rear ; but, having been before posted 

* See Sparks s "Writings of Washington," Vol. IV. p. 469. 



JET. 31.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 143 

at considerable distances from head-quarters, and it being 
late the preceding night before the orders could be sent them, 
Howe was retiring before they united. Such detachments, 
however, as did arrive, followed him about four miles ; but 
he was too strong to admit of a direct and close attack. 
He retired to Amboy.* 

"It being reported, on good grounds, that the enemy 
were crossing over to Staten Island, the whole army were 
ordered to supply themselves with three days provisions, 
and be ready to march the next morning. 

"June 23d. The rain this day prevented the march of 
the army ; so they were to get ready to march to-morrow." 

The same day he wrote to Mrs. Pickering : 

" HEAD-QUARTERS, MIDDLE BROOK, June 23d, 1777. 

"I embrace the first opportunity since my arrival here to 
write you. I am very happy in the General s family. His 
secretaries and aides-de-camp are gentlemen of education, 
and of the most polite, obliging manners. Yesterday Gen 
eral Howe s army decamped, and, from the best accounts, 
are all retired to Amboy, from whence the passage to Staten 
Island is short and easy. What will be their next attempt 
is altogether uncertain ; but I am inclined to think the game 
is nearly over with them. I believe as many as thirty 
deserters from the enemy have come in since my arrival 
here, which was on Tuesday, the 17th inst. 

"In the execution of my office, I have received all neces 
sary assistance from Colonel Connor, the late temporary 
Adjutant-General ; and he has very obligingly offered me 
any further aid that I may need. 

"If the enemy should continue the war, I am inclined 
to think it may be nearer my home ; for surely they will not 
go far southward at this season. Nothing, I think, can they 
have in view but to distress us ; conquest they must despair 
of. When I left home, I conjectured that one campaign

after the present would end the war. I now believe this 
one year will finish it. The sooner the better, for the sake 
of the lives, health, and happiness of thousands. And then, 
also, shall I return to enjoy, with my Becky, all the sweets 
of domestic life ; that quiet, ease, and heartfelt satisfaction 
which spring from the sincerest friendship and the ten- 
derest love." . . . 

With our knowledge of subsequent events, it seems 
extraordinary that Colonel Pickering should have en 
tertained so sanguine an expectation of the speedy 
termination of the contest. 

Journal. " June 24th. The army marched to Quibble- 
town, about five miles from its encampment, and halted ; 
the intelligence respecting Howe s situation not being such 
as to warrant our proceeding to Amboy, where, in a plain 
country, he might attack with his whole force.* 

"June 25th. From the best information it appeared 
that nearly Howe s whole force was still at Amboy. Several 
detachments were yesterday and to-day sent down towards 
the enemy, and almost the whole body of light-ho^se, under 
Colonel Bland, who fell in with some of their advanced 
guards, and was fired upon. 

"June 26th. About seven in the morning a light-horse 
man brought word to the General, that the enemy were at 
hand, within two miles and a half. The General ordered 
the alarm-guns to be fired. The men ran briskly to arms. 
Next, a light-horseman of the enemy was brought in prison 
er, taken by some of our light-horse, who also rescued three 
others of their brethren. This prisoner said he was taken 
not more than two and a half miles from head-quarters at 
Quibbletowu. It was surprising to the General, that of so 
many parties he had ordered out to watch the enemy, none 
gave him earlier notice of the enemy s advancing. How 
ever, it afterwards appeared, that no considerable body of

the enemy were within several miles of Quibbletown at 
that time. One body of the enemy having marched to 
wards our left, to attack and pursue Lord Stirling, who 
was pretty far advanced, General Washington ordered the 
troops at Quibbletown to retire to the mountains, and 
guard the passes to our old encampment ; which was done 
accordingly. 

" Lord Stirling, having with him only General Maxwell s 
brigade, was attacked by superior numbers, and obliged to 
retire. Here three pieces of brass artillery (three three- 
pounders) fell into the enemy s hands, but the ammunition 
wagons were saved. Lord Stirling retired to Scotch Plains. 
The enemy of that column advanced to Westfield. There 
were skirmishes between the enemy and other detachments 
of our army. What loss we sustained has not been ascer 
tained yet, the returns not having been made. The loss of 
the enemy was considerable. 

"June 27th, 28th. The enemy returned again to Am- 
boy, marking their way with the most wanton devastation, 
burning some houses and plundering others, breaking in 
pieces and destroying what was not portable. Places of 
public worship seem everywhere marked as objects of their 
fury and bigoted rage. At Westfield the meeting-house 
was converted into a slaughter-house, and the entrails of 
the cattle thrown into the pulpit.* . . .

after, to the Clove." 

TO MRS. PICKERING. 

" MORRISTOWN, July 6th, 1777, Sunday. 

"... The enemy having entirely quitted Jersey, and the 
General suspecting they might go up the North River, the 
army moved up from Middle Brook, last Thursday, to this 
place, to be nearer to Peekskill. General Sullivan, with his 
division, is gone about twenty miles farther on, to a place 
called Pomptou. What led the General the more to appre 
hend a movement up the North River was, that the enemy 
from Canada were about to attack Ticonderoga. We shall re 
main here till Howe makes some movement. If he goes up 
the river, we shall follow him. If he goes to Philadelphia 
(of which I think there is little danger) , we shall go thither. 
But, if he stands off with his fleet to the open sea, we shall 
not know where he is going, and of course be in a great 
quandary which way to steer. Two sailors, by one of whom 
I send this, escaped from New York the day before yester 
day. They say the talk there was, among some, that Howe 
was going to Boston, and, among others, that he was going 
to Philadelphia. We are greatly at a loss to determine 
what his intentions are ; and, since he was disappointed in 
his plan of going to Philadelphia by land, we have some 
times suspected that Howe himself was at a loss which way 
to go. But, for my own part, if the enemy make a real 
attack on Ticonderoga, I shall wonder if Howe does not 
go up the North River. . . . 

"P. S. I am so crowded with business, and as yet with 
out an assistant, my friends must excuse me if I do not

good one." . . .

"After the enemy left the Jerseys, we had reason to

to Morristown, thence to Pompton, thence within eighteen 
miles of King s Ferry, and thence into Smith s Clove, in a 
route that would carry us to New Windsor, where we should 
have crossed the ferry to Fishkill. But, having advanced 
a dozen miles into the Clove, we halted, having reason to 
doubt, from the enemy s movements and the best intelli 
gence we could obtain, whether they were bound up the 
North River or to the eastward, or not. At length we had 
such intelligence as induced the general officers to think

Howe intended for Philadelphia. This intelligence was 
strengthened by a letter, written with Howe s own hand, to 
General Burgoyne, in which he says he is going to Boston.* 
But he sent it out by a man who had been confined by him 
in the provost three weeks, and on whom he had no reason 
to rely. In short, it was not doubted but he sent it 
on purpose by such a messenger, that it might fall into 
our hands. The messenger, at the first guard of ours he 
met, delivered it up to the officer, and gave what other 
information he could. We had, before the receipt of 
Howe s letter, come back out of the Clove. We are now 
got back to Morristown, and shall proceed on towards 
Philadelphia ; for the bulk of the enemy s ships have sailed 
from New York, and, it is supposed, for Philadelphia." 

Journal. "July 31st. We marched for Philadelphia, 
where the General, his aids, &c., arrived about ten in the 
evening, leaving the army behind. In the morning, about 
half past nine, an express came that two hundred and

Delaware, which occasioned the army to move thither."

General to inform him of the arrival of the enemy s fleet 
at the Capes of the river. Orders were immediately issued 
for all the troops upon the river (being eight brigades) to 
cross with all despatch possible ; two more brigades at Mor 
ristown, under General Sullivan, and two more from Peeks- 
kill, are to follow as expeditiously as they can. All, we

trust, will arrive before the enemy can take any decisive 
measures. The militia from this State, Jersey, and Mary 
land will, no doubt, turn out with spirit.* The people of 
the city seem to be quite at ease, and not by any means to 
dread the enemy s approach. Fighting there must be, no 
doubt. God grant we may give them an overthrow, which, 
if general, must probably decide the contest. The army is 
in high spirits, and the order to march this way gave uni 
versal joy. The General and all the principal officers much 
prefer the enemy s coming here to their going up the North 
River, or to New England. For to this place the army will 
have but little way to march ; and, as it is an event long 
expected, it is presumed the people are better prepared to 
give the enemy a proper reception. However, if they 
should even gain this city, the cause will not be given up 
as lost; the enemy will, I trust, have a great deal more 
work to do before they conquer America. Though we have 
met with many losses, yet even now the inhabitants of 
America seem not to be actuated by a becoming ardor. 
Greater sufferings will show us the necessity of more univer 
sally spirited exertions ; and, when they take place, we shall 
undoubtedly, under Providence, prevail over our enemies. 
Tis now past noon, and I have heard nothing more of the 
enemy s fleet, except a slight report that they were still at 
the Capes, which, I am inclined to think, is true ; for, if 
they had made any considerable progress, we should 
doubtless have heard of it. So much for news." . . .

150 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1777. 

In a letter dated Philadelphia, August 2d, to his 
wife, Colonel Pickering mentions that, to the sur 
prise of everybody, Howe, with all his fleet, left the 
Delaware on the 31st of July, standing off to sea in a 
south-east course ; and he criticizes a conjecture that his 
plan was to draw our army from the North River, in 
order that he might go up, possess himself of Peekskill 
and other Highlands, eifect a junction with Burgoyne, 
and so cut off the communication between the North 
ern and Southern States. The letter then proceeds : 

" Howe s conduct appears to every one to be strongly 
marked with want of judgment. Indeed, it was long since 
thought that he possessed very moderate abilities ; for which 
reason tis wished by all, that he may live long to head the 
British armies. Burgoyne is supposed to have ability, but 
to be too sanguine and precipitate, and puffed up with 
vanity ; which failings, we hope, may lead him into traps 
that may undo him. But, whatever Howe and Burgoyne 
may attempt, nothing is to be despaired of. We have yet 
ample resources, and only want a sufficient spirit to apply 
them ; which, I trust in God, we shall do when driven by 
necessity. ... I expect we shall soon be on the march 
eastward again, in this uncomfortable month of August. 
Till yesterday we have hardly felt too much warmth. 
Should Howe proceed southward (which the most judicious 
will not believe is his intention), the climate will be suffi 
cient to ruin him, without an army to oppose him. But, 
wherever he goes, and whatever he does, I hope he will 
allow me time next winter to return and see my friends." 

Journal. " August 8th. The army was reviewed, and 
in the afternoon marched about nine or ten miles back from 
Germantown. But it was a hot day ; the troops fatigued 
by being under arms from six o clock in the morning till 
one or two in the afternoon ; and the march afterwards hurt 
many of them, especially as some did not arrive at their

ground till late in the evening. But the General did not 
intend they should have moved so far by four or five miles. 
The Deputy Quartermaster-General miscalculated the dis

twenty-seven ; and tis our design and duty to prevent them. 
Fighting will ensue, most probably. I think Howe cannot 
retreat with honor till he attempts to go on to Philadelphia ; 
and that object is too important for us to abandon without 
the most vigorous opposition. . . . Our troops are in good 
spirits. We have a respectable army of Continental troops,

abounds in profaneness and debauchery ; nevertheless, our 
enemies do not fall behind us in vice, but rather, I believe, 
exceed us, and have besides none but the worst motives 
the motives of tyrants to steel their hearts against us; 
whereas we have a just cause, on which the happiness, not 
of innocent Americans only, but of the thousands of poor, 
oppressed people in every kingdom in Europe, depends, to 
point our weapons and brace our arms, to urge them against 
the mercenary foe. Such a cause Providence, I hope, will 
favor and succeed, and that I shall return according to your 
wishes ; or, if not &lt; crowned with the laurels of victory, as 
you express it, at least without disgrace. I mean to do my 
duty, and pray God to inspire me with all that fortitude 
which my station demands. The hearts of all men are in his

CHAPTER X. 

Battle of the Brandywine. Report of it to Congress. Skirmish 
on the 16th of September. Night Attack on General Wayne. 
Garrison of Fort Mifflin. Want of Zeal in Pennsylvania. 
Militia of Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, and New 
England. Conduct of some Inhabitants of Chester County, 
Pennsylvania. 

THE following extracts from Colonel Pickering s jour 
nal contain memoranda of proceedings of the American 
and British armies, including the battle of the Brandy- 
wine and a later skirmish on the 16th of September; 
and they set forth the lessons suggested to him by 
those actions. 

Journal. " September 9th. Left Newport in the morn 
ing before daylight, and marched to Chad s Ford ; crossed 
it, and encamped on the east side of the Brandy wine, hav 
ing information that the enemy had marched far to the north 
of Newport. 

" September 10th. At Chad s Ford, hearing the ene 
my appeared, by their route, designing to cross the Brandy- 
wine at that place. 

" September llth. This morning a cannonade took 
place, the enemy having advanced to the heights opposite 
to those occupied by us, on the other side of the ford. A 
hot skirmish took place between our light troops, under 
Maxwell, and a party of Hessians, in which the latter were 
chiefly killed and wounded, not thirty running away, it 
being judged by Maxwell that three hundred of them were 
killed and wounded. The enemy made no attempt to cross 
at this place. The cannonade was mutual; theirs did us no 



Mi. 32.] LIFE OP TIMOTHY PICKEEING. 155 

harm, save killing one man. The enemy remaining paraded 
on the distant heights, and continuing the cannonade, in 
duced me to think they did not intend to cross at Chad s 
Ford, but only to amuse us while their main army crossed 
at some other place. The event proved the conjecture right. 
The enemy s main body crossed the Brandywine six or eight 
miles above, on our right. The General had intelligence 
of this by some messengers ; but it was contradicted by 
others ; and, the information remaining a long time surpris 
ingly uncertain, it was late before a disposition was made 
to receive the enemy on that quarter. The consequence 
was, that the divisions first engaged, being too far distant to 
be supported by others, were repulsed ; and this laid the 
foundation for a final defeat. Nevertheless, Weedon s bri 
gade, which got up a little before night, fought bravely, and 
checked the pursuit of the enemy, and gave more time for 
the others to retreat. This engagement on the right began 
about half after three P. M., or four, and lasted till night. 
When the battle raged most on the right, and the Con 
tinental troops were all, save Wayne s division, drawn off 
to the right, the enemy opposite Chad s Ford began a most 
furious cannonade, which was as warmly returned from the 
park of artillery. But at length the enemy pushed over, 
and, after an obstinate engagement with our artillery and 
Wayne s division, the latter retreated. The whole army 
this night retired to Chester. It was fortunate for us that 
the night came on, for under its cover the fatigued, strag 
glers, and some wounded made their escape. General Arm 
strong s division of Pennsylvania militia, being stationed at 
a ford two miles below, were too far off to lend their aid ; 
they retreated with the rest. Although we left the field, 
yet we had reason to think the enemy s loss greater than 
our own in killed and wounded.* The only field-officer 



* General Greene estimated the loss of the Americans, in killed, wounded, 
and prisoners, at about twelve hundred ; that of the British at nearly eight 
hundred. General Howe reported his loss at ninety killed, four hundred and 



156 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1777. 

killed on our side was Major Bush, an amiable, good 
officer." 

General Washington and his staff arrived at Chester 
late at night, and took up their quarters in a house in 
that town, all of them very tired. The General, how 
ever, said he must send to Congress a report of the 
engagement, and called upon his military secretary, 
Colonel Harrison, to prepare the despatch. Colonel 
Harrison desired to be excused, on account of fatigue, 
and requested Colonel Pickering to write it. Colonel 
Pickering retired to another room, made a draught, 
and handed it to Washington. The General, having 
read it, said it was very well, but that some words of 
encouragement should be inserted, as that he hoped to 
give a better account of the enemy another time. Mr. 
Sparks told me, that, in relating the circumstances to 
him, Colonel Pickering remarked, that this was a very 
proper and a very important suggestion. The letter 
was altered accordingly, and reads as follows,* the 
amendment being in Italics : 



eighty-eight wounded, and six missing; and the loss of the Americans at 
about three hundred killed, six hundred wounded, and four hundred prison 
ers. Lossing s Pictorial Field-Boole of the Revolution, Vol. II. p. 178, note 
2 ; Sparks s Writings of Washington, Vol. I. p. 253 ; Ramsay s History of 
the American Revolution, Vol. II. p. 11; Bancroft s History of the United 
States, Vol. IX. p. 400. 

Headley, in his " Life of Washington " (p. 258), quotes a very different state 
ment, "found among the papers of General James Clinton," and labelled in 
his handwriting, "Taken from the enemy s ledgers, which fell into the hands 
of General Washington s army at the action of Germantown." According to 
this statement, the whole British force in the field numbered ten thousand two 
hundred and eighty men ; Cornwallis s loss was one thousand and eighty-eight, 
killed and wounded ; and Knyphausen s, eight hundred and ninety-eight ; total, 
nineteen hundred and eighty-six. It is an interesting inquiry, If this account 
was authentic, why has it been neglected by historians ? and what became of 
the ledgers ? See APPENDIX, No. II. page 545.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

" CHESTER, twelve o clock at night, llth September, 1777. 
SIR, 

" I am sorry to inform you that, in this day s engage 
ment, we have been obliged to leave the enemy masters of 
the field. Unfortunately, the intelligence received, of the 
enemy s advancing up the Brandywine and crossing at a 
ford about six miles above us, was uncertain and contradic 
tory, notwithstanding all my pains to get the best. This 
prevented me from making a disposition adequate to the 
force with which the enemy attacked us on our right ; in 
consequence of which, the troops first engaged were obliged 
to retire before they could be reeuforced. In the midst of 
the attack on the right, that body of the enemy which re 
mained on the other side of Chad s Ford crossed it, and 
attacked the division there under the command of General 
Wayne, and the light troops under General Maxwell, who, 
after a severe conflict, also retired. The militia under the 
command of General Armstrong, being posted at a ford about 
two miles below Chad s, had no opportunity of engaging. 

"But, though we fought under many disadvantages, and 
were, from the causes above mentioned, obliged to retire, 
yet our loss of men is not, I am persuaded, very consider 
able ; I believe much less than the enemy s.* We have 
also lost seven or eight pieces of cannon, according to the 
best information I can at present obtain. The baggage, 
having been previously moved off, is all secure, saving the 
men s blankets, which being at their backs, many of them 
doubtless are lost. I have directed all the troops to assem 
ble behind Chester, where they are now arranging for this 
night. Notwithstanding the misfortune of the day, I am 
happy to find the troops in good spirits; and I hope another 
time we shall compensate for the losses now sustained. The 
Marquis de Lafayette was wounded in the leg, and General 
Woodford in the hand ; divers other officers were wounded ,

and some slain ; but the numbers of either cannot now be 
ascertained. 

" I have the honor to be," &c., 

" G9 WASHINGTON. 

"P. S. It has not been in my power to send you earlier 
intelligence, the present being the first leisure moment I 
have had since the action." 

Journal. " September 12th. This day the army 
marched to the Schuylkill, part crossing and marching to 
our old camp by Schuylkill Falls. The enemy lay still 
near the field of battle. 

" September 13th. The rest of the army crossed, and 
the whole collected at the old encampment, vast numbers 
of stragglers coming in. 

" September 14th. The army, having yesterday cleaned 
their arms, and received ammunition to complete forty 
rounds a man, this day marched up a few miles and re- 
crossed the Schuylkill at Levering s Ford,* the water being 
nearly up to the waist. We lost here much time, by reason 
of the men s stripping off their stockings and shoes, and 
some of them their breeches. It was a pleasant day, and, 
had the men marched directly over by platoons without 
stripping, no harm could have ensued ; their clothes would 
have dried by night on their march, and the bottom would 
not have hurt their feet. The officers, too, discovered a 
delicacy quite unbecoming soldiers ; quitting their platoons, 
and some getting horses of their acquaintances to ride over, 
and others getting over in a canoe. They would have better 
done their duty, had they kept to their platoons and led in 

* In a letter of February 14th, 1827, to Chief Justice Marshall, Colonel 
Pickering says the army recrosscd the Schuylkill at Matson s Ford. "The 
water appeared to be two feet deep, and the current so swift, that the men of 
each platoon locked their arms, the better to resist its force." A map by John 
Hills, published at Philadelphia in 1800, exhibiting "the operations of the 
British army from their landing at Elk River in 1777," &c., puts Levering s 
Mills on the Wissihickon, which creek the army crossed. A place near these 
mills may have been called Levering s Ford. 



JET. 32.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 159 

their men. We advanced about five or six miles that night. 
Before this day s march, the General ordered all heavy bag 
gage to be separated and sent away, directing the officers 
and men to retain only what was absolutely necessary. 
This order was, I believe, complied with very punctually, 
all expecting we should soon attack the enemy, when our 
baggage would be an unwieldy encumbrance. 

" September 15th. We advanced to the Warren tavern. 

" September 16th. About nine in the morning we were 
informed that the enemy were advancing towards us. The 
troops got under arms, and the baggage was sent off. An 
advanced party of the enemy attacked our picket, just posted 
(about three hundred strong) , who shamefully fled at the 
first fire. About this time it began to rain. General Scott, 
with his brigade, was ordered to advance to attack this party 
of the enemy, or skirmish with another expected in our 
front. The rain increased. It was now discovered that the 
ground on which the army was drawn up for battle, particu 
larly the ground where the park of artillery was posted, was 
not well chosen, as not admitting a chance of saving the 
cannon, should there be a necessity of retreating. So, 
after some hesitation, the orders were given to retire to 
better ground in our rear. Whilst this was performing, 
the rain poured down vehemently; and, by the time the 
whole had gained their new ground, the arms were abso 
lutely unfit for action. After remaining here a little while, 
orders were given to march to the Yellow Springs, there 
being no prospect of the rain s ceasing, and our ammunition 
being in danger of spoiling, which happening, we should 
have been in a manner defenceless, if the enemy approached 
us next day. This was the reason, I presume, for the 
tedious march this night in the rain to Yellow Springs, a 
distance of [ten] miles. It was eight or nine o clock before 
even the horse arrived there.* The brooks were swollen 
with the heavy rain, and Pickering s Creek up to the horses

160 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKEEING. [1777. 

bellies, so that the passage of the artillery and wagons was 
difficult. The foot passed over, in a single file, on a log laid 
across as a bridge for foot passengers. To add to the diffi 
culties, the night was dark. The wagons, with the tents, 
&c. , had gone another road, so that even the next day and 
following night the troops received no benefit from them, a 
few excepted. However, they made fires in the wood, and 
the next day looked tolerably comfortable. 

" The proceedings of the battle of Brandy wine and this 
day (September 16th) suggested to me two or three impor 
tant lessons : 

"1. To reconnoitre thoroughly the post you take, observ 
ing its avenues, and what ways for retreating ; whether the 
ground be the most advantageous, or better be at hand ; and 
for every general officer, at least, to be perfectly acquainted 
(if the time admits) with every hill and vale you occupy, 
and for several miles round, with every place, indeed, by 
which the enemy can approach you. This ought to be the 
first point attended to in taking a post. Before the battle 
of Brandy wine, we had time to have viewed all the ground 
several miles on our right, but did not do it. So we had 
September 16th. 

"2. Tis of very great importance to have correct maps 
of the country which is the seat of war. 

"3. You should have guides perfectly acquainted with 
every road. These men should be timely procured before 
hand, and not be sought for just at the critical moment when 
you want them. 

" 4. The great destruction of ammunition by the battle 
and heavy rain the 16th, shows the necessity of having very 
large stocks ready made up ; otherwise you become de 
fenceless, or are rendered incapable of any enterprise for a 
long time. This very circumstance obliged us to keep aloof 
from the enemy, after the rain of the 16th, for a considerable 
time, not being able fully to supply the men with a comple 
ment of cartridges till they had made some up themselves. 

"5. It was a happy precaution, taken previous to the action 



MT. 32.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 161 

of the llth, to pack up and load our baggage, by which 
means all was saved, and our retreat not obstructed ; and, 
as the event of battle is at all times uncertain, tis a precau 
tion that should generally be taken, when you have timely 
notice of an expected engagement. One circumstance, 
however, was unfortunate, the men had their blankets at 
their backs, which encumbered them in action ; and then, 
and in the retreat, they threw great numbers away. Some 
also, to add to their speed, threw away their muskets; the 
latter deserve severe punishment, and the former are not 
blameless. 

" September 17th. Part of the army marched to Read 
ing Furnace, where they were joined by the rest the next 
day ; from which time to the 22d we were marching the 
chief of our time, having within that space again crossed 
over the Schuylkill at Parker s Ford, and marched down to 
the Trap, where we halted a day or two, when, hearing the 
enemy were tending upwards on the western side of the 
river, we moved up on the other, till we arrived at our 
camp near Potsgrove. Here we lay till the 26th, on which 
day we marched downwards as far as Pennybacker s Mills. 
But before this, while we lay near Potsgrove, the enemy 
crossed over the Schuylkill, and marched towards Philadel 
phia ; but it was two or three days after they crossed the 
river before they entered the city, which was fortunate for 
us, as it gave time to our people at Philadelphia to complete 
the movement of stores." 

In the following letter to his brother, Colonel Pick 
ering relates some of the facts above stated, with further 
proceedings of the contending parties. He mentions a 
suggestion made by him, that the garrison in the fort 
below Philadelphia should be reenforced ; compares the 
militia of New England with that of Pennsylvania and 
Delaware, and comments with severity on the luke- 
warrnness of Pennsylvania in regard to the conflicts 
taking place within her own territory.

" CAMP NEAR POTSGROVE, thirty- four miles above Philadelphia, 

" Near the River Schuylkill, September 25th, 1777. 

... " Although our loss in the battle of Branclywine 
was not so great as the enemy s,* yet since then it has been 
much larger; I mean by straggling and desertions, which, I 
am satisfied, have reduced the army more than the bare 
action. After that battle we returned to within seven miles 
of Philadelphia, rested two nights, cleaned our arms, fur 
nished each man with forty rounds of well-made cartridges, 
then recrossed the Schuylkill, and, after several marches, 
were one day overtaken by a most severe rain. The army 
had just been arrayed for battle, the enemy approaching. It 
was judged best to shift our ground for a position more 
advantageous. It began to rain ; the enemy halted ; we 
inarched ten miles in a continual rain and bad roads ; arrived 
late in the evening at Yellow Springs ; men fatigued, arms 
wet, ammunition chiefty spoiled (perhaps three hundred 
thousand cartridges) ; no covering for the men (the tents 
having been sent off when the battle was expected) ; rain 
all night and part of next day ; another march to Reading 
Furnace ; then we returned, and again crossed the Schuyl 
kill in order to obstruct the passage of the enemy, leaving 
one division, under General Wayne, behind, to hang upon 
their rear. The second or third night the enemy fell upon 
Wayne ; they exchanged one fire, close ; pushed bayonets ; 
Wayne retired ; the enemy did not pursue, but retired also. 
Next day Wayne buried fifty-six of his men, and the in 
habitants said the enemy buried twenty-three of theirs, and 
carried off four or five wagon-loads. 

"Information that the enemy were proceeding up the 
Schuylkill on the [west] side induced us to march up like 
wise on this side. We got above them, and then they 
crossed below us at Swedes Ford. We wait for Wayne to 
join us, and McDougall with his brigade from Peekskill. 
We shall, I expect, unite to-morrow. 

" Six o clock P. M. I have just heard that the enemy have

dropped down to-day within twelve miles of Philadelphia. 
The city is open to them. The day before yesterday I pro 
posed, in presence of General Washington, General Knox, 
&c., that at least one company of artillerymen and a suf 
ficient number of musketeers should be sent down to garrison 
the fort below the city, which defends the chevaux-de-frise. 
His Excellency assented to the propriety of the measure ; 
yet nothing was done. However, yesterday it was judged 
of the highest importance to garrison that fort. Accord 
ingly, two hundred musketeers and two good artillery 
officers were despatched to cross the Delaware at Bristol. 
Had this step been taken when I proposed it, it might have 
been executed without a circuitous march to Bristol, for 
the enemy had not then crossed the Schuylkill. However, 
I trust it will still be effected with safety. If the fort is as 
tenable as represented, I presume the enemy will not speed 
ily pass the chevaux-de-frise ; and, if Howe is not aided by 
the fleet, he will not long possess Philadelphia, I am per 
suaded. But, from the account given by others, it seems 
that a height on the Jersey shore, a mile from the fort 
(which is near the opposite shore, back of which the large 
meadows are now laid under water) , may be taken pos 
session of by the enemy, from which, by their guns and 
mortars, they may prevent the galleys defending the chevaux- 
de-frise, and possibly make the fort too warm for our men. 
But surely the fort, at the distance of a mile, must be safe 
from everything but bombs, and I should not fear much from 
them alone. 

" To-day it rains. To-morrow morning, at nine o clock, 
we march and join McDougall. Pretty soon, I imagine, we 
shall proceed to attack the enemy, if their post be practica 
ble. Were Howe, with his present force, in New England, 
and General Washington with so many Continental troops 
as he will have w T hen joined by Wayne and McDougall, I 
should not wish for a better opportunity to crush him ; for 
we should have there the best intelligence, and as many 
militia as we desired for a short, bold push ; but here we 



164 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1777. 

are, in fact, in an enemy s country. I am told upwards of 
sixty-five thousand men are enrolled in the militia of Penn 
sylvania; yet we have not two thousand in the field, and 
these are of little worth and constantly deserting. After 
the action of the llth, and the enemy took possession of 
Wilmington, almost all the militia of Delaware State also 
ran home. Some Maryland militia join us to-morrow, per 
haps a thousand men. Many that marched from home have 
deserted. Other militia are coming from Virginia and Jer 
sey, together with a stout and good State regiment from 
Virginia, the latter perhaps now at Lancaster. The Jersey 
militia have been at war a year, are embittered against the 
foe, and have constantly behaved well in Jersey. But be 
fore all the militia arrives, I presume we shall be engaged, 
lest the fleet should get to the city. 

" I had heard at home of so much contempt and ridicule 
thrown by the southern gentlemen on the New England 
militia, that I expected something better here ; but no militia 
can be more contemptible than those of Pennsylvania and 
Delaware ; none can be spoken of more contemptuously than 
they are by their own countrymen. And how astonishing 
is it, that not a man is roused to action when the enemy is 
in the heart of the country, and within twelve miles of their 
grand capital, of so much importance to them and the Con 
tinent ! How amazing, that Howe should march from the 
head of Elk to the Schuylldll, a space of sixty miles, with 
out opposition from the people of the country, except a 
small band of militia just round Elk ! Such events would 
not have happened in New England. I rejoice that I can 
call that my country. I think myself honored by it. I 
hope I shall not do anything to detract from the applauses 
justly its due. 

"The inhabitants here have, of a long time, been the 
most abominable extortioners ; and where Howe has passed 
they refuse to take paper money. The villains in Chester 
county (between the Schuylkill and the Brandy wine) re 
fuse even to supply our poor wounded men among them 



JEr. 32.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 165 

with necessary provisions, without the solid coin; and our 
surgeons have been obliged to carry provisions to them from 
hence. I feel in some degree reconciled to Howe s entering 
Pennsylvania and Philadelphia, that the unworthy inhabit 
ants (of which tis apparent a majority of the State is com 
posed) may experience the calamities of war, which nothing 
but their own supineness and unfriendliness to the American 
cause would have brought on them. Possibly Heaven per 
mits it in vengeance for their defection, that their country 
should be the seat of war. Not that I have a great opinion 
of the morality of the Americans in general ; but there are 
surely none who have not more public virtue than the Penn- 
sylvanians. However, did the event of the contest depend 
on the goodness, the moral virtue, of my countrymen, I 
should despair of success. But, for the justice of our cause 
and the sake of the righteous in the land, I hope, and I 
doubt not, God will in the end grant us victory, and a 
consequent happy peace. Yet perhaps many trials await 
us. All our afflictions have not taught us humility. Every 
species of vice has rather prevailed since the war began. In 
short, look where you will, there is so much evil, that a good 
man would scarcely wish to live, were it not for the pleas 
ures he enjoys in the small circle of his nearest friends. I 
sometimes wonder we are so fond of life, when we almost 
daily meet with something to vex our souls. But, doubt 
less, Shakespeare has assigned the true reason, an un 
certain futurity. Yet this should affect none but infidels ; 
and we have good advice, Fret not because of evil men. 
We must do our duty, and await our appointed time till 
our change comes, enjoying what bounties Heaven pleases 
to bestow.

CHAPTER XL 

Battle of Germantown. Lessons suggested by it. News of 
Burgoyne s Surrender. 

THE subject of some further extracts from Colonel 
Pickering s journal and letters is the battle of German- 
town. This contemporary account of that battle is not 
only interesting in itself, but important in its bearing 
on a controversy which arose many years afterward, 
on that subject, between William Johnson, a Justice 
of the Supreme Court of the United States, on the 
one part, and Colonel Pickering and Mr. Sparks on the 
other.* Colonel Pickering seems to have forgotten 
that he held such a document ; as otherwise he would 
probably have referred to it, as corroborating his state 
ments founded upon his recollection at the time of the 
controversy. 

Journal. " September 29th. We marched from Pen 
ny backer s Mills down to Skippack, within about twenty-five 
miles of Philadelphia. 

" October 2cl. The [army] marched about five miles 
farther down on the Skippack road to Worcester township. 

" October 3d. The troops were got ready for marching, 
it being intended to make an attack upon the enemy the 
next morning. In the evening, about eight o clock, the 
troops were on the march, in the following disposition: 
General Sullivan, commanding the right wing, was to move

ber, 1826, p. 414; and the " National Intelligencer" of December 5th, 1826, 
January 27th, 1827, and February 24th (Supplement), 1827. 



Mi. 32.] LIEE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 167 

down, with his and Wayne s divisions, on the direct road to 
Germantown, preceded by Conway s brigade, which was to 
take off the enemy s picket, file off to the right, and fall 
upon the enemy s left flank and rear, while Sullivan s and 
Wayne s divisions attacked them in front. Maxwell s and 
the North Carolina brigades were to form a second line in 
rear of Sullivan and W r ayne. General Greene, with the 
left wing, was to move down the North Wales road to 
attack the enemy s right, the front line of this wing being 
composed of Greene s and McDougalPs divisions, and the 
second line, of Stephen s ; while Smallwood, with his Mary 
land, and Forman , with his Jersey militia, were to attack 
them on their right flank and rear. At the same time Gen 
eral Armstrong, with his division of Pennsylvania militia, 
was to move down the old Egypt or Schuylkill road, and 
take off a Hessian picket posted there, and attack the 
enemy s left wing and rear. The attack was to begin upon 
every quarter at five in the morning. 

" This disposition appears to have been well made ; but 
to execute such a plan requires great exactness in the offi 
cers conducting the columns, as well as punctuality in com 
mencing the march, to bring the whole to the point of 
action at once ; and for this end it is absolutely necessary 
that the length and quality of the roads be perfectly ascer 
tained, the time it will take to march them accurately 
calculated, and guides chosen who are perfectly acquainted 
with the roads. It is also necessary to assign proper 
halting-places, if either column would arrive before the 
appointed hour. All these points, I believe, were attended 
to in the present case ; but yet I understood that the guide 
of the left wing mistook the way, so that, although the 
right wing halted a considerable time, yet it attacked first, 
though later than was intended ; that halt being occasioned 
by information from a prisoner, that half a battalion of the 
enemy s light infantry had the preceding evening advanced 
on the same road a considerable way beyond their picket. 
It was necessary, therefore, to make a disposition to secure 



168 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1777. 

that party of light infantry, that their opposition might not 
frustrate the principal design. Such a disposition was in 
fact made ; but the enemy had retired about midnight to 
their camp. 

" General Conway s brigade formed the advanced guard, 
and in the morning, October 4th, attacked and drove the 
enemy s picket at Beggarstown (which is the upper end 
of Germantown) . The rest of the right wing followed to 
support Couway. In a little time the whole got engaged, 
save the North Carolina brigade, which was not brought on 
to the attack at all. The other brigades drove the enemy 
before them a mile or two to the very centre of German- 
town. All this time we could not hear of the left wing s 
being engaged, for the smoke and fog prevented our seeing 
them, and our own fire drowned theirs. (General Wash 
ington went with the right wing, attended by his aides-de 
camp and myself.) But the left wing had engaged, and 
both wings met almost in the same point, which was at Mr. 
Chew s house, into which the enemy had thrown a party 
(we since find them to have been six companies, with a 
Colonel to command them) that annoyed us prodigiously, 
and absolutely stopped our pursuit ; not necessarily, but 
we mistook our true interest ; we ought to have pushed 
our advantage, leaving a party to watch the enemy in that 
house. But our stop here gave the enemy time to recollect 
themselves and get reenforced,* and eventually to oblige 
us to retreat; for this period was all suspense, and the 
brigades not well collected and formed in the mean time. 
Indeed, this would have been, perhaps, impracticable, for 
the troops were greatly broken and scattered, great num 
bers having left their corps to help off the wounded, others 
being broken by other means, or by carelessness ; for officers 
and men got much separated from each other, neither (in 
numerous instances) knowing where to find their own. 

" This house of Chew s was a strong stone building, and 

* Stedman says, that by the delay " time was afforded to the rest of the 
British line to get under arms." History of the American War, Vol. I. p. 399. 



^Sx. 32.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 169 

exceedingly commodious, having windows on every side, 
so that you could not approach it without being exposed to 
a severe fire ; which, in fact, was well directed, and killed 
and wounded a great many of our officers and men. Sev 
eral of our pieces, six-pounders, were brought up within 
musket-shot of it, and fired round balls at it, but in vain : 
the enemy, I imagine, were very little hurt; they still kept 
possession. It was proposed (for our advanced brigades 
had driven the enemy some way beyond it) to send a flag 
to summon the enemy posted there to surrender, it being 
urged as dangerous to leave them in our rear. A proposal 
was made to leave a party to watch them, and for the rest 
of the army to push on. But a flag was sent, Lieutenant- 
Colonel Smith, Deputy Adjutant-General, offering himself 
to carry it. I did not expect to see him return alive. I 
imagined they would pay no respect to the flag, they being 
well posted, and the battle far enough from being decided. 
The event justified my apprehensions : in a few minutes Mr. 
Smith was brought back with his leg broken and shattered 
by a musket-ball fired from the house. 

"During this time there was a cessation of firing ; but soon 
the enemy advanced, and our troops gave way on all sides, 
and retired with precipitation. This retreat surprised every 
body (all supposing victory was nearly secured in our favor) ; 
but I think the facts before mentioned will tolerably well 
account for that event. Another circumstance also contrib 
uted to it : the foggy, still morning (the air moving very 
little, but what there was bringing the smoke and fog in our 
faces), and the body of smoke from the firing, absolutely 
prevented our seeing the enemy till they had advanced close 
upon us. This also prevented the two wings, and even the 
different brigades of the same wing, from seeing each other 
and cooperating in the best manner ; nay, I am persuaded 
they sometimes fired on each other, particularly at Chew s 
house, where the left wing supposed the cannon-balls fired 
by the right at the house came from the enemy. In a word, 
our disaster was imputed chiefly to the fog and the smoke, 

VOL. I. 22 



170 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1777. 

which, from the stillness of the air, remained a long time, 
hanging low and undissipated. But, on the other hand, it 
must be remembered, that the fog blinded the enemy as 
well as ourselves, though it certainly injured us most. 

" This battle taught me the absurdity of helping off 
wounded men during the heat of action. By doing it you 
save a few mangled bodies, but most probably lose a victory. 
By such numbers going off with the wounded, the ranks are 
thinned and broken, their arms dropped and lost, and few 
of them ever return to the charge. Indeed, it furnishes the 
timorous with an admirable pretext for deserting their duty. 
Frequently from two to five and six men were seen helping 
off one wounded man ; whose death, too, from the badness 
of his wounds, was probably inevitable and not far off. By 
these losses, added to the killed arid wounded, your ranks 
must be so broken and your strength so greatly reduced, 
that it can never be matter of surprise if victory declares 
against you. It ought, therefore, to be an established rule, 
that where a man falls, there he should lie, unless his own 
strength and the assistance of the drummers and lifers could 
remove him from the field. This maxim, to some, may 
appear destitute of humanity ; but the contrary practice is 
certainly the greatest evil. Kout and ruin are the most 
probable consequences. Nor is there much tenderness in 
hoisting a man with a broken limb into a wagon, and then 
driving over rough ways, where every jar tortures his inmost 
soul ; and, if no limb be broken, he will probably get off the 
ground alone. The only case which can warrant the bring 
ing off wounded men during the action is when you main 
tain the fight retreating. 

" Another capital defect, in many instances, in this action 
was, the separation of the officers and their men ; by which 
means to rally and form them again, when broken, was a 
thing impracticable. 

" The fences, in this action, were exceedingly troublesome. 
Germantown abounded with small enclosures, strongly 
fenced with rails. These, in some instances, were attempted 



^Ex. 32.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKETING. 171 

to be pulled down, and in others the troops mounted over 
them. If a fence is to be thrown down, the best way is for 
the whole rank to press it two or three times backwards and 
forwards, and then, seizing the under rails, to lift the posts 
out of the ground and throw the whole down together ; but 
if the fence be strongly set, the best way is to get over it. 
Some, indeed, suggest it as better to make openings in it 
here and there, that the troops may march through in col 
umns, and then form again in line ; but I cannot agree with 
them. If a battalion or brigade marches up regularly to a 
fence, they may get over in a tenth part of the time that it 
would take them to go through in columns and form again, 
especially if the troops are not very expert at manoeuvring. 
In such grounds the officers ought to be on foot, otherwise 
they will of necessity be separated from, and many times 
fall behind, their men. 

" After the army were all retreating, I expected they 
would have returned to their last encampment, about twelve 
or thirteen miles from the enemy at Germantown ; but the 
retreat was continued upwards of twenty miles ; so that all 
those men, who retired so far, this day marched upwards of 
thirty miles without rest, besides being up all the preceding 
night without sleep. This step appeared to me not of such 
pressing necessity. It also gave the enemy an idea that we 
were greatly galled in the action, and thought it necessary 
to keep well out of their way. On the other hand, I own, 
had the enemy come out in full force the next day, and we 
had stayed at our former encampment, it might have put us 
to much trouble, and perhaps loss, unless we had of our 
selves retired early in the morning ; which we might have 
done, and by that means have collected our men with more 
ease, and saved them much of the preceding day s fatigue. 
Certain it is, that we were by no means in a situation to 
meet the enemy till after we had made up a new stock of 
cartridges. But, in actions well disputed, the victors are 
commonly too sore to push their advantages. The refresh 
ing their men, serving them with ammunition, taking care 



172 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1777. 

of and removing the wounded, and burying the dead, will 
usually find them employ at least for one day. But where 
the victors can possibly pursue immediately, tis their duty 
and interest to do it ; for, if the body of the vanquished 
escape, great numbers of straggling, fatigued, and wounded 
men may be taken prisoners, with perhaps a part of the 
baggage. 

" October 5th. This day and the following the stragglers 
had generally joined the army over Perkiomen Creek. 
After remaining here a few days, the army removed to Towa- 
mensiug township. This was on the 9th of October. On 
the 15th we marched down again to Worcester township, to 
the same encampment from whence we moved to the attack 
on the 4th instant." 

In a letter to Mrs. Pickering, dated " Camp at Towa- 
mensing, twenty-six miles above Philadelphia, October 
loth, 1777, Monday evening. 10 o clock/ he wrote : 

" Just at the edge of the evening, Captain Randall, 
of the artillery, now a prisoner of war on parole, told me 
he was going home to Boston, and should take a pleasure 
in serving me, if I had any commands. I told him I should 
embrace his obliging offer and give him a letter. He goes 
to-morrow afternoon, and, as I know I shall not be able to 
spare a minute for myself to-morrow, I determined to write 
before I lay down on my straw. Now, you may perhaps 
regret that I have no better lodging; but make yourself 
easy. I never slept sounder, or was more refreshed with 
sleep, than on my bed of straw, wrapped up in my blanket. 
I wish every soldier was as happy. Many of them have 
neither blankets nor straw. They make up fires, indeed, 
which render their lodging tolerable. In the two general 
actions at Brandy wine and Germautown, especially the for 
mer, the men lost a great number of blankets. 

"I believe I have never given a particular account to 
you or "Mr. Williams of the two actions above mentioned ; 



JEi. 32.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. . 173 

and I dare not undertake to do it now; for I should 
then scarcely get to bed till morning. Mr. Williams de 
sired me to give him weekly the copy of my journal ; but 
I have been so excessively hurried, that I could keep 
none.* Whenever we are not marching, I write incessantly 
from morning till night, and am now more driven than ever, 
because business has increased and I have no assistant, the 
Deputy Adjutant-General being wounded in the last action ; 
and I fear he will lose his leg.f After he was appointed, 
I looked forward to the winter, and pleased myself with the 
expectation of leaving the business of my office with him 
while I made a visit to my friends ; but now I cannot guess 
what I shall do as to the intended visit. Indeed, the great 
events of the war must first take place, before it can be 
determined whether or not I shall enjoy so great happi 
ness. 

" Not long since I pleased myself with the hope, that 
Howe and Burgoyne would both be crushed this campaign ; 
but Clinton s taking Fort Montgomery and Peekskill, and 
proceeding up the North River, may make such a diversion 
as to give Burgoyne effectual relief. The garrisons at that 
fort and at Peekskill were much too weak to support a pass 
so important. About two thousand men had been drawn 
from there lately to reenforce the army under General 
Washington. This reenforcement was absolutely neeessa^ 
to enable him to cope with Howe : and, had those troops 
remained at Peekskill, Clinton probably would not have 
gone up thither, but have turned his arms southward, and 
come to the assistance of Howe. And, with regard to Howe, 

* In the small book which I have called a Journal, many of the entries are 
very meagre, and Colonel Pickering s letter to his brother (page 1G2), and 
the remark in the text, show that they were not all made daily as the 
occurrences took place, but some of them several days after, as leisure 
permitted. 

f Lieutenant-Colonel Smith. He died of the wound on the 26th of Octo 
ber. Colonel Pickering, in a letter of November 2d to his wife, speaks of him 
as "a youth much to be lamented. He was active, sensible, and brave; of a 
manly and generous disposition." 



174 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1777. 

I am under no concern, provided we can keep the pass of 
the river, and prevent the ships coming up to the city ; of 
doing which I think we have a reasonable prospect. 

" As my friends may have but a faint idea of the pass and 
the obstructions of the river, I will give a rude sketch of 
them." * ... 

"There are five ranges of chevaux-de-frise, which the 
enemy must pass to get with their ships to the city. They 
have moved one single cheval-de-frise a little way (but not 
sufficiently to let them through) at Billingsport ; and Com 
modore Hazlewood has an old ship ballasted ready to sink 
in its place, if they quite remove that cheval-de-frise. This 
Commodore commands our armed vessels in the river, and, 
I fancy, is a capable, brave man. Fort Mifflin is on a low 
island, called Mud Island, where we have a garrison of two 
hundred men, Continental troops. The enemy, a few days 
since, threw up in the night the redoubt (No. 2),f within a 
small distance of the fort ; but next morning the Commo 
dore sent in some of his galleys to the shallow water, which 
silenced the battery, and made fifty-six of the enemy who 
were at it prisoners, one of them a lieutenant and one an 
ensign, and would have taken twice the number, but a party 
of the enemy advancing from the house (No. 3)| back of 
them, and the fort beginning a fire at the enemy, half of the 
battery men ran off to their friends, who were advancing. 
Province Island is diked all round, and, by cutting the dike, 
I am informed, it may be overflowed at every tide. Why 
the dike had not been cut, I can t devise. I presume it is 
done now. 

" Red Bank is a good eminence on the Jersey shore, at 
which we have about four hundred men, lately sent down. 
A good piece of work had (General Knox tells me) been

t So numbered on the " sketch " ; in which this redoubt is placed on Prov 
ince Island, on marshy ground, near the Delaware River. 

J This house is represented on the " sketch " to be on a small rising 
ground on Province Island, back of the redoubt, and much farther from the 



Mi. 32.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 175 

raised there before, to defend it against any attack by land ; 

and the garrison are going on to complete the fortification. 

While we possess Ked Bank and Fort Mifflin, onr gondolas, 

galleys, and other armed vessels, can lie between them, and 

effectually prevent (I am assured by judicious men, and 

well acquainted with their situation) the enemy s getting 

up a single cheval-de-frise there, and without getting them 

up they cannot pass. And the Commodore says, in his 

letter received yesterday, that, only keep him supplied with 

ammunition, provisions, and men, and he fears not what the 

enemy can do in the river. And these supplies, I trust, it 

will not be impracticable to furnish him with. He speaks 

of men, because many have deserted him. Two captains 

and their whole crews left him, and I suppose have joined 

the enemy. But out of the Rhode Island regiments which 

are now arrived (two of them, I think, have gone to Red 

Bank for garrisoning the fort there), I should suppose a 

supply of seamen might be given him ; and, in case of 

absolute need, the General would surely give orders for it. 

" With regard to the army, tis in good spirits, and reen- 

forced, since the last action, by the arrival of some troops 

from Peekskill, and five regiments of militia from Virginia, 

and one regiment from Virginia well disciplined, being the 

State regiment. But Pennsylvania, from which we ought to 

have the largest reinforcements of militia, has now but about 

twelve hundred men in the field ; whereas they should have 

as many thousand, if needed. Sure I am, that, were Boston 

situated exactly as Philadelphia is, and Howe in possession 

of it, twelve thousand of the militia would join us in a few 

days. Indeed, he could not have marched in New England 

with eight or nine thousand men through such a tract of 

country as that from the head of Elk to Philadelphia. 

General Washington s army, aided by the militia which 

would have nocked to him, would certainly have destroyed 

him utterly. But the government of this State has no 

vigor, the Constitution being generally disliked. And in 

this country, too, vast numbers are Quakers, and disaffected 



176 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1777. 

to us ; and, although the Quakers profess a perfect neutral 
ity, yet many perhaps I may say most of them manifested 
joy at Howe s coming, and afforded him every comfort in 
their power. However, many are sick of their bargain ; 
for, wherever the enemy went, they generally took all their 
horses that were good for anything. Howe, when he landed, 
promised protection to the peaceable. But, in his General 
Orders, issued soon after, he oifers a reward of a guinea to 
those who would bring to the Quartermaster-General a good 
horse, and for others in proportion ; and less sums for oxen, 
cows, sheep, and swine, making no exception or distinction 
with regard to the persons from whom the horses and cattle 
should be taken. This I read myself in one of their orderly 
books which fell into our hands. 

" Yesterday two or three German horsemen, and to-day 
four British light-horsemen, were taken by our parties, with 
their horses and equipments. 

"In the late action General Agnew was killed, and we 
were told also, by divers persons, Sir William Erskine was 
badly wounded,* and General Grant, or Grey, mortally. 
But these horsemen acknowledge only that Agnew was 
killed, and the others not wounded. One of the German 
horsemen said General Knyphausen was wounded in the 
hand ; another, that he was not wounded at all. These 
horsemen say the enemy lost more in this action than in the 
battle of Brandy wine ; and two or three persons, who came 
from the city soon after the action at Germautown on the 
4th instant, make the enemy s loss very great, as much as 
sixteen hundred killed and wounded. 

"Of our army, Brigadier-General Nash, of the North 
Carolina troops, was wounded in the thigh by a grape-shot 
or cannon-ball, of which he is since dead. Major Sher- 
burne, of Portsmouth, aide-de-camp to General Sullivan, 
also soon died of his wound ; and a Major White (an Amer 
ican, married, I think, in England), who came over to 

* See Sparks s " Writings of Washington," Vol. V. p. 82. 



JET. 32.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 177 

America to partake in its defence, has likewise died of his 
wound. A few days before the action, he was appointed 
volunteer aide-de-camp to General Sullivan. Divers of our 
field and other officers were taken prisoners, some of them 
being wounded and some not ; and a number of our men 
fell, too, into the enemy s hands; which, in a retreat in 
haste, is an inevitable consequence. We were on the eve 
of, and expected, a glorious victory. Everybody was sur 
prised at our troops giving w T ay. We stopped to get pos 
session of a paltry stone house, which the enemy occupied, 
and from which they annoyed us much. We ought to have 
passed it by (only leaving a party to watch it), and pushed 
after the enemy ; but this halt gave them time to re 
collect and recover themselves, and then we were obliged 
to retreat in our turn, after we had driven them a mile. 
Tis half past eleven, and I must conclude this letter of 
news." . . . 

In the following letter to his wife, dated " Camp at 
Whitpain, fifteen miles from Philadelphia, October 
20th, 1777," Colonel Pickering gives an account of the 
proceedings in camp on the arrival of intelligence that 
Burgoyne had surrendered. He also remarks on the 
situation of General Howe s army in Philadelphia. 

... " This prospect [of peace] is now nearer than ever. 
O, my dear, we cannot sufficiently admire that Providence 
which, from the supposed most dreadful calamity, has pro 
duced the greatest good to these States, and especially to 
those of New England. What evils were dreaded from the 
loss of Ticonderoga ! But God meant it for good. We are 
saved, and our vain-boasting enemy he has delivered into 
our hands. 

" Last Saturday, the 18th instant, we received by express 
the truly great and glorious news of the surrender of Gen 
eral Burgoyne and his whole army prisoners of war. In the 
afternoon, just before sunset, we fired thirteen pieces of 
cannon, and a rejoicing fire, to celebrate the victory. 

VOL. i. 23 



178 LIPE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1777. 

"The following General Order was immediately issued 
upon receipt of the news : 

" The General has his happiness completed relative to the 
successes of the northern army. On the 14th instant, Gen 
eral Burgoyne and his whole army surrendered themselves 
prisoners of war. Let every face brighten, and every heart 
expand with grateful joy and praise to the Supreme Dis 
poser of all events, who has granted us this signal success. 
The chaplains of the army are to prepare short discourses, 
suited to the occasion, to deliver to their several corps and 
brigades at five o clock this afternoon. 

"But, in the interim, news arrived that the enemy were 
marching towards us, which occasioned a muster for another 
purpose, and prevented the chaplains making the intended 
preparations. However, the enemy pretty soon went back 
to their quarters, and gave us an opportunity of enjoying 
the victory. 

" I wish everything here was in as prosperous a train as 
at the northward ; but that will probably not be the case 
till we have more Continental troops, or Heaven shall 
inspire the inhabitants of this and the neighboring States 
with some portion of that zeal and animation which carried 
the New-Englanders to the field in multitudes, and which 
God has crowned with the most happy success. 

" I believe I remarked in my last, that, while we kept the 
pass of the river by our forts and armed vessels, we had 
nothing to fear from Howe s possessing the city. I am still 
of the same opinion ; and we are still in possession of the 
pass of the river. But this day a party of Hessians crossed 
the Delaware to Jersey, probably with a design to attack 
our fort at Red Bank. But such re enforcements have been 
already sent as, I hope, will secure that as well as the other 
fort. This day we also have detached about two thousand 
men on a secret expedition. I hope it may produce some 
good effects; I think there is a fair prospect of it.* The 

* The letter not being sent on the day of its date, Colonel Pickering inserted, 
" This detachment did not proceed, but are refinforced to-day (October 22d) 
with a thousand men, and will now go on." 



JET. 32.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 179 

enemy at present have no communication with their shipping 
but by land carriage, over the Schuylkill, through Derby to 
Chester, off which their ships lie. 

" Last Sunday the enemy entirely evacuated Germantown, 
and retired near to Philadelphia, encamping round about 
the city, within a circuit of a mile or a mile and a half from 
it ; and, to secure this camp, they have thrown up a number 
of breastworks or redoubts. This will render an attack 
upon them difficult. But, if the militia would turn out with 
spirit, we might reduce them without fighting ; I mean, by 
cutting off all supplies, either inducing them to abandon the 
city, and retire on board their ships with loss and disgrace, 
or, by hemming them in, obliging them to surrender. How 
ever, though considerable difficulties are in our way to con 
quest, I hope and trust in God they will be removed. Even 
in times far more distressing, He has appeared for us, and 
granted us prosperity beyond our most sanguine wishes; 
above all, in delivering Burgoyne and his army into our 
hands. This is not all. General Gates will, I suppose, be 
able to send or bring such reinforcements to this army 
as will enable us finally to overcome General Howe. But 
Gates and his troops are at a great distance, and it will be 
some time before we can receive his aid. Nevertheless, if 
Howe s present vigorous attempts to reduce our forts on the 
river should fail, I am satisfied he will soon relinquish the 
city as a place incapable of being supported. Indeed, our 
information from the enemy is, that they place their event 
ual success on the coming up of their ships. They are 
greatly disappointed in finding the city empty of stores and 
provisions. Everything of importance was removed ; and 
the inhabitants are already in a starving condition, there 
being very small supplies from the country, and in such a 
city but a few of the inhabitants lay in stocks of provisions, 
depending on the daily markets for their family supplies. 
We are assured both the enemy and the Tory inhabitants

beginning to despair of getting up the chevaux-de-frise.

They have been able to remove none yet, and have only 
canted two a little in the lower range." . . . 

Journal. " October 21st. The army moved lower 
down to Whitpain township, within fifteen miles of Phila 
delphia. Head-quarters at Mr. Morris s. 

"November 2d. The army marched to Whitemarsh, 
about thirteen miles from Philadelphia. In all this period 
from the battle of Germantown on the 4th of October, noth 
ing material happened in camp. Our scouting parties only 
brought in a few prisoners. But, on the 22d of Octo 
ber, about twelve hundred -Hessians, led by Colonel Count 
Doiiop, attacked the fort at Red Bank, and were repulsed 
with the loss of about four hundred killed and wounded. 
Among the latter were Count Donop himself and his Bri 
gade-Major, both of whom were made prisoners. Our loss 
in killed and wounded amounted to thirty-two only. 

" The next day some of the enemy s ships passed the lower 
chevaux-de-frise, came up, and engaged our galleys ; and, 
after a constant cannonade of several hours, the Augusta, 
of sixty-four guns, got on ground, took fire, and blew up. 
Another of the enemy s ships (since found to be the Merlin, 
of eighteen guns) ran aground, and, being hard pushed by 
our galleys, the crew set fire to her and left her. The crew 
of the Augusta also escaped (except the Chaplain, Second 
Lieutenant, and forty men, who were blown up and lost) , 
leaving as soon as they found the fire inextinguishable. 
These instances of success and good fortune were pleasing, 
and gave great spirits to the garrisons of the forts and to 
our fleet. 

" I forgot to mention, that, having on the 18th of October 
received the news of the surrender of General Burgoyne 
and his whole army to the army under General Gates, his 
Excellency ordered thirteen pieces of cannon to be dis 
charged just before sundown, followed by a feu de joie. 
He also ordered divine service to be previously performed, 
expressive of our gratitude to Heaven for this signal favor ; 



MT. 32.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 181 

but an alarm happened in the afternoon which prevented 
the chaplains getting prepared. 

" Soon after the enemy arrived at Philadelphia they began 
to throw up some batteries on Province Island, from whence 
they cannonaded and bombarded Fort Mifflin divers times, 
but to very little purpose. Between the 20th and 30th of 
October we had several days heavy rain, which swelled the 
rivers to a higher pitch than had been known for thirty 
years. Province Island was laid under water, and the 
enemy s guards waded up to their knees, and some to their 
waists, in water, to mount at their works. This same flood 
also carried away a bridge the enemy had thrown over the 
Schuylkill at the middle ferry. 

"November 10th. The enemy made a heavy cannonade 
and bombardment upon Fort Mifflin, and have continued the 
same daily on the llth, 12th, and 13th, by which they have 
nearly ruined the defences of the fort. 

" Within ten days past, sixteen of our light dragoons, 
under Captain Craig, fell in with a party of the enemy, 
consisting of seven light-dragoons and seven foot-soldiers, 
all armed, and took the whole prisoners, without firing 
a gun. 

"A few days after, another party of our horse had a 
rencounter with a party of the enemy, when two were made 
prisoners on each side ; but one of ours was a French gen 
tleman, a volunteer in Colonel Sheldon s regiment. 

"November 16th. The garrison evacuated Fort Mifflin, 
the defences the preceding days having been demolished, 
and the garrison greatly exposed to the enemy s fire, par 
ticularly from a floating battery of theirs, mounting twenty 
twenty-four pounders, which lay so near, that the men in 
her tops (for she was an old East Indiaman the Empress 
of Russia cut down) could fire plump upon every man 
who showed his head above the ruins of the parapets, while 
they in the tops were surrounded with cotton-wool bags. 
Tis said the galleys in the river in general behaved badly, 
or they might have taken the floating battery, or obliged 



182 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1777. 

her to fly.* The old garrison had defended it [the fort] 
with great bravery, and were worn down with fatigue, and, 
the day or two before the evacuation, had been relieved by 
the New England troops ; but both the old and the new 
garrison behaved with great bravery. 

" November 20th. By two New-England sailors, who 
escaped from the enemy s fleet, we are informed that about 
forty sail of vessels arrived from New York, four of them 
vessels of war, fifteen with light-horse, three or four with 
provisions, and the rest with troops on board. 

"November 21st. Early this morning (before day) 
there was a cannonade, which continued till eleven o clock ; 
supposed to be in the Delaware, near Red Bank."

CHAPTER XII. 

The Board of War newly arranged. Colonel Pickering and 
Richard Peters elected Members. Colonel Pickering s Delicacy 
towards the Assistant Adjutant-General. Devastations by the 
British Troops. Escape of American Officers, Prisoners of 
War. British Treatment of Prisoners. Accident to Colonel 
Pickering. The Kindness of his Relatives. His Plan of Living 
at York, Pennsylvania. Colonel Scammell appointed Adjutant- 
General. 

BEFORE the 17th of October. 1777, the Continental 
Board of War consisted of members of Congress. On 
that day the War Office was remodelled ; and it was 
resolved, that three persons, not members of Congress, 
should constitute the Board. Their powers and duties, 
as enumerated in the resolve, were multifarious and 
highly important, corresponding in general to those 
of a Secretary of War ; and other specific services 
(comprehended, in the resolve, under the terms "to 
execute all such matters as they shall be directed") 
were from time to time required of them.* General 
Thomas Mifflin, Colonel Robert H. Harrison, and Colonel 
Pickering were elected, on the 7th of November, the 
members of the new Board.f Colonel Pickering ac 
cepted the appointment ; but his successor as Adjutant- 
General, Colonel Alexander Scammell, not being elected 
until the 5th of January, 1778, J he continued to per-

form the duties of the office until the 13th of January. 
General Mifflin also accepted the appointment to 
the Board of War. Colonel Harrison declined it. 
On the 24th of November, 1777, it was resolved, that 
two additional commissioners should be appointed ; 
and, on the 27th, General Horatio Gates, Colonel 
Joseph Trumbull, and Richard Peters, Esquire,* were 
elected. General Gates was appointed President of 
the Board. 

On the 10th and 12th of January, 1778, Congress 
chose a committee, consisting partly of members of 
Congress and partly of members of the Board of 
War, the latter being Generals Gates and Mifflin 
and Colonel Pickering, to repair to General Wash 
ington s head-quarters, and to concert with him a 
reform in the arrangements of the army.f Colonel 
Pickering remained at camp, in order to meet the 
other members of the committee ; but, on the 20th, 
it was resolved, that the members of the Board of 
War should be excused from attending on that busi 
ness, and that General Mifflin, Colonel Pickering, and 
Colonel Trurnbull should be directed to repair imme 
diately to York, Pennsylvania, where Congress then 
held its sessions. J Before he left the camp, Colonel 
Pickering wrote many letters, extracts from which are 
given below. 

The letter from Mrs. Pickering, to which the fol 
lowing is an answer, has not been preserved ; but it 
must have told of her distress on account of the 
absence of her husband and his exposure to the dan 
gers of battle.

" CAMP AT WHITEMARSH TOWNSHIP, November 4th, 1777. 
" MY DEAR, MY AMIABLE BECKY, 

"Although tis no more than forty-eight hours since I 
wrote you by Mr. Gary, yet yours of the 20th ultimo, this 
day received, excites anew my tenderest feelings, and com 
pels me to begin again. . . . But, pleased as I am with this 
proof of your fond affection, I do not wish you to indulge 
such melancholy thoughts. I know tis difficult to control 
the mind. That little wanderer will often make excursions 
where wisdom would check its career, but strives in vain. 
However, tis commonly in our power to place other objects 
in view than those which lead to misery, such as business, 
amusing books, and the society of friends. All these have 
a natural tendency to withdraw the mind from the pursuit 
of objects which give it pain. But, my dear, the Christian 
rests not here, but seeks and finds relief from other views. 
The Christian grieves not as those who have no hope beyond 
the grave, but looks forward to a glorious immortality, 
where grief and care shall have no place. Let this, my 
dearest, be our support. Often have I experienced its 
powerful aid, when surrounded with difficulties, dangers, 
and distress. Other props have failed, but never my hope 
in Heaven. This, raised and animated by prayer to the 
great Supreme, has often eased my burdened soul. Prayer 
is the natural mode of converse of man with his Maker ; 
and highly should we prize the condescending grace which 
invites us to adopt it. Let gratitude warm our hearts for 
that and all other blessings, and let us never forfeit them by 
inattention or neglect. Let our confidence in God never 
fail or lessen ; for that alone can support us under the 
severest trials. Let us reflect, at the same time, on our 
own ignorance and short-sightedness, which often lead us 
to view those events as most adverse and unfortunate 
which Heaven designs for our best good, if not in this 
world, at least in a better. To the Christian every event 
will prove a benefit : if it be happy, he will highly enjoy 

VOL. i. 24 



186 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1777. 

it; if afflictive, it will brighten his virtues, and lead him 
forward to scenes of bliss without allay. 

" Reflections of this kind, my dear, are the suggestions 
of reason and Scripture. But, I confess, tis easier to 
preach than practise the lessons of wisdom. Notwithstand 
ing the glories which, we believe, will in another world be 
displayed, great beyond the power of the human imagina 
tion to conceive, and although the path of life is strewed 
with cares, pains, and perplexities, still we are fond of 
living, still content to postpone the enjoyment of exalted 
bliss beyond the grave. Whence arises this attachment to 
life, with all its miseries, especially when set in competition 
with perfect happiness? Is it because the first is present 
and certain, the other absent and unknown? With the 
infidel this may operate forcibly ; but why should it strongly 
affect those who believe their peace is made with Heaven ? 
Or, does it proceed from the corruption of human nature, 
from perverse inclinations? This I cannot admit. A desire 
of life is the strongest of all our passions ; and the Creator 
has, I believe, implanted none in vain. Even this fond love 
of life is necessary to man. Our existence is designed for 
the accomplishment of some noble ends, and tis usually 
lengthened to a certain period. Were we indifferent to life, 
few would live out half their days. Tortured with pain, 
or vexed with disappointment, most would cut the slen 
der thread, and thwart the views of Providence. Hence, 
then, I conclude tis lawful to indulge this fond love of life, 
with all its reasonable enjoyments, only remembering, that 
this world is not our abiding-place ; that life, at longest, is 
but of short duration ; and that we ought to conduct our 
selves as heirs to a better inheritance. 

"These reflections on human life need not lessen our hap 
piness while here ; at the same time, they may well serve 
to bear us up in adversity, and prevent our souls being 
weighed down with grief, even at the most distressing 
events. With this view only have I made them. 

" November 13th, morning. ... To my surprise (and 



JET. 32.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 187 

to yours it will be), the Congress, by a resolve passed 
the 7th instant, have chosen General Mifflin, Colonel Har 
rison (General Washington s Secretary), and myself to be 
a Board of War; and, for a variety of reasons (which I 
have not time now to mention), I have concluded to accept 
the commission. One reason, however, I will tell you : I 
thought it would give ease to your anxious heart, and relieve 
my friends, particularly my mother, from all distress about 
me. This Board, I take it, will reside where Congress does. 
The office is extensive and important, and therefore my 
acceptance is with diffidence. However, I am determined to 
spare no pains to comprehend and perform the duties of it. 
I ardently hope my associates will accept. General Mifflin 
is active, sensible, and of great knowledge in business, and 
my friend Colonel Harrison is one of the worthiest of the 
human race. The salary to each is, I understand, to be two 
thousand dollars a year. This is better than my present 
pay by one quarter. This, to a man without a fortune, 
deserves attention. Not that I am mercenary : everybody 
who has viewed my past life knows the contrary. But 
a wife and child strongly impress my mind with the im 
portance of laying up something. And my views have 
extended farther. When the independency of America is 
established (as I trust it will be), a Board of War will most 
probably still exist. If, therefore, I find myself equal to 
the duties of it, and give satisfaction, I, by accepting now, 
may doubtless secure a permanent support ; and this pros 
pect, when I think of you and your dear babe, gives me no 
small joy. Tis possible the business of the department 
may call me eastward; if not, I imagine you will be 
less impatient to see me, as being removed from the mili 
tary line. . . . 

" Adieu, my dearest 1 Heaven guard you and your 
infant boy." 

To Henry Laurens, President of Congress, he 
wrote : 



188 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1777. 

" CAMP AT "VVniTEMAKSH, November 15th, 1777. 

" SIR, 

" I was honored with your favor of the 8th instant, en 
closing a minute of Congress intimating my appointment to 
the Board of War. This mark of their confidence demands 
my sincere acknowledgments. I accept the commission; 
and, as speedily as the situation of my present affairs will 
admit, shall enter upon the execution of it. 

" The business of the department I am not fully informed 
of, but conceive it to be very extensive, and of high im 
portance. As such, I accept the office with diffidence. I 
am personally known to some gentlemen in Congress ; I 
wish they may not have mistaken my abilities. Often an 
opinion has been formed of them, which, however flattering, 
\vas really a source of mortification to me, from a con 
sciousness that they were rated too high. For nothing, 
therefore, can I engage, but my industry and fidelity ; and, 
if application will enable me to comprehend and execute the 
duties of the office, Congress, I hope, will never have reason 
to regret the appointment with which they have been pleased 
to honor me. I am, Sir," &c. 

To Mrs. Pickering he wrote : 

" HEAD-QUARTERS AT WHITEMARSH, November 18th, 1777. 
... " Colonel Harrison yesterday went to Reading to see 
General Mifflin, being in some doubt whether to accept or 
not. I hope ardently that he will, because he is a sensible, 
a diligent, a most worthy, honest man, with whom I live in 
the greatest harmony, and whose inclinations correspond 
with mine. ... I am aware of the vast importance of 
the office ; and when the intention of Congress to appoint 
Colonel Harrison (the General s [Washington s] first Secre 
tary) and me was first intimated to the General, I was 
surprised, deeming the office above my abilities and knowl 
edge. But the General thought the Congress made a dis 
creet choice, observing (to Mr. Harrison) that those who 
had been in the army could best judge of its wants, and, 



MT. 32.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 189 

having felt them, would of course most probably provide 
suitable supplies, so far as the means were in their power. 
I suppose the General s approbation was sent to Congress ; 
for, in a few days after, the appointments were made. I 
wondered a little the General should be so ready to part 
with Colonel Harrison, because he was his acquaintance 
before the war, had been with him two years as Secretary, 
very diligent in business, and high in his estimation. 
Nothing but the greater public good could have induced 
him to part with Colonel Harrison. 

" With regard to myself, I think I can do as much public 
service in this new office as in that I now hold ; and, at 
the same time, it will be attended with circumstances much 
more agreeable to me. My present business has been one 
continued course of attention and unremitting toil ; for, of 
the five months I have been in the service, during one only 
have I had any assistance. I could have none while remain 
ing in the General s family, because my deputy could not 
also be admitted. The General s family is large, and I 
cannot wonder that he was unwilling to increase it. I only 
wish he had sooner explained his mind. On the 1st of 
September I got a deputy [Lieutenant-Colonel Smith] , and 
then first found that he could not make one of the family. 
This put me in a situation quite disagreeable, and I did not 
expect the deputy would have consented to serve ; but he 
did ; and, to render his situation as tolerable as possible, I 
went to board with him while at Wilmington, for I had 
quarters at a house close by head-quarters ; but this lasted 
only a week, when the army marched. In two or three 
days, the General, observing my absence from table, sent 
one of his aids to tell me that he feared I had mistaken him, 
and that, although he could not admit of an addition to his 
family by my deputy, yet he always wished me to make 
one of it. I told the aide-de-camp (who was my intimate 
friend) I had not mistaken him ; but, as it was inconvenient 
to the General to admit my deputy at the same time, the, 
situation of the latter must be so disagreeable that I could 



190 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1777. 

not think of separating from him in such manner. -After 
quitting Wilmington, we were so continually shifting ground, 
and in places where houses were thinly scattered round, there 
was no possibility of my deputy s being elsewhere than at 
head-quarters ; but I know his feelings were much hurt by it. 

"On the 4th of October, Lieutenant-Colonel Smith was 
wounded, and from that time I have been without help. 
Many wondered I did not get another deputy, or assistant ; 
but, when I told them the reason, they ceased to wonder, and 
confessed the case difficult. But I will not tire you further 
with this detail. Had I remained any longer in the office 
of Adjutant-General, I would, upon our next move, and 
always afterwards, have taken separate quarters, and got a 
deputy. This would have been sometimes very inconven 
ient, because I came away, you know, altogether unprepared 
to keep a table of my own : however, I should have been 
able to do my business with a vast deal more ease and 
satisfaction, though I must have lived at much greater 
expense. . . . 

" My new appointment I revolved in my mind deliber 
ately ; a variety of motives conspired to lead me to accept 
it; and, after concluding that I could serve the public at 
least to as much advantage as in my present office, every 
personal consideration was strongly in favor of my accept 
ing it. A more laborious office, I was sure, I could not 
have ; and the hurry, noise, and bustle of a camp are less 
compatible with one s ease than the quiet and regular 
periods of labor and rest to be enjoyed in the country in 
my new employment." . . . 

Having remarked on the probability, that, if his con 
duct as a member of the Board of War should meet 
with the approbation of Congress, he might be con 
tinued in that office when peace should be established, 
he proceeds : 

... " When my friends read this letter, they may wonder 



JET. 32.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 191 

at the facility with which I contemplate a separation from 
them. Much pleasure, indeed, have I enjoyed in their socie 
ty, and still wish to enjoy. Nowhere can I expect to find an 
equal kindness and affection. But these considerations yield 
to capital advantages to one s family; and every married 
man knows that a wife and children are more than parents, 
brothers, sisters, and other relatives combined. Besides, 
the business of my department may probably carry me in 
the way of seeing them at least once a year, which is as 
frequently as they see some other branches of the family not 
fifty miles distant ; and I am sure they would hear from me 
as often as they do from them, and oftener. 

"I expect, the latter end of this week or the beginning of 
next, to set off for Yorktown, where Congress sits. Millet * 
will go with me. I gave him full expectation of my serving, 
during the war, in the military line, and that he should be 
with me. He enlisted on that footing only. Were I to 
leave him in the service, I should disappoint and deceive 
him, and render him very unhappy. I shall therefore pro 
cure his discharge, which I think the General will grant 
without difficulty. The bounties Millet has received from 
the State of Massachusetts Bay and from the town I shall 
be ready to refund ; and, then, he will be a cheaper servant 
to me than any I could hire at this time, by far ; and his hon 
esty, care, fidelity, and prudence stand unimpeached." . . . 

In another letter to Mrs. Pickering, dated " Camp 
at a place called the Gulf, on the western side of the 
Schuylkill, fifteen miles from Philadelphia, December 
13th, 1777," he wrote, 

..." Contrary to my expectation, I still remain in camp. 
No successor is appointed, nor a deputy, though I have an 
assistant. I believe I have already told you that Congress 
have made an addition to the Board of War. Major-Gen 
eral Gates is appointed President, Major-General Miftlin, 

* See page 145. 



192 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1777. 

Colonel Trumbull, Mr. Peters (Secretary to the present 
Board), and myself, at present are the elected members. 
Gates and Trumbull being at a distance, the Board could 
not be formed till they had been sent to and it was known 
that they accepted. Whether they have accepted or not I 
cannot say. I hope they have. The Board remaining thus 
unsettled, it was not necessary for me to leave the camp ; 
so now I expect to finish the campaign. This, I trust, will 
be pretty soon ; for the weather is too severe to keep the 
field, and our soldiers suffer much. The great difficulty is 
to fix on a proper station for winter-quarters : nothing else 
prevents our going into them. I wrote to brother John (or 
Williams) , that our winter-quarters would probably be at and 
about Wilmington (thirty miles below Philadelphia) ; but it 
is a point not absolutely determined. The day before yes 
terday we left our old camp at Whitemarsh, and intended 
to cross the Schuylkill ; but, to our surprise, the head of 
our column had but just passed when the enemy appeared, 
which (their strength being unknown) induced the com 
manding officer to recross it. We halted, and looked at 
each other some time, and at length we marched to a new 
camp. It was afterwards found that the enemy were about 
four thousand strong, under Lord Cornwallis, the body 
consisting of the grenadiers and light-infantry and some 
other troops. Half this number, and less, could have easily 
prevented our crossing the river, their ground was so ad 
vantageous and the passage so difficult ; for our bridge 
would only admit two, or, at most, three men to go abreast. 
Towards night the enemy retired, and yesterday (or rather 
last night) we crossed over to this place. 

" We have had now certain information that this body of 
the enemy came out to forage, and they have committed, as 
usual, great devastations ; but tis some consolation, that 
these calamities have fallen upon their best friends. This 
is the county of Chester, and the most disaffected in Penn 
sylvania. The barbarous wretches even refused to sell their 
provisions to our wounded men, after the battle of Brandy- 



^Ex. 32.] LIFE OP TIMOTHY PICKERING. 193 

wine, without the solid coin in payment, although they 
were ready to perish with hunger ; and now their kind 
protectors, the British, have plundered them without mercy 
or distinction. Such was their wantonness, that what they 
could not carry off they destroyed ; as in breaking furniture 
in pieces, ripping open beds, and scattering abroad the 
feathers, &c. With a sword they ripped the clothes from 
the back of one woman, and cut off one of her fingers. 
These barbarities will doubtless have their natural effect, 
to excite the resentment and alienate the affections of these 
people, as we could wish. I was pleased yesterday to 
see how one old Dutchman and his sons were exasperated. 
They had been cruelly plundered. One of the sons watched 
his opportunity, and killed two, wounded two, and took 
one, of the plunderers ; and the old man (who before had 
hid his rifle) said he would go home, put his rifle in order, 
and get revenge. 

"If we had gained seasonable intelligence of Cornwallis s 
being on this expedition, we might probably have taken 
and destroyed the whole of them ; but the first notice we 
had of them (for they marched out of Philadelphia in the 
dead of night) was the report of guns in their engagement 
with one brigade of Pennsylvania militia, under General 
Potter, who were the back-countrymen, and behaved (three 
regiments particularly) extremely well. Coruwallis crossed 
the Schuylkill in his way to the city at the same time that 
we were crossing hither. Yesterday Colonel Bland, with 
about fifteen horse, got intelligence of a party of Hessians 
on a scout ; he rushed upon them and made the whole pris 
oners. The party consisted of a sergeant and ten men ; but 
in the course of the day we lost four of our light-dragoons 
killed and taken prisoners by the enemy. 

"Yesterday two of our officers, prisoners of war, made 
their escape from Philadelphia; and, as the circumstances 
are remarkable, I will relate them. 

" Captain Plunket was a captain in Colonel Moylan s 
regiment of horse, and was taken prisoner when he was on 

VOL. i. 25 



194 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1777. 

the point of taking a Hessian lieutenant-colonel. The 
uniform of Moylan s regiment is red faced with blue. Two 
or three days since, Captain Plunket dressed himself clean, 
put on his regimentals, and powdered his hair, and then 
marched down from the place of his confinement as if he 
had been a British officer, the sentries thinking him to be 
one, and paying him the compliment with their arms as he 
passed. About twenty of our officers were confined in the 
same room with Plunket, and they were sometimes visited 
by British officers, which I suppose was the means of the 
sentries being deceived. The other officer, Lieutenant 
Whipple, escaped in a manner still more extraordinary. 
He one day put on a plain blue coat, and by some accident 
there was in the room a broad-brimmed hat. This also he 
put on. One of the other officers observed to him, that he 
appeared very like a Quaker. He walked in, unobserved, 
to another room of our officers ; but soon the sentry dis 
covered him, and, seeing the young Quaker, asked him if he 
belonged there. Whipple (not having had any thought of 
escaping) was at first confounded, but, recollecting himself, 
answered, no, he did not belong there. The sentry then 
took him out to the Captain of the guard, who examined 
him strictly, and threatened to send him to the provost for 
his impudence and presumption in going into the room 
where the rebel officers were confined ; but at length the 
Captain dismissed him, and bid him be gone. Whipple took 
him at his word, and came out of the city in his Quaker s 
habit. Plunket, having escaped from confinement, bor 
rowed the dress of a female Quaker, with her high-heel 
shoes, &c., and so easily obtained a pass. Some women at 
the same time brought out his clothes. 

"About a fortnight past, Colonel Rawlings (who was 
taken at Fort Washington), Major Stewart (taken prisoner 
in Sullivan s expedition to Staten Island), and Lieutenant- 
Colonel Livingston (taken at Fort Montgomery) , all made 
their escape from a prison-ship at New York. A small skiff 
came alongside in the evening ; one of them saw it ; in five 



JEr. 32.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 195 

minutes they were in it : they let it drift -by two or three 
ships, and then paddled briskly to the Jersey shore. . . . 
" Major Stewart is a fine officer. He told me he had 
intended to leave the service at the close of the campaign, 
but now he would fight as long as, and wherever, there was 
opportunity. Should the British quit America on account 
of a French war, he would then go to France, and never 
cease his opposition. Seven days, he says, he was kept 
without food, and during the whole time of his confinement 
fared badly, and was treated with all manner of insult. 
The like complaint you will hear from almost every officer 
and soldier who makes his escape." . . . 

The next day be wrote to Mrs. Pickering : 

" Sunday Evening, nine o clock, December 14th, 1777. 
. . . "Brother John has, since I left home, written me 
two affectionate letters; in the last, lately received, he 
wishes my return to see my friends. I most cordially wish 
I could spend the ensuing Thanksgiving with them. I wish, 
too, for opportunities of meeting with the people in their 
assemblies for public worship. I have heard only three or 
four sermons since I have been in camp. With great truth 
I may apply to myself Pope s words, 

" Ev n Sunday shines no Sabbath-day to me. 

"I long for a little rest, a short period, at least, of rel 
axation, and the agreeable intercourse I used to enjoy with 
my friends. But from peace alone do I expect these bless 
ings. Burgoyne, I am told, says Britain will own our 
independence, and enter into a treaty of commerce ; and 
just now I saw a letter, informing that a Major Eustace, 
aide-de-camp to Lord Cornwallis, assured a Mr. Willing, 
that all differences with America would very soon be ac 
commodated. But Burgoyne may probably mean an exclu 
sive treaty of commerce with Britain only, and Eustace may 
expect, possibly, that the differences will be accommodated 
by our subjugation. However, perhaps the expectation of 



196 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1777. 

a French war may have led to the declarations above men 
tioned. A French war would doubtless procure us the 
most speedy relief, and, for that reason, is an event to be 
wished for : at the same time I can hardly reconcile it to 
my conscience to wish so great a calamity may befall any 
people. But, on the other hand, the cause of America I 
consider as the cause of humanity, and that this land will 
become an asylum for the oppressed in every nation in 
Europe ; and in that view a good man would be willing 
personally to endure many afflictions. 

"I forgot to mention, in the letter enclosed, my escape 
from great danger. My horse, in leaping over a very low 
fence, fell down upon his side and threw me ; but I received 
little harm from this ; but, whilst I lay entangled with my 
own horse, another followed, and, in leaping, his feet came 
directly over me. Had his feet dropped a few inches one 
way or the other, he might have ruined me. By God s 
good providence, the horse did not touch me. This is the 
first fall I have had since I have been in camp. The ground 
was hard, a little sidelong, grassy, and slippery." 

In another letter to Mrs. Pickering he wrote : 

" CAMP AT THE VALLEY FORGE, December 21st, 1777. 

... " You tell me you embraced the opportunity by Mr. 
Goodhue to write to me, though you had nothing new to 
acquaint me with ; and yet you filled up nearly three pages. 
I often begin to write to you without a single idea in ad 
vance; but my love, ever faithful and alive, suggests at all 
times some things which I conceive you wish to hear besides 
the news of the day, which to me arc always the dullest part 
of my letters. I am always happiest when I am adverting 
to our mutual love and esteem, and to those circumstances 
which particularly respect ourselves and our little son. I 
often contemplate (and it has been my principal enjoyment) 
the bliss we shall feel on our next joyful meeting, though I 
repine deeply that it is probably at such a distance. . . . 
I think on your peculiar state, without father, mother, 



JEi. 32.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 197 

brother, or sister,* and wish the more to be ever present 
with you, that in the care, protection, and love of a hus 
band, you may find all these wants more than supplied. I 
am indeed happier than most men would be ; for, though 
you are destitute of, yet I am blessed with, all those dear 
relatives ; and such affection unites the family, that, even in 
my absence, you must experience from my parents, brothers, 
and sisters all the fruits of parental and fraternal love. I 
am deceived if you do not find in them all the kindness 
which is generally to be expected from kindred blood. . . . 
I remember now you have mentioned their kindness, par 
ticularly brother Gardner s, who has been at home, has had 
it in his power, and has laid himself out, to oblige you. He 
is a kind-hearted man as lives ; and tears of gratitude this 
moment fill my eyes for the substantial, friendly offices he 
has done you. My sister Gardner, too, with the strictest 
economy, is most obligingly generous. . . . 

" The army is come to its ground, and this day we begin 
to hut." . . . 

On the 24th of December he again wrote from 
" Camp at the Valley Forge " to Mrs. Pickering. Ad 
verting to their long separation, he says, 

..." This is the fruit of war. Ah ! that greater ills did 
not attend it ! Compared with the distresses of some, ours 
are but slight and temporary inconveniences. We still live, 
and are even happy in the anticipation of future joys, 
while multitudes have fallen by the iron hand of war. How 
many tender, fond connections have been broken by it ! 
How many parents hearts have been rent with grief, 
how many widowed mates, how many spotless virgins (like 
the drooping lilies), have bowed their heads, oppressed 
with sorrow, at the loss of children, husbands, lovers ! 
And, my amiable mate, the possibility that that might be 
your lot has cost me many a tear. But God has spared 

* She had a sister, but then living in England. 



198 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKEKING. [1777. 

me, in mercy to us both, in kindness to my parents and 
friends, in favor to our sweet babe, and, I hope, not 
without future benefit to my country. Let us, my dear, 
ever gratefully acknowledge God s goodness to us, and 
devoutly pray for the continuance of it." . . . 

In the same letter, but under the date of December 
29th, he writes: 

... "I remain well, and soon expect a summons from 
Congress to repair to the Board of War at Yorktown ; for, 
contrary to what I had heard, . . . that General Gates 
was gone to Boston, a friend of mine just from York in 
forms, that Gates had accepted his appointment, and was 
daily expected there, and that upon his arrival the Board 
would be formed. I understand there is a vast field of 
business to be laid open to the Board, so that I despair of 
seeing you till the spring. Then, I hope and expect to re 
turn with you and your boy. . . . The information of my 
friend, above referred to, renders your coming with me in 
the spring still more necessary than I had imagined j for, 
though flour at Yorktown is less than four dollars a hundred, 
and beef but about eight pence, lawful money, [eleven cents 
and one ninth,] a pound, yet the members of Congress give 
thirty-seven dollars and one third a week for their board, 
without a servant, and but middling fare into the bargain. 
This sum would be considerably more than the amount of 
my wages per week ; of course I cannot live in that manner. 
And, as the necessaries of life are so cheap there, tis plain 
this dearness of board must be a most abominable extortion, 
and enhanced chiefly for cooking your food and finding a 
bed. Before I heard this, I had thought of a scheme for living 
at such a moderate expense as would enable me to maintain 
you and our son, as well as myself. This was by taking 
lodgings two or three miles out of town. At that distance 
I imagine I can live at a quarter of the expense ; for I would 
buy my own hay and firewood, and then I should have no 



^T. 32.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKEKING. 199 

one to pay extravagantly for feeding my horse or my fire ; 
for Millet can do both, and cook, too, extremely well, if 
need be. And this distance would by no means hinder 
me in the general course of business. On the other hand, as 
I expect close application will be necessary, to ride or walk 
that distance daily will be extremely beneficial, if not neces 
sary, for my health. Now, the principal necessaries of life 
being thus cheap, were you with me to conduct the family 
affairs, the whole might ... be supported at much less, or, 
at least, without greater expense, than I alone at board. ... 
"Tuesday morning, December 30th. I might have told 
you, that, since our arrival at this place, which was on the 
20th instant, I have been at my own quarters, separate from 
the General s family, at Avhose quarters they are exceedingly 
pinched for room ; and, as I am in a house where there is a 
family, Millet borrows such utensils as are necessary for 
cooking. Had I conceived how much satisfaction, quiet, and/ 
even leisure, I should have enjoyed at separate quarters, I 
would have taken them six months ago. For at head-quar 
ters there is a continual throng, and my room, in particular, 
(when I was happy enough to get one,) was always crowded 
by all that came to head-quarters on business, because there 
was no other cover for them, we having, for the most part, 
been in such small houses. Besides, at head-quarters much 
business passed through my hands, which is now done by the\ 
aides-de-camp, and I get rid of, being absent." &lt;* 

To Mrs. Pickering, December 30th : 

..." Nothing new to-day, save the coming in of twenty- 
one deserters from the enemy, who deserted within a few 
days past. Four or five of them were Americans, whom 
they had taken prisoners, and who, to save themselves from 
starving, had enlisted with them. 

" A small party of twenty-five men and two or three sub 
altern officers of the New-England troops pushed headlong 
after the enemy, and though urged to return, because an 
ambuscade laid for them had been discovered, yet they 



200 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1778. 

pressed on, and about fifteen were taken. This happened 
yesterday. 

"A considerable number of our men are in warm, com 
fortable huts ; but others have made little progress as yet, 
the march of several thousand of the enemy from Philadel 
phia to Derby (where they remained till the 28th) having 
obliged a considerable body of our men to leave their work 
to watch them. The work is also retarded by the scarcity 
of tools. On Christmas day it snowed, and before the next 
morning it was four inches deep. The weather has since 
been clear and cold." 

Again to the same : 

" CAMP AT THE VALLEY FORGE, January 5th, 1778. 

. . . "Yesterday I saw my friend who gave me the in 
formation [about the expenses of living at Yorktown] .... 
This friend I speak of is Mr. Boudinot, of New Jersey, 
Commissary-General of Prisoners, and lately elected a mem 
ber of Congress. I told him I long ago determined to take 
lodgings two or three miles from the town, where I could 
get convenient house-room and stable ; and, if I could not 
board to my satisfaction in such a place, that I would then 
buy my own provisions, hay, and wood, and Millet should 
be housekeeper. He was much pleased with my scheme, 
and intends to live with me. This will be exceedingly 
agreeable to me, as he is a most worthy, honest, judicious 
man, and we are intimately acquainted. He added, that, 
when you came, it would be still more agreeable. Upon the 
whole, unless some very material changes take place, I am 
resolved (since you consent) to bring you and John along 
with me in the spring. My mother s fears of my being taken 
prisoner are altogether groundless, because nothing will lead 
me in the way of danger. I am happy to find my father 
is pleased with my acceptance of a seat at the Board of 
War : my mother and you, I assured myself, would be 
pleased in the highest degree. . . . 

" The army has made good progress in hutting ; but the 
want of tools has retarded the work. The huts are very 



JET. 32.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 201 

warm and comfortable, being very good log-houses, pointed 
with clay, and the roof made tight with the same. The 
weather is now very mild, which is exceedingly favorable to 
our hutting; but tis a melancholy consideration, that hun 
dreds of our men are unfit for duty, merely from the want 
of clothes and shoes." 

In the following letter, of January 8th, to Mrs. Pick 
ering, as well as elsewhere, Colonel Pickering puts a 
moderate estimate on his knowledge and abilities, 
and likewise on the virtue of his countrymen. After 
mentioning that different employments had been suc 
cessively given him, which furnished him the means of 
living beyond his highest expectations, he says, 

" These were not, I presume, wholly undeserved. I only 
regretted my knowledge and abilities were not more equal 
to their importance. You will smile at this. But, my dear, 
I speak what I think ; at the same time, I have hoped that 
an upright discharge of the duties of my various offices 
would in some measure compensate my country for my 
other wants. Integrity in office is, I fear, too rare. Modes 
of defrauding the public have taken place, which I hoped 
had been unknown on this side the Atlantic. And, when I 
view the general depravity of manners, I sometimes almost 
think Europe does not exceed us in crimes. The virtue of 
the Americans is often sounded in our ears ; I wish there 
was more reason to boast of it. However, no one should 
despair of his country. Every good man will endeavor to 
restrain the vicious, and defeat their pernicious designs ; at 
the same time, by his example and encouragement he will 
animate and support the virtuous ; and, if the effect of all 
his efforts fall short of his wishes, he will nevertheless 
console himself with this reflection, that he has done 
his duty. 

" Congress have at length appointed a successor in my, 
office. Colonel Scammell (who is a Massachusetts man, but 

VOL. I. 26 



202 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1778. 

commands a New Hampshire regiment) this day received 
a letter from Congress containing his appointment to be 
Adjutant-General. I wished for this ; for Colonel Scam- 
mell is allowed to be an excellent officer, and he has here 
tofore, with General Lee, been conversant in this kind of 
duty. He had a liberal education at Harvard College, is 
sensible and brave. Next week I shall set off for York- 
town."

ON the 30th of January Colonel Pickering left the 
camp at Valley Forge for Yorktown, Pennsylvania, 
to enter upon his duties as a member of the Board 
of War ; but, the Susquehanna being for a few days 
impassable, he did not arrive there until the 4th of 
February. 

The following extracts from letters of Colonel Scam 
mell show that Colonel Pickering did not overstate the 
labors of the Adjutant-General, and at the same time 
they are a testimonial of his efficiency in the office, and 
of the esteem in which he was held by officers of the 
army. 

" MUDDY FORGE, February 6th, 1778. 

. . . "We miss you much here, and believe shall miss 
you more. I ll assure you, that I am almost tired of the 
berth [of Adjutant-General], and believe I shall wish that 
I never had accepted. The trouble is infinitely more than 
that of a regiment, more especially one that I was so much 
attached to as mine, and the expense vastly greater than 
when I only commanded my regiment, in proportion to the 
pay. Here I have no opportunity of gaining any laurels ; 
whereas, when I was with my regiment, I stood a chance of 
plucking now and then a sprig. 



204 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1778. 

" Besides, to hear the complaints of the officers, and see 
the miserable situation of the soldiery, is really affecting. It 
deeply penetrates my inmost soul to see men destitute of 
clothing, who have risked their lives like brave fellows, 
having large arrearages of pay due to them, and prodigiously 
pinched at times for provisions. It is a most melancholy 
scene. Desertions increase very fast among us, as you may 
see by the return of the army ; and I am really apprehen 
sive they will be still greater, unless regular and plentiful 
supplies of provisions are furnished them. Several brigades 
have been without their allowance of meat, this is the third 
day. God grant it may not be the means of breaking up 
the army. Discontent runs through the army. Feed and 
pay our soldiers well, and they will pay you well for their 
board and wages. At such a time as this, when we want 
to have our army filled up, such sufferings must be an almost 
invincible bar ; for, depend upon it, [accounts of] the treat 
ment will spread like lightning through the United States. 
My dear, worthy friend, for Heaven s sake use your influ 
ence to have regular and plentiful channels of supplies 
established, both of provisions and clothing." 

"February 7th. 

. . . "Can you lay any plan to get Trumbull, or such 
another man, appointed Commissary vice the present one?* 
Can you find out some way to rouse the States to fill up the 
army seasonably? Cannot regular supplies of money and 
clothing for the army be furnished? Your good judgment 
and perfect acquaintance with our situation are much de 
pended upon. Our prospects are gloomy at present ; fatal 
consequences must soon ensue, unless the above questions 
can tye fully answered and complied with. 

"Your affectionate, anxious friend, 

" ALEXANDER SCAMMELL."

Colonel Pickering replied, 

" YORKTOWN, February 17th, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

" Yours of the 6th and 7th instant came to hand yesterday. 

... "I am very sensibly pained for the distresses of 
the army ; the more because I fear they may not be of short 
duration. Clothing, however, I hope you have received ere 
this time ; but where an ample and constant supply of flesh 
can be obtained I am in doubt. Flour, I believe, you will 
not want. I suppose it scarcely possible to diminish the 
ration of meat and increase that of bread. The great Tu- 
renne s army had daily two pounds of bread a man, and little 
meat; and this, I understand, is the practice of the German 
and French troops to this day, to eat much bread and 
little flesh. Marshal Saxe, I recollect, observes, that if you 
give a full supply of bread to the Germans they are always 
easy. No people on earth eat such quantities of flesh as the 
English. But, if our troops had soups every day, thickened 
with good bread, a much less quantity of meat would suf 
fice. The King of Prussia, I remember, in the regulations 
for his infantry (which book I have) , enjoins it positively 
upon his officers to see that the men boil the pot every 
day. And I suppose, under that perfect discipline estab 
lished in his armies, this and every other regulation is 
punctually obeyed. But, for the establishment of such an 
exact system, he has had the experience of repeated wars 
to discover errors and defects, followed by the leisure of 
peace to correct and supply them. Could the army be 
persuaded to eat more bread and less meat, the want of 
vegetables would hardly be felt ; and as vegetables are not 
procured, tis the more necessary to use much bread. I wish 
some good might flow from these hints. Were you with 
your regiment, I know you would be ready to try the ex 
periment, and by your own example induce the soldiery to 
adopt a mode of living so salutary both to them and the 
public. Nothing but the example of the officers would pos 
sibly avail to effect this matter ; and perhaps the attempt 



206 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1778. 

could not be made without the danger of mutiny. But is 
there no other officer who will with great prudence make 
the trial? or is the very proposition visionary? Think 
of it. 

S " What a fatal change was that of Commissary-General 
* last summer ! Congress, too late, are convinced of their 
error. Besides all the mischiefs to the army during the 
campaign, it is supposed the department is beyond com 
parison more expensive than when Colonel Trumbull con 
ducted it. He, by the way, accepts his appointment to the 
Board of War, but is so sick at present as to keep house, 
and I fear will not come here for a long time. J Tis ex 
tremely unfortunate, for his knowledge of the Commissary s 
business would, I trust, point out the way to obtain full 
supplies of provisions. Early last January this State ap 
pointed commissioners in each county to buy provisions for 
the army. On the 15th, Congress authorized the then Board 
of War to appoint proper persons for the like purpose, and 
to form magazines of flour ; but they were not to thwart 
the measures of the commissioners. The Board, accordingly, 
appointed certain men, whom they called superintendents, 
and instructed them how to conduct. These men happened 
to be in opposition to the Constitution. The State grew 
jealous, thinking the commissioners were equal to the busi 
ness. The matter was by the Council represented to Con 
gress, who have finally discontinued the superintendents 
east of the Susquehanna just as they had set the mills 
a-going. The Board thought their instructions would effec 
tually prevent an interference with the commissioners ; . . . 
they were intended to facilitate their measures. Thus a 
month of precious time has been lost. 

"The Quartermaster-General s department, too, remains 
unsettled, and General Miffiin, who knows more about it 
than anybody, is absent. He went home just before I ar 
rived ; disgusted, as I understood from Jonathan Mifflin, 
at the jealousies entertained of him, at camp and elsewhere, 

f that he was, or had been, aiming to remove General Wash- 



^T. 32.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 207 

ington, a thing he solemnly disavows. Congress also 
have lately sent him a resolve requiring an account of all 
the expenditures in his department of Quartermaster-Gen 
eral. By such means public business, which demands instant 
attention, and is essential to the safety of the States, is post 
poned, although the campaign is at hand ! If we do not 
lay aside jealousies and resentments, and apply hard to real \ 
business, we shall be ruined. 

" The present situation of public affairs reminds me of the 
distracted state of Britain the first years of the last war. 
Would to God we had some great, some patriot Pitt, to 
rescue us from impending danger, and conduct us to victory 
and glory, by a wise arrangement and vigorous execution 
of public measures ! But where shall the man be found? 

" But I need not add distress to the melancholy picture 
you painted. Yet let us not despair. From the midst of 
difficulties we have repeatedly been relieved. A kind Prov 
idence has saved us, and I trust will yet render us secure, 
if we are not grossly wanting to ourselves. 
"I am, dear Sir, your friend and servant, 

" TIMOTHY PICKERING." 

A letter to his wife, dated Yorktown, February 14th, 
1778, exhibits the simple style in which Colonel Pick 
ering lived when a Commissioner of the Board of War ; 
which, however, was an agreeable contrast to his pre 
vious life in camp. In allusion to her joining him at 
Yorktown, he says, 

" Tis more difficult getting a habitation than I expected. 
I was puzzled to find a place to lodge at. Finally I was led 
to the widow Mihmin s (the widow of a Dutch physician) ; 
but she said she had no bed but one, her own, nor could 
furnish me with diet. I told her I could find both. So she 
consented to take me in. I am happy that she did ; for she 
is a very neat, clever, obliging old woman, and has agreed 
to wash and mend my linen and stockings, which is a great 



208 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1778. 

thing here. What her price will be I do not know, but I 
am sure not extravagant. . . . The old lady often puts me in 
mind of my mother. . . . She is in all respects very kind 
and motherly. I have not felt myself so much at home since 
I left Salem. She lived all alone, and now sits from morn 
ing till night at her spinning-wheel, which, by the way, is a 
very modest one ; and when I am at home, writing or read 
ing, it gives me no more disturbance than the purring of a 
cat. She has one decent lower room, warmed by a stove, 
after the German fashion (she is of that nation), and a small 
kitchen, furnished with every necessary utensil, in pretty 
order. There she gets her own victuals, and Millet cooks 
for me. . . . Besides the lower room and kitchen, there 
is a warm chamber where I lodge ; in one corner Millet has 
fixed me a little cabin, in which he has put a straw bed, and 
upon that my mattress ; a bag of straw makes my bolster, and 
my pillow is upon that. I lie between my sheet doubled 
(the other sheet was stolen from me at Wilmington last 
September) ; my blanket lies double upon that, and my great 
coat and other clothes over all. In this manner I have every 
night lain warm and comfortable. In another corner of the 
chamber Millet lies on a bed of chaff, furnished by the land 
lady. These chaff beds are very good. Tis the chaff of 
w r heat, and is much preferable to straw. Millet has bought 
tolerable veal at a shilling [thirteen cents and a third] a 
pound, butter at two thirds of a dollar, eggs at one third 
of a dollar a dozen, and potatoes at a dollar a bushel ; but, 
above all, he gets a quart of good milk every night and every 
morning, which, with good bread (at a third of a dollar a 
loaf of about six pounds weight) , makes our breakfasts and 
suppers. But half the time, as we dine late, we eat no sup 
pers ; so we have milk enough for good puddings. The 
milk costs me twelve pence a quart. At the next door Millet 
gets excellent beer of a brewer at half a dollar a gallon. 
Thus my diet is perfectly agreeable. I have directed Millet 
to get some rice and Indian meal, and when these are ob 
tained I shall want for nothing. 



MT. 32.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 209 

" This little detail I thought would no more than satisfy 
your curiosity ; at the same time I supposed it might divert 
you and my friends. . . . 

" I confess, notwithstanding all I have said, that I have 
many doubts about the expediency of your coming this way 
so soon as I at first proposed. I say so soon, because, if we 
regain Philadelphia in the course of the next campaign 
(which I trust we shall), and all things get quiet here, and 
I be likely to continue at the Board of War, I shall then 
most certainly determine to bring you away from Salem, 
and not pass another winter without you." 

The illness of Colonel Pickering s father, which in a 
few months terminated fatally, occasioned the following 
letter : 

"YORKTOWN, February 23d, 1778. 
"MY HONORED FATHER, 

" With much grief I received the account of your indis 
position, but at the same time was happy to find you rather 
growing better, and that there was a prospect of your re 
covery. Not that I deemed you anxious to live ; I supposed 
the contrary ; but, whether to live or die, I know you are 
perfectly resigned to the will of Heaven. But, for the sake 
of your family and friends, I wished you to live yet many 
years, that I, too, might again see you, and manifest that 
filial duty which I feel and would cheerfully pay to your 
latest breath. When I look back on past time, I regret our 
difference of sentiment in great as well as little politics, as 
it was a deduction from the happiness otherwise to have 
been enjoyed. Yet you had always too much regard to 
freedom in thinking and the rights of conscience to lay upon 
me any injunctions which could interfere with my own 
opinion of what was my duty. In all things I have endeav 
ored to keep a good conscience, void of offence towards God 
and man. Often have I thanked my Maker for the great 
est blessing of my life, your example and instructions 
in all the duties I owe to God and my neighbor. They have 
VOL. i. 27 



210 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1778. 

not been lost upon me, though I am aware that in many 
things I have offended and come short of my duty. For 
these things I am grieved, but not as those who have no 
hope. I am deeply indebted, too, for your care in my edu 
cation ; I only regret that I improved my time no better. 
But, although the line of action I have pursued has not always 
been such as you would have chosen, yet (but I boast not), 
in regard to religion and morality, I hope you have never 
repented that I was your son. By God s grace I will, in 
my future life, aim at higher attainments in those all-essen 
tial points, not only from a sense of duty to my Creator, 
from a regard to my own happiness here and beyond the 
grave, but that I may never wound the breast of a parent to 
whom I am under so many and so great obligations. My 
love and duty to you and my mother, conclude me your 
obedient son, 

" TIMOTHY PICKERING. " 

The difference of sentiment in " great politics/ I 
suppose, refers to the forcible resistance to the mother 
country. Nathaniel Peaslee Sargent, a Justice of the 
Superior Court of Massachusetts, who had married a 
sister of Colonel Pickering, wrote to him from Haver- 
hill, April 12th. 1778 : 

" We have lately been at Salem ; found all our old friends 
well but our honored father, who continued poorly last 
Friday. He seems to retain his reason pretty well, and 
goes to meeting, but is as much inclined to Toryism as 
ever." * 



* He could not, however, have approved of the conduct of the mother 
country towards the Colonies ; for, in a communication in his handwriting, in 
the City-Clerk s office in Salem, dated October 21st, 1765, and addressed to 
Benjamin Lynde, Moderator, in which he deprecates inconsiderate and violent 
proceedings against the Stamp Act, he says, " We would not be here under 
stood as though it was our principle tamely to submit to every law made by 
lawful authority, whether it be right or wrong, good or bad ; for this would be 
to lower ourselves down into passive obedience and non-resistance." He also

Colonel Pickering pretty uniformly felt confident of 
the ultimate success of the Americans in the Revolu 
tion ; and, in a letter, dated York town, March 6th, 
1778, to his wife, he assigns a substantial reason : 

... "I enjoy my health perfectly, and should be very 
happy, if our public affairs wore a better aspect. If we 
should fail at last, the Americans can blame only their own 
negligence, avarice, and want of almost every public virtue. 
For common sense will inform every one, that a country 
filled with four or five hundred thousand men able to bear 
arms, and having all the necessary means in its hands, can 
not be conquered by twenty thousand mercenaries, unless 
it is totally wanting in duty to itself." . . . 

His sentiments in regard to female beauty, and on 
marriage, and his benevolent disposition, are exhibited 
in a letter to Mrs. Pickering, as follows : 

" YORK-TOWN, March 8th, 1778. 

... " Why does not Clarke * write to me ? Tell him I 
heard but three sermons during the eight months I was in 
camp, and that one from him would be seasonable and 
highly acceptable. His call to the metropolis, I hope, will 
not make him forgetful of his friend of the village. . . . 
If he has accepted his call, I presume he has thought of a 
helpmeet ere this time. . . . He used formerly to ask 
my advice about some things. Were he to ask it about the 
choice of a wife, I should remark to him, that, in marrying, 

presided, as moderator, at a town-meeting in May, 1770, respecting a non 
importation agreement, and at another in the following September, at which 
resolutions were passed against four persons as violators of the non-importa 
tion agreement. He joined in a subscription in July, 1776, to enable a com 
mittee to hire the men ordered to be levied in Salem to ree nforce the northern 
army.

time he had been invited to become a minister of the First Church in Boston,

he could have but one principal aim to be happy with a 
deserving female ; of consequence, that he must slight 
honors, birth, and fortune, if not accompanied with real 
worth. On the other hand, I should not expect him to be 
captivated with very engaging qualities under an ugly form. 
Beauty, or an agreeable face and person, is lovely and com 
manding. I confess, I (yes, even /) am involuntarily led 
to respect it wherever I meet with it. Be not alarmed, my 
dearest ! that very circumstance contributed to excite and 
fix my fondness, my unalterable attachment, to you. An 
agreeable form, innocence, simplicity, good sense, and a 
decent education, with a disposition gentle, faithful, and 
affectionate, are the only foundation of real happiness in 
the nuptial state. And, that there may be no deception 
and disappointment in an affair the most important in 
human life, the contracting parties ought to be perfectly 
explicit, and not by any means conceal the faults and foibles 
in their conduct and dispositions, unless they can and will 
cure them. If their failings would, in their apprehension, 
disgust, and prevent a union, if discovered, they will assur 
edly mar, if not destroy, their happiness when united. And 
who, that has any prudence, or even self-love, would plunge 
himself in misery ? And what misery in life so dreadful as 
an unhappy marriage ! Clarke may smile, perhaps, at these 
remarks from an old bachelor,* if he sees them; or, if not, 
at least deem them unnecessary with regard to him. But 
he will forgive me, as he knows I wish him every happiness 
life can yield. 

"And now, my Becky, what can I say to you that I 
have not told you over and over, till you are tired with the 
repetition? Did I possess a creative imagination, I would 
frame some story to amuse you. But simple truth, you 
know, is my utmost skill ; and my sincerity and fond 
affection you are pleased to accept in the room of qualities 
more striking and brilliant. . . . But few of mortal race 
possess every valuable talent ; and I would be contented

with my mediocrity, since Heaven has so ordained. Thank 
ful I am for all His gifts, but for none more than for a spirit 
of benevolence towards all mankind, a wish to diffuse 
virtue and happiness universally, and especially to study 
and promote the felicity of those with whom I am connected 
by the tenderest ties; and of these, my dear Becky, you 
are the first and chief. Heaven has been still more boun 
tiful, and given me you, you who possess a tender, feeling 
heart, that is kind to all, and perfectly attuned to harmony 
and love. Oh ! how painful is the separation from one so 
amiable ! How much does it grieve me to leave you alone, 
and for so many long, tedious months ! " ... 

The two following letters from Colonel Pickering to 
his wife relate to the illness, death, and character of 
his father, and furnish one of many evidences of a 
tenderness of feeling which some persons have sup 
posed he did not possess. The first is dated York- 
town, April 26th, 1778. 

... " You will probably be informed by brother John, 
before this reaches you, that I did not expect to see you this 
spring. I wrote you a line, at the same time, by Captain 
Pike, of Newbury ; but I could not bear to tell you then 
what would render you so* unhappy. General Gates is 
ordered by Congress to take the command on Hudson s 
River; Colonel [Joseph] Trumbull is yet unable, through 
want of health, to attend the Board [of War], nor expects 
to be able before autumn, and has, in fact, desired Congress 
to appoint a member in his stead ; and I am not certain but 
General Mifflin will leave us also, to take the lead of the 
Pennsylvania militia, in case the enemy should make a push. 
I do not know anybody who would be so likely to rouse the 
militia as he; and they will need a spur: I wish, with the 
sharpest, they may have feeling enough to turn out briskly 
in case of need. In this state of things it is impossible for 
me to break away. I could not consistently with my honor

or duty, neither of which, I am sure, you would have me 
infringe. I am sensibly affected on another account, that 
I cannot at this time go home. Millet says my father bid 
him tell me that he should probably not see me again, if I 
continued much longer absent. My tears flow at the thought. 
Could my presence or aid prolong his existence, I would fly 
to his relief; or, if my father were anxiously concerned to 
see me before he drops the veil of flesh, I would go home. 
But I know his firmness of mind, his piety, his confidence 
in Heaven, and thence his entire resignation to the will of 
God ; and that his anxiety is not to live long, but to live 
well. You, my dearest, will be kind enough to present my 
duty to him and to my mother." . . . 

In the other letter alluded to, of May 24th, hav 
ing learned that his father had grown weaker, he 

says, 

... "I was in hopes the warm weather would have 
restored him ; but now I fear his prediction will be verified, 
and that I shall see him no more. Pray, my dear, present 
him with my affectionate love and duty, if this reaches you 
before he leaves all mortal cares. It would have been a 
satisfaction to me to have seen my father again ; and, could 
my presence have yielded him comfort or relief, it should 
not have been denied. But, my love, the consolations of a 
good man are derived from a higher and better source than 
any on earth. . . . His family have abundant reason to 
be grateful, that his life and health have been spared so 
long." . . . 

In the following letter, also to Mrs. Pickering, after 
a notice of the favorable impression made by Gerard, 
the Minister from France, then just arrived, Colo 
nel Pickering criticizes the ladies head-dresses. His 
taste preferred simplicity both in dress and in deport 
ment. 



Mi. 33.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 215 

" PHILADELPHIA, July 19th, 1778. 

... " The Sieur Gerard, Minister Plenipotentiary from 
the court of France, arrived in the French fleet. I should 
take him to be fifty years old. He has a fine, piercing eye, 
and a most agreeable countenance. Everybody is pleased 
with him. He speaks English tolerably. 

" I mentioned to you the enormous head-dresses of the 
ladies here. The more I see, the more I am displeased 
with them. Tis surprising how they fix such loads of 
trumpery on their polls ; and not less so, that they are by 
any one deemed ornamental. The Whig ladies seem as 
fond of them as others. I am told, by a French gentleman, 
they are in the true French taste, only that they want a few 
very long feathers. The married ladies, however, are not 
all infected. One of the handsomest (General Mifflin s 
lady) I have seen in the State, does not dress her head 
higher than was common at Salem a year ago. . . . But 
you know, my dear, I have odd, old-fashioned notions. 
Neither powder nor pomatum has touched my head this 
twelvemonth, not even to cover my baldness. The latter I 
find a very common thing, now men have left off their 
wigs. I observe a few men members of Congress as well 
as others like plainness and simplicity in dress as well 
as I do."

The Board of War. The Business of the Board is transacted 
chiefly by Colonel Pickering and Richard Peters. The Deputy 
Commissary-General of Military Stores, arrested for Frauds, and 
condemned. His Principal, Colonel Benjamin Flower, arrested 
also, but honorably acquitted. Congress offended by the Part 
taken in the Case by Colonel Pickering and Mr. Peters. Their 
Explanation. Letters at a later Period between them on the 
Subject. Anecdote of Dr. Witherspoon. 

AT the Board of War, Colonel Pickering had at dif 
ferent times, as associates, several distinguished men ; 
but, while he acted as a member, the burden of the office 
rested upon him and Mr. Peters, and afterwards upon 
Mr. Peters alone, until towards the end of the war, 
when the duties of the Board were transferred to a 
Secretary of War. 

An unfortunate occurrence placed both of them, for 
a short time, in an unpleasant relation with Congress. 
On the 20th of June, 1778, the Committee on the Treas 
ury reported that there were errors in the accounts 
of Benjamin Flower, Commissary-General of Military 
Stores, which indicated fraud on the part of his deputy, 
Cornelius Sweers; whereupon the Board of War, in 
obedience to an order of Congress, caused Sweers to be 
arrested, and his property to be sequestered.* On the 
18th of July, Sweers s wife wrote to Colonel Pickering, 
saying she was encouraged to address him by "the

universal good character she had heard of his humanity 
and tenderness"; asserting the integrity of her hus 
band ; representing, that in the service of process she 
had been subjected to insult; that, if her husband had 
been " a person of mean birth and brought up to the 
crafts of the world, he could not have been treated with 
less humanity " ; and that she and her family were in 
great distress ; and requesting Colonel Pickering s in 
terposition, in order that her husband might be brought 
to a speedy trial, and, in the mean time ; be admitted 
to bail. 

To this he returned the following answer : 

PHILADELPHIA, July 18th, 1778. 

" MADAM, 

" I hope your opinion of my humanity and tenderness is 
not ill grounded. I feel every disposition to relieve the 
distressed. But justice also should form a part of the char 
acter of every good man. Congress, attentive to the public 
interests, upon the appearance of strong marks of an inten 
tion to defraud the States of considerable sums of money, 
ordered Mr. Sweers to be secured. I sincerely wish he may 
prove himself innocent ; but till this is done he must una 
voidably submit to many inconveniences. I do not imagine 
his situation will appear to the unbiassed singularly hard, 
if the crime with which he is charged be duly weighed. 
The public have a right to be secured against a loss in the 
case. Such confinement must doubtless be more irksome to 
a person of good birth and delicately brought up ; but tis 
fit it should be, because such a one will commonly be in 
trusted with matters of great concern, which demand every 
tie of nature and sanction of law to secure [them] from vio 
lation. Nevertheless, as the crime alleged is pecuniary, I 
should suppose Mr. Sweers might be set at liberty, if any 
means can be contrived to secure the United States from 
any loss, if fraud should appear. I will therefore make

known to the Treasury Board your wishes and offer of 
sureties without delay, and take such other steps as shall 
lead to procure Mr. Sweers all reasonable relief. I am 
really grieved at an event which must necessarily give you 
so much pain. The distress must unavoidably be so great, 
that no person of the least sensibility would willingly have 
added to it, but, in executing the order of Congress, have 
treated you and } 7 our family with all possible tenderness 
and indulgence. I am," &c. 

On the 1st of August a letter from the Board of 
War was read in Congress, representing that Sweers 
had been secured in such manner as the Board deemed 
sufficient while it remained doubtful in a degree whether 
or not he had been guilty of frauds against the States ; 
but that, the matter being now reduced to a certainty, 
and the sums deficient amounting to many thousand 
pounds, the Board were uneasy at his remaining guarded 
only by sentries. Thereupon it was ordered by Con 
gress, that Sweers be immediately confined in the public 
jail in Philadelphia, and that he be charged, generally, 
with malconduct in his office, and, particularly, with the 
crime of forgery. 

Sweers then, in the hope of obtaining favor for him 
self, wrote letters implicating his superior; and, on 
the 3d of August, Congress passed the following 
orders : 

" Colonel Benjamin Flower, Commissary-General of Mil 
itary Stores, being charged with malconduct in the execution 
of his office, 

" Ordered, that he be arrested and safely kept until the 
farther order of Congress. 

" Ordered, that the Board of War carry into execution 
the above order." * 

* Journals of Congress, Vol. IV. pp. 439, 440, 441. 



^T. 33.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 219 

The next day the following letter from the Board of 
War was sent to the President of Conress : 



OFFICE, August 4th, 1778. 
SlK, 

"Yesterday afternoon the Board received an order of 
Congress, that Colonel Flower, Commissary-General of Mil 
itary Stores, being charged with misconduct in the execution 
of his office, should be arrested and safely kept. The word 
arrest, in military language, has a determinate signification ; 
but the phrase safely kept does not ascertain the manner in 
which Colonel Flower should be secured. He may be put 
under guard, or confined in jail ; the latter only will insure 
his being safely kept. But, before either be done, we entreat 
Congress to permit us to observe, that Colonel Flower has, 
till this time, ever sustained the fairest character; that in 
all his transactions with this Board he has ever discovered 
the strongest marks of pure integrity, and nice, unblemished 
honor, great diligence, knowledge, and activity in business, 
and the most disinterested patriotism. In one word, we 
should have pronounced him a public officer of singular 
worth. Even the first imputation against him, that of a 
supposed negligence in not minutely examining Sweers s 
accounts (if in fact he did not) , we believe, arose from his 
own guileless, unsuspecting honesty : the event, however, 
would have taught him sufficient caution in future. 

" With these sentiments, it was matter of surprise and 
grief to find him charged with malconduct, and such mal- 
conduct as required his person to be safely kept. But our 
pain did not spring from an apprehension that he would 
be found guilty. We felt for a man appearing to us pos 
sessed of the keenest sensibility, integrity, and honor. He 
is laboring, too, under an ill habit of body, the effect of great 
fatigues and exposures in the public service upon a con 
stitution naturally delicate. We even feared the conse 
quences might be fatal, and that he might fall a victim to 
the malice of a detected villain, unless the motions of an 



220 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1778. 

indignant spirit should support and invigorate a feeble 
frame. 

" Possessed of sentiments like these, Congress will see 
with what extreme pain and reluctance the Board must have 
carried the resolve into execution, had Colonel Flower, at 
the time of receiving it, been within our reach. We may 
possibly be mistaken ; but we are still sanguine, that Colo 
nel Flower will manifest his innocence. The charge ortei- 

o o 

nates from a man against whom there is clear evidence of 
the most palpable frauds, and who, though conscious of his 
guilt, has had the effrontery to make to this Board repeated 
and solemn protestations of his innocence. We know, too, 
that his wife (who has been with him almost continually 
since she came to town) repeatedly discovered strong marks 
of resentment against Colonel Flower, and dropped intima 
tions that he was the cause of the severities (as she called 
them) of her husband s confinement. We cannot, therefore, 
from a view of all circumstances, but conclude, that revenge 
and some other obvious motives are the sole foundation of 
the accusation against Colonel Flower. We beg leave to 
add, that an immediate suspension of Colonel Flower, before 
any steps are taken preparatory to his trial, will necessarily 
interrupt and retard public business, and in the midst of a 
campaign may prove highly injurious to the States. We 
have not the most distant suspicion that he would attempt 
to escape. He possesses considerable property in this 
city. 

" For these reasons we beseech Congress to excuse an im 
mediate execution of the order ; or, at least, that a military 
arrest be the only restraint on his person ; or, if the order 
in its present form must be executed, that Congress will be 
pleased to declare, explicitly, what is intended by the words 
safely kept, that we may make no mistake in complying 
with their direction. We are," &c. 
" By order of the Board, 

"TiM. PICKERING, 

"President." 



MT. 33.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 221 

Upon the reading of this letter in Congress, on the 
4th of August, it was moved to resolve, " That the said 
letter, signed, By order of the Board, Tim. Pickering, 
is a breach of the privilege of Congress." The con 
sideration of this resolution was postponed; and it was 
" Resolved, That the execution of the resolution of 
yesterday, relative to the arrest of Colonel Benjamin 
Flower, Commissary of Military Stores, be committed 
to Major-General Arnold." The next day a letter from 
Arnold was read, " informing that, in pursuance of the 
resolution of Congress, he has arrested Colonel Ben 
jamin Flower in the usual manner, and desiring an 
explanation of the resolution with respect to the safe 
keeping of Colonel Flower." Whereupon it was "Re 
solved, That Mr. President inform Major-Gen eral Arnold, 
that it is the intention of Congress, that Colonel Ben 
jamin Flower should be securely kept in a convenient 
room under a sufficient guard." 

On the 7th of August, the motion made on the 4th 
respecting the letter signed, " By order of the Board, 
Tim. Pickering," being withdrawn, it was moved to 
resolve : 

" That it is the duty of the Board of War implicitly to 
obey and execute every order or direction of Congress, 
agreeably to the terms of such order or direction ; and that 
any neglect or delay in executing any order of Congress, 
and every excuse for disobedience, and any evasion to exe 
cute such order, is a breach of duty, and derogatory to the 
authority, honor, and dignity of Congress : That the letter 
of the 4th instant, signed, By order of the Board, Tim. 
Pickering, cannot be considered the act of the Board of 
War, because the resolve of Congress of the 21st day of 
April requires that not less than three persons be present 
to constitute a Board of AVar : That T. Pickering, Esq., by 



222 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1778. 

writing the said letter, and Richard Peters, Esq., by assent 
ing thereto, were guilty of a high insult to this House : 
That, by requesting Congress to excuse them from an im 
mediate execution of their order to arrest and safely keep 
Colonel Benjamin Flower, they were guilty of a breach of 
duty : That, by requesting Congress that a military arrest 
should be the only restraint on the person of Colonel Flower, 
they were guilty of a disobedience to the authority of Con 
gress : That their offering reasons to prove the innocence 
of Colonel Flower was insolent and affrontive : That, by 
expressing their extreme pain and reluctance to carry [into 
execution] the resolve of Congress to arrest and safely keep 
Colonel Flower, they were guilty of a disobedience to the 
power and authority of Congress, and that their conduct 
was insolent and affrontive to the honor and dignity of 
Congress." 

In lieu of this ebullition of excitement, an amend 
ment was moved, directing Colonel Pickering and Colo 
nel Peters to attend at the bar of the House, to answer 
questions touching the order requiring the Board of 
War to arrest and safely keep Colonel Flower^ and 
touching their letter of the 4th of August. The con 
sideration of this amendment was postponed to the next 
day, when the following letter, draughted by Colonel 
Peters, and addressed to the President of Congress, 
was read: 

" WAK OFFICE, August 8th, 1778. 
" SIR, 

" We are extremely concerned to hear, that a letter ad 
dressed to you on the subject of Colonel Flower s arrest 
has given offence to Congress. We are much pained at the 
recollection, that the attention of Congress should be drawn 
off from more important concerns by any proceeding of ours. 
We mean, on every occasion, to lend our feeble aid in 
forwarding the public business, and never intentionally to 



JET. 33.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 22$ 

embarrass Congress, or thwart their measures. In the case 
in question, we thought the order not ., perfectly clear, and 
therefore asked an explanation -7+-d. favorable opinion of 
Colonel Flowe-Tvttcquired by an attention to his conduct as 
a public mincer, and our feeling for his present infirm con 
dition, prevailed too far, and induced us to mix private 
sentiments in a public letter, and (we confess, very improp 
erly) to travel into the evidence inducing Congress to give 
the order. As we would not wish anything to remain on the 
files of Congress which has given them offence, we entreat 
Ithe return of the letter, especially as the occasion of writing 
it does not now exist, as Colonel Flower is confined, agreea 
bly to the intention of Congress ; which they explained, as 
we are informed, to General Arnold. We are," &c. 

"TiM. PICKERING, 
"KicHARD PETERS." 



Colonel Pickering, at the same time, wrote to the 
President of Congress as follows: 

" WAR OFFICE, August 8th, 1778. 
SIR, 

"It is with concern I hear that a letter sent from the 
Board of War, the 4th instant, and signed by me, has 
given offence to Congress ; and that it has been imagined, 
by some of the members, that uiy colleague, Mr. Peters, 
was the principal author of such parts of it as have 
awakened the displeasure of the Honorable House. As I 
feel my honor concerned in not giving weight, by my silence, 
to suspicious which may prove injurious to another person, 
I flatter myself Congress will pardon my taking up their 
time in simply stating to them in what manner it originated. 
Colonel Flower I knew was a man of exquisite sensibility. 
He was sick, though abroad ; and I doubted whether he 
could survive a close confinement : humanity wished him 
relief. I thought him an officer of uncommon fidelity, and 
that justice demanded our testimony in his favor. It hap- 






224 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1778. 

pened tliai- J heard on what grounds the order was given. 
I thought the w^rld^ who knew Colonel Flower s character 
and conduct in the public- service, and the character of Mr. 
Sweers, would deem the evidence of the Batter, circum 
stanced as it was, too slender to subject the former to the 
disgrace and inconveniences of being put in safe custody, 
/supposed, therefore, that the honor of Congress was con 
cerned, and that it was our duty, as public officers, to give 
such information as might happily prevent the execution of 
a measure, which, in its consequences, might detract from 
the dignity and lessen the influence of Congress. Colonel* 
Flower being the active head of a very important depart 
ment, I feared his sudden suspension (which might, as in 
similar instances, continue for mouths before a trial could 
possibly be had) would, in the midst of a campaign, prove 
greatly injurious to these States, and that, from a regard to 
the public interest, we were bound to mention it. Added 
to this, the order did not appear to us sufficiently explicit; 
which induced us to ask an explanation. 

"Impressed, Sir, with these sentiments, in the simplicity 
and warmth of my heart I wrote the letter in question. 
Mr. Peters wrote a letter on the occasion in a different form. 
I offered an objection to it, and then read my own. We 
had no time to lose ; the day was far spent. We feared the 
House would rise ; and I was concerned lest we should miss 
the only opportunity of obtaining a relaxation of the order 
before Colonel Flower came to town. So Mr. Peters, 
though not altogether satisfied, agreed that my hasty draught 
should be sent ; expecting, as he has since informed me, 
that it would go through the hands of Mr. Duer, who, as 
one of the Board, would judge of the propriety of it. 
Whatever, therefore, Congress may determine concerning 
it, I wish the consequences may be confined to me. It 
will make me very unhappy if my rashness should subject 
another man to censure. I am, Sir, respectfully, your 
most obedient servant, 

"TlM. PlCKEKIXG." 



JET. 33.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 225 

On the same 8th of August it was resolved, "That 
Congress do admit the letter of this date, signed, Tim. 
Pickering and Kichard Peters/ as a sufficient atone 
ment for the letter of the 4th instant signed, By order 
of the Board, Tim. Pickering/ " 

Colonel Pickering, writing to his wife on the llth of 
August, says, in reference to this affair of Colonel 
Flower : 

"A general account of it is contained in the enclosed 
letter to brother Williams. I send it to you, because it is 
a pleasure to me to communicate it, and because I know 
you would wish to be acquainted with everything affecting 
my character and conduct. A more particular account I 
must reserve till I shall be indulged the happiness of giving 
it to you with my own mouth. My intention is, that you 
should keep the letter to yourself, for the present ; but, if 
you hear any reports about the matter to my disadvantage, 
then deliver the letter to Mr. Williams, to show it for my 
justification. 

"I have the satisfaction to inform yon, that I have lost 
no ground by the affair, unless perhaps with the illiberal and 
cruel. It has, I am told by some friends, represented me 
in an amiable light to every candid and generous mind. 
You, my sweet girl, I know will do me the justice to believe, 
that I acted from the purest and most disinterested motives ; 
that what I did was dictated by truth, justice, and humanity. 
And I trust you know also, that, when acting under the in 
fluence of those principles, it is not my temper to be anxious . 
about personal consequences. Not that I am indifferent to 
praise or censure ; I could wish for the approbation of all 
mankind ; but, to give me any pleasure, it must be attended 
with a consciousness that I deserve it. Merely to gain 
applause, I do not recollect that I ever did anything in my 
life. If it followed the doing what appeared to be my duty, 
it made me happy ; if, in such case, it was denied me, yet, 

VOL. I. 29 



226 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1778. 

conscious of the rectitude of my intentions, I enjoyed tran 
quillity and peace of mind. . . . 

"I did not know, while the affair above mentioned was in 
agitation, but Congress would have eased us of our anxiety, 
by letting me go home, not to return : perhaps you would 
not have been sorry, provided I had nothing to reproach 
myself with as the occasion of it." 

In another letter to his wife, dated the 18th of August, 
Colonel Pickering recurs to the same subject : 

"In my last, by Captain Joseph White, I enclosed an 
account of the proceedings of Congress relative to Colonel 
Flower, and to Mr. Peters and me. I have forgotten 
whether I mentioned our having written an explanatory 
letter to Congress, who, thereupon, voted it satisfactory. 
A committee of Congress have since examined into the 
charge against Colonel Flower, and find him innocent ; and 
so reported him to Congress, and moved that he should be 
discharged with honor : but, forgetting one small circum 
stance in point of time, it gave occasion to one member to 
propose a reexamination ; and a new committee was ap 
pointed accordingly. But I would venture to vouch for 
Flower s innocence as soon as for my own. The villain 
who accused him confessed to the committee, that he could 
lay nothing to Flower, except the single article he alleged 
against him. But tis evident the rascal persisted in this 
merely because he first raised the lie and afterwards swore 
to it. And the committee, on examination into the sup 
posed fraud, found it could amount only to eight pounds 
odd, of which there was not the shadow of proof but the 
accusation of an abandoned wretch who has defrauded the 
Continent of thousands, and for which he was then, and is 
still, in close jail. Had Congress been disposed to receive 
the information the Board offered them, they would have 
prevented much distress to Colonel Flower, and they would 
have prevented a diminution of their own honor and a great 
loss to the public ; for I expect, as soon as Colonel Flower s 



JET. 33.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 227 

character is cleared from dishonorable imputations, that he 
will resign : and a more honest and valuable officer I do not 
know anywhere." 

Justice was at length done to Colonel Flower. On 
the 24th of August, the committee to whom were re 
ferred the papers relative to him and Sweers reported, 
among other things, that, having confronted Sweers 
and Colonel Flower, the latter positively denied every 
part of the charge against him by the former; that 
Sweers, during his examination, appeared to be under 
fears and apprehensions ; that Colonel Flower, during 
his examination, appeared possessed of a confidence 
of his innocence ; and that, in the opinion of the com 
mittee, the integrity of Colonel Flower stands unspot 
ted, notwithstanding the charge by Sweers. 

Thereupon the following resolution was passed : 

"Whereas, After minute inquiry, it has appeared to 
Congress, that the integrity of Colonel Benjamin Flower, 
Commissary-General of Military Stores, remains unspotted, 
notwithstanding the charge by Cornelius Sweers, Deputy 
Commissary-General of Military Stores, against Colonel 
Flower, for fraud in his office, 

"Resolved, That Colonel Benjamin Flower be discharged 
from his arrest, and permitted to resume the functions of 
his office." 

Many years later, this affair became the subject of 
the following correspondence between Judge Peters 
and Colonel Pickering. A comparison of it with the 
foregoing letters and Journals of Congress will show 
(as might well be expected) some inaccuracies of recol 
lection. Mr. Peters mentions certain additional cir 
cumstances. In his letter dated Belmont (his country 



228 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1778. 

seat, near Philadelphia), September 17th, 1823, he 

says : 

"DEAR SlR, 

" By mere accident I took up, a day or two ago, the first 
volume of the Secret Journals of Congress, sent to me by 
the Secretary of State, who is authorized to distribute them ; 
and, at the opening of the book, the 81st page presented 
itself. With surprise I saw, * August 4th, 1778. A 
letter of this day, from the Board of War, . . . was 
read. " 

After a statement of specific charges contained in 
the motions made on the 4th and 7th of August, the 
letter proceeds : 

" Then a sweeping philippic on our conduct, as insolent 
and affrontive. An amendment, in lieu of the whole, was 
moved, that we should be directed to attend the House 
to answer questions. . . . The further consideration of 
this was postponed to the next day, by yeas and nays. 
Meantime, several of the members, who had been under 
much prejudice and sensation, but had reflected calmly on 
the subject, called on us, in a friendly way, and desired us 
to write some letter which would afford them, and possibly 
the House, an opportunity of justifying them in giving the 
affair the turn we had requested : that was, to order General 
Arnold, who then commanded the troops in the city, to 
execute the order of Congress. We complied with their 
wishes ; * knowing that Arnold could arrest Flower only 
according to military rules, he [Flower] being a Colonel in 
the line, commanding the regiment of artillery artificers, 
as well as Commissary-General of Military Stores. You, 
having written the first letter, requested me to write the 
last, which I accordingly did. There were no other mem- 

* That the resolution that Arnold should make the arrest, originated with 
Colonels Peters and Pickering, seems doubtful, as this resolution was passed 
on the same day on which the offensive letter was read in Congress. 



MT. 33.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 229 

bers of the Board, either active or attendant.* The whole 
of the arduous labors was generally thrown on us ; and we 
cared nothing about precedency. Sometimes one of us, 
and sometimes the other, styled ourselves President, in 
letters or papers, according as the one or the other did the 
business ; and most commonly signed without such addi 
tion. After you left me,f the Board, very commonly, 
consisted of myself, though occasionally others attended. 
Sometimes members of Congress were authorized to com 
pose part of the Board. But they were, for the most part, 
solemn witnesses. 

" I calculated the last letter so as to avoid everything like 
warmth, and yet firmly to adhere to our first opinion, de 
claring, at the same time, most sincerely, that we had not 
the most distant idea of treating Congress with disrespect. 
We considered ourselves bound to regard military rank and 
rules, and so to act as not to offend the feelings of the 
officers by treating one of respectable rank, and to us well 
known, having been long under our immediate notice, 
as a criminal, guilty of a base and scandalous offence. I 
concluded the letter by expressing our satisfaction that Con 
gress had placed the matter in the train we had suggested: J 
which had been done. I speak from memory, which, in 
such cases, is yet faithful ; the letters and all the War-Office 
papers having been burnt at Washington. The conclusion 
I well remember ; because some member of Congress had 
charged me with writing the first letter ; declaring you to 
be more prudent. Now, the fact being directly the reverse, 
you a la mode de Pickering wrote (unknown to me, 

* According to Colonel Pickering s letter of August 8th, 1778, to the Presi 
dent of Congress, Mr. Peters expected that their letter of the 4th would go 
through the hands of Mr. Duer, one of the Board. See page 224. 

t About the 5th of August, 1780, when Colonel Pickering was appointed 
Quartermaster-General. 

I This allegation seems not strictly in accordance with the letter. (See 
page 226.) But the first letter to Congress requested an explanation of 
the terms safely kept, in the order to arrest Colonel Flower, and the conclu 
sion of the second letter reminds them significantly, that to General Arnold, 
who had made the like request, they had explained their intention. 



230 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1778. 

who would not have so done) to Congress, that you had 
written the letter, and I had reluctantly consented to some 
passages in it, objecting to the phraseology, though agree 
ing cordially in the general sentiments. Old Dr. Wither- 
spoon, member for New Jersey, who had been heated up 
(as were the members of Congress generally) by the novel 
and supposed atrocity of Flower, and always had voted for 
the censure on us, said he was glad of the opportunity 
of closing an unpleasant business, as it regarded us, who 
always had been heretofore known and esteemed as faithful 
officers. He said, sarcastically, in his appropriate style, 
that, i though there hud been allegations and doubts as to 
the writer of the first letter, there could be none in relation 
to the writer of the second. It was epigrammatical, and 
had a sting in the tail of it, whereof he was willing to bear 
his share. This was related to me by my friend Robert 
Morris, who was also rejoiced at getting rid of the business, 
which he declared he had not, at first, sufficiently under 
stood. And in this many others concurred, who occasion 
ally and amicably conversed with me on the subject. The 
resolve of August 8th, on which day, it appears, our last 
letter was dated, recites its having been read; and it was 
moved to resolve, That Congress do admit the letter of 
this date, signed T. Pickering and R. Peters, as a sufficient 
atonement for the letter of the 4th instant, signed By order 
of the Board, T. Pickering. After a motion for the pre 
vious question, which was negatived, the main question was 
put, and carried in the affirmative. Thus ended, to the no 
small pleasure of the members generally, a misconceived 
business ; which was the first and the last misunderstanding, 
or want of harmony, between Congress and either of us, 
during your stay in the Board, or my abidance in the de 
partment from its first institution, in June, 1776, until I 
turned over, in November, 1781, its duties to General 
Lincoln ; as may be seen in the old Journals of that highly 
respectable and meritorious body of Revolutionary patriots, 
who meant well even in their errors. 



^ET. 33.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 231 

" You must remember, that, on the information to Con 
gress of an atrocious villain, Cornelius Sweers (a deputy 
under Colonel Flower) , who was then imprisoned under a 
charge of peculation of public stores, and, whilst in durance, 
had accused the Colonel of frauds in his office, to gain favor 
for himself, the Board was ordered. i to arrest and confine 
Colonel Flower in jail. * 

" This was deemed by us unmilitary and hasty ; though we 
were ready to cause Flower, although we knew him to be 
innocent, to be arrested in the manner all officers, by the 
rules of military discipline, should be treated. All we 
wished was, to give Congress the opportunity of reconsid 
ering the matter as to the mode of inquiry into his conduct. 
Arnold ordered a Court of Inquiry, or Court Martial ; I 
forget which, f But the result was, that Flower was most 
honorably and justly acquitted. Sweers was tried under 
State authority, and found guilty, and punished by fine, 
pillory, and imprisonment, on sundry charges. Both trials 
were fairly, carefully, and ably conducted, and our views 
of the business thus indisputably confirmed and appreciated. 
How the word * atonement crept into the closing resolution 
of Congress, I cannot account. There was nothing in our 
letters to warrant the expression, \ and the ultimate issue 
fully justified us. We lamented, more than anything relat 
ing to ourselves, that Congress had been induced, by a too 
ardent zeal for punishing breaches of duty, to proceed 
rigorously and unjustifiably against a meritorious, and, to 
us, an essentially useful officer, whose conduct was imme 
diately and constantly under our observation ; and that 
without even the oath of the unworthy accuser. See old 
Journal for August, 1778, p. 439. 

* "To arrest and safely keep " were the terms of the order as adopted; 
confinement in jail was proposed in previous motions. Journals of Con 
gress, Vol. IV. pp. 439, 440. 

f According to Co lonel Pickering s letter of August 18th, 1778 (page 226), 
the investigation was made by committees of Congress. 

J The reader of the second letter from the Board may perhaps dissent 
from this opinion. See page 223. 



232 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1778 

" There is not one of the members mentioned in the 
Secret Journal of yeas and nays as voting on the several 
questions in all twenty-five now alive. So that we are 
left without contemporary witnesses ; and the proceedings 
of the Court Martial, or Inquiry, are burnt. I think it is 
incumbent on us to place, somewhere, a full explanation of 
the whole matter, as the Secret Journal is now published 
to the world. I always understood, and was so informed 
by several of the members, that the whole proceedings had 
been obliterated by Congress. 

" I have called to your recollection this antiquated trans 
action, of forty-five years of age, that you may advise what 
is best to be done. At least we should leave with our 
friends or families, to guard against misrepresentations 
hereafter, some authentic account of a business which now 
appears in the Secret Journals unmeritedly to reflect on our 
conduct. Would it be advisable to publish anything, and 
what, about it ? I did not wish to publish without consult 
ing you. This letter contains all I could say or write on the 
subject. 

" With a sincere esteem, older than this unnecessarily 
revived little tornado, always affectionately yours, 

" EICHARD PETERS." 

Colonel Pickering, doubtless not recollecting that 
copies of the letters to Congress were among his own 
papers, wrote, in answer to Mr. Peters, on the 21st of 
October, 1823 : 

" Your statement of the affair brings to my recollection 
the substance of the transaction ; and if you will take the 
trouble to make a formal one, to leave, by duplicate, in the 
hands of our children, in perpetuam rei memoriam, we will 
both sign it. Send me yours, signed by you, which I will 
sign and keep. I will make out the duplicate, sign and send 
it to you for the same purpose. This is agreeable to your 
own intimation, at the close of your letter, and better, in 



^Er. 33.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 233 

my present view, than any publication. An extremely small 
number of persons will ever see the Journals ; and, if some 
malevolent creature . . . should give publicity to the 
Flower affair, our declaration under our hands, to explain 
and justify our conduct, may then be made public, either 
by ourselves or our posterity, as the case may be. 

" P. S. Our reasons for not arresting Flower, as ordered, 
will be an essential part of your statement. I do not re 
member ever to have signed a letter, By order of the Board, 
as President.* If I wrote a letter, I signed it; and you 
signed yours." 

To this Judge Peters replied., under date of the 2d of 
November, saying he would prepare a statement. 

" I will do it the first moment of leisure ; and in the mean 
time you can file my letter to you, which contains all I can 
say on the subject. Some such explanation, most assuredly, 
we should leave in our families ; and, if we should be com 
pelled by malevolence or gossiping historiographers to pub 
lish anything, this statement may be at hand for the purpose. 
I rejoice that my career has been such, that, either from 
good luck, or want of consequence in political affairs, I 
have been very much exempted from the necessity of public 
controversies. I believe the true reason is, that I stand 
in nobody s way." 

* Of more than forty letters from the Board of War, signed by Colonel 
Pickering, of which I have copies, not one has the addition of "President," 
except the offending letter about Colonel Flower.

CHAPTER XV. 

Reception of Gerard, the French Minister. Colonel Pickering s 
Father. Steuben s Infantry Regulations. General Sullivan s 
Complaints of the Board of "\\ r ar. Salaries of the Members of 
the Board. Depreciated Currency. Colonel Pickering s Fru 
gality. The Office of a Judge in Massachusetts proposed to 
him. His intention to be a Commission Merchant. 

THE following extract not only evinces Colonel Pick 
ering s full belief in the maintenance of the indepen 
dence of the United States, but contains confident 
predictions of important results from their success in 
the war. which have not all been realized. It is taken 
from a letter to his wife, dated Philadelphia, August 
7th, 1778. 

" Must not superior beings be struck with amazement 
when they behold rational creatures, endowed, too, with all 
the qualities requisite to form the kindest and most friendly 
societies, shedding, with savage fury, each other s blood? 
And for what? To possess a few dirty acres, or sordid 
gold ; or, perhaps, only for the pleasure of domineering. 
The latter seems now to be almost the only motive which 
induces haughty Britain madly to continue the cruel war 
which her avarice first began. Though conscious that our 
independence is irrevocably fixed, she is too proud to 
acknowledge it. She must now yield up more. The 
United States will not make peace until Canada, Nova 
Scotia, and the two Floridas are also recovered to freedom 
and independence, and a free fishery secured to New Eng 
land. Britain has long been the tyrant of the ocean an 
element which Heaven designed for the equal and common 



Mi. 33.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 235 

use of every nation. She will not, I presume, long main 
tain her exclusive dominion over it ; and, among the nations, 
the rising States of America will claim an equal right to 
traverse every part of it uncontrolled. . . . She did not 
want advisers, who saw and pointed her to her true interest ; 
but her full-blown pride would not suffer her to embrace 
it by doing only justice to the people she despised." 

In the same letter is this anecdote : 

" Yesterday the Sieur Gerard, Minister Plenipotentiary 
from the court of France, had a public audience in Con 
gress. The letter of credence from Lewis [Louis XVI.] 
was read. The Minister was then presented to the Presi 
dent [Laurens] and members, as the person referred to in 
the King s letter. He then addressed the President and 
members in a prepared speech in French, to which the 
President replied in a written speech in English. He 
then withdrew. The matter was conducted with dignity 
and propriety. The President was so affected with the 
solemnity, that before he had finished his speech he was 
seized with a general tremor, [so] that he had some trouble 
to get through it." 

In a letter dated Philadelphia, September llth, 1778, 
to his wife, Colonel Pickering recurs to the death and 
character of his father. He also mentions his proposed 
domestic arrangements, and some of the expenses of 
living in that city. From the prices of board paid by 
the members of Congress (twenty dollars a week, and 
at one house thirty), it seems that they were made to 
pay for their official dignity, as well as for their food 
and lodging. 

" Last Monday I had the pleasure of receiving your favor 
of the 19th of June. . . . This letter repeated the ac 
count of my father s death, which I before heard from Mr. 



236 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1779. 

Williams. There were in this case all the consolations 
friends could have wished for. He doubtless exchanged 
this life for a better, and in his last moments could look 
back with pleasure on a long life spent in the fear and 
service of God. His peculiarities rather deserve respect, 
because they were dictated by an upright heart, and were 
deemed erroneous only because they did not coincide with 
the practices or fashions of the world, which ever was, and 
is, too corrupt to be governed by principles founded solely 
on love to God and love to man. . . . By next Monday s 
post I hope to receive your answer to my letter on the sub 
ject of your coming hither with me in the fall. In one 
written lately I informed you that I had rented a house. 
... I hope you have concluded to accompany me hither, for 
every reason we can think of, except the separation from 
our friends. ... As to the mode of conveyance, I think 
it not very difficult. The mode of travelling here formerly 
was in stage-wagons, similar to that Captain Nichols goes 
home in. I have told him I may want it to bring my family 
hither, and he has engaged to keep it till I get home, and 
to give me the refusal of it. You may think it will be hard 
riding in such a carriage ; but the middle seat is not bad. 
Besides, I will get the seats fixed on springs, which will 
make them easy enough. But if any other mode of con 
veyance presents, and more agreeable to you, I shall cer 
tainly prefer it." 

The manuscript of Baron Steuben s " Regulations for 
the Infantry of the United States" having been sub 
mitted to General Washington s examination, he wrote* 
to the Baron : 

" One precaution is rendered necessary by your writing 
in a foreign tongue, which is, to have the whole revised 
and prepared for the press by some person who will give

^Ex. 33.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 237 

it perspicuity and correctness of diction, without devi 
ating from the appropriate terms and language of military 
science." 

Colonel Pickering having formerly published a work 
of a similar nature, and being habitually attentive to 
precision in his own compositions, was well qualified to 
perform this service ; and, according to Mr. Sparks,* 
he " superintended the publication of the first edition, 
bestowed a good deal of pains to have it brought out 
accurately, and probably revised and corrected the 
manuscript for the press." Colonel Pickering, by 
order of the Board of War, wrote to the President of 
Congress, March 27th, 1779 : 

"The Baron Steuben, Inspector-General, having formed 
a system of exercise and discipline for the infantry of the 
United States, has delivered the same to this Board, with 
a request that we would present the same to Congress. 
This we have now the honor of doing. General Washing 
ton s remarks have been incorporated in the work. It has 
been examined with attention by the Board, and is highly 
approved, as being calculated to produce important advan 
tages to the States. We beg leave to join the Baron 
in praying it may, as soon as possible, have the sanction 
of Congress, that it may be committed to the press with 
that expedition which the advanced season of the year 
requires." 

In a friendly letter dated "Camp, Smith s Clove, New 
York, June 12th, 1779," the Baron thus acknowledges 
the aid he had received from Colonel Pickering : 

" DEAR COLONEL, 

" When I write to the Board of War to complain of their 
not granting me the assistance I expected from them in my 

* See Sparks s " Writings of Washington," Vol. VI. 177, and note. 



238 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKEKING. [1779. 

operations, it is not to my friend Mr. Pickering or my 
friend Mr. Peters I write. I regard and esteem you equally, 
both ; and I expect, from your good nature, that you will 
not find fault with my laying before the Honorable Board 
the unhappy circumstance in which I find myself, which 
reduces me almost to despair. 

" I do beg, my dear Colonel, you will lend me all the 
assistance in your power, that I may have, without delay, 
the necessary copies. I know I have already given you a 
considerable deal of trouble ; I am perfectly sensible that 
you have taken all possible pains for the correction of that 
work, without which the undertaking \vould never have 
succeeded. To your kind assistance, and that of Captain 
Walker, the Regulations owe their existence ; you have it 
in your power to have them soon reduced into practice. 

" Our affairs are now in a more critical situation than 
ever. I wish we may make up by good order for what 
we w r ant in strength, and our triumph will be the more 
glorious." 

The inability of the Board of War to meet all the 
demands on the part of officers in the army subjected 
the Board at times to undeserved censure. General 
Sullivan, who had command of the expedition against 
the Indians of the Six Nations, and had made a call 
upon the Board for large quantities of clothing and 
other supplies, complained to Congress that they 
had not been furnished. This drew forth a letter, of 
August 4th, 1779, from Colonel Pickering to Congress, 
in behalf of the Board, in which he detailed the requi 
sitions made by General Sullivan, and stated how far 
the Board had complied with them. Towards the end 
of the letter, he says : 

" [General Sullivan] has now made a demand of one thou 
sand blankets and five thousand shirts, which, at present, 
tis not possible to comply with. Could we have formed 



J^T. 34.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 239 

any certain judgment of the quantity of clothing requisite 
for General Sullivan s army, we should have spared no pains 
to supply it ; but all his information was very general : we 
had complied with every requisition from the Commander- 
in-Chicf, and were for a long time utterly ignorant of the 
corps destined for the Indian expedition, excepting those 
three before named. Moreover, General Sullivan s demands 
being usually on a large scale, we deemed some caution 
necessary in granting him supplies. He asked for one 
thousand spare muskets at a time we had but a single one 
in store. We communicated the matter to General Wash 
ington, at the same time informing him, that we had some 
time before ordered two hundred stands of spare arms and 
accoutrements complete for the troops under General Sul 
livan ; and these his Excellency, in his answer, judged 
adequate to the service. From this view of the matter 
we humbly conceive it will appear, that the Board were not 
in fault, if General Sullivan has not been supplied with the 
necessary clothing for the troops under his command." 

Besides complaining to Congress, Sullivan issued a 
general order at Wyoming, on the 21st of July (which 
had not been seen by Colonel Pickering when he wrote 
the preceding letter), saying : 

"The Commander-in-Chief [Sullivan] acquaints the army, 
that, had the Board of War complied with his requisitions, 
and even their own engagements, respecting clothing, the 
numerous brave and virtuous soldiers at this post would not 
now be suffering through want of any articles in that way. 
Although he has been disappointed from time to time, and 
has almost despaired of receiving suitable supplies, yet, 
from late advice, he promises himself the satisfaction of 
relieving the absolute necessities of the troops before they 
move from hence." 

On a copy of this order Mr. Peters made a note : 
" The Board never made a single engagement on they 
subject with General Sullivan." 



240 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKEEING. [1779. 

By a letter from Mr. Peters, on behalf of the Board, 
to General Washington, it would seem that Washing 
ton had been addressed by them on the subject of 
Sullivan s complaints. 

" WAR OFFICE, August 28th, 1779. 

" We have been honored with your Excellency s favors 
of the 21st. ... We return your Excellency our warm 
est acknowledgments for the candid and decisive account 
you have given to Congress of the charge made by Gen 
eral Sullivan on the subject of clothing. We shall think 
ourselves fortunate, if calumny must fall on us, to have it, 
ever, so clearly in our power to exculpate ourselves. And, 
while any part of our conduct falling under your Excel 
lency s observation meets with your favorable sentiments, 
we with much sincerity declare there are very few quarters 
from whence censure can wound our feelings. Your senti 
ments on the necessity of cultivating harmony among per 
sons engaged in the same pursuit the interest and safety 
of our country are perfectly in unison with our opinions 
and conduct. Had your constant example been followed 
by General Sullivan, no trouble would have arisen on the 
present occasion. He has sent us a copy of the order we 
complained of, and still insists on its propriety. His letter 
accompanying the copy is so full of forced constructions 
and uncandid comments on our letters, with such ungenteel 
and insulting insinuations superadded thereto, that we see 
little prospect of his doing us the least justice. We believe, 
however, that we shall put an end to the controversy with 
him by taking no further notice of his letter, which we 
cannot answer without descending into paths we feel our 
selves above treading. We will leave it to time to unde 
ceive the army, whose good opinion we are really, on all 
occasions, anxious of possessing. We have neither leisure 
nor inclination for personal controversies." . . . 

The Board, nevertheless, sent a letter * to Congress, 

* Of August 31st. See Journals of Congress, September 1st, 1779. 



Mr. 34.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 241 

enclosing a copy of the general order issued by Gen 
eral Sullivan, and " representing that the characters 
of the Board are made very free with in General Sul 
livan s army, who, being under a deception, censure 
the members with great bitterness ; and thereupon 
requesting the favor of Congress to appoint a com 
mittee to examine into their conduct and proceedings 
on this subject." * A committee was appointed accord 
ingly ; but, in January, 1781, when it was proposed to 
supersede the Board of War by a Secretary of War, 
and General Sullivan, Colonel Pickering, and Mr. 
Peters were named as candidates for the office, Mr. 
Peters, writing to Colonel Pickering, said : 

Sullivan is doing you and me (particularly Pillgarlic) 
ill offices on the score of the old complaint, in which Con 
gress left our letter undecided upon." f 

The following letter from the Rev. John Clarke, 
which contains an interesting statement respecting the 
situation of the inhabitants of Boston, furnishes evi 
dence of Colonel Pickering s industry and of his hopeful 
disposition : 

"BOSTON, October 21st, 1779.

t In Lossing s "Pictorial Field-Book of the Revolution" (Vol. I. p. 272,

of the Board of War, and believing himself ill treated, resigned his commis

extremely anxious about your situation. My mother, in 
especial, is very apprehensive you will ruin your constitu 
tion by a too close attendance upon your public office. O, 
Sir, give their fears a proper consideration. Live to make 
your amiable consort, to make them, to make us all, happy. 
" In Boston we are much alarmed by the last accounts 
from Philadelphia.* Some are not a little apprehensive 
that a like tragedy may be acted upon this stage. But I 
cannot say I suffer much from that quarter. It appears to 
me we are in a far more likely way of being starved ; for I 
doubt whether Egypt, during the seven years of famine, was 
in greater distress than this unhappy town. We can procure 
nothing, Sir, for money ; barter is the only method of com 
merce which now prevails. You will therefore readily 
believe that the circumstances of such as have neither salt, 
sugar, &c., beggar all description. It is my firm belief, 
that \ve are the wretchedest people under heaven. We 
have depraved every virtuous principle, and, was Britain to 
remove her troops and leave us to our independence, it 
seems to me we should be incapable of enjoying it. Think 
not, Sir, I am now raving in the language of my profession. 
Nothing, I am sensible, is more unamiable than such a 
business ; but, when I take a view of that base principle 
which actuates so great a part of my countrymen, when I 
behold such wicked pains taken to elude the most salutary 
measures, I see, I feel, too much to speak upon the subject 
with any tolerable composure. But you will not be dis 
turbed by anything I advance. Tis your maxim, I well 
know, Nil desperandum ; and Heaven grant it may be to 
you according to your faith. While you are engaged in 
affairs of state, I am no less industrious in my sacred em 
ployment. My passion for it daily increases. New truths 
are continually breaking in upon me.

Some of the inconveniences suffered by Colonel 
Pickering, and the frugality he was compelled to prac 
tise, resulting from the depreciation of the currency, 
are set forth in his letter to a committee of Congress, 
as follows : 

" WAR OFFICE [Philadelphia], November 22d, 1779. | 

GENTLEMEN, 

" Your notification to the officers of the Board of War to 
attend the committee appointed to consider what allow 
ances shall be made for their past services, has been handed 
to me ; but, instead of a personal attendance, I beg your 
permission to state in writing what I might say in the 
matter. In October, 1778, Congress were pleased to in 
crease the salaries of Mr. Peters and me from two thousand 
to four thousand dollars, assigning as a reason of that 
increase, that our situation exposed us to extraordinary 
expenses, particularly for company.* This addition to our 
salaries was made on my representation of the necessity of 
my being supported, if I continued in the office ; and I 
then imagined (living with the frugality to which I had been 
accustomed, and money not depreciating) it would have 
been barely sufficient for the purpose, though I am now 
convinced it would have fallen short even of that. But I 
have, in fact, expended upwards of fourteen thousand dol 
lars for the mere support of n^ family the year past ; and 
the expense would have been much greater, had I not early, 
while prices were low, laid in stocks of some necessary arti 
cles sufficient to bring the year about, and at the same time 
purchased very little clothing ; for in the whole year I have 
not expended in this article, for my whole family, as much 
as would now buy me a plain suit. But, to prevent a fur 
ther accumulation of expense, which I was not sure would 
be reimbursed, and which otherwise I could not bear, I 
have done more. I have denied myself numerous common 
gratifications. I have not, for a good while past, kept even

244 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1779. 

a single horse ; and I have often, to my great mortification, 
deprived myself of the pleasure of company. In regard to 
the salary proposed for the Commissioners of the War Office 
for the current year,* it is a trifle compared even with the last 
year s grant. That would not have supported a family small 
as mine, even with my habitual frugality ; but the necessa 
ries of life are now, upon an average, at least ten times dearer 
than they were a year ago, when that grant was made ; and 
how it is expected we can exist on the present grant, and 
with an increasing depreciation of money, I am not able to 
conjecture. Our family expenses are necessarily greater; 
and, for my own part, I must buy some clothing, for my 
old clothes I have already worn on both sides. I am also 
obliged to give four thousand dollars for the current year s 
rent of the indifferent house I occupy, and must increase 
that sum in proportion to the depreciation of the money. 
From these facts the committee will be able to judge what 
sum will be necessary to make good the deficiency of my 
salary for time past. A year ago, when I had the honor of 
addressing Congress on the subject of my pay, I informed 
them my circumstances demanded, that, whatever business I 
pursued, it must support me ; and that if, in the service of 
the public, I could not obtain such support, I must abandon 
it."^ The consequent Act of Congress imported, I thought, 
an engagement to yield me such support. Had I not thus 
conceived of the matter, I should then have quitted the 
office ; especially, I should not have brought my family 
four hundred miles from home, at the hazard of starving 
them. I can form no idea of the principle on which the 
salary proposed for the current year was estimated. If its 
manifest insufficiency w r as intended to be remedied at the 
year s end, it had been better (I humbly conceive) to have 
let the old salary remain ; but the making an addition to it, 
joined with the subsequent declaration, that, if the money 
appreciates, the salary is to be proportionally lowered, leads

1779, Vol. V. p. 409.

rne to suppose that the grant of fourteen thousand dollars 
was deemed adequate to the expenses of the current year, 
taking prices as they now are. But, after the facts already 
stated, I need not observe how far it must fall short. Yet 
I have not a wish to live luxuriously ; I have not been used 
to it. No man can content himself easier than I with the 
utmost simplicity of living. It has long and often pained 
me, that our manners, for two or three years past, have 
been so totally opposite to it. But to these prevailing man 
ners I must, in some small degree, conform, or quit a public 
station. I am aware of the public embarrassments on account 
of the currency, and that many, like ourselves, are suffering 
in the public service ; and, were public virtue generally ap 
parent, as at the beginning of the contest, we would with 
pleasure devote our time and all we possess to the public 
service, nor ask a recompense. But, while some servants 
of the public are amassing fortunes, and all ranks of people 
pursuing, with so much avidity, only their private gain, we 
are unwilling, for their sakes, to reduce ourselves to beg 
gary. In respect to the relative amount of our salaries, I 
shall say nothing, after reading what Mr. Peters has sug 
gested on that head. His ideas appear to me perfectly 
just."* 

Mr. Williams, a brother-in-law of Colonel Pickering, 
wrote to him, December 12th, 1779, that Judge Sulli- 

* In a letter, dated Philadelphia, December 13th, 1779, to his brother, /&gt; 
Colonel Pickering says, "The price of a pair of man s shoes is a hundred dol 
lars;" flour is "from ninety to a hundred pounds [per cwt.] ; beef, twenty- 
two shillings and six pence [per pound] by the quarter or side ; pork, twenty- 
five to thirty shillings [per pound.] ; ... salt, seventy -five pounds per bushel ; 
rum, twenty -five pounds [per gallon] ; sugar, one hundred and fifty to two 
hundred pounds [per cwt.] ; Indian corn, from twelve to fifteen pounds [per 
bushel]." At that time a dollar in specie was worth about twenty-six dollars 
in Continental currency.f In September, 1780, the salary of the Commission 
ers of the Board of War was fixed at eighteen hundred and fifty dollars, to be 
paid in specie or other current money equivalent (Journals of Congress, 
September 13th) ; and by a subsequent resolve, it was to " have retrospect from 
that day to the 2d of November, 1778." (Ibid., November 15th, 1780.)

van said he wished Colonel Pickering was at home, as 
he was talked of to fill a vacant seat on the bench of 
the Superior (now called Supreme) Court of Massachu 
setts, and that his brother, John Pickering, believed he 
would have the offer of it if he were present. 

In his answer to Mr. Williams, dated Philadelphia, 
January 6th, 1780, he says: 

" I chose to put by itself what I have to say relative to 
the important vacant office you mention. I really cannot 
tell why I should have been thought of to till it, as my 
knowledge of the law is very small, and I cannot boast of 
abilities. . . . Perhaps an opinion of my integrity might 
have been the principal cause. Indeed, the knowledge I 
have of the law (small as it is) would enable me to pursue 
the study of it with more facility, were I to devote n^self 
to it ; but, setting this aside, I know not why brother John 
should not have the preference. There is no man more 
upright ; and on all occasions I discover in him the obvious 
marks of an understanding and penetration superior to mine. 
I should, therefore, be well pleased to see him raised to the 
vacant seat. It will probablj" be an office for life ; and, 
whatever may be the case now, it will doubtless hereafter 
yield a man a decent or genteel maintenance. But is any 
thing more to be expected ? If not, it might satisfy brother 
John ; * but would it enable me to leave anything to my 
children? The fear that it would not is an argument 
against my accepting of it, and, indeed, my principal objec 
tion ; for, if I were in the station, by devoting my attention 
to it I should hope to render myself not altogether unquali 
fied for it. I consider it as a most honorable, as well as 
important office. In this view it is flattering to a man s 
ambition, and I know not any man wholly destitute of 
that passion ; which is, indeed, a necessary one, implanted 
in us by our Creator, as a spur to the best and noblest 
actions." 

* Being a bachelor. 



^T. 34.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 247 

After a request that his friends would weigh the 
advantages of the proposed office with those of a scheme, 
which he had long contemplated, of going into business 
at Philadelphia as a commission merchant on the con 
clusion of the war, and after remarking, that, in general, 
but small salaries were attached to civil offices, he 
proceeds : 

"I recollect, indeed, that about 1774 the General Court, 
by a kind of compulsion, raised the salaries of the Superior 
Court judges to a sum tolerably handsome, to prevent Great 
Britain doing it ; but may a generous allowance be expected 
now? ... I may add, that the Continental War Office 
will probably be continued, which will yield something 
clever to the holders of it ; but, on the other hand, it is not 
improbable (as the members are annually elected), that, at 
the end of the war, some deserving general officers may con 
stitute the Board, to the exclusion of the present members. 
I, therefore, on the plan of remaining here, reckon very little 
on that office, and place my dependence on the commission 
business. I have delivered my sentiments with frankness, 
and I expect yours and my friends will be given me with 
equal freedom. 

"P. S. I forgot to mention that the salary voted to each 
member of the Board of War, for the year to come, is four 
teen thousand dollars, which will not half support me. I 
expect Congress will add about ten thousand dollars to the 
last year s salary, w r hich, with all my economy, will but 
about clear off my last year s vscore of expenses in this ex 
pensive place. In October, 1778, the four thousand dollars 
then voted me would buy more than fourteen thousand 
dollars now.* Congress lately voted, that about the 1st of 
May they would remove from this city, and on the first 
Monday of January were to agree on what place they would

remove to ; but the consideration of it is postponed for a 
month or two. Hartford, Burlington, Fredericktown, in 
Maryland, and Fredericksburg in Virginia, are talked of as 
proper places ; but I much doubt whether Congress will 
move at all. Should they move, I feel little inclination to 
follow them to either of the places, as it would so much 
interfere with my commercial plan." 

In a letter of June 6th, 1780, Mr. Williams observes, 
that in former days the salary of a judge of the Su 
perior Court was two hundred pounds (six hundred and 
sixty-six dollars and sixty-seven cents), but what it 
would be under the new Constitution was uncertain; 
and that probably an appointment would not be made 
until October. 

K During the greater part of the years 1779 and 1780, 
in which the Board of War held its sessions in Phila 
delphia, Colonel Pickering was employed by some of 
his Massachusetts friends to act in their behalf in pro 
curing the condemnation and sale of several prizes sent 

[in to that city by their privateers.

ON the 20th of January, 1780, Congress passed a 
resolve, that " three commissioners, one of whom to be 
a member of Congress, be appointed to inquire into 
the expenses of the staff departments, and the means 
of retrenching the same ; . . . and that they report such 
arrangements in all or any of the said departments as 
they may judge expedient." General Schuyler, General 
Mifflm, and Colonel Pickering were chosen to be the 
commissioners.* Subsequently a resolve was passed, 
that Congress return their thanks to General Mifflin 
and Colonel Pickering for their attention to the busi 
ness committed to them, manifested in their plan for 
the arrangement of the staff departments ; and the 
report of the commissioners was referred to a com 
mittee, who were to consult with the Commander-in- 
Chief and the heads of the staff departments on the 
same, and such alterations as the circumstances of the 
army might render necessary.f What alterations were 
made by the committee does not appear ; but the plan 
for conducting the Quartermaster s department, as re

master-General, was so much dissatisfied with the new 
arrangement, that in consequence he resigned his office. 
In his letter of resignation * to Congress he says : 

" However willing I might have heen heretofore to sub 
ject myself to the fatigue and difficulties attending the 
duties of this office, justice to myself, as well as to the 
public, constrains me positively to decline it under the 
present arrangement, as I do not choose to attempt an 
experiment of so dangerous a nature, where I see a phys 
ical impossibility of performing the duties that will be 
required of me. . . . 

" It is unnecessary for me to go into the general objec 
tions I have to the plan. It is sufficient to say, that my 
feelings are injured, and that the officers necessary to con 
duct the business are not allowed. Nor is proper provision 
made for some of those that are. . . . Whoever has the 
least knowledge of the business in this office, and the field 
duty which is to be done, must be fully convinced, that it 
is impossible to perform it without much more assistance 
than is allowed in the present arrangement." 

And to Washington he wrote :f 

" The principal characters on whom I depended are left 
out, and many parts of the plan it is impossible to reduce 
to practice. . . . When I take a view of the religious and 
political prejudices that have frequently influenced public 
bodies, at different periods, to adopt the most ruinous meas 
ures, I am not surprised to see an attempt to change a sys 
tem of one of the most important departments of the army, 
in the most critical and interesting season of the campaign, 
and when every exertion under the best direction is incom 
petent to the demands of the service."

This office, thus encompassed by difficulties which 
General Greene, with his brilliant talents and indomi 
table energy and industry, was unwilling to encounter, 
was proposed by Roger Sherman, a member of Con 
gress, to Colonel Pickering for his acceptance ; and Mr. 
Sherman parted from him with the understanding that 
he would not decline the appointment. 

On the 5th of August, 1780, Congress passed the 
following resolutions : 

" Resolved, That the absolute refusal of Major-General 
Greene, at this important crisis, to act under the new 
arrangement of the Quartermaster-General s department, 
has made it necessary that the office of Quartermaster- 
General be immediately filled. 

" Resolved, unanimously, That Congress proceed to the 
election of a Quartermaster-General. 

" Congress accordingly proceeded, and, the ballots being 
taken, Timothy Pickering was elected.* 

"Resolved, That Timothy Pickering, Esquire, having 
been appointed Quartermaster-General upon an extraordi 
nary emergency, be continued as a member of the Board 
of War ; but that the exercise of all his powers at the said 
Board, and his pay as a member thereof, be suspended dur 
ing such time as he shall continue Quartermaster-General. 

" That, while he holds the office of Quartermaster-Gen 
eral, he have the rank of colonel, and the pay and rations 
of a brigadier-general, over and above the pay allowed the 
Quartermaster-General in the late [new] arrangement of 
the Quartermaster s department." f 

* Unanimously. 

t Journals of Congress, August 5th, 1780, Vol. VI. pp. 154, 155. The pay 
of Quartermaster-General was one hundred and sixty-six dollars a month ; of 
Brigadier-General, one hundred and twenty-five dollars ; and the rations for a 
year were estimated (Journals of Congress, March 14th, 1782) at nine hundred 
and four dollars ; making Colonel Pickering s whole compensation to be at the 
rate of forty-three hundred and ninety-six dollars a year. He was also supplied 
with forage for his horses.

The appointment having been made on the 5th of 
August, the following letter to Mr. Sherman was proba 
bly misdated the 6th. Some expressions in it seem 
to indicate that Colonel Pickering had seen General 
Greene s letter to Congress. 

Sm, 

" When we parted this morning, it was, I suppose, on 
your part, with an expectation that, if Congress should 
think proper to appoint me Quartermaster-General, I 
should not decline accepting the office. But I beg leave 
to inform you, that, on a further consideration of the matter, 
I feel exceedingly embarrassed. In Avhatever light the 
department is viewed at this time, numerous difficulties 
present themselves. Tis in the midst of a campaign, and 
a campaign which may be deemed the most important since 
the commencement of the war. Tis a campaign for which 
but partial provision has been made ; and the state of the 
public finances almost forbids the hope that deficiencies will 
be fully supplied. The late Quartermaster-General has 
stood high in the opinion and favor of the army : I cannot 
pretend to equal abilities or approbation. I have no rank 
in the army ; and yet without rank the Quartermaster-Gen 
eral might not have that weight the duties of his office will 
demand. Having adopted a new plan for the department, 
Congress will doubtless expect a reformation conformable 
to it; but the practicability of such reformation, in this 
stage of the campaign, may be doubted. 

" Under these circumstances it would be with the utmost 
concern I should accept the proposed appointment ; and, 
independent of them, I would choose to remain where I am. 
Yet I am not disposed to shrink from difficult services, 
where it appears to be my duty and I possess ability to 
encounter them ;(but on the present occasion I wish to be 
excused, unless my acceptance of the office will relieve 
Congress from embarrassments absolutely not otherwise to 
be overcome, "

FROM SAMUEL HUNTINGTON, PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

"PHILADELPHIA, August 5th, 1780. 



" Enclosed you will receive an act of Congress of this x & 
day, by which you will be informed that General Greene l ^ e , 
has refused to act as Quartermaster-General under the new 
arrangement of that department, and that you are elected 
Quartermaster-General. I am persuaded, that in this criti 
cal conjuncture the cause of our country will overrule every 
other consideration, and incline you to accept this appoint 
ment, and undertake the important service without delay. 

" Congress being under the necessity of making a new 
appointment, their minds have unanimously fixed upon 
you." . . . 

The President then states the substance of some of 
the resolves above quoted. 

Colonel Pickering, induced, as he said, "by a kind 
of political necessity," accepted the appointment, and 
wrote the following letter to the President of Con 
gress : 

"WAR OFFICE, August 7th, 1780. 
" SIR, 

" I received yesterday your favor of the 5th instant, P n^ 

enclosing an act of Congress appointing me Quartermaster- 
General. I will not decline the appointment, though it be 
as opposite to my wishes as beside my expectation. It is 
indeed a very honorable appointment, that demands my 
grateful acknowledgments ; and it is rendered still more 
honorable by the manner and circumstances in which it was 
made : but, under the present numerous and peculiar em 
barrassments of the office, I fear it would be difficult for 
much greater abilities than mine to acquire honor in the 
execution of it. The public in general may not distinguish 
between defects arising from the singular circumstances of 
our affairs and those which result from negligence and mis 
management. Congress, however, will be more just, and 



254 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1780. 

will permit me to rely on their candor for a favorable inter 
pretation of my conduct in the execution of an office which, 
at any former and more happy period, I should have under 
taken with reluctance, and which, at this time, promises 
only a constant succession of complicated difficulties and 
distress. Nor can I give any assurances of an adequate 
performance of the duties of Quartermaster-General, but 
only of a diligent exertion of such talents as I possess, and 
of which I wish Congress may not have entertained too 
favorable an opinion." 

Joseph Jones, a member of Congress from Virginia, 
wrote to General Washington : 

" On Saturday Colonel Pickering was appointed to the 
office of Quartermaster-General. . . . This gentleman s 
integrity, ability, and attention to business, will, I hope, 
not only prevent the evils to be apprehended from a change 
in so important a department at this time, but will, I hope, 
be able to reform some of the abuses crept into that busi 
ness, and lessen the amazing expenditures of the depart 
ment. He must, if he accepts, have a disagreeable office 
in the present state of our finance ; but we must support 
him all we can." * 

Colonel Pickering gave notice of his appointment to 
General Washington, then at head-quarters at Orange- 
town, New York, in the following letter : 

"PHILADELPHIA, August llth, 1780. 
SIR, 

" You will doubtless, ere this reaches you, have been 
informed that Congress have been pleased to appoint me 
Quartermaster-General. This was so totally unexpected, 
that it will take me some days yet before I can get ready 
to proceed to camp. In the mean time I shall make some 

* Sparks s " Correspondence of the Revolution," Vol. III. p. 53. 



MT. 35.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 255 

necessary arrangements for conducting the business of the 
department in this State and the other States southward of 
it. The gentlemen concerned in the department with the 
army will, I hope, cheerfully continue to exercise the duties 
of their respective offices until my arrival in camp, which 
shall be as speedily as possible." 

On the 12th of August, a few days after his appoint 
ment to the office of Quartermaster-General, Colonel 
Pickering wrote to the President of Congress : 

" In order to prevent an interruption in the business of 
the Quartermaster-General s department, an immediate grant 
of at least one million of dollars * appears to me to be 
indispensable to pay for the transportation of stores and 
provisions, and to procure forage where the State supplies 
prove insufficient. It being impossible just now to collect 
the returns and information by which the state of the depart 
ment may be precisely known, I cannot at this time make a 
particular estimate ; but the demands which, for some time 
past, have been laid before the Board of War, convince me 
that a much larger sum than that above mentioned will very 
soon be necessary to continue the business of transportation 
and the purchase of forage and camp equipage ; though, till 
I obtain further information, I request the grant only of one 
million of dollars. 

" Congress, I hope, will pardon me for observing, that the 
public funds appear so inadequate to the large and constant 
demands made on them, that a competent supply of current 
money for the Quartermaster-General s department cannot 
soon be expected : at the same time, every substitute for 
current money hitherto provided seems, for a good while 
past, to have been received in payment with reluctance. 
Under these circumstances a measure has occurred to me, 
which I conceive will, in many instances, greatly relieve me, 

* Equivalent to fourteen thousand two hundred and eighty-five dollars in 
specie; a Spanish dollar being then worth seventy of Continental paper 
money. 



256 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1780. 

and which, therefore, I beg leave to mention. It is this, 
that the Quartermaster-General be authorized, for all ser 
vices performed or articles purchased in his department, for 
which any credit is given, to cause the prices thereof to be 
fixed in specie, and certificates given for the same to be paid 
in specie, or other money equivalent, at the times which shall 
therein be stipulated ; and, if not then paid, that such cer 
tificates afterwards bear an interest at the rate of six per 
cent, per annum until paid. 

"This measure, I apprehend, can work no injury to the 
States, and will do only simple justice to the public cred 
itors. It is a measure from which I should hope to derive 
substantial benefits ; while certificates in the usual form are 
held in such low estimation, that no good, but rather mis 
chief by destroying the credit of the department, is to be 
expected from them. 

"I am sorry, especially at such a time as this, to be 
obliged to request Congress to make me an advance of fifty 
thousand dollars * on my personal account ; but I am obliged 
to purchase horses with their furniture, and almost every 
species of camp equipage, with necessary stores, before I 
can take the field ; and, on a calculation I have made, a less 
sum will be insufficient." 

Congress, in accordance with the above highly-im 
portant suggestion, passed resolutions requiring that 
certificates issued in the Quartermaster s and Com 
missary s departments, for services performed or articles 
purchased within their respective departments, should be 
signed by the Quartermaster-General and Commissary- 
General respectively ; should be " given for specie or 
other current money equivalent " ; and should " bear 
an interest of six per cent, per annum from the time 
stipulated for payment until paid." These certificates 
were called specie certificates, and proved eminently use-

ful to Colonel Pickering in administering the affairs of 
his department. 

On the 17th of September, just before leaving Phila

of Congress :

SIR, 

" I would have done myself the honor of waiting on you 
before I left town, but for almost all last week I was too 
unwell to be abroad, especially in the evening, and the 
greater part of the time so ill that nothing but necessity 
would have induced me to do business. I am still indis 
posed and sore from a fall from my horse this day week ; 
but shall, nevertheless, set out for camp immediately, with 
melancholy prospects indeed ! when the treasury has been 
empty forty days, and it is expected by the army (which is 
in the greatest distress), that I shall go loaded with money. 
I have borrowed money to defray my expenses to camp. I 
am, Sir, with the greatest esteem," &c.

every step, after the first twelve miles, giving me much 
uneasiness.

IN the year 1808, when Colonel Pickering s opposi 
tion to the embargo law had made it an object with 
the Democratic party to lessen his political influence, 
the failure of an enterprise, in 1780, against the British 
on Staten Island, was alleged to have been owing to 
misconduct on his part. This accusation drew from 
him the following vindication, published in the " Salem 
Gazette " : 

"The &lt; Essex Kegister of the 13th instant has been put 
into my hands. In it is a piece from the Charleston City 
Gazette, headed &lt; Fidelity and Gallantry of Colonel Pick 
ering in the Campaign of 1780, stating the failure of an 
enterprise against a British post on Staten Island to have 
arisen from a want of fidelity and gallantry in me. In your 
Gazette of the 16th I observe the same piece republished, 
with several remarks subjoined for my vindication. The 
reflections of the candid and intelligent editor of the &lt; Nor 
folk Ledger are alike obvious and just. Had cowardice 
or a want of fidelity in the aifair spoken of been manifested, 
it is impossible that General Washington should have allowed 
me to retain the important office of Quartermaster-General, 
which I then held, and which I continued to hold to the 



JET. 35.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 261 

close of the American war. I may add, that, if there had 
been any room even to suspect my fidelity, that real patriot 
and upright man would not afterwards voluntarily have con 
ferred on me several very important trusts and offices ; I 
say voluntarily ; for, of all those trusts and offices, never 
one was asked for by me. If any of my friends requested 
them, or any of them, in my behalf, it was, and is, to me 
wholly unknown.* 

"Another writer, with a warmth of zeal to vindicate a 
much injured man, has done it on the ground that no such 
expedition as that mentioned in the * Charleston City 
Gazette had been undertaken in 1780. This is a mistake. 
Such an expedition was projected, but with secrecy; and, 
failing in the execution, its object could not be generally 
known ; and hence, probably, this writer has fallen into this 
mistake. Against what post the expedition was intended, 
I do not recollect ; but access to it was to be gained by 
water. The facts were simply these : 

" I had recently joined the army as Quartermaster-Gen 
eral. The boats attached to the army, like the wagons, 
were tinder the general direction of that department. The 
repairs of both pertained to the corps of artificers of that 
department. The late Colonel Baldwin, of Brookfield, com 
manded that corps. He had just reported to me the condi 
tion of the boats that they were ready for service and 
that the wagon-carriages, on which the boats were mounted, 
being furnished with double-trees, none need be carried by 
the wagoners with their horses. The boats were at some 
distance from the army. The only duty incumbent on me 
was to give, in the proper time, the requisite orders to the 

* This statement is repeated elsewhere by Colonel Pickering ; but, as in 
other instances, his memory was here at fault. He did ask, in September, 
1700, for the office of Postmaster-General. It was given to him in August, 
1791, without a repetition of the request. It was then an inferior office, 
having a salary of only fifteen hundred dollars, and not entitling him to a 
seat in the Cabinet. But his argument is sustained by the facts, that the 
office of Secretary of War was conferred on him voluntarily, and that of 
Secretary of State almost forced upon him, by President Washington. 



262 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1780. 

Wagonmaster-General to transport them. And, in doing 
this, I repeated the words of Colonel Baldwin respecting 
the double-trees. Unfortunately, either Colonel Baldwin 
mistook the fact as to the double-trees, or they had been 
taken away without his knowledge. Consequently, when 
the horses with their drivers reached the boats, they could 
not be moved ; the double-trees being the movable bars 
across the tongues of wagon-carriages to which the horses, 
by their traces and swingletrees (whippletrees), are at 
tached. 

" That this trivial accident relative to the double-trees 
occasioned a disappointment to the Commander-in-Chief, to 
Lafayette, and to others acquainted with the object of the 
enterprise, there can be no doubt. I perfectly remember 
stating the facts immediately at head-quarters to Colonel 
Hamilton, principal aide-de-camp to General Washington ; 
whose answer was, that the General attached no blame to 
me. And, from that time until the publication in the Essex 
Register (one of the common sewers of lies and slanders), 
I do not recollect to have seen or heard one word concern 
ing it. 

" In this affair there was no room to display or to with 
hold ; gallantry on the part of the Quartermaster-General ; 
and, if there had been any want of fidelity/ he would 
have been tried, and, by the sentence of a court-martial, 
adequately punished. 

" TIMOTHY PICKERING. 

" SALEM, August 18th, 1808." 

The following contemporaneous letter from Colonel 
Pickering, which probably he had forgotten, and which 
undoubtedly relates to the expedition above men 
tioned, shows, instead of a want of fidelity, that, besides 
performing his simple duty of issuing his orders, he 
was earnest and active in his endeavors to have them 
promptly carried into effect.

TO GENERAL WASHINGTON. 

" CAMP AT TOTOWA, October 28th, 1780. 
" SlB, 

" Sensible how mortifying is disappointment, especially 
when the object of our wishes is almost within our grasp ; 
aware that the supposed cause of the disappointment is 
ever the subject of censure and resentment ; and fearing 
your Excellency will deem me greatly culpable for the fail 
ure of the late enterprise of the light infantry, I beg you 
will do me the favor to read the orders I gave on the occa 
sion, copies of which I enclose. Each was given on the 
instant of receiving from Colonel Hamilton his several 
communications on the subject. 

"After despatching an express with the letter No. 1, and 
another express with the letter No. 2, and the instructions 
No. 3, I rode myself to Major Cogswell,* that I might be 
assured of his having received my orders. He arrived soon 
after, having received my letter from the express, whom I 
had directed not to cease riding until he had found him. 
The Major instantly wrote his orders relative to the removal 
of the boats, and sent them to his conductor before I left 
him. 

"The next day (the 25th), late in the afternoon, my ex 
press returned from King s Ferry. Mr. Kiers, the Quarter 
master there, was sick, and unable to do anything; but the 
express, agreeably to the conditional instructions I had given 
him, executed the orders with so much promptitude, that 
the next day he put into the boats near SufFern s three and 
forty oars. He informed me that there were no double 
trees at the boats, but that the conductor would endeavor to 
procure some of the neighboring farmers ; and, if he failed, 
the conductor said he would send back one of his people 
to fetch them from his quarters, and in the mean time get 
on with the boats as far as he could. About seven that 
evening I sent off the letter No. 5 to Major Cogswell, and 

* Wagonmaster-General. 



264 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1780. 

immediately afterwards rode myself to head-quarters. With 
what passed there Colonel Hamilton is acquainted. 

" On the first notice of the affair I directed Colonel Bald 
win to repair the carriages (which I went to examine) of 
the boats in camp, and get them ready to move by ten the 
next morning. On the 26th I went to the boats to see if 
they were in readiness. The carriages had been repaired, 
but the wheels wanted tar, and the boats thole-pins. These 
defects I caused to be remedied, and some spare thole-pins 
to be made, lest the other boats should be deficient; and 
about the time the teams were fixed to them the boats were 
ready to move. 

" In the afternoon I rode to the two bridges (hurrying on 
the boats as I passed) , where I expected to find the boats 
from Suffern s ; but, to rny extreme mortification, they had 
not arrived. I immediately rode to Dodd s, where I found 
Major Cogswell, who informed me the boats were near at 
hand. I waited a little for the arrival of some, and rode 
forward to meet the rest. They advanced with rapidity ; 
and, after seeing half of them over the hill, and the residue 
just ascending, I returned to the two bridges, where I 
expected to meet some officer with orders, whether to pro 
ceed with the boats or stop there. For, not knowing the 
distance they would have to march beyond the point to 
which they were ordered to proceed, I could not determine, 
though I feared that they would arrive too late. But, on 
coming to the two bridges, whither Major Cogswell had 
galloped a little before me, he presented me with Major 
Langboru s orders to drive on the boats with all possible 
despatch, and they were pushed accordingly. 

" In the course of the business I gave many verbal direc 
tions, all tending to effect a punctual execution of orders ; 
but they would be too tedious to relate, and some, as they 
arose from the occasion, I could not now recollect. 

" I am sorry to trouble your Excellency with so long a 
detail ; but I have felt too much pain not to attempt, by a 
relation of facts, to remove any unfavorable impression on 







JET. 35.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 265 

your Excellency s mind, which the event of the affair may 
have produced. I should also be happy that the Marquis 
were acquainted with the state of the matter as here given, 
if, in your Excellency s opinion, it amounts to a justifica 
tion, or will in any degree lessen the blame I may other 
wise incur. 

" I should sooner have laid before your Excellency copies 
of my orders on this occasion, with such remarks as I have 
now made ; but the business of my office, especially the 
writing divers public letters, which did not admit of delay, 
prevented me. 

" I have the honor," &c. 

It seems from the following letter from Mr. Peters, 
that Colonel Pickering had requested of the Board of 
War a commission as Quartermaster-General ; but, as 
none is found among his papers, he may have been 
satisfied with Mr. Peters s suggestion, that the vote of 
Congress by which he was elected to that office was 
equivalent to a commission. He had also expressed 
himself better pleased with his new situation than with 
his late seat at the Board of War ; but Mr. Peters s 
caution to him, not to rely on a continuance of present 
flattering appearances, w as justified by the event. 

"If Stodclert* and I can hammer out a form for your 
commission, it shall be sent. (This is an Irish postscript, 
at the beginning of a letter.) 

"PHILADELPHIA, November 4th, 1780.

anticipated so many embarrassments, that I almost dreaded 
to hear from you. I do not wonder that you do not wish 
to return to the Board. With my feelings and aversions, 
there could be no possible change for the worse. I am a 
very bad correspondent, and therefore I beg you may not 
conceive I forget you when I do not write. You are very 
often in my mind, and always in my heart. I wish most 
sincerely, that you may continue in the ideas you have of 
your department ; but I cannot say I am entirely easy on 
the subject. For, though a patience under difficulties may 
at present subsist, there is a point beyond which toleration 
will not pass. I do not say this to make you uneasy, but 
to render you less susceptible of impressions flowing from 
a security grounded only on present appearances. I do not 
say these appearances will not continue ; but I would wish 
you prepared in any event. For my part, I continue averse 
from public business and eternally wishing to leave it ; but 
I hate to do it in times of distress, though I am preparing 
my affairs, so far as I can, for my conge. You know I have 
no personal comfort in my situation ; and, as to emolument, 
I never sought it in any place, and more especially where I 
know it is not to be found. Apropos, I have, for the first 
time in my life, written to Congress about the salary of the 
Board, which was put one hundred and fifty dollars specie 
lower than it was originally. The comparison with others 
hurt me more than the sum. I have requested it to be set 
right, and mentioned that you were eventually concerned, 
either in compensation for past depreciation, or future 
salary on your return to the Board, and therefore desired 
anything done for me may also be done for you. I don t 
know what success my application may have. I shall, at all 
events, have one beatitude, which Mr. Pope reduced to an 
axiom, Blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall 
never be disappointed. 

" I have no news to send you which can be depended

" RICHARD PETERS." 

A singular correspondence took place between 
Colonel Pickering and Colonel Hugh Hughes, his 
deputy for the State of New York, the latter having, 
through misconstruction of a letter from Colonel Picker 
ing, believed that he had offended him. The correspond 
ence is of too little importance to be given at length ; 

* Occasionally, indiscreet letters from members of Congress and officers in 
the American army, found in the mails intercepted by the British, were pub 
lished in New York, in Rivington s " Royal Gazette." Some of Colonel Pick 
ering s letters, it seems, appeared in that paper. James Lovell wrote to him 
from Philadelphia, January 8th, 1781 : " I see Jemmy Rivington has catched 
you. He is a tell-tale scoundrel, is he not? You would smile to hear what 
work the interpreters make here of my reference to some salt mackerel which 
Gerry promised to send to Mrs. Clymer. And they make my abbreviation of 
Massachusetts relate to Romish mass" 

The curious statement is made in Custis s " Recollections of Washington" 
(pp. 293, 296), that Rivington was all the while in communication with Gen 
eral Washington. He was a publisher of books; and "he wrote his secret 
billets upon thin paper, and bound them in the cover of a book, which he 
always managed to sell to those spies of Washington who were constantly 
visiting New York, and who, he knew, would carry the volumes directly to 
the head-quarters of the army. The men employed in this special service 
were ignorant of the peculiar nature of it." 



268 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1780. 

but some passages are extracted as characteristic of 
Colonel Pickering. It would seem that a person of 
the name of Lewis had written an uncivil letter to him, 
and that he had sent a sharp answer, for which Colonel 
Hughes complimented him as having the advantage of 
Lewis. He wrote, October 27th, 1780, in reply to the 
letter of Hughes : 

"You are very obliging in your remarks on the letters 
between Colonel Lewis and me. Eeally, Sir, I wish ever to 
be civil towards all men ; but not (infrequently inattention 
(not designed), especially in matters that have as much of 
form as substance, subjects me to the charge of want of 
politeness. This inattention is a fault which I wish to 
amend ; but it springs from my natural disposition, con 
firmed by habit. For, having, from my earliest remembrance 
of reflections of the kind, looked on all mankind as possess 
ing equal rights, I am wont not to make those distinctions 
between the high and the low which gave birth to the term 
politeness" 

Hughes, mistaking the period at the end of the first 
sentence for a comma, and the comma after " Really, 
Sir," for a period, construed the foregoing passage as 
an unaccountable strain of irony, and, in a second let 
ter, requested an explanation of the sense in which 
Colonel Pickering had understood such part of his let 
ter as had given ground for suspecting his veracity or 
his sense of decorum, and intimated that he would rather 
resign his office than live in a state of jealousy and sus 
picion. Colonel Pickering, not having been offended, 
nor having had any intention of giving offence, made 
merry with Hughes s letter, and, being much puzzled 
by it, requested a sight of his own letter, or a copy, not 
having taken one. He then proceeded to say (Octo 
ber 30th): 



JET. 35.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 269 

" My dear Sir, so far from being offended, I read your 
letter with much satisfaction, and recollect that I forbore 
taking notice of the first paragraph about Colonel Lewis s 
affair, only because it appeared too flattering ; and, instead of 
thanking you for the very favorable opinion you expressed 
of the propriety of my letter to him, went on to confess my 
general want of prudence and politeness, and to account for 
it from my natural disposition ; jfor I was ever prone to call 
a cat a cat, and to estimate mankind (how proud and vain 
a man, you will say ! indeed, my good Sir, I do pride my 
self in the consciousness of such a disposition) not by their 
wealth, titles, or connections, but, so far as I can discern 
their true characters, by their real worth. . . . 

"Permit me now seriously to assure you, Sir, and I do 
it with perfect sincerity, that I had not the most distant 
idea of being offended with you. What absurdity I was guilty 
of in my letter I do not know ; but this is certain, that your 
uneasiness has arisen from a total misconception of the inten 
tion of it, however the terms might warrant your construc 
tion. In this instance we may see what is probably the 
ground of many quarrels, mere, and perhaps mutual, mis 
apprehension. But, as we are friends, and both wish to 
remain so, no ill consequence can follow from this strange 
incident. Perhaps it may do good ; it may, in time to come, 
prevent our drawing too hasty conclusions from our mutual 
expressions in matters of real moment." 

In the same letter he writes : 

" Reflecting lately on the situation of my family in Phila 
delphia, and that the motives which brought it thither now 
had ceased, it struck me as the most eligible step I could 
take, that it were better to remove it to some place more 
within my reach, and where I could support it at much less 
expense ; and, considering where may probably be the seat 
of the war. for at least a year to come, I concluded that a 
most convenient residence would be somewhere above the 



270 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKEKING. [1780. 

Highlands, not far from the Hudson. Can you advise me 
to an agreeable position, and help me to a tolerable shelter? 
I wish not for parade ; convenience and comfort outweigh 
all other considerations. Mrs. Pickering will be an easy 
and kind neighbor ; she has two fine boys and two honest 
maid-servants. These will constitute my family. . . . 
Your information and assistance in this affair will do me 
the greatest kindness." 

Colonel Hughes replied : 

"FISHKILL, November 5th, 1780. 

Sir, 

" I now declare solemnly, once for all, that there is no 
person with whom I have ever had any connection, that I 
would sooner serve than you." 

He proceeds to account for and to excuse his mis 
take of the meaning of Colonel Pickering s letter. He 
states that he has found apartments for Mrs. Pickering 
in as elegant a farm-house as any in the county, in a 
village called New Hackinsack. 

"The house is the property of a Dr. Thorn, a person 
once of a suspicious character, but now a sworn Whig. . . . 
I must not omit acquainting you, that some of the con 
ditions are, that Mrs. Pickering stays no longer than till 
spring, if it should be found inconvenient for the family, 
and that no forage is to be taken but what can be spared 
without detriment to his stock. A temporary kitchen is 
also to be erected, if required; and we have boards, &c. 
Whatever sheds, stalls, &c., shall be wanted, must be sup 
plied by me, if there is not room in the Doctor s stables, 
&G. ... I expect your lady will be very happy there, as 
it is an orderly, good-natured family, and the Doctor s wife, 
I am informed, is well affected to the cause of her country, 
whatever he may be. She refuses to lodge any suspicious 
characters, or have any of their meetings, &c., held at her 



Mr. 35.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 271 

house. The Doctor himself is naturally a good-natured, 
merry fellow ; tells a good story, and sings now and then 
an old-fashioned song." 

In the latter part of November, Colonel Pickering s 
family removed from Philadelphia to New Hackinsack, 
to the house of Dr. Thorn. He had previously written 
(November 7th) to Colonel Hughes, accepting his offer 
to provide their necessary winter stores, and saying : 

" You will perhaps repent of your readiness to serve me ; 
for I am not very scrupulous in requesting the kind offices 
of my friends, when I think their goodness will prevent 
their giving me a denial. I will, however, be as little 
troublesome as possible ; and, when I have asked as much 
as I can with decency, but still want more, I must get Mrs. 
Pickering to be my mediatrix ; against w r hom a new account 
may be formed, and the enormity of my debt not be in 
creased. 

"You are an old housekeeper, and have anticipated all 
my wishes ; and, though I have not my wife s answer re 
specting a permanent residence in your State, yet, as she is 
reasonable in her desires, and ever disposed to conform to 
whatever is most agreeable to me and most consistent with 
my interest, I have not the least doubt that the proposal 
will have her consent ; besides, should she choose to go to 
New England again next spring, she will, by the proposed 
removal, have performed half the journey. I will, therefore, 
without hesitation, gladly accept of your offer to lay up for 
us the necessary winter stores." 

After giving directions on that subject, Colonel 
Pickering says : 

"All the conditions stipulated by Dr. Thorn I am willing 
to comply with. His stables will have plenty of spare 
room for all my cavalry ; for I am too poor to keep a car- 



272 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1780. 

riage, and of course shall want no more forage than the 
public are to furnish me with ; and, as I shall be very little 
absent from the army, there will be seldom an occasion of 
making demands on the Doctor s haystacks ; though in emer 
gencies he would surely be too good to deny me, at least on 
condition of repayment in kind ; which I would make, even 
if I sent to Connecticut for forage to enable me to do it. I 
doubt if any room will be wanting, excepting a temporary 
kitchen; and this I believe will be indispensable, if there 
be not already a place to cook in separate from that of the 
Doctor s family. But, my dear Sir, you will suffer me to 
make one condition, if public workmen and public stock 
are made use of in furnishing conveniences for myself and 
family, which is, that you will take the trouble to charge 
me with the real value of everything so furnished. There 
are certain things to which, as an officer in the army, I am 
entitled at the public expense : these I am willing to accept, 
but nothing more, without paying therefor. My indigna 
tion, Sir, has often been kindled at a different conduct in 
others, and I will not, by committing a fault which I con 
demn in others, lay a foundation for se^-reproach ; though, 
so frequent has been the practice, I may escape the reproach 
of the world. 

" I have always kept a cow in Philadelphia, because I like 
milk better than wine because I prefer it to all other food 
for children and because none good could be bought ; but 
at Dr. Thorn s, I suppose, I can get milk in full plenty. . . . 

"I beg your pardon for troubling you with such a detail, 
and more still for trespassing on your time for a mere pri 
vate affair; but in the end I hope it will be beneficial, not 
to myself only, for, if I can live at much less expense at 
Hackinsack than in Philadelphia, I shall be less disposed to 
ask an increase of pay on account of the expenses incurred 
in supporting a large family at camp. 

"P. S. Upon reading over this letter, I felt a wish that 
neither public workmen nor public materials were at all 
employed in building a kitchen ; for, as in receiving my pay 



MT. 35.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 273 

I will give credit for the real value of them, the business 
may perhaps be as well done at once by private workmen 
with private stock, if to be obtained on a short credit ; for 
by New Year s day I will pay the whole expense of it. If 
it be done by the public in the first instance, I may be 
reproached, for people will see the building, but not your 
books or my accounts. I mean not, however, to ask you 
to perform impossibilities. If you find a kitchen neces 
sary . . . for the comfort and convenience of my family, 
let it be built at all events." 

Manifestations of disinterestedness and of submission 
to personal inconvenience for the benefit of the public, 
were not of rare occurrence in the army of the Revo 
lution. The preceding letter, and the following extracts 
from others, illustrate Colonel Pickering s character in 
these respects : 

TO HIS BROTHER. 

"NEWBURGH, April 12th, 1781. 

" You mention the ten half-joes which I sent for by Cap 
tain Abbot. My necessities have obliged me to call for a 
much larger sum on brother Williams. These wants will 
not, I hope, always continue; and, in the end, I trust I 
shall not lose, though I do not expect to gain, by serving the 
public. The depreciation being allowed for while a member 
of the Board of War, there is now a balance of near four 
thousand dollars, specie value, due to me ; but it is im 
possible to obtain this from an empty treasury." 

TO THE SAME. 

" NEWBURGH, April 15th, 1781. 

" The deficiency of my salary while a member of the Board 
of War has principally occasioned these draughts. That 
deficiency, however, Congress have agreed to supply, which 
leaves a balance still due to me of three thousand nine hun-

dred and fourteen dollars and one third, specie* But, as it 
is impossible to obtain this at present, and the expenses 
attending my present office are very great, I hope you and 
my other friends will readily excuse the draughts I am con 
strained to make on them. Could I appropriate monthly a 
part of the public moneys I receive, in discharge of my pay, 
I could support myself henceforward ; but to take the whole 
of my pay in this manner would make too large deductions 
from those moneys while I am so scantily supplied." 

FKOM PETER ANSPACH.* 

" NEW YORK, October 6th, 1789. 

"I am almost certain that no case similar to yours and 
ours is to be met with anywhere, to wit, that a Quarter 
master-General and his own immediate assistants, while 
possessed of as much public money as would answer for 
amounts clue to them, should disburse that very sum (which 
was no more than their own due) among the sundry cred 
itors, for the mere name of maintaining public credit, and 
thereby leave themselves moneyless." 

In a letter from Newburgh of December 28th, 1780, 
to his brother, Colonel Pickering says, respecting his 
domestic arrangements : 

" I believe I informed you or Mr. Williams of my inten 
tion of removing my family from Philadelphia. They are 
with me at this place. We are all very well. As I had no 
inducement to carry my family to Philadelphia but to have 
them with me, so, on my removal, that inducement ceased, 

* Mr. Anspach served under Colonel Pickering in the Quartermaster-Gen 
eral s department; first, as a clerk, from September 1st, 1780, to July 31st, 
1781 ; then, as paymaster, until December 31st, 1782 ; fend afterwards, probably 
to the end of the war, as an assistant quartermaster. He was engaged in the 
settlement of Colonel Pickering s accounts as Quartermaster-General when he 
wrote the letter above quoted. He was an accurate accountant, a worthy 
man, and warmly attached to Colonel Pickering.

and every reason conspired to urge my bringing them from 
that expensive city. I have now but one family, one set 
of servants instead of two, and the satisfaction of having 
my wife and children with me. Should the war continue, 
as it doubtless will, another year, I mean to find some 
convenient house in this State (probably between Fishkill 
and Poughkeepsie) , where my family may remain during 
the next campaign."

CHAPTER XVIII. 

Specie Payments and Specie Certificates. Letter on these Subjects 
from Colonel Pickering to Congress. Robert H. Harrison. 
Colonel Pickering proposes Reforms in his Department. Em 
barrassments in it. His Public Spirit and Independence. 
Legacy from his Friend, Colonel Flower. His Aversion to 
Slavery. 

BY the new regulations* of the Quartermaster s 
department, the salaries of its officers were to be 
paid " in specie or other money equivalent " ; and, as 
before mentioned, by a resolve f of Congress, the 
Quartermaster-General was authorized to issue cer 
tificates of debt, payable in the same way. Doubts, 
however, were entertained by some persons, whether 
a real equivalent to specie was intended by Congress ; 
which doubts were strengthened by a resolve, that the 
salaries of certain civil officers, which had been made 
payable "in specie or other current money equiva 
lent," should be paid in bills of credit of the "new 



emission." 



Colonel Pickering went to Philadelphia in February, 
1781 (arriving there on the 24th), for the purpose of 
making application to Congress in relation to the sal 
aries and the specie certificates, and also of forward 
ing the movement of a detachment of troops under 
Lafayette.

On the 2d of March, at Philadelphia, he wrote to 
Mrs. Pickering : 

I found our old acquaintances well, except Mr. Fooks,* 
who is much better, and Colonel Flower, whp is not expected 
to live long. I went to see him the day I arrived. He said 
he had never expected to have that happiness. . . . 

" I have yet had little time to speak or think of the first 
object of my journey, being busily engaged in forwarding 
the detachment. ... I have now a little leisure, and 
shall frame my address on the subject. The affair is 
attended with embarrassments, and I know not what may 
be the result." 

He accordingly wrote to the President of Congress, 
under date of March 3d, 1781 : 

" SIR, 

" After twice requesting of Congress an explanation of 
their resolutions relative to the pay of the officers of my -^ fL-i 
department; and the certificates I am authorized to issue, I v -* 
would not again trouble them on the subject, if it did not 
appear to me indispensably necessary to come to a decision. 
To obtain this was the principal cause of my journey hither ; 
though I was charged, at the same time, with the arrange 
ments requisite for the march of the detachment under the 
command of the Marquis de Lafayette, f and attention to 
which has till this time prevented my applying to Congress 
on the subject of this letter. 

" Trusting to the plain and obvious meaning of the words, 
I ventured to assure the persons concerned, that the moneys 
promised to be paid in specie or other current money equiv 
alent would really be so paid, and that no bills of credit

to the Head of Elk was performed prosperously and expeditiously. 



278 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1781. 

should ever be tendered to them as such equivalent, unless 
they were current among the people at the rate of specie. 
By these assurances, I was enabled to organize the depart 
ment, and to issue some certificates in lieu of money. But, 
as doubts still rose in the minds of many, I requested of Con 
gress an explanation of the words in question. A resolution 
passed thereon, declaring a real and not a nominal equiva 
lent was intended. But the next day this was ordered to 
be reconsidered, and, some time after, to be recommitted ; 
and thus the matter rests. These proceedings were indeed 
represented to me in a light somewhat different. I was 

told that the resolution of October was the next day 

repealed, and another resolution passed, declaring that the 
salaries and contracts fixed and promised to be paid in 
specie should be paid in bills of the new emission as equiv 
alent to specie. The source and circumstances of the infor 
mation were such as almost to exclude a doubt of the truth 
of it, and I could scarcely withhold my full belief, when, 
turning over the Journals of Congress for September and 
November (just then arrived), I found that the salaries of 
the officers on the civil list, which in the first month had 
been fixed and made payable in specie or other current 
money equivalent, in the latter were ordered to be paid in 
bills of the new emission. 

" Well knowing what would be the fatal effects of such a 
resolution respecting my department, I immediately com 
municated my information to the Commander-in-Chief, who 
thereupon gave me my present leave of absence. And 
now, although the representation differed from the fact, 
yet it appears to me not the less necessary that a clear and 
unequivocal explanation of the meaning of Congress should 
be given, and such further measures adopted and uniformly 
pursued, as shall recover and fix the confidence of the 
people. I am aware that this subject is not without embar 
rassments ; yet the path of justice appears plain and simple, 
and with justice sound policy cannot be at variance. 

"In the plan for the Quartermaster s department, I 



Mi. 35.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 279 

supposed Congress intended to establish a permanent prin 
ciple, in fixing the pay of the officers in a medium not 
liable to the continual changes of paper money, by a reli 
ance on which persons suitably qualified might be encour 
aged to enter into the public service, and, receiving a just 
compensation, not be tempted to pay themselves at discre 
tion. It was the establishing of this principle which led me 
to propose the issuing specie certificates. I had not then, 
nor long after, any knowledge of the tender laws relative to 
the bills of the new emission ; and those respecting the old 
emissions, I thought had either been repealed, suspended, 
or become obsolete. I could not indeed conceive that such 
laws, which the experience of five years had shown to be 
injurious to public credit, destructive to the morals of the 
people, and beneficial to none but sharpers and fraudulent 
debtors, would ever have been revived. While these laws 
remain in force, the evils of which I complain will be reme 
diless. Were Congress, at this time, to declare, in the most 
candid and explicit terms, that the salaries of persons in my 
department, and the specie contracts they have made, should 
be paid in gold and silver, or other moneys really equiva 
lent, still I should be embarrassed ; for the tender laws hang 
over my head, and threaten severe penalties if I attempt to 
act honestly by rating the current paper money at its just, 
instead of its legal, value. Yet there is not a single mem 
ber of any public body in America who will accept a paper 
dollar of the new emission as an equivalent to a silver dollar. 
But a public officer must tender it as such. Hard condition 
to an honest man engaged in the service of his country ! 
Why such a man, in his public office, should be obliged to 
do what, in his own private affairs, he would be ashamed 
of, I know not. Credit, or the reputation of integrity and 
good faith, is alike essential to the public as to an individual. 
The want of public credit I consider a greater calamity than 
the war itself; for, with the fair faith of 1775, and the paper 
currency established on its present funds, we could soon put 
an end to the war. Embarrassed as our affairs are at this 



280 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1781. 

time, yet, with money equal to one fourth part of the ex 
penses of the department for the current year, I would 
engage that the supplies and services expected from it 
should not fail, provided the iniquitous tender laws were 
immediately repealed, and such solemn public declarations 
made as should recover the lost confidence of the people, 
and induce them to believe that the promises made them 
should faithfully be performed. But, if some such measures 
are not speedily taken, or money furnished equal to the 
whole expenses of the department, the public business will 
essentially suffer; and, were I to continue in office, I could 
not be answerable for deficiencies. I cannot continue unless 
enabled to do substantial justice. 

" Diffident of my abilities, I ever supposed that an opinion 
of my integrity was a principal inducement to my election 
to the office I now hold, and, by discharging the duties of it 
with a certain degree of propriety, and acting uprightly, I 
hoped at least to be secured from censure. But, in the 
present state of things, this is impossible. A failure of 
supplies, or services, will incur blame ; yet such failures 
must frequently happen, as money is not furnished equal 
to a tenth, perhaps not a twentieth, part of the expenses 
of the department, nor is there public credit to supply its 
place. The public faith, so often shaken, ceases, in a great 
degree, under the present measures of government, to give 
security. I speak from information, not conjecture. 

" The uniform course of my walk in public life, I should 
hope, would exclude a suspicion that the fixing the value 
of my own salary was an object with me in my present 
application. Yet it is possible that, in the minds of gen 
tlemen to whom I am not known, that suspicion may arise. 
To such my professions to the contrary might be in vain ; 
I shall, therefore, waive them. But with sincerity I declare, 
that, honorable as my office is accounted, so great is its 
weight, and such difficulties attend the execution of it, I 
am willing to resign. A resignation would ease me of a 
load of anxiety by no means pleasant to bear. Or, if Con- 



Mi. 35.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 281 

gress are now of opinion, that the salary, which, in the 
midst of their embarrassments occasioned by the resigna 
tion of my predecessor, and the fulness of their approbation 
on my appointment, they were pleased to grant me, is too 
high if paid in solid coin or its just equivalent, I am con 
tent it should be reduced to any sum they shall now deem 
proper. 

" On revising this letter, I see that I have spoken my 
sentiments with freedom ; yet I hope without oifence. My 
words flowed from a strong conviction of the necessity 
of applying a radical remedy to the evils under which we 
groan, and which so deeply aifect me as a public officer. 
Could I have expressed myself coldly on a subject so inter 
esting, I must have been as insensible to my own honor as 
to the public good." 

Colonel Pickering wrote to his wife on the 9th of 
March, 1781:- 

" My affair is before Congress. It excited general atten 
tion, and is committed to a committee of the whole house.. 
I fear their decision will be too long in forming for me to 
stay here till it is made. If I discover a proper disposition 
in Congress to establish just principles, and seriously and 
diligently devise and pursue the measures which the public 
necessities require, I will return without waiting their de 
cision. That such is the disposition of a majority of the 
members, I doubt not; but there appears, at the same 
time, a degree of timidity which makes them cautious of 
going to the bottom of the business. vPut tis time to have 
done with patchwork. We have been nearly ruined by it 
already. Such fair principles must be established, and 
open, honest measures pursued, as shall recover the public 
credit, than which nothing is more wanted, nothing is more 
essential to the welfare of the United States. . . 7] I intend 
to leave this city the beginning of next week, if the pro 
ceedings of Congress will admit of it. But do not expect 
me too soon. Congress, like other large assemblies, are 

VOL. i. 36 



282 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1781. 

slow in business ; and the subject I have laid before them 
is of the first magnitude. It concerns, not my department 
only, but all others, and every individual in these States, 
namely, the management of our paper currency. I have 
the pleasure to inform you, my dear, (for you enjoy what 
ever gives me pleasure,) that some members expressed 
very great satisfaction with my letter, and were happy that 
I had started a subject on which, for the reasons I gave, it 
was evidently time to come to a fair and candid decision." 

The next day he wrote to her again : 

" Our friend Mr. Fooks . . . told me yesterday, that 
my application to Congress was spoken of in high terms of 
approbation by divers gentlemen in the city. If it produces 
the effects it naturally leads to, not my department only, 
but every other, and, indeed, every honest man in America, 
will feel the benefit of it. And, should the consequences be 
so extensively useful, my interference will be a source of 
satisfaction all my life long. Should my application fail of 
success, I shall regret it exceedingly ; because I think the 
public welfare involved therein. To convince my enemies 
(for some I believe I have, who are also enemies to justice) 
that my personal interest was not an object with me in 
endeavoring to fix the value of the salaries, I told Congress 
that, if they thought my present salary too high, they might 
reduce it to any sum they should now judge proper. Of 
these things you will say nothing at present; I mention 
them because I know they will give you pleasure ; for you 
will value what does me honor more than wealth." 

Congress resolved : * 

\ " That all debts now due from the United States, which 

have been liquidated in specie value, and all debts which 

i have been or shall be made payable in specie, or other 

* Journals, March 16th, 1781. See also Journals, May 22d. 



JET. 35.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 283 

1 

money equivalent, shall be actually paid, either in specie 
or other money equal thereto, according to the current 
exchange between such money and specie. 

" That it be, and hereby is, recommended to the several 
States to amend their laws making the bills of credit emit 
ted under the authority of Congress a legal tender, so that 
such bills shall not be a tender in any other manner than at 
their current value compared with gold and silver." 

The letter of March 2d to Mrs. Pickering, above 
cited, says: 

" The first salutation Mrs. Hastings gave me was, that I 
was coming to live here again. You know there was a new 
plan formed, abolishing the Board of War, and proposing 
a single Minister of War in their stead.* It seems I was 
in nomination for this new office. General Sullivan and 
Mr. Peters were my competitors. Colonel Miles saw me 
as I arrived, and gave me a hint of the matter; which sur 
prised me nearly as much as when Mr. S. [Sherman] called 
me up to tell me I was nominated to be Quartermaster- 
General. But you need say nothing of this affair." 

A letter of an earlier date (February 15th) had been 
written by his friend Samuel Hodgdon, but had not 
been received, in which Mr. Hodgdon says : 

" Permit me to arrest your attention for a moment on 
a subject which, as an American, I feel interested in. I 
mean, the choice of a suitable person to superintend the 
War Department. This and the other similar appoint 
ments for the other branches engross the whole of con 
versation in every circle. On this occasion the virtuous 
citizens feel and lament the want of men qualified for these 
important trusts, as they are convinced nothing is wanting 
to bring in and support an army in the field, sufficient to

284 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1781. 

destroy every hostile attempt of our enemies on the peace 
and happiness of America, but men of integrity and knowl 
edge in war, to preside at the head of their affairs. In this 
situation they have again cast their eyes on you. Whether 
their representatives will gratify their wishes, by making 
choice of you as Minister or Secretary at War, time alone 
can determine. I have myself, in free conversations with 
some of the gentlemen belonging to Congress, mentioned 
the matter, and have always received for answer, &lt; What 
shall we do for a Quartermaster-General? In reply, I 
have demanded whether a man s merit ought to prevent 
his promotion. Upon the whole, were you present on the 
spot, I have reason to think you would once more expe 
rience a unanimous choice to the office in question ; and 
you will do me the justice to acquit me of a design to flatter, 
when I tell you that this is mine and every other man s wish 
that I have heard speak upon the subject. Your own good 
sense and delicacy will enable you to act right on the occa 
sion. General Sullivan and Mr. Peters are also on the 
nomination, and both, I am informed, very desirous to 
obtain the appointment ; * but, as Mr. Lovell has prom 
ised me to write you by this conveyance, on the subject, I 
add no more." 

While he was in Philadelphia, Colonel Pickering was 
much annoyed by the information in a letter from 
Mrs. Pickering, dated Newburgh, March 7th, 1781 : 

* General Sullivan, in a letter to General Washington, March 6th, 1781, 
says : " I was nominated against my will, and, if chosen, should not have ac 
cepted." Sparks s " Correspondence of the Revolution" Vol. III. p. 253. 
Mr. Peters, in reference to a Report before Congress in favor of establishing the 
office, wrote to Colonel Pickering, January 16th, 1781 : "I doubt whether I 
shall have anything to do with the matter ; nor do I wish to undertake so ardu 
ous a charge. ... I have neither vanity nor ambition to be gratified in this 
way." With his ability and industry, and his experience in the War Office, 
it can hardly be doubted that the department, had it been confided to him, 
would have been satisfactorily administered. The election of the Secretary 
of War was postponed until October, when General Lincoln was chosen, and 
on a salary of four thousand dollars. Journals, October 1st and 30th, 1781. 



Mi. 35.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKEEING. 285 

"The weather has been very unpleasant for this week 
past, and unfortunately we have had no wood for these five 
days but what we have borrowed, and of that but a scant 
supply. Our credit in that way begins to run low now. I 
know not from what cause it proceeds ; I believe no great 
exertion is made to procure any wood." 

He replied, on the 13th: 

" I cannot express in terms sufficiently strong my grief 
and indignation at your late sufferings and the cause of 
them. The information came to hand last evening, and 
kept me awake half the night. I am to the last degree 
impatient to return. . . . 

"P. S. My mind is so much agitated, I can scarcely attend 
to business. Congress have made such progress on the sub 
ject of my letter, that I hope earnestly two or three days 
will so ripen their measures as to enable me to return." 

On the 20th of March, 1781, he wrote to Mrs. Picker 
ing: 

"Congress have at last come to such conclusions as I 
desired respecting specie salaries and certificates, and have 
recommended a repeal of the iniquitous tender laws. . . . 
I know at present of nothing to detain me here beyond to 
morrow night, provided Congress, in the interim, can hold 
up any prospect of furnishing money for enabling me to 
procure the great supplies necessary for the next campaign ; 
but I shall not wait for their grants. 

"This will be delivered to you by my worthy friend, 
Colonel Harrison, who is going to head-quarters, though 
not to stay any longer with the army. He is appointed a 
judge of the Supreme Court in Maryland, a place of honor, 
and with a salary adequate to his support. He, like me, is, 
above all things, fond of domestic life, and, after devoting 
so many years of his life to the public in the field, embraces 
with joy this opportunity of retiring. For your sake, my 
dearest, as well as my own, I most earnestly hope that this 



286 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1781. 

year may relieve me from the busy, bustling scenes of war, 
and that such means of supporting a family may present 
as shall never more require our separation." 

Before leaving Philadelphia, he wrote two long letters 
(dated March 21st and 24th) to the President of Con 
gress, in which he represented the necessity of allowing 
to some of the officers in his department forage and 
rations, and an increase of compensation beyond the 
pay fixed by the late regulations of the department. 
He also argued that several offices, including those of 
the Assistant Quartermaster-General, the Commissary of 
Purchases, and the issuing Commissaries at posts, might 
well be abolished. Some officers he had already dis 
charged, as being unnecessary. 

He suggested the abolition of the regiment of arti 
ficers, whose pay he estimated at six thousand eight 
hundred and fifty-three dollars and one third a month, 
and the employment of a director of artificers, four 
master workmen, four foremen, and one hundred jour 
neymen, who would do as much (and beyond com 
parison better) work as the regiment, and whose pay 
would amount to only three thousand four hundred and 
twenty dollars a month.* He says : 

"That I have interested views in the reformation here 

proposed, I will not deny. The saving to the public in such 

immense sums as an adoption of these or similar measures 

would produce, would be a source of pleasing reflection to 

I me during life. But I hope it will not be deemed unlawful 



* General Washington wrote to Colonel Pickering, January 1st, 1781 : "In 
general, though they [the corps of artificers] receive high wages, as far as they 
have come under my observation they appear to work little, and the officers 
to have forgotten the end of their appointment, and to have assumed the 
appearances and pretensions of officers of the line, instead of accommodating 
themselves to the spirit of their stations." 



MT. 35.] LltfE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 287 

1 

to derive from them another advantage. A small portion 
of the moneys so saved, distributed among some of the 
officers in my department so as to accommodate their pay 
and allowances to circumstances, to the importance of their 
offices, and the quantity of business they transact, would 
retain them in the public service, would give them content, 
and relieve me from the trouble and anxiety which their 
quitting the service would occasion." 

Mr. Hodgdon wrote to Colonel Pickering from Phila 
delphia, on the 16th of April: 

"Nothing further, that I can learn, has been done with 
any of your matters since you left this ; only I was informed 

by General that his Excellency did not approve of 

your plan, and that he never thought he would." 

In reply (April 22d), Colonel Pickering said : 

"As to the rejection of the plan, it is rather a relief than 

a matter of regret to me. General , I suppose, plumes 

himself on the event. He is welcome. I would rather re 
joice when the public interest was evidently promoted. I 
thought (such was my weakness) that two hundred thousand 
hard dollars per annum were worth saving. I declared (and 
with sincerity) that I did not want to be the executor ; but 
is there no man in the United States whose abilities can 
comprehend and execute the plans proposed, in addition to 
the duties of the Quartermaster s department? And why 
can t he be appointed? If the half of that sum can be 
saved by him to the public, I will not stand in his way a 
moment." 

The Board of War approved of many of Colonel 
Pickering s recommendations ; but it does not appear 
by the Journals, that Congress acted in express refer 
ence to them. The artificers, however, were reduced) 



288 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1781. 

r 

to one company for the main army, one for the south 
ern army,* and one at Carlisle ; and on the resignation 
of Charles Petti t, Assistant Quartermaster-General, his 
[^office was abolished.^ 

In another letter (March 30th) to the President of 
Congress, Colonel Pickering represented, at much length 
and in strong terms, the distresses of his department 
for want of money ; that the credit of the United States 
was at the lowest ebb; and that, unless he were furnished 
with money, public business would either cease alto 
gether, or, where partially continued, it would be with 
the greatest difficulty and disadvantage. Towards the 
end of the letter he gives the reasons of his having 
remained so long in Philadelphia, saying : 

"To this long letter I beg leave only to add, that I have 
continued here with an expectation that my information 
might be of some use in framing those economical arrange 
ments which I have had the honor to lay before Congress ; 
to obtain those additional allowances for some officers in my 
department which their services and stations require ; to 
propose those amendments in the systems already estab 
lished, and those additional provisions, which are herein 
suggested ; and, above all, to procure money for the pur 
pose mentioned in my estimates for a part of the services of 
the ensuing campaign. But, in regard to the latter, I must 
return hopeless. The Board of Treasury, to whom it was 
referred to find the way and means of supplying the money 
demanded, have not the least prospect of furnishing a single 
shilling. Of consequence, no material provision can be 
made of the articles necessary to enable the army to take 
the field. Many of them require time in preparing; but

The following cogent extract on the same topic is 
from a letter of the 21st of April, 1781, to the President 
of Congress, written after Colonel Pickering s return 
to Newburgh : 

" I do not mean to be continually wounding the ears of fi- 
Congress with tales of public poverty and distress. These 
already are but too well known ; and till there is some pros 
pect of relief I shall not think it necessary to repeat them. 
Permit me, Sir, only to say, once for all, that, if camp 
equipage, forage, and other supplies in my department shall 
fail ; if transportation shall cease ; if the necessary officers, 
artificers, watermen, and laborers shall abandon the ser 
vice ; in a word, if the business of the department shall 
absolutely stop, the blame, I hope, will not be thrown on 
me. If any other man can, without money, carry on the 
extensive business of this department, I wish most sincerely 
he would take my place. I confess myself incapable of 
doing it." 

Having, in a letter of the 8th of May, 1781, to 
Mr. Hodgdon, mentioned great losses sustained by his 
brothers-in-law, Gardner and Williams, by the capture 
of their ships at St. Eustatia, by Admiral Rodney, he 
adds, in the spirit of the period : 

" These misfortunes affect me not only as a brother, but 
as a borrower of money. I depended on Mr. Williams for 
a supply of cash on every occasion. I shall decline drawing 
on him in future, and must, therefore, mortgage or sell a 
piece of land for my support. However, I remember the 
time when I would cheerfully have parted with one half or 
the whole of my little patrimony, for ever, to have put an 
end to the war, and to establish our liberties. I can still 
do it without murmuring, if it be necessary."

It seems, from the following letter to Mr. Hodgdon, 
that Colonel Pickering had enemies desirous of having 
him removed from his office ; but who they were, and 
what were the grounds of discontent, are not mentioned. 
The abolition proposed by him of certain offices was 
not agreeable to some of the incumbents ; and it may 
be presumed that due allowance was not made by 
others for the impossibility of performing the duties of 
Quartermaster-General satisfactorily without money. 

" NEWBURGH, May 22d, 1781. 

"All things and circumstances considered, I conclude to 
give up all thoughts of buying Colonel Flower s mare. 
Before she would be of use I may be a private man. I am 
well satisfied the efforts of some persons will not be wanting 
to effect it. But I defy their malice as much as I detest 
their principles ; not because I think they cannot succeed, 
but because their success would not mortify me. Con 
scious of upright, and diligent, and even laborious endeavors 
to perform the duties of my office, they cannot hurt me, 
though I should be removed from office. I sometimes think 
that the day is fast approaching when t the post of honor 
will be a private station. Rank and office I can quit with 
out a sigh. With pleasure I should handle the peaceful 
instruments of husbandry ; for / can dig, though I am 
ashamed to beg. I believe I am neither vain nor envious ; 
but I think too highly of the dignity of human nature, of 
the equal rights of all mankind, or, if you please, I have 
too much pride, to worship at the shrine of any individual, 
or collection, of my fellow-mortals. But this unaccommo 
dating disposition may create me enemies who will attempt 
my ruin ; but, as I said before, they cannot hurt me. The 
tenor of your letter, with the complexion of one or two 
lately received from another quarter, have given rise to 
these reflections. But I have done. ... I thank you for 
the information respecting the bequest of my deceased

friend.* It is a handsome one, and given in terms that 
cannot fail to please." 

Mr. Hodgdon informed Colonel Pickering that a 
negro girl, about thirteen years old, had been brought 
into Philadelphia in a prize vessel, and would probably 
be sold ; and he inquired whether Mrs. Pickering would 
not like to have her as a servant. Colonel Pickering s 
dislike of slavery is shown in his answer, dated June 
13th, 1781: 

" My wife would be well pleased with the services of the 
negro girl, if she is a good one. Her moving condition 
renders it difficult to get help, and therefore one bound to 
her, or one of the family, always to go with her, will be 
convenient ; but we will never have a slave. ... As a 
servant for years, we should not object ; but you will prob 
ably be directed to sell her for the most she will fetch. If, 
however, the owners were to consent to let us have her for 
five, six, or seven years, at a reasonable price, the girl then 
to be free, we shall be willing and glad to have her, pro 
vided she manifests a good disposition." 

* Colonel Benjamin Flower, Commissary-General of Military Stores. Writ 
ing to Mr. Hodgdon, the deputy of Colonel Flower, under date of Newburgh, 
May 5th, Colonel Pickering says : " Mr. [Samuel] Adams called here to 
day ; he informs me that our friend Colonel Flower is at length relieved from 
the miseries of life. Considering his situation, this event must rather yield 
comfort than distress to the surviving friends who saw the anguish of his 
wasting disease. I assure myself you will have no competitor for the succes 
sion. I wish you success in every undertaking, for I know you will deserve it." 

The bequest was as follows : "I give unto my beloved and much respected 
friend, Colonel Timothy Pickering, as a small testimony of the great esteem I 
bear for him, my brace of elegant pistols, made by Joseph Perkins, my cara 
bine, taken trophy at the engagement of Princeton, my small sword, with a 
leathern scabbard, and my saddle and bridle." Colonel Flower was grateful 
for the interposition of Colonel Pickering and Mr. Peters on his behalf, which 
led to the misunderstanding between them and Congress. See page 219 et seq.

CHAPTER XIX. 

Skirmish between General Lincoln and British Troops. Junction 
of the French and the American Armies. Attempt to capture 
Cornwallis resolved on. March of the Army to Yorktown. 
Baltimore. Mount Vernon. Williamsburg. Lord Bote- 
tourt. Virginia Ideas. Agriculture of Virginia. Cornwal- 
lis s Forces, and his Proceedings. 

IN the early part of the campaign of 1781, it was 
the intention of General Washington to lay siege to 
the city of New York; but, in consequence of the 
failure of cooperation on the part of the French fleet, 
he gave up the project, and resolved upon attempting 
the capture of Cornwallis. The part borne by Colonel 
Pickering, and the incidents affecting him, during the 
campaign, are shown, in some measure, by a short 
journal kept by him, and by some of his letters, from 
which the following extracts are taken : 

Journal. " June 27th. Joined the army encamped at 
Peekskill. 

" July 2d. The army marched to Tanytown. At sun 
down pursued their march, and early the morning of the 
3d reached Valentine s Hill. General Lincoln with his 
command, who, the night of the 2d, had gone down the 
river with a view of taking some of the enemy s works, and 
making a lodgement on York Island, was disappointed.* 
But, landing about Phillips s, they accidentally fell in with 
a party of yagers, who, supported by other troops from 
York Island, maintained a severe skirmish with General 

* See Sparks s " Writings of Washington," Vol. VIII. pp. 97, 98. 



MT. 36.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 293 

Lincoln, with a large and very disproportionate loss to the 
latter. The combatants seem to have parted by consent ; 
or, rather, General Lincoln retreated, and the enemy did 
not pursue.* General Washington, with others, reconnoi 
tred at a distance the enemy s works at the north end of 
York Island, and then the troops retired, and lay on their 
arms the night of the 3d, at Valentine s Hill. 

4th. The army marched up on the east side of Saw 
mill River, and formed an encampment on the first hills 
eastward of it, the road from Dobbs s Ferry (from which 
we were distant about two miles and a half) to White 
Plains running between the front and rear lines. 

" 5th. The French army from Rhode Island arrived, 
and formed their camp on the left of the American camp. 

" In this position the two armies lay until the 19th of 
August, in the mean time all preparations going on for the 
siege of New York. 

"August 15th. But about the 15th a packet arrived, 
informing that Count de Grasse, who commanded the 
French fleet in the West Indies, intended to sail for the 
Chesapeake, and not for New York. The design against 
New York thus failing, the General communicated to me 
his intentions to march with a part of the army to Virginia, 
to attempt the capture of Comwallis, the destination of the 
French fleet rendering that the only enterprise of moment 
that could then be undertaken." 

In a published letter f to Governor Sullivan of April 
22d ? 1808, Colonel Pickering says: 

* In a letter to his wife, dated " Camp, July 6th, 1781," Colonel Pickering 
says: "General Lincoln commanded a detachment which was attacked by 
the enemy, and overpowered by superior numbers. Our loss is not yet ascer 
tained ; about forty wounded were brought off. . . . We are now encamped 
about a dozen miles from the enemy, at Kingsbridge. To-day the French 
army joined us." 

On the 14th he desires her to send him a barrel or two of cider, for his use 
at camp, accompanying his request with the remark, "The French are 
fond of cider, but hate grog."

294 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1781. 

" The project of besieging the city of New York, in 1781, 
having been relinquished, and the siege of Yorktown, in 
Virginia, resolved on, I received General Washington s 
orders to prepare immediately for the march of a part of 
the army to that place, and for the transportation of artil 
lery, and of all the stores requisite for the siege. This 
was done." 

Journal. "August 19th. The removal of the stores 
of the American and French armies being effected, the 
two camps were this day broken up, and the two armies 
marched for King s Ferry. General Heath only remained, 
with the residue of the N. H., M., and C. [New Hampshire, 
Massachusetts, and Connecticut] lines about two days, when 
he marched and encamped at Peekskill.* 

" 20th, Monday. This morning the detachments from 
the American army reached King s Ferry, and began to 
cross ; and such despatch was used that day, the following 
night, and Tuesday morning, that the baggage, park, and 
American troops had crossed by noon of the 21st. It was 
the 27th before the whole of the French army, their artil 
lery and baggage, had crossed, f

" 30th. Rode from Brunswick Lauding to Philadelphia, 
sixty miles." 

He wrote to Mrs. Pickering, from Philadelphia, Sep 
tember 7th : 

" I am just on the point of setting out for Virginia. The 
fairest prospects present of complete success. Besides the

great superiority in ships to the British, the French have 
landed upwards of three thousand men southward of Corn- 
wallis, to prevent his escape into Carolina." 

Journal. " September 7th. At sunset left Philadel 
phia, and the next day arrived at the Head of Elk. That 
morning the Commander-in-Chief had left Elk and pursued 
his journey to Virginia." 

From the Head of Elk, Colonel Pickering wrote, on 
the 9th of September, to his wife : 

"Here I am, my dearest, in perfect health. Presently I set 
out for Williamsburg by land. It will be a seven or eight 
days journey, and give me an opportunity of seeing Mary 
land and Virginia. I hope, in a little time, to congratulate 
you on the capture of Cornwallis and his army. Should 
we succeed at all, the work, I think, will be short; and the 
only chance of ill success will arise from this, that Corn 
wallis may possibly attempt to save himself by flight, by 
marching his army up the country, and then pushing ta 
South Carolina. But a few days delay will render this 
impossible, as our troops will soon surround him." 

Journal. "September 9th. I proceeded for Williams- 
burg, where I arrived the 16th. 

" From the Susquehanna to Baltimore, the country in 
general presents you with nothing very agreeable. The 
soil is for the most part ordinary. Baltimore is a pretty 
town; the houses are of brick, and well built. Tis well 
situated for trade, at the head of the Bay of Chesapeake, 
and has depth of water sufficient for vessels of as great 
burden as are generally used in the merchants service. 
The town contains perhaps six hundred dwelling-houses. 

" Georgetown, on the north side of the Potomac, is about 
forty-five miles from Baltimore, contains about eighty or a 
hundred houses, and is well situated for trade. Tis said 
to be two hundred miles from the mouth of the river. Two 



296 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1781. 

or three miles above Georgetown are falls in the river, 
which put an end to the navigation from the bay. But the 
Potomac extends far into a rich country above, and must 
greatly facilitate, at certain seasons, the transportation of 
its produce to market. 

"Eight miles below Georgetown, and on the opposite 
side of the river, stands the town of Alexandria, in 
Virginia; for the Potomac is the boundary between this 
State and Maryland. This town is more than twice as 
large as Georgetown, and, before the war, was rapidly 
increasing, the course of trade being turned to it ; which, 
at the same time, prevented or checked the growth of 
Georgetown. At this place the Potomac is about a quar 
ter or a third of a mile wide, and will admit vessels of five 
hundred tons burden. At Alexandria tis of double that 
width, and deeper. 

"Ten miles below Alexandria is Mount Vernon, the seat 
of General Washington. It is on an elevated bank of the 
Potomac, where the river winds agreeably, and from whence 
you have a fine and extensive prospect of the country, as 
well in Maryland as Virginia. The house, it seems, was 
an old one, to which many additions have been made, and, 
like other patchwork, exhibits nothing striking. 

" Colchester and Dumfries (the first, twenty, the other, 
thirty miles from Alexandria) are small villages, situated 
on creeks that run into the Potomac, from which they are 
only a few miles distant. Dumfries was said to be one of 
the capital landings for tobacco. Vessels can come up only 
to the mouth of the creek, to which the tobacco must be 
carried in scows four or five miles from the lauding. Of 
late years (before the war) considerable quantities of wheat 
were brought from the country back, and exported from 
Dumfries. 

" Fredericksburg is a pleasant town, and agreeably situ 
ated on the southern side of the Kappahannock, which is 
there perhaps three hundred and fifty yards wide. Vessels 
of a hundred or a hundred and fifty tons may come to load 



JET. 36.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 297 

at this great tobacco landing. Tis fifty-five miles from 
Alexandria, and about a hundred and ten from Williams- 
burg. It contains as many, or more, houses than Alex 
andria. 

"About fifty miles from Fredericksburg you cross the 
northern branch (called Matapony) of York River ; and 
about twenty- four miles farther on, you cross the southern 
branch (which is four times as large as the other), called 
Pamunkey, at a place called Rufim s Ferry. Travelling 
from hence thirty-six miles, you arrive at Williamsburg. 
This is a pleasant town, situated about midway between York 
and James Rivers. A creek, or creeks, from both come up 
near the town ; one within a mile, where craft drawing five 
or six feet of water may unload. It has one very spacious 
street, said to be a mile in length. At the extremities, and 
bounding the view, are two large buildings, which have a 
grand and elegant appearance ; at the west end, the college, 
at the other, the Capitol, or State House. About the centre 
of this street, but retired perhaps two hundred yards, with a 
large court in front, stands the palace, the residence of their 
Governor. It is two stories high, and has a decent appear 
ance outside, but nothing magnificent. The rooms were 
finished in a rich and costly manner ; but, since the war, they 
are wholly defaced. In the centre of the Capitol, and encir 
cled by iron pales, stands the grand marble statue of Lord 
Botetourt, the last but one of their Royal Governors. He 
stands in a graceful posture of address, with his left hand 
at his side, holding his coronet under his arm, and in the 
other hand, with the arm a little extended, a roll of parch 
ment. His countenance seems marked with sixty years. 
He was almost adored by the Virginians, who still speak in 
raptures of his virtues and his elegant and engaging man 
ners. 

" In a building near the palace are to be seen the remains 
of the richly-ornamented state coach , which was brought 
over with Lord Botetourt, and once used by him to carry 
him from the palace to the Capitol. Tis a clumsy machine, 

VOL. i. 38 



298 LITE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1781. 

and enormously heavy, perhaps equal to two common 
wagons. It is gilded in every part, even the edges of the 
tires of the wheels. The arms of Virginia are painted on 
every side. The motto of the arms led me to remark how 
peculiarly disposed the Virginians have been to adopt ideas 
of royalty and magnificence. For instance, the residence 
of their Governors was not a * Province House? but a Pal 
ace ; the building in which the General Assembly met was 
not even a State House, but t tlie Capitol? But the motto 
of their arms reminded me of the style of dominion assumed 
by Eastern rnonarchs, who, among other titles of magnifi 
cence, call themselves Lords of the whole earth/ The 
motto is, En dat Virginia quartam, that is, * Virginia 
gives a fourth quarter to the world. 

"On the whole road from Alexandria to Williamsburg, 
the country is so generally level, and presents so uniformly 
woods (a large proportion pitch-pine), corn and tobacco 
fields, (the prospect being ever bounded by very short lim 
its,) that the eye is tired with the sameness of the scene. 
Every field almost is skirted with woods, so that your view 
seldom exceeds a mile in extent ; and for a large proportion 
of the way you can see but a few rods on either hand, as 
the road is lined with thick woods. 

" The surface of the ground is generally sandy ; but you 
very commonly find clay beneath the soil, at the depth of 
one or two feet or more ; and this clay, if by deep plough 
ing, or otherwise, it were mingled with the sandy surface, 
I should suppose would furnish a perpetual supply of 
manure. 

" The great articles of culture in Virginia are Indian corn 
and tobacco. They also raise considerable quantities of 
excellent wheat ; and every plantation yields some cotton, 
which is of a fine texture, and whiter, though shorter, than 
the West India cotton. The soil is admirably adapted to 
the culture of lucern, and they have many low grounds 
fitted to the production of timothy ; but neither of these 



MT. 36.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 299 

grasses is generally cultivated ; and southward of the 
Rappahannock you meet with no other long forage than 
[Indian] corn blades and tops." * 

* At the end of the journal are a few memorandums on the ordinary prod 
uce of lands in the lower parts of Virginia. In regard to cotton, Colonel 
Pickering says : 

" A light, mellow soil, pretty rich, will produce [per acre] two thousand 
pounds of cotton, which, when ginned (by which process the seeds are taken 
out), will yield five hundred pounds of clean cotton; which, before the war, 
sold for a pistareen [twenty cents] a pound. 

" Cotton seeds are commonly planted about the middle of April. When 
the stalks are about eighteen inches high, they nip off the tops, to make the 
larger pods, and to ripen them the sooner. The branches from the stalks are 
likewise to be nipped, and all suckers broken off. Most plant the cotton in 
hills, but Mr. Holt says it is better in drills, and commonly two feet apart; 
but it would doubtless be still better to sow it three or four feet apart, to 
admit the hoe-plough."

Investment of Yorktown. Progress of the Siege. Surrender of 
Cornwallis. Colonel Scammell mortally wounded. Postage 
on the Quartermaster-General s Letters. Plunder of surrendered 
Tents and Stores. Storekeepers in Yorktown and Glouces

Expensiveness of Living in Philadelphia. 

THE letters and journal of Colonel Pickering contain 
accounts of further proceedings and incidents con 
nected with the siege of Yorktown. 

He wrote from Williamsburg, September 21st, 1781, 
to Samuel Hodgdon : 

" The departure of the French fleet, in pursuit of the 
British, induced the General (then on his way to Williams- 
burg) to direct the troops to stay at Annapolis till he should 
hear further relative to the two fleets. That of the French 
having soon returned, and with it that from Rhode Island, 
the troops were ordered down. Yesterday the first division 
arrived in James River, and the whole are expected to-day, 
the wind being northerly. The unavoidable delay in getting 
forward our troops and stores has given Cornwallis time to 
strengthen himself by many works ; but they are not im 
pregnable. In a day or two, I suppose, we shall move 
down to York and commence the siege. By the last of 
October I hope to congratulate you on the enemy s sur 
render. Cornwallis, however, will doubtless make an obsti 
nate defence. Though his talents are moderate, he is known 
to be brave and persevering. He is said to have a hundred 
sail of vessels at York. From these he has probably re 
ceived a reinforcement of a thousand men, at least. The 



MT. 36.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 301 

guns of the ships of war he is mounting on his batteries. 
His whole force may amount to six thousand men,* of 
whom four thousand five hundred are supposed to be regu 
lar troops. He had, perhaps, two thousand negroes, with 
whose labor, chiefly, he has raised his works. By hard fare 
and severities these wretches have suffered exceedingly ; 
many have perished, and many are coming off. Those that 
are become unfit for labor, the enemy doubtless wish to get 
rid of. Their toils have saved his regular troops fresh for 
the siege. 

" It is Cornwallis s duty to make the best defence in his 
power ; but it is said some of his officers have been heard 
to say they l expect (to use their own words) &lt; to be Bur- 
goyned. Indeed I see scarcely a possibility of their 
escaping. The weather here is fine often till Christmas; 
and there is little probability of a British naval force supe 
rior to that of the French, now consisting of thirty-six sail 
of the line. I shall be disappointed if Cornwallis stands a 
siege of six weeks. Our whole regular force, when collected, 
will amount to fifteen thousand men. If Cornwallis resists 
so long such a superiority, in works suddenly raised of 
earth, he will deserve great credit. 

"At present we want nothing but horses and wagons. 
Those which came on from the northward, I expect, will 
arrive here in five or six days. In the mean time, we shall 
muster so many as will enable us to move to invest the 
enemy. . . . 

"P. S. Remember, I write you nothing now, nor shall I 
hereafter, for publication, but merely for the information of 
yourself and a few friends. If I should have no objection 
to your publishing any intelligence in future, I will tell you 
so. September 24th. The first division did not land 
entirely till yesterday. The second is expected to-day. 
Nothing new, except that a vessel, with three British officers 
from Charleston, ran into the French fleet and was taken.

Journal. " September 28th. The allied army marched 
from Williamsburg to the vicinity of York. The French 
took their position on the left. 

" September 29th. The American army marched over 
a bridge, and took a position extending from the morass, 
which separated us from the French army, to beyond the 
Hampton road from York. 

" September 30th. Colonel Scammell, in reconnoitring, 
was wounded and taken prisoner. He was barbarously 
wounded. . . . The enemy in York treated him kindly 
afterwards, particularly the surgeons. He was suffered to 
go to Williamsburg on parole." 

In a letter to his wife, dated " Camp before York- 
town, October 1st," he wrote : 

"The enemy have abandoned some of their outworks, 
which will probably, in some degree, shorten the siege." * 

Journal. " October 7th. The enemy fired frequently ;

not of a house burning in York, but the British frigate 
Charon, in the river. She was of fifty guns, and was set on 
fire by red-hot shot thrown from a battery of the Marquis 
St. Simon s. She had been previously stripped by the 
enemy, who had mounted her cannon on the batteries in 
town. 

" The firing from all our batteries continued during this 
day. In the evening a second parallel was begun and 
completed during the night, without annoyance from the 
enemy. 

" October 12th. The cannonade and bombardment con 
tinued. 13th. The same." 

Colonel Pickering wrote to Mrs. Pickering on the 
llth of October : 

" It may give you some pleasure to be informed of the pro 
ceedings of the allied army, especially as the present object 
of their attention is important, and generally interesting, 
so that the event of this expedition may capitally aifect our 
negotiations for peace. September 28th, the armies marched 
to the vicinity of York ; and then, and on the 29th, invested 
the place. . . . We have had very few men killed ; and 
not one officer, as I recollect, has been hurt, excepting Colo 
nel Scammell, who was unfortunately wounded and taken 
prisoner the 30th of September, while reconnoitring a work 
the enemy had abandoned. It was barbarously done ; for, 
after two dragoons had him their prisoner, a third came up 
and shot him through the side. Of this wound he died the 
6th instant, at Williamsburg, lamented by all who knew 
him, and who valued friendship, integrity, and truth. The 
French have had an officer or two badly wounded." 

The larger part of the preceding letter is omitted, 
many of the facts therein mentioned being more fully 
stated in the following extracts from a letter to Samuel 
Hodgdon, dated the llth of October, nine o clock in

the evening. This letter is written in the form of a 
journal. 

" October 6th. Until this day the armies were occupied 
in debarking and getting up their stores and cannon from 
James River, at landings six or seven miles distant from our 
camp, in opening communications through a morass, 
and in making fascines, saucissons, pickets, and gabions. 
In the evening of this day the trenches were opened, and 
by morning the first parallel was in great forwardness, and 
two redoubts begun.* It was fortunately cloudy, and it 
rained gently ; otherwise the moon (just passed the full) 
might have proved very injurious, by discovering us to the 
enemy. Not a man was hurt during the night. 

" October 9th. By this time our first parallel, with two 
redoubts, were nearly complete, and two batteries erected 
by the American army. 

"October 10th. This morning our two batteries were 
opened. The French army opened two more, besides one 
on their left near York River. The whole have continued 
firing shot and shells to this moment (October llth), and 
the noise of the cannon and mortars is now sounding in 
my ears. 

"Yesterday, Secretary Nelson came out of York. He 
was put under no restraint by the enemy. He says our 
shells had great effect. The enemy retired for shelter under 
the bank of the river, but the shells annoyed them there. 
He said a boat had arrived from New York with two Majors 
on board, who said a British fleet of thirty sail would come 
to relieve Cornwallis in seven days. It seems that Corn- 
wallis s army depend on this ; which, by the way, is a con 
fession they have no alternative for safety, and, that failing, 
that they must fall. I conceive it to be in the power of the 
Count de Grasse to disappoint their hopes ; and yet I con 
fess I am a little afraid that at least some relief may be thrown 
in, of stores if not of troops ; for in a case so important the

Mi. 36.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 305 

British will run great hazards ; and they may hope that a 
prolongation of the siege may oblige us to raise it. How 
ever, eventually, I cannot but look for complete success. 

"Last evening, the Charon, of fifty guns (said to be set 
on fire by hot shot from a French battery), and another 
vessel, were burnt between York and Gloucester, and this 
morning a third. Cornwallis has now only one frigate (the 
Guadaloupe) left for his principal naval force. The Charon 
had been dismantled to furnish cannon and stores for the 
enemy s batteries. 

" Knox damns the Pennsylvania shells, as not being well 
cast, varying greatly in weight, and especially for not being 
proved. As a proof of the latter, they observed that the 
cores have not been well cleaned out ; so that, if they in fact 
passed a proof, it is not a full evidence that they are sound, 
as any holes might be stopped up by the remains of the 
cores. He and Bowman [Bauman ?] say, Faesch s are per 
fect. Bowman proved them. 

"I observed to you, that the batteries had continued firing 
from the time they were first opened to this moment (say 
forty hours), and the artillery gentlemen suppose, with 
great effect. But though I am ready to acknowledge their 
abilities, yet I do not imagine they can work miracles. We 
know what has, in times past, been the effect of British 
cannon against our earthen defences, and I cannot think 
ours to be essentially different. At the present distance of 
our batteries (say five hundred yards), they might fire till 
Christmas without materially lessening the enemy s force. 
The shells, falling in a variety of places, are doubtless 
troublesome, and do some mischief. I am impatient to get 
nearer to the enemy, that our work may be more speedily 
accomplished, and our ammunition not thrown away. Corn 
wallis prudently reserves his till that time. He scarcely 
answers one shot in fifty. 

"This night, I expect, our approaches commence. The 
engineers chose to complete our first parallel, with the re 
doubts and batteries, that we might be perfectly secure from 

VOL. I. 39 



306 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1781. 

the enemy s sallies, however vigorous, before they began a 
second. This is doubtless right ; but I think we might have 
dug with more advantage than we have fired these two days 
past, during which very little work has been done. But I 
do not pretend to be a competent judge, as I am neither an 
artillerist nor an engineer. Yet, after eight or ten hours 
firing of our batteries, looking with a glass, I could discern 
no injury done to the enemy s works. They were induced to 
fill up the embrasure in one work, and to draw their cannon 
behind the merlons in another; for, as I told you above, 
they did not return our fire.* 

" Three quarters past nine. The firing continues frequent. 
It may be useful now, if our workmen are making their 
approaches. But I shall hear the firing with more pleasure 
when our cannon are mounted on the batteries which shall 
be erected beyond the next parallel." 

An inadvertence, probably, on the part of Congress, 
which was mortifying to Colonel Pickering, and which 
might have proved injurious to the public service, is 
disclosed in the following letter to the President, dated 
Camp before York, October llth " : 

"Two or three days since, I had the mortification to be 
refused the letters in the post-office addressed to rue, unless I 
paid the postage. Before that time the postmaster had con 
tented himself with charging me with the postage of letters. 
Those above referred to were all on public business, and I 
wished to take them up ; but the want of money obliged me 
to leave them in the office, where they still remain. 

"I entreat the attention of Congress on this subject. 
Certain officers of the army receive their letters free from 
postage. The letters of the principal staff must generally 
be at least as necessary and important ; I cannot even con 
jecture one tolerable reason for the distinction. Nor can I 
discern any public advantage in the regulation obliging the

latter to pay for public letters. There may, however, be 
very good reasons for it ; and I should not attempt to con 
trovert it, were I furnished with the means of complying 
with it. But, as the matter now stands, I must either obtain 
my letters by the post, without payment, or, if this be in 
admissible, I shall be obliged to direct all my deputies to 
cease sending me any papers by the post, and to suspend 
their communications till other conveyances present." 

This letter was read in Congress on the 22d of 
October, and it was thereupon " Resolved, That letters 
to and from the Quartermaster-General be carried free 
of postage." * 



Journal. " October 14th. In the evening the American 
light infantry stormed and took the enemy s left redoubt on 
the bank of the river. The French grenadiers took their 
next advanced redoubt. The former s loss, about thirty-six 
non-commissioned officers and privates killed and wounded, 
and five or six officers wounded. The French lost about a 
hundred troops killed and wounded. This night communi 
cations were opened by trenches from the first parallel.

to surrender.

On the 17th Colonel Pickering wrote to his wife : 

" On this memorable day, in 1777, Burgoyne surrendered. 
On this present day, Lord Cornwallis has proposed a sur 
render. A suspension of hostilities has, in consequence, 
taken place. The negotiation is not yet settled, nor do I

know the terms proposed. This event is unexpected, and 
can be accounted for only on supposition that the enemy 
want provisions or warlike stores, for their works would 
admit of yet many days defence; though, on the 14th, in 
the evening, we took two of their most detached redoubts, 
which gave us great advantage, and at once brought our 
batteries near the enemy s.* Cornwallis has made a very 
feeble resistance: one sally only he attempted, and that a 
trivial one. I congratulate you, my dear Becky, on the near 
prospect of the success we wished for. I trust the treaty 
will soon be closed. This great event will give a happy turn 
to our affairs, and perhaps by next spring procure peace to 
America." 

By the following letter from Colonel Pickering to 
General Washington,f it appears that much property, 
especially tents, surrendered by Cornwallis, was lost 
through mismanagement, arising from opposition^ on 
the part of some American and French officers to the 
orders of Colonel Pickering : 

" CAMP, October 23d, 1781. 

SIR, 

"Agreeably to your Excellency s orders on the 19th in- 
stant to me, to take possession of the enemy s public stores 
., , pertaining to my department, I went to York myself with 
my storekeeper, and at the same time desired Colonel 
Dearborn to go to Gloucester, with an assistant of the store 
keeper, for the purpose of receiving the stores. 

" At Gloucester the dragoon horses with their accoutre 
ments, and the wagon horses and wagons, were delivered 
up that day, and the whole committed by Colonel Dearborn 
to militia guards. The same evening the dragoon horses 
were driven out of Glouce-ster and delivered to the care of

the Duke de Latizun s legion ; and, by the enclosed certifi 
cate and oath of Major Boyton, it appears that no changes 
were made between the receipt of those horses from the 
British and the delivery of them to the Duke s legion. 

" On the 20th I sent over the superintendent of the horse- 
yard with a party of men, and a written order, to take charge 
of the cavalry horses ; but Colonel Sheldon told my assist 
ant (Mr. Mix) that they should retain the horses till there 
was an order from your Excellency to deliver them up. So 
the superintendent remained at Gloucester. During the 
20th and 21st I had persons waiting at Gloucester to receive 
every species of property pertaining to my department, with 
a party of men for fatigue and guards. As soon as the 
prisoners left their tents on the 21st, Mr. Mix applied to 
the officer of the French guards, and told him his orders and 
business ; but he refused to let him take a tent unless he 
could produce an order from your Excellency, Count Ro- 
chambeau, or General Choisi. The time would not admit 
of an application to either. Night came on, and the tents j 
were chiefly stolen. In two hours the persons I had assigned 
for that service would have had them in store. Early that 
morning I sent Mr. Mix with a note to head-quarters, men 
tioning the embarrassment given me by the French and the 
militia guards ; but your Excellency was gone to the fleet ; 
though Mr. Trumbull said you had previously written to 
General Choisi on the subject.* 

" Colonel Dearborn informs me that a large proportion of 
the public stores thus lost (tents particularly) were taken 
away by the soldiers and women in the British hospitals ; H 
so that, of one hundred and ten new tents returned in the 
Eightieth Regiment, only four or five were left. This in 
formation he received from the Quartermaster to that regi 
ment. Some French soldiers were yesterday found there, 
loading two boats with tents. Colonel Dearborn s coming

probably prevented their completing their design ; but, in 
defiance of him, they carried off what they had got. 

" The French have placed safeguards over the houses at 
Gloucester where the British officers are quartered, so that 
no American officer on duty there can obtain any shelter, 
unless in the vilest hovels. I conceive it to be absolutely 
necessary that these and the French guards over the stores 
be removed, as well as the guards of the militia ; their 
places to be supplied, as far as shall be found necessary, by 
Continental troops. 

" I request to be favored with your Excellency s direc 
tions respecting the public stores and tents carried off by 
the people in the British hospitals. Colonel Dearborn will 
present this, and explain more circumstantially the pro 
ceedings at Gloucester." 

By a return, dated the 19th of October, 1781, by 
Thomas St. John, Assistant Deputy Quartermaster of 
Cornwallis, there were twenty-five bell tents and seven 
hundred and seventy-seven soldier s tents in the pos 
session of the British army at the time of the capitu 
lation. The money in the military chest, surrendered 
by the British, was two thousand one hundred and 
thirteen pounds, six shillings, sterling.* 

* The following receipt was given by Peter Anspaeh, the Paymaster in 
the American Quartermaster-General s department : 

" YORK, VIRGINIA, 24th October, 1781. 

" Received from David Thomas, Esquire, Deputy Paymaster-General of 
his Majesty s forces in North America, by the hands of Captain George Val- 
lancey and William Campbell, Acting Deputy Paymasters-General, the sum 
of 2113 6s. sterling, dollars at 4s. 8d. being the amount of cash in their pos 
session on public account at the capitulation of the garrisons of York and 
Gloucester pursuant to an order from Earl Cornwallis, dated 24th October, 
1781, for which I have signed three receipts of the same tenor and date, to 
serve but for one.

By the ninth article of capitulation * the traders in 
York and Gloucester were to be allowed three months 
to dispose of their effects, "the allied armies having 
the right of preemption." Notice was given to the 
traders as follows : 

" This right has not yet been exercised : until it is, and 
permission afterwards given to those merchants and traders 
to sell their effects, whoever shall be found to have disposed 
of any part of them, unless it be to public agents, will 
thereby infringe the treaty and incur a forfeiture of the 
whole. 

" TIMOTHY PICKERING, Quartermaster- General. 

" YORK, October 22d, 1781." 

About thirty traders sent in lists of their goods ; 
of whom the Quartermaster-General and other officers 
eagerly bought partly on public account and partly 
for their individual use various articles, amounting 
in value to more than three fourths of the above-men 
tioned sum surrendered in the British military chest. J 

The following extract from a letter from Colonel 
Lutterloh, Commissary-General of Forage, exhibits his 
opinion of the nature and importance of the Quarter 
master s department. He complains that provision had 
not been made for a just compensation to its officers, 
and that its services towards effecting the capture of 
Cornwallis s army had not received from Congress f a 
due share of commendation. 

" TRENTON, November 24th, 1781. A 

"I must also beg you will be pleased to consider the ^ 
situation of us all in your department. We are certainly 
the worst off. We are obliged to spend our own money,

312 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1781. 

have a great [deal of] trouble, much blame of everybody, 
and very little thanks or reward to expect. The heads in 
the staff department have certainly the greatest share of all 
the proper movements of an army, and its proper existence 
depends upon the good conduct of that body ; but, when 
ever any public thanks are given, no mention ever is made 
of our services. The aids of generals commonly run away 
with great applause, and their service is commonly only to 
carry messages and feast on plentiful tables, a business 
which is in no comparison with ours. While they advance 
in fortune and high character, we labor under silence for a 
pitiful pay, which is at an end when we leave the service, 
and all our troubles are forgotten. . . . There is no proper 
provision made for a man that serves well. Even the doc 
tors establishment is better. Their compensation at four 
dollars a day and half pay for life is an object for a man to 
look upon as a sufficiency for his troubles. I beg, there 
fore, you will see if Congress will not grant us a better 
existence [subsistence] . I must also beg you will get us 
money. The little sums I received from you and Mr. 
Anspach are all gone, and more of my own." 

Why the Quartermaster-General and the officers in 
his department should not have had the promise of 
half pay or commutation, is not very apparent ; but 
their case is not embraced by the Acts of the Old Con 
gress on the subject. This, however, has proved to be 
a matter of no consequence, as the nation broke its 
faith with the officers to whom its promise was made. 

The only entry in Colonel Pickering s journal after 
the 19th of October is the following : 

"November 6th. The American troops separated; the 
Pennsylvanians, Mary landers, and Virginians marching to 
the southward, and the Jersey and other northern troops 
to the northward. This day I left the late camp and came 
to Williamsburg." 



MT. 36.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 313 

On his return from Yorktown to Philadelphia, he 
wrote, November 30th, to Mrs. Pickering: 

" I arrived here last evening in perfect health. I fear, 
from what Colonel Miles tells me, that you have heard a 
groundless report of my having been dangerously ill, 
which must have given you much unnecessary pain. I was 
unwell, and for a day or two totally unfit for business, 
but not in the least apprehensive of danger from it, though 
it was a bilious disorder, to which the country is subject. 
In about twenty days I was again in good health, and have 
since gained so much flesh, that my clothes begin to feel 
tight upon me. 

"The day before yesterday I left the Head of Elk, in the 
storm, and, in a plain road, where I saw no danger, my 
sulky was overset by a small stump which escaped my notice. 
This hurt me a little, and has scratched my face ; but two or 
three days will rid me of complaint from this accident. . . . 

"I have not received a syllable from you since Tatham [an 
express] came to camp near York ; and I, on my way hither, 
recollected that I had been too negligent in writing to you 
since the surrender of Cornwallis ; but the consequent hurry 
of business and my sickness prevented ; and on my recovery 
I expected so soon to return, that I thought it unnecessary 
to write. My detention here has been unexpected. How 
long I shall be kept here is uncertain, as the General is 
here, and will remain perhaps two months. But I shall 
endeavor to set off for Newburgh the beginning of next 
week : at any rate, I am resolved to keep Thanksgiving 
with you, if I am obliged to come back again to Philadel 
phia soon after." 

To his brother he wrote from Philadelphia, on the 
2d of December : 

" I arrived here the 29th ultimo, in good health, from 
Virginia. By the 5th or 6th instant I expect to leave this 
place and proceed to Newburgh, where I left my wife and

children when I went on the expedition to Virginia. I pre 
sume she has informed my friends at Salem of her having 
another sou,* born on the 8th of October. . . . After the 
surrender of Cornwallis, when I found that would close the 
campaign, I promised myself the pleasure of visiting Salem ; 
but I fear I shall be disappointed. I must return hither 
again shortly, as the General stays here on account of the 
arrangement for the next campaign. On this business I 
may be detained here during the month of January." 

In the following letter, Colonel Lutterloh speaks of 
a cabal in Congress against Colonel Pickering ; but who 
were the members engaged in it, or what was the cause 
of their dissatisfaction, does not appear.*}* 

" BURLINGTON, December 1st, 1781. 

"Now, as a friend, which I hope you take me for, you 
have a number, and persons in Philadelphia in the great 
Council, who work against you. I hope their devilish 
projects and designs will fall through. General Lincoln is 
your friend, and speaks in most high terms of you ; which 
you fully at all times merit. I avoided to go to Philadel 
phia, on purpose not to bring myself into troubles, into 
which some speeches and manufactured cabals would have 
brought me, which I knew were brewing against you." 

Possibly Lutterloh s allusion to a cabal against him 
may have occasioned the air of discontent in the 
following letter to Mrs. Pickering, dated the 4th of 
December. 

" The date put to this letter reminds me, that this day 
three years we parted from our friends at Salem, and in 
just such pleasant weather as this ; but, perhaps, on that 
side the mountains where you dwell, it may now be cold

and dreary. How swift the days have rolled along ! What 
varied scenes have we passed through ! But these, I hope, 
will make us wiser and better. The more I see of the 
world, the more I see causes of disgust; and, were it not 
for the dear names of wife and children, I should care very 
little how short my stay was in it. I write in melancholy 
mood ; and yet, perhaps, I had never less cause to be cast 
down ; but trifling matters sometimes discompose us, and 
we cannot always command our own feelings. I long to 
be with you ; then I can unbosom myself, and talk over a 
thousand things. Tis a happiness to have a friend to whom 
I may commit myself without restraint. Tis doubtless best 
for us to meet with causes of disgust : it makes us think of 
futurity, an existence hereafter, freed from the vexa 
tions incident to our living here. In that existence alone 
I look for consolation ; in the faith of that alone I find it, 
when troubles or vexations affect me. 

" I believe, in a letter written yesterday, ... I mentioned 
my return hither, after making a visit to Newburgh, and I 
knew not but my stay here might then be of long continu 
ance, which induced me to wish to bring you with me ; but 
I now expect sufficient work will be cut out for me on the 
North River, and I shall consequently be generally with 
you at Newburgh. Indeed, after inquiring to-day for a 
house here for your reception, I found rents so insufferably 
high, wood and other necessaries in general so extravagant 
ly dear, I was nearly discouraged, before I was informed 
that public business would require my residing for the most 
part at Newburgh. This, I know, will be most for my inter 
est, and perhaps (all things considered) more agreeable to 
us both, than the round of diversions in this city, which are 
attended with every species of extravagance, in which we 
must have partaken (however ill-suited to my purse) in 
some degree, or been pronounced very singular, and have 
suffered repeated mortifications."

CHAPTER XXI. 

Controversy between Colonel Pickering and the State Agent of 
New York concerning Forage in West Chester County. Suf 
ferings in the State of New York from its being the Seat of War. 
Views of the State Agent and the Land-owners respecting the 
Forage. Their Censure of Colonel Pickering. His Vindi 
cation. 

AMONG the many vexations to which Colonel Picker 
ing was exposed in the execution of the multifarious 
duties of his office, was a controversy with Colonel 
Udny Hay, State Agent of New York. It related to 
forage taken by the allied American and French armies 
from estates in the county of West Chester. Some of 
these estates had been sequestered or confiscated by 
the State ; others belonged to persons who had fled 
from them on account of the vicinity of the British 
troops, and who, in consequence, were locally called 
" Kefugees." 

On the 1st of July, 1781, the legislature of New York 
passed an act authorizing the Commissioners of Seques 
tration to permit the State Agent to collect any forage 
or other supplies for the army which might be found 
on sequestered or confiscated estates in the county of 
West Chester, to be disposed of by the Agent, like other 
supplies furnished by the State for the use of the army. 

On the 5th of July, Colonel Hay wrote a letter to 
Colonel Pickering, enclosing a copy of this law, and 
saying, that he had desired the bearer, Captain William 
Brown, his assistant, to show to Colonel Pickering his 
instructions for executing the law. The object of the 



^x. 36.] LITE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 317 

law was to make the United States a debtor for the 
forage taken by the army in West Chester County ; but, 
as the lands lay desolate and waste, having been within 
the enemy s lines, and if the American army had not 
encamped there the forage would either have been con 
sumed by the enemy or have perished on the ground, 
Colonel Pickering was of opinion that the consumption 
of this forage ought not to create a charge against 
the United States. He therefore expressed surprise at 
the communication from Colonel Hay, according to 
whose statement he refused to pay any respect to 
this act of the New York legislature. Colonel Hay, 
in conversations and in letters, insisted that the United 
States were bound to make compensation to the State 
of New York and to the Eefugees. Colonel Pickering 
was willing to ascertain, as nearly as practicable, the 
quantity and value of the forage consumed, and to give 
certificates of the facts ; but he refused to certify what 
Colonel Hay demanded that the consumption of the 
forage created a debt against the United States. 

He wrote to Colonel Hay, from the Camp near 
Dobbs s Ferry, under the date of July 26th, 1781 : 

" I am misinformed if this opinion [that the United States p ^ 
ought not to be charged] is not current in the French as 
well as in the American army. At the head of the latter I 
may quote the opinion of the Commander-in-Chief ; which, 
being known, was sufficient to teach me caution how, as a 
public officer subject to his command, I acted in direct 
opposition to it. Now, although for an act of injustice no 
man should find shelter under any name, however great, 
yet, as an apology for a supposed error in judgment, one may 
certainly be allowed to quote the opinion of a superior. . . . 
I am wholly ignorant of myself if either an arrest, which 
you have repeatedly held up to my view, or even the actual 



318 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1781. 

imprisonment of my person, for a debt really or supposed 
to be due from the United States to any particular State, 
or any individual subject of it, would at all influence my 
determination. A seizure of my person or property for a 
debt contracted by me as a public officer, I should indeed 
consider as an act of cruel injustice ; and, even if it were 
warranted by law (of which, however, I may at least ex 
press a doubt), yet tis an act against which the common 
sense of mankind revolts. . . . 

" That any one should imagine I wished to deprive this 
State of one particle of its property, is doing me great in 
justice. I have seen its exertions ; I have been a witness 
to its sufferings. I have represented them to Congress. I 
have spoken of them on all occasions. To Congress I said, 
* The people in the State of New York are under very pecu 
liar disadvantages. Their trade with the neighboring States 
is so confined, the troops have been so long unpaid, and 
the public officers there have for so long time past been fur 
nished with so little money, at the same time that the army 
has drawn thence such considerable supplies, money, of 
consequence, must be extremely scarce. For its quota of 
supplies, not money, but State certificates, were given. In 
addition to these supplies, the army make large draughts on 
this State for forage, lumber, wood, &c., and the service of 
teams ; for all which no consideration can in general be 
given but certificates, and these not receivable in taxes ; 
whereby the inhabitants of that State are exceedingly dis 
tressed. There is nothing which the army wants and that 
State can furnish, that is not taken by impress, when not 
otherwise to be obtained, which often happens. The people 
submit to these oppressions (for such undoubtedly they are, 
though unavoidable) with astonishing patience, partly from 
a conviction that the articles so obtained are essential to the 
army, and partly through the influence of the military, who 
either are in fact, or are expected to be, called to enforce 
the execution, if opposed. Other States, out of the army s 
reach, experience no such oppression. The inhabitants make 



MT. 36.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 319 

their own terms for supplies and services required of them, 
and, without money or promise of speedy payment, refuse 
to yield either. 

"To Mr. Morris, the Superintendent of Finances of the 
United States, I have represented the distress of Colonel 
Hughes, Deputy Quartermaster, of this State, for want of 
money, that his small warrant of twenty thousand new- 
emission dollars, on the loan office of this State, was not yet 
paid off; . . . and that almost all persons of course re 
main unpaid for services and supplies : (then subjoining,) 
These, added to the debts of the old department,* would 
have long since put a stop to public business here, were there 
not a peculiar energy in the Executive f of the State, and a 
military force at hand, to carry into effect every necessary 
order. If any relief can be afforded, I know not where it 
can be better applied. It is due to the public officers and 
to the inhabitants of the State. The United States will 
also be benefited, for the doing the public business here 
wholly without money increases the public debt beyond 
conception. 

" I have said thus much to justify myself from groundless 
aspersions ; and, in a matter so interesting to me as a man, 
and still more as a public officer, I trust you will excuse me, 
even if you should deem me tedious." 

Colonel Hay, being dissatisfied with the answer to 
his letter, proposed that the decision of Congress on the 
point in dispute should be obtained, to which Colonel 
Pickering assented. 

The views of the parties, with some of the measures 
proposed by them respectively, and the spirit in which 
the controversy was conducted, are pretty fully dis 
closed in the letter given below from the Refugees to 
Colonel Pickering, and his reply. 

* Of Quartermaster-General, previous to the appointment of Colonel Pick 
ering, 
f Governor George Clinton. 



320 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1781. 

A meeting of the Refugees was held at White Plains, 
on the 31st of July, 1781, at which it was 

" Resolved, unanimously, That a letter be wrote to the 
Quartermaster-General of the American army, demanding 
of him pay for what forage, or other articles, he has obtained 
from either of their farms, and at the same time giving him 
their opinions of his conduct, as Quartermaster-General. 

" Resolved, unanimously, That Colonel Udny Hay, State 
Agent, prepare a draught of said letter. 

"On the said letter being read, paragraph by paragraph, 
the same was unanimously agreed to." 

This letter, dated at White Plains, July 30th, 1781, 
was as follows : 

" Sm, 

" Astonished at the information of an attempt being made 
to take by force, for the use of the army, the produce of our 
farms, without making us the least recompense, nay, even 
refusing an acknowledgment by which we would obtain pay 
hereafter, and having met this day and appointed Robert 
Graham, Esquire, Judge of this county, as our chairman, 
the Agent of the State, at our request, favored us with a 
correspondence between you and him, that has fully con 
firmed the information we had received, and which impels 
us to tell you, Sir, (for your unprecedented and unwarranted 
attempt to trample on the laws of that State to which we are 
subject, and of which we have [been] and ever will be the 
firm and unshaken supporters, forbids every degree of deli 
cacy,) that we are determined to have full and speedy sat 
isfaction for the insults offered us, by taking such steps as 
the laws of our country will, warrant for compelling you to 
do us justice ; while we cannot refrain from smiling with 
disdain at the folly of any individual, however high in sta 
tion, presuming openly, and without the smallest necessity, 
to set the law at defiance. We, nevertheless, should think 
it necessary to show our immediate indignation at such a 



JET. 36.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 321 

character, were we not withheld from doing so by that 
love of our country and regard for the general cause 
which induced us at first to quit these habitations and 
these fields which you wish to prove our right and title to 
extinct. 

"Actuated by these motives, and at the particular request 
of the State Agent, not from the smallest inclination to show 
you any favor, we shall defer putting the law in execution 
till the 10th of next month ; against which time you will 
probably have received such instructions from Congress, to 
whom, we are informed, you have wrote on the subject, as 
may prevent any further altercation. 

" We have carefully read over the Agent s letter to you 
and your answer, taken both up by paragraphs, and made 
the necessary comparisons, and would make no observation, 
Sir, on the absurdity and childishness of your reasoning, 
but impute that to the weakness of your head, did not the 
wickedness of your heart appear too glaring for us to pass 
over unnoticed, in your attempt to make it be believed your 
illegal practices have been commenced and pursued in con 
sequence of an opinion received from our illustrious Com- 
mander-in-Chief. The well-known character of that great 
man, his exerted attention on every occasion to support the 
rights of individuals, the sacred regard he has ever shown 
to the civil authority and laws of this State, all join in 
defeating your wish to make us believe he would counte 
nance the infringement of a law, did he even think the law 
in itself improper or impolitic. Be assured, therefore, we 
have not the most distant idea of your being able to screen 
yourself, in an illegal act, under a shield which would give 
you such importance. 

"We have thus, Sir, with that liberty which, as free citi 
zens of America, we claim as one of our most invaluable 
privileges, declared our opinion of your late proceedings 
respecting the forage taken by your directions in this county ; 
and our determination is firmly fixed to assert our rights, 
and rescue our property out of the hands of every invader

thereof, whether under the color of an open enemy, a secret 
Tory, or a self-interested and designing Whig. 

" We have requested Captain William Brown and Mr. 
Francis Chaudinet to deliver you this letter at your office in 
camp, and beg your answer, directed to their care at the 
widow Miller s, White Plains. 

" I am, Sir, in behalf and by the unanimous order of the 
Refugees of West Chester County, met at Mr. William 
Field s, your most obedient, humble servant, 

"ROBERT GRAHAM, Chairman." 

The preceding letter was accompanied by a long 
private one from Colonel Hay, dated the 1st of August, 
insolent in manner, and abounding in misconstruction 
of Colonel Pickering s language and conduct. 

In his reply to the Refugees, dated at Camp near 
Dobbs s Ferry, August 3d. 1781 ? Colonel Pickering 
says : 

" GENTLEMEN, 

"I received a letter, dated the 30th ultimo, signed Robert 
Graham, Chairman, in behalf of the Refugees of West Ches 
ter County. I should have been more surprised than I was 
at the contents, had I not believed you had been unwarily 
drawn into the measure by gross misrepresentations of my 
character and conduct. Had I not supposed you thus de 
ceived, I should have returned your letter unanswered, the 
terms of it are so indecent, so improper, so unbecoming the 
honorable characters you profess to maintain as the sup 
porters of the laws and liberties of your country. But, as 
your reproaches have arisen from mistake and misrepre 
sentation, I am willing to undeceive you ; and this, much 
more to prevent my usefulness as a public officer being les 
sened, than from any concern for my personal reputation ; 
for this would sustain no injury from such an attack as 
yours, in the opinion of any gentleman to whom I am per 
sonally known. 






JET. 36.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 323 

"You, Gentlemen, have been made to believe, that I have 
first knowingly committed an act of palpable injustice, and 
this, in a case wherein I am totally disinterested, in which I 
cannot gain or lose one farthing, in which there is no con 
ceivable motive to do wrong! and then, to cover this 
unjust act, that I falsely accused the Commander-in-Chief 
as giving countenance to it ! You were not aware, Gentle 
men, of the enormity of the crimes you have thus ground- 
lessly laid to my charge. . . . By the supposed act of 
injustice I exposed myself to the resentment of the Refugees, 
to the frowns of your legislature, and to the displeasure of 
the whole body of the people of this State. By the supposed 
false accusation of the Commander-in-Chief, I subjected 
myself to his indignation, and to be broken with infamy ! 
Yet these are crimes which you have imputed to me ; to a 
man who, for divers years past, has executed several im 
portant public offices without the imputation of the smallest 
crime ! to a man who, after such experience of his fidelity, 
was called by the unanimous voice of Congress to his pres 
ent office ! to a man (to whom indeed you must have been 
strangers, and whom you should not therefore have so rashly 
censured) who, from his earliest youth to the present hour, 
has sustained the reputation of unspotted integrity and truth ! 
. . . Guilt, you are sensible, Gentlemen, implies knowl 
edge. I have doubtless often erred through ignorance and 
mistake. . . . And it was only for a supposed error in 
judgment, that I sought for countenance in the opinion of 
the Commander-in-Chief. . . . 

"Suffer me now to inquire what foundation there was for 
so much calumny. 

" You begin to this effect : that you were informed that I 
had attempted to take by force, for the use of the army ( tis 
fortunate that it was not for my own use), the produce of 
your farms, without making you the least recompense ; that 
I even refused giving an acknowledgment, by which you 
could obtain payment hereafter ; and that the correspond 
ence between Colonel Hay and me had fully confirmed that 



324 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1781. 

information. The word, force, in the sense in which you use 
it, seems hardly applicable to the case in question. How 
ever, I do not mean to dispute about words. It is a fact, 
that, when the army marched into this county, every man 
turned out his horse and his ox to feed where he pleased 
(excepting into fields of grain, which, I believe, were gen 
erally preserved till ripe), nobody appearing to forbid it. 
After some days (I do not recollect how many), Mr. Brown 
brought me a letter from Colonel Hay, State Agent, en 
closing an extract of a law of this State.* . . . 

"I expressed some surprise, for I had entertained the 
same opinion that generally prevailed in the army, that the 
forage consumed here would not become a charge against 
the United States. As Mr. Brown had come instructed to 
collect the forage, I asked him where he was to carry it ; he 
answered, * Up above. I asked him if he had men, and tools, 
and teams to cut and carry it away. He replied that he had 
not, but depended on the army for those things. This was 
the substance of what passed between us, as nearly as I can 
recollect ; and, being very busy, I referred him to Colonel 
Lutterloh, the Commissary of Forage ; but (I do not know 
why) Mr. Brown neglected to call on him. I heard little 
said on the subject afterwards, till Colonel Hay came down. 
I believe I repeated to him what had passed between Mr. 
Brown and me. We conversed some time on the subject, 
and finally I told him I should not choose to come to a de 
termination until I had consulted the Commander-in-Chief. 
I accordingly mentioned the matter to his Excellency. He 
immediately said that he thought the demand a very ex 
traordinary one, or words to that effect. I observed, that 
the State had made a law concerning it, at the same time 
presenting him with the extract from it which I received 
from Colonel Hay. He cast his eyes on it, and said, I 
think it is a strange (or a very strange) law. This conver 
sation I communicated to Colonel Hay. 

"Thus, knowing the General s opinion from his own 

* See page 316. 



JET. 36.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 325 

mouth, I did not think myself warranted in giving such 
certificates as Colonel Hay desired, that would positively 
make the United States debtors for all the forage con 
sumed by the army in this county. I believe I then pro 
posed that Colonel Hay should himself speak to the General, 
to get his determination. He afterwards informed me that 
he did so, but that the General declined intermeddling in 
the matter, or even giving an opinion on the subject. This, 
however, was not satisfactory to me. If the case had been 
so very clear as you seem to think it, why should the 
Commander-in-Chief, whose justice no one will call in 
question, hesitate to direct, or, at least, advise me, to 
give the certificates demanded? This circumstance alone 
should have rendered you, Gentlemen, more cautious than 
to have rashly accused me, as you have done, of the infa 
mous crime of telling a falsehood, for quoting his opinion 
as agreeing with my own. 

" As to a recompense for the forage, I grant I did not 
ofter any, not being convinced that it was justly due ; but 
that I refused giving an acknowledgment whereby such 
recompense, if judged right, might be obtained hereafter, 
is not true. I was willing, to the best of my recollection, 
even the first day I saw Colonel Hay, to give him a certifi 
cate for that end ; but he has ever demanded one of a 
different kind, which, without further inquiry, would make 
the United States chargeable. In the letter to Colonel 
Hay, I say explicitly, that, in adjusting this business, I 
have no other object in view than to avoid an improper 
charge against the United States. Any certificate of facts, 
with that caution, I am content to give/ Afterwards, it is 
true, I propose a particular form, but subject to alteration 
if not approved, for I say expressly, in some such form as 
this ; which plainly implies a willingness to alter it, if 
objected to. For the purpose of ascertaining the quantity 
of forage consumed by the army, Colonel Hay proposed 
two methods : first, to find the number of horses, oxen, 
and fat cattle belonging to the army, which had subsisted 



326 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1781. 

on forage growing in this county ; or, second, to have 
appraisers appointed to estimate the forage used by the 
army, distinguishing what was taken from confiscated or 
sequestered estates, and what from the lands of individuals ; 
according to which certificates should be given. It being 
thus referred to my choice to take one or the other of these 
two ways of ascertaining the forage used by the army in 
this county, I preferred the former, and proposed calling 
for returns to fix the number of cattle subsisted as above 
mentioned, according to which certificates should be given 
that would entitle the owner of the lands to payment, if it 
should finally be adjudged, by those who had a right to 
determine the point, that justice required such forage to be 
paid for. Colonel Hay subjoined a number of questions, 
to which he desired answers, in case I closed with neither 
of his propositions ; but, as I agreed substantially to the 
first, such answers were unnecessary. 

" Colonel Hay, after reading my answer to his letter, 
proposed taking the sense of Congress on the affair. I 
readily agreed to it. He said he would write to the Dele 
gates of the State, and I told him that I would write to the 
President of Congress. I did so, and ordered an express 
to be ready to take the letters as soon as his should be 
brought to my office. 

" The business being thus submitted, and at Colonel 
Hay s own motion, to the decision of Congress, I confess I 
was not a little surprised at being presented, six days after 
wards, with a letter written with so much acrimony as yours, 
and could not avoid thinking that much industry had been 
used to excite your bitter resentment when there was so 
little ground for it. 

" Now, Gentlemen, permit me to ask, In what part of 
these transactions do you discover any foundation for accus 
ing me of the heinous crimes you have laid to my charge? 
Besides those already noticed, you speak of my trampling 
on the laws of the State. That is a strong expression, and 
means a contemptuous disobedience to those laws. But I 



Mi. 36.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 327 

am not conscious of any such thing. I have, on the con 
trary, ever spoken of this State with the highest respect. 
But suffer me to ask, Gentlemen, whether a particular 
State may not pass a law which an officer of the United 
States might justly hesitate to obey. Suppose the army 
were in Jersey, and that the legislature of that State had 
made a law fixing the price of hay at twelve pounds a ton 
(and, being sovereign and independent, it could pass what 
law it pleased), while New York set it only at six, agree 
ably to the Act of Congress. Suppose, then, that the agent 
of Jersey should demand of me certificates for forage, taken 
there by the army, at that rate : would you think me justi 
fiable in complying with it? Would you not rather think 
I went far enough in offering a certificate of facts, until the 
United States in Congress (whose servant I am) should 
determine whether the price of forage demanded by Jersey 
should be allowed? But the legislature of New York have 
made a law authorizing a demand of pay for forage, for 
which it was generally thought in the army no recompense 
at all ought to be given. I was of that opinion. The prin 
cipal officers of the army, whom I heard speak of it, held 
the same opinion ; and, I have told you already, it was the 
opinion of the Commander-in-Chief. 

".Under these circumstances, Gentlemen, what was my 
duty ? What more could I have done with propriety than 
I have offered to do? Be pleased to bear in mind, that I 
am an officer of the United States, under oath to discharge 
the trust reposed in me with justice and integrity, to the 
best of my skill and understanding. What judgment, then, 
would you have formed of my attention to the duties of my 
office, of my * justice and integrity, if I had pursued the 
line of conduct required of me, in direct opposition to my 
understanding of what was just and upright, in contempt 
of the opinion of the principal officers of the army, and 
especially of the Commander-in-Chief? Yet I do not say 
this opinion was not an erroneous one : I never said it was 
not; but it was an opinion, supported as it was by the 



328 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1781. 

authorities I have mentioned, by which I thought my con 
duct ought tq be governed. 

" I forbear, Gentlemen, to remark on those reproachful 
expressions with which every paragraph of your letter is 
dishonorably marked. I have written this reply, not to 
retort, not to irritate, but to inform. I have aimed at 
giving you a true detail of facts, according to the best of 
my recollection. If there be any circumstance which de 
mands a further explanation, I am ready to give it. I wish 
only to have my conduct fairly understood. I ask for jus 
tice only, and not favor, from any man. Though poor, yet 
I feel myself perfectly independent. Having neither ambi 
tion nor avarice to gratify, I am not even under a tempta 
tion, much less am I disposed, to do an unjust or an improper 
act, knowingly, for the sake of pleasing any man, or any 
body of men. What appears to be right, whether agree 
able or disagreeable to others, I mean ever to pursue. Yet 
I am not indifferent to the opinion of my fellow-men ; I 
wish my actions to meet with their approbation. To this 
period I have received, generally, such approbation ; yet I 
never used any species of bribes or flattery to obtain it. I 
never even asked for any one of the offices I have held 
under the United States. Yet I have been appointed to 
three very important offices in succession, one of them 
under the immediate observation of the delegates of your 
/State and of all the members of Congress, for upwards of 
two years ; but, after this, to have unanimously elected me 
to an office of such magnitude as the present, if I at all 
deserve the character you have so freely given me, must 
have shown them to be as destitute of wisdom as regard 
less of the interests of their country.

WRITING to Samuel Hodgdon, on the 7th of August, 
1781, Colonel Pickering says: 

" Retrenchments and reformations in the management of 
our public affairs will (as you suppose) ever meet with 
my concurrence ; notwithstanding I have created not a few 
enemies by stirring in this business as far as I have. To 
yoty, as my friend, I can relate an anecdote. Colonel Day 
ton, the other day, addressed me thus: I heard a hand 
some compliment paid you a few days since. On what 
account? said I. He replied, A gentleman of the Jersey 
brigade, who had been over to the army, on his return told 
me that all the other staff departments were making com 
plaints against you ; adding, &lt; I was exceedingly glad to 
hear it ; for it was high time to make retrenchments of 
public expenses, and I am glad that somebody is attempt 
ing it. 

" Since my propositions relative to the commissariats, I 
have observed appearances in some (not all) of the staff, 
which indicated feelings that would give rise to such com 
plaints as Colonel Dayton referred to. I have found that 
my proposals about the commissariats were grossly misrep 
resented in the army ; and these misrepresentations (and 
it is not difficult to discern who were interested to make 

VOL. i. 42 



330 LIEE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1781. 

them) excited jealousies, as though / were ambitious, and 
desirous of grasping at every staff department that could 
be managed without particular professiojialknowledore. 
But you will recollect that I was willing to quit the direc 
tion, not only of the department if extended, but even of 
the office I was actually invested with. 

" But I have a new set of enemies ! stirred up by Colonel 
U. Hay, because I hesitated to give certificates for the forage 
. consumed by the army in this county, where the lands gen 
erally lay desolate and waste. . . . The Refugees, at a 
meeting where he was present, lately wrote me a letter on 
the subject, filled with abuse from one end to the other. It 
was a perfect piece of ribaldry, dictated, I verily believe, 
by Colonel Hay himself.* I told the bearer of it (one of 
Hay s assistants) that, if I treated it as it deserved, I should 
trample it under my feet. It was signed by the Chearman 
of the meeting, who, in the letter, is said to be the Judge 
of the county. The abuse was so extremely gross, I told 
the bearer it disgraced the chairman and the Refugees, but 
not me ; that, however, I considered Colonel Hay as the 
instigator in the whole affair. I confess it at first excited 
some resentment ; but I now view it with the most calm 
indifference. As these plain farmers have been inflamed 
and drawn into the measure by Colonel Hay, without being 
sensible of the impropriety of writing such a letter, I intend 
going to their next meeting (next Thursday) , to give them 
a plain narrative of facts, and show the cruelty and injustice 
of their accusations. 

" Colonel Hay cannot easily be forgiven ; for this proceed 
ing took place three days after it had been mutually agreed 
between us (on his own motion) to refer the point in dis 
pute to the decision of Congress." 

Colonel Pickering attended the meeting of the Refu 
gees on the 9th of August, at North Castle. To a 

* The resolutions of the Refugees (page 320) say as much. 



JET. 36.] , LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING, 331 

question put to him in writing, whether he would give 
such certificates for the forage taken as were agreeable 
to the laws of New York, and consonant to such as he 
usually gave, he made answer, that he was content to 
appoint, immediately, one person, the Refugees to ap 
point another, (these two, in case of disagreement, to 
choose a third,) to ascertain the quantity and value of 
the forage taken ; agreeably to which certificates should 
be given, the form of which might be like this : 

"I certify that (bay, grain, or pasturage, which 
ever it may be), of the value of , has been taken, 

for the use of the American army, from the estate of A B 
(or a confiscated or sequestered estate), in the county of 
West Chester/ 

He subjoined : 

" As the only point in question has, by mutual agreement 
between Colonel Hay and me (and at his own motion), 
been submitted to Congress, I cannot with propriety or 
decency undertake to determine it, until I am made ac 
quainted with the decision of Congress thereon. Colonel 
Hay at the same time said he should not think himself 
bound by such decision." 

The next day a number of the Refugees instructed 
their agents to apply to the Quartermaster-General, and 
endeavor, agreeably to his proposal, to determine the 
value of the forage used by the army, fixing the value 
of pasture upon the principle that hay was worth 
about three pounds, in specie, per ton. If the Quarter 
master-General consented to enter upon the business 
immediately, no action was to be commenced against 
him before the 20th of August, unless an answer should 
be previously received from Congress, and he should 



332 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. , [1781. 

then refuse giving such certificates as were demanded 
on the 9th. The agents were desired, on all difficult 
matters, to take the advice of the State Agent, pro 
vided it was not contradictory to the spirit of the 
instructions. 

Colonel Pickering wrote, on the 12th of August, a 
second letter to the President of Congress, requesting 
an immediate determination respecting the forage, and 
stating that the matter had become more serious ; that 
on the 9th instant he attended a meeting of the Refu 
gees, and he had no doubt the whole business would 
have been amicably adjusted, had not Colonel Hay 
stirred up their passions whenever they discovered a 
disposition to listen to moderate measures ; that Colonel 
[ Hay urged them to commence suits against Colonel 
I Pickering immediately; and that they afterwards grew 
more cool, and agreed to suspend their suits until the 
20th instant, and in the mean time to act agreeably 
to the proposal Colonel Pickering had made. 

On the 13th of August, Colonel Pickering wrote to 
his wife : 

"I have the pleasure to inform you, that Colonel Hay s 
violent proceedings against me are condemned by all the 
gentlemen in the army whose opinions I have heard ; par 
ticularly by men of such discernment as Colonel Hamilton 
and Judge Laurance ; * and I am satisfied Colonel Hay is 
not a little chagrined." 

In a letter of the 14th of August, Colonel Hay pro 
poses a meeting with Colonel Pickering, with three or 
four mutual friends, in order to discuss the question 



* Judge Advocate-General of the army, and from 179G to 1800 a Senator 
of the United States from the State of New York. 



-Ex. 36.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 333 

of granting certificates in the usual form. In this he 
says he has two views : 

" The first, to bring about a speedy and amicable settle 
ment before the next meeting of the Refugees, without 
which I will venture to predict there will soon be such a 
rupture between the inhabitants of the State and you, as 
will tend further to clog the business of your very impor 
tant department, already too much embarrassed by unavoid 
able causes. The second is, that, should you not comply 
with this requisition, I may have an opportunity of show 
ing them the various proposals I have made and you have 
rejected." 

Colonel Pickering replied on the 15th : 

" I have already fully explained myself on the subject 
of your letter of yesterday ; and I am sorry my explana 
tions have failed in any degree to answer my wishes ; which 
are, to inform and convince those who were strangers to 
facts, and to put the matter in so clear a light, that the arjts 
of designing men, who desire to foment differences, might 
be ineffectual. 

" Having submitted the matter to Congress, their decis 
ion I am bound to wait for and obey. When that arrives, 
I shall immediately act in consequence thereof. And, lest 
there should be an unnecessary delay, I have wrote a second 
time, by express, representing the necessity of, and entreat 
ing, their immediate decision. In the mean time, I shall 
not be intimidated by any threats, for I have, from the 
beginning, offered to do, in this affair, whatever was con 
sistent with my duty ; and disinterested men, of discern 
ment and candor, acknowledge it. I have also shown every 
disposition to cultivate harmony with this State, and the 
citizens thereof concerned in this business ; nor would any 
thing but an adherence to my duty induce me to hazard an 
interruption of it. But, as I have acted entirely in a public 
character, without any private views (none such, indeed, can 



334 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1781. 

possibly exist) , I am willing to abide the consequences of 
my conduct." 

The next day he wrote again to Colonel Hay : 

"Mr. William Keese, the bearer, is come down for the 
&gt; purpose of joining with such person as shall be chosen by 
the agents of the owners of the lands where the army have 
consumed any forage in this county, in making appraise 
ments of the quantities eaten or taken from those lands 
respectively, and the value thereof, agreeably to the pro 
posals I made at the meeting of the Refugees on the 9th 
instant. 

" I did not consider myself bound by those proposals, 
seeing they were rejected by the Refugees and you ; yet, 
as my intentions were the same from the beginning, namely, 
to give a certificate of facts, where required; so I could 
have no objection, on general principles, to an adherence 
to the proposals I had made. The ill treatment I have 
received from you, and, through you, from the Refugees, 
would indeed warrant, or at least excuse, my throwing 
every possible embarrassment in your way ; but resent 
ment will have no influence on my conduct : I am still 
ready to take any proper measure in my power to ascer 
tain the quantity and value of the forage in dispute, that 
the owners of the lands, if pronounced entitled to a com 
pensation, may have the proper evidence of their respec 
tive dues. . . . Mr. Keese, therefore, may proceed to 
the appraisement of the forage taken from the sequestered 
lands, as well as the lands of Refugees." 

Colonel Hay wrote to Colonel Pickering on the same 
day : 

" The Assistant State Agents have my orders to fall in 
with your proposals of the 9th instant for the present, and 
until I have advice from proper authority to adopt another 
method." 



J&T. 36.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 335 

He says he will not suppose that "the arts of design 
ing men," &c., is intended against him, as his conduct, 1 
though warm, has been open and unequivocal ; and he 
insinuates that every one concerned has not been actu 
ated by principles equally honest and honorable. 

From the following letter, dated at King s Ferry, 
August 26th, 1781, addressed by Colonel Pickering to 
George Clinton, Governor of New York, it would seem 
that the arrangement thus acquiesced in by all parties 
had fallen through. 

"Sm, 

"I fear your Excellency has heard already too much on-f, tfc 
the subject of the forage taken by the army in the county fat\j-)h\ 
of West Chester; yet, as my character has been unjustly 
aspersed by some men who have other views than to pro 
mote the public good, I think it my duty, holding an office 
of so much importance as that of Quartermaster-General, to 
request your Excellency s attention to the enclosed papers, 
which contain a state of facts, which I also wish to have 
communicated as you shall think proper. 

" Although many observations occur which could further 
tend to justify my conduct in this business, yet I will waive 
them, and rely on what is contained in the papers above 
mentioned ; only begging leave to refer your Excellency to 
John Laurance, Esquire, Judge Advocate-General, for in 
formation of what passed at the meeting of the Refugees on 

A O O 

the 9th instant. He will, I doubt not, satisfy you, that, so 
far from aiming at an amicable settlement, as Colonel Hay 
had ever pretended, he was the sole cause of preventing it. 
The Refugees have now no means left of ascertaining their 
respective dues, for which perhaps they may blame me ; but 
your Excellency will judge whether it is not rather due to 
their violent advocate. For, from the beginning of my con 
versations with Colonel Hay on the subject, I offered to give 
any certificate of facts, which would have answered every 
purpose the Refugees could reasonably wish for. However, 



336 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1781. 

as resentment for the ill treatment I have received will have 
no influence on my conduct towards the proprietors of the 
lands in West Chester County, so I shall not decline com 
municating to them any information in my power respecting 
the quantity of forage taken by the American army from 
those lands. The entire quantity may be ascertained with 
some degree of accuracy by the returns of the number of 
horses and working oxen employed with the army while in 
that county, which I will transmit to Colonel Hughes, 
and by the returns of fat cattle, which doubtless can be fur 
nished by the superintendent of live stock. 

" I have taken the liberty of referring your Excellency 
to Judge Laurance for information in the case before 
mentioned, because Colonel Hay will probably produce cer 
tificates of the propriety, firmness, and even decency of his 
behavior at that meeting. It may seem strange that a man 
whose conduct had been evidently governed by those prin 
ciples should think of getting certificates to prove it. Colo 
nel Hay asked for and obtained them, as I was informed. 
One gentleman, indeed, who had understanding, candor, and 
fortitude to think and determine for himself, did not sign it. 
This was Mr. E. S. Burling, clerk of the meeting. He 
offered to sign the certificate if the word decency were struck 
out. Your Excellency will judge, from this circumstance, 
what kind of firmness Colonel Hay exhibited, and whether 
another word would not more properly characterize his con 
duct at the meeting. Colonel Hay may attempt to palliate 
all his virulence towards me by haranguing on the suffer 
ings of the Eefugees, and the injustice of depriving them of 
their property ; but I will venture to say, that all his bustle 
and clamor on the occasion sprung from another source than 
a tender concern for the interests of the State, or the suf 
ferings of the Refugees, and that the affair of the forage was 
only used as a handle to promote his private designs. But 
he has overshot his mark, and convicted himself of having 
used too much violence, by adopting at last the proposition 
which I substantially made near a month before. 



JET. 36.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 337 

" Colonel Hay had ever professed a respect for me, and 
repeatedly expressed his desire to render every assistance 
in his power to my department. These professions were 
continued until his receipt of my letter of the 26th of July, 
and even longer ; for he had the art to make the Refugees 
meet at the White Plains July 31st, and believe that he 
still wished not to embarrass me, by desiring that their suits 
might be postponed ; and yet he himself wrote the infamous 
letter signed by Judge Graham in behalf of that meeting ! 
And this letter he doubtless prepared before the Refugees 
assembled. I observe it was dated July 30th, and the pro 
ceedings of the meeting bore date the 31st. This irritating 
transaction, too, your Excellency will observe, was but three 
or four days after the matter, on his own motion, had been 
referred to the decision of Congress for the purpose of effect 
ing an amicable settlement ! All these proceedings were 
likewise subsequent to the writing of a piece of scurrility, 
published in London s paper * of the 9th of August, which 
was designed by the writer to represent me in a ridiculous 
point of light. I do not hesitate to pronounce Colonel Hay 
the author of it. The style corresponds exactly with that 
which he exhibited at the meeting of the Refugees on that 
same day ; there are divers references in it to some letters 
which I wrote to Congress last March on the subject of re 
trenchments (some of which they were pleased to adopt) , 
and which Colonel Hay unluckily told me he had read when 
in Philadelphia ; and the original appeared in the hand 
writing of one of his people or dependants. It was left at 
the printer s some weeks before it was published, London 
having refused to print it ; but the person who brought it 
at last insisted on its being printed. The true history of 
the affuir to which this piece alludes is contained in the en 
closed extracts of the letters of May 10th to General Wash 
ington, and from and to Mr. Tilghman, his aide-de-camp. 
The plan, however, was not pursued, and I had no other

concern in the affair. I do not even recollect to have heard 
one word on the subject after that day, until I was told the 
fish * were spoiled and thrown into the river. I will only 
observe here, that one Monell and another assistant of Colo 
nel Hay s were (as I have been informed) the undertakers 
to catch and cure the shad for the army. 

"As I had never injured Colonel Hay, but, on the con 
trary, from the character given of him, had thought and 
spoken of him with respect, I can account for his unprovoked 

* The extracts referred to are these : 

Colonel Pickering to General Washington. "I am informed that about 
sixty barrels of shad came down yesterday from Esopus. As this article of 
provision is for an immediate supply, I beg leave to suggest the expediency 
of bringing down daily all that are caught. Two or three pettiaugers may be 
employed in this service ; and, with the wind as it is to-day, they may run from 
Esopus to West Point in five or six hours ; and, if the wind be adverse, they 
can get down in two tides. If this mode be adopted, the immense expense of 
salt and barrels, and the great loss of time in putting up the shad, will be saved. 
If three quarters of a bushel of salt be allowed for salting one barrel of shad, 
then the salt for the sixty barrels already brought down was worth two hun 
dred and seventy hard dollars ; for it sells currently at six hard dollars per 
bushel, and will probably grow dearer soon. Should six hundred barrels be 
caught during the season, the salt thus consumed will be worth twenty-seven 
hundred hard dollars. To this are to be added the price of half the barrels 
(for probably half will be lost), three hundred dollars, and the price of pack 
ing, of the cost of which I am ignorant, but it will be considerable. But in 
the way here proposed, all these expenses will be saved, and the troops 
receive daily an agreeable supply of fresh provisions, as a change, with their 
salt meat." 

Lieutenant-Colonel Tilghman to Colonel Pickering, May 10th, 1781. " His 
Excellency very much approves your plan of bringing down the shad daily, 
only taking care to give each cargo as much salt as will secure them against 
a passage longer than the common calculation." 

Colonel Pickering to Lieutenant-Colonel Tilghman, May 10th, 1781. 
"Your favor of this date is just received. I know not who has the direction 
of the shad fishery, and, if I did, I have no authority to put the business in 
a new train. 

" The pettiaugers I can order to be got ready to sail at a moment s warn 
ing ; and, for the security of the fish against the accident you mention (which, 
however, can scarcely happen), each boat may take and keep on board a bar 
rel or two of salt. But somebody must be authorized to contract for the 
delivery of the fish from the seine, and an order given for the salt, of which I 
presume there is already enough at Esopus to answer every demand on the 
proposed plan." 



I&T. 36.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 339 

abuse but on one principle, his wish to oust me out of 
office. Early in the dispute I suspected, from his manage 
ment, that this was his design, that he might come in as 
deputy for the State of New York, under some principal who 
with him was plotting to destroy my reputation, as the sure 
means of getting me displaced. Some circumstances since 
made known to me put this almost beyond a doubt. But 
I cannot avoid despising attempts so basely conducted, 
because I am sure they will be ineffectual, and because a 
removal from my office (so it were not with disgrace) , far 
from distressing, would relieve me of a very heavy and 
painful burden. 

"I beg your Excellency s pardon for these observations. 
But, while I continue in my present office, it is of public im 
portance that I support my reputation ; and it is on this 
ground alone that I trouble your Excellency with this letter 
and its enclosures."

CHAPTER XXIII. 

Further Proceedings respecting the West Chester Forage. The 
New York State Agent sends a Challenge. Colonel Pickering 
refuses to accept it. His Sentiments on Duelling. He with 
draws the Charges complained of, on finding them erroneous. 
He vindicates his Conduct relating to the Forage. His Views 
sustained by the French Quartermaster-General. 

ON the 7th of September, Colonel Pickering being 
then on his way to Yorktown on the expedition against 
Cornwallis, Congress passed a resolve, 

" That Major-General Heath . . . cause immediate and 
equitable measures to be taken for ascertaining the quantity 
of forage expended by the allied army, in the county of 
West Chester, which hath not been accounted for ; and 
that he direct the Deputy Quartermaster in that depart 
ment to give certificates accordingly to the State Agent 
of New York, or any other person or persons authorized 
to receive the same." * 

What progress was made in this business under 
General Heath I have not learned ; but the adjust 
ment of some, if not all, of the claims appears to have 
reverted to Colonel Pickering. He appointed in Sep 
tember, 1782, John Keese, and in June, 1783, Charles 
Tillinghast, to attend, on the part of the United States, 
to the appraisement, by arbitrators, of the quantities and 
values of the timber, wood, forage, &c., taken by the 
army from sequestered and confiscated estates in the 

* Journals of Congress, Vol. VII. p. 184. 



MT. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 341 

State of New York ; and they certified respectively, 
the one in December, 1782, the other in July, 1783, 
that the sums found by the arbitrators, amounting to 
upwards of fifty-one thousand dollars, as the values 
of property taken from such estates in the counties 
of West Chester, Dutchess, Orange, and Ulster, were 
just charges against the United States. 

No further correspondence appears to have been 
held between Colonel Hay and Colonel Pickering 
until the beginning of the year 1783, when the fol 
lowing letter was handed to Colonel Pickering by 
Major Nicholas Fish and Major John Armstrong : 

" NEWBURGH, January 15th, 1783. 

SIR, 

" The ignominious light in which you endeavored to 
exhibit my private character and reputation, in your letter 
of the 26th of August, 1781, to his Excellency Governor 
Clinton, must be atoned for, either by a proof of the asser 
tions you there make, or in such other manner as it would 
be equally improper in me not to demand, as in you to 
refuse to grant. The gentlemen who do me the honor to 
deliver this will acquaint you with the reasons which pre 
vented a much earlier application on this subject, and I 
flatter myself they are such as will appear to you not only 
admissible, but even satisfactory. These gentlemen, too, 
are informed of the mode of settlement I have determined 
to adopt, which, having been formed on the most mature 
deliberation, cannot be receded from ; and, if you are 
equally inclined with me to an immediate settlement upon 
generous principles, we shall soon have an opportunity of 
meeting each other. Till then, I am your most obedient 
servant, 

UDNY HAY." 

Colonel Pickering, on the same day that he received 
this letter, apparently in order to leave, in case the 



342 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

affair should in any way cost him his life, a record of 
his sentiments on duelling, and of his conduct in rela 
tion to the challenge, made the following minutes of 
his conversation with Majors Fish and Armstrong : 

" Newburgh, January 15th, 1783. Major Fish and Major 

t~ Armstrong delivered me a letter, of this date, from Colonel 

r if &gt; Udny Hay, referring to a letter of mine, dated the 26th of 

August, 1781, to Governor Clinton, in which I enclosed the 

papers exhibiting a state of the dispute between Colonel 

Hay and me, relative to the West Chester forage used by 

the army in July and August, 1781. In that letter Colonel 

Hay says I endeavored to represent him in an ignominious 

light ; for which, in the letter now delivered me by Major 

Fish and Major Armstrong, he demands atonement, either 

by a proof of the assertions I had made in my letter to the 

Governor, * or in such other manner as it would be equally 

improper in him not to demand, as in me to refuse to 

grant. 

"The two gentlemen, bearers of Colonel Hay s letter, 
said, that, if I chose the first of the two modes above men 
tioned, Colonel Hay was ready, or willing, to have the 
matter laid before some officers to be mutually chosen by 
us ; or to admit of a retraction of my assertions. 

" We had considerable conversation on the subject, in the 
course of which I expressed my consent to have the affair 
laid before officers mutually chosen ; that, whenever I had 
done an injury to any man, I should cheerfully make him 
reparation ; that, when convinced of an error, I thought it 
infinitely more honorable to retract than to maintain it. 

" The gentlemen withdrew to dine, agreeably to their 
engagements. On th.eir return, after dinner, it appeared 
that they had seen Colonel Hay. They then showed me a 
note to this effect, as nearly as I can recollect, namely : 
that, if the affair were referred to the judgment of officers 
mutually chosen, and they should decide against me, I 
should either fight Colonel Hay, or make concessions, and 



MT. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 343 

accordingly write one letter to Governor Clinton, and one 
letter to Colonel Hay, of which they should be at liberty 
to make such use as they should think proper. 

" On this we (Major Fish, Major Armstrong, and myself) 
had some conversation, the result of which was to this effect : 
I repeated my readiness to make reparation for an injury, 
on its being made to appear; that so much time had elapsed 
since the dispute between us had happened, I presumed 
Colonel Hay s resentments had cooled, as well as my own ; 
that the affair would now admit of a temperate discussion ; 
that if it should appear that I had pronounced my suspi 
cions of Colonel Hay, at which he had taken offence, on 
too slight grounds (for I had only expressed my suspicions, 
though, perhaps, in strong terms), I should not hesitate to 
declare it ; that I presumed Colonel Hay would not demand 
any mean concessions, neither would I make them, and 
that I would sooner die than deny the truth ; that I should, 
if decided to have committed an error, be ready to declare 
it in a letter to the Governor ; and, as it was observed that 
a retraction, to do justice, must be as public as the injurious 
assertion, so I should have no objection to insert in the 
letter to the Governor the same expression which I used 
in my former letter to him of the 26th of August, 1781, 
to wit, that it might be communicated as he should think 
proper. 

" As to the alternative of fighting, I was neither afraid 
nor ashamed to say, that I should not fight. Duelling was 
an absurd and barbarous practice. It decided not whether 
a man was, or was not, in an error, and sometimes scarcely 
whether he was brave or a coward ; that I had no doubt of 
Colonel Hay s intrepidity, I had heard it mentioned in some 
actions or enterprises at the northward ; * that I had con 
nections too tender to put my life at stake in such manner 
as was proposed ; that I was a poor man, and had a wife

heat of the action." Thacher s Military Journal, p. 211.

and three children, who would be miserable without me ; 
that, but for these, my attachments to life were very slen 
der ; that I was, besides, influenced by principles of reli 
gion against duelling ; that, from my first knowledge of 
things, I had ever held the practice in abhorrence, and 
determined not to give or accept a challenge ; that, how 
ever, if attacked, I should certainly defend myself; that, 
if any concessions I should think proper to make were not 
satisfactory to Colonel Hay, he must then take such meas 
ures as he saw fit. 

" The gentlemen observed that it was not Colonel Hay s 
wish to fight, but to settle the matter in the other way ; 
that duelling was (as I had described it) an absurd thing, 
which they both condemned, and that nothing but custom 
could be pleaded in favor of it ; that they knew many who 
were alike principled against it. They said that they inter 
fered as friends, and wished to have the affair amicably 
settled. 

" Resuming the subject, I observed, that I thought I 
had expressed my sentiments so clearly that nothing could 
be misunderstood. Very clearly, the gentlemen replied. 
Then, speaking again of duelling, I closed with these 
words, that &lt;I much less feared to die than to offend that 



Being who had given me existence. 



T. PICKERING." 



No allusion is found, in the manuscripts of Colonel 
Pickering, to the subsequent negotiation which must 
have taken place between him and the friends of 
Colonel Hay. The unpleasant affair was terminated 
by the following letter from Colonel Pickering to 
Governor Clinton : 

"NEWBURGH, March 8th, 1783. 

SIR, 

"On the 26th of August, 1781, I wrote to your Excel- 
1 A. lency a letter, enclosing copies of sundry papers relative to 



-0 



JET. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 345 

the forage taken by the army in West Chester County during 
that and the preceding month. 

"In that letter are two passages, which, Colonel Hay ob 
serves, detract from his reputation. The subject led me to 
notice a piece of scurrility published in London s paper of 
the 9th of August, of which, for the reasons mentioned in 
that letter, I supposed Colonel Hay to be the author. I 
believe every man of candor will think the circumstances 
there related warranted the suspicion. However, Colonel 
Hay s friends have assured me that he disavows it, declaring 
that he was not the author of it. I am satisfied with the 
declaration, and withdraw my suspicion. 

" In another part of the letter, there is expressed a sus 
picion that Colonel Hay was aiming, by the steps of which 
I complained, to get me removed from my office, with a 
view to introduce himself into the department. This origi 
nated in the manner there suggested ; but the circumstances 
alluded to, which, when the suspicion was raised, and while 
resentment was still awake, served to confirm it, I see, on a 
review, are too light to support it. This suspicion, there 
fore, without hesitation, I retract. 

"As divers inhabitants of this State took offence at my 
refusing to pay for the West Chester forage, and (I am 
sorry to hear) that refusal is still viewed in such a light by 
some as to prejudice my interest and reputation, I beg leave, 
on this occasion, to remark, that in this refusal it was not 
possible for me to have any personal views ; nor could it be 
imagined that I would knowingly do wrong, at the hazard of 
my character, to save the value of that forage to the public ; 
yet I have been accused of intentional injustice, although I 
acted in strict conformity to the opinion of the Commander- 
in-Chief, expressed to me on the occasion. This I publicly 
avowed at the time. But I have since accidentally met with 
other evidence of it than my own declaration. This is 
contained in the letter of General B^ville, Quartermaster- 
General to the French army, of which I request permission 
to enclose a copy. This letter was in answer to mine 

VOL. I. 44 



346 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

requesting returns of the horses and cattle of the French 
army, while they lay in West Chester county, to be 
transmitted to General Heath, to be communicated to the 
arbitrators.* 

" Under this view of the affair, I persuade myself your 
Excellency will think me excusable in refusing to ac 
knowledge the United States debtor to the owners of the 
soil where the forage in question was taken. Certificates 
to ascertain the quantities so taken, to be produced in proof 
of their claims, if the latter were admitted by Congress, I 
did not deny them. I cannot, therefore, but think myself 
unfortunate to be for this cause an object of displeasure to 
any individual in the State. f 

* The letter from General Beville, dated Williamsburg, April 30th, 1782, 
says, " The foraging of the French army about the camp of Phillipsburg 
has been in consequence of the orders of Count de Rochambeau, who had been 
told by his Excellency, General Washington, that we ought to consider our 
selves as being upon an enemy s ground, and behave accordingly, because the 
greatest part of the country was inhabited by disaffected people, and the former 
properties of the friends of the cause were by that time, and had been long 
ago, entirely forsaken. Indeed, the forage which has been moved was noth 
ing but wild grass, and would have remained useless ; no value could be fixed 
upon it. 

" In regard to the dry forage already collected in the barns, we have taken 
it, sword in the hand, on the sea-shore, down upon the Sound, and almost in 
sight of the enemy, because we knew that the same forage was engaged to be 
soon after delivered to the enemy. You know, Sir, that it is a constant rule 
in war not to pay anything for the forage when it is intended for the enemy. 

" However, we keep good registers, and are able to produce a right and full 
account of our consumption, if we are ordered to do it by his Excellency, 
General Washington." 

t At a later period letters on business passed between Colonel Hay and 
Colonel Pickering, showing that neither party cherished unkind feelings to 
wards the other. Thus, Colonel Hay writes, on the 12th of August, 1788, 
"Accept of my sincere congratulations on your return to your family from 
your late equally extraordinary as unmerited confinement,* and believe me to 
be, with every sentiment of respect," &c. In his answer, October 8th, Colo 
nel Pickering says, "I feel myself sensibly obliged by your congratulations," 
&c. Again, January 19th, 1792, when Colonel Pickering was Postmaster- 
General, Colonel Hay wrote, " Should you have an inclination to forward 
such a measure, and choose to enter into a contract with me [for carrying the

THE facility with which the government of the 
United States, from time to time during the recent 
attempt of the Southern States to secede from the 
Union, raised enormous sums of money, presents an 
extraordinary contrast to the financial difficulties under 
which the Congress of the Confederation (and, in con 
sequence, the Quartermaster-General) were obliged to 
struggle. An illustrative instance of those difficulties 
is exhibited by the following passage in a letter from 
him to General Washington, in which the failure of 
the conveyance of letters is attributed to the want 
of the small amount required to pay express riders.* 
The emptiness of the public treasury was owing, not 
so much to the poverty of the country, as to the weak 
ness of Congress, whose powers were overshadowed 
by the " States Rights " of the period.

WINDSOR, January 17th, 1782. 

"Colonel Miles has informed me that delays have hap 
pened in the carriage of letters from Count de Rochambeau. 
The most probable cause is the want of money to support 
the expresses. Before I left Virginia, the chain was fixed 
from the Bowling Green northward, agreeably to your or 
ders ; and, fearing the want of money might occasion failures, 
I authorized Major Claiborne to apply to this use so much of 
the money arising from the sale of the stores at Yorktown 
as should be necessary. He was to sell such only as were 
not necessary for the public service. Mr. Yeates [Deputy 
Quartermaster for Maryland] informs me, that the want of 
money for the riders renders it extremely difficult for him 
to forward letters through his district." 

In the beginning of February. 1782, Colonel Pick 
ering went to Philadelphia for the purpose of making 
the arrangements necessary in his department for the 
ensuing campaign, expecting to stay a few weeks only ; 
but, in consequence of the inability of Mr. Morris, the 
Superintendent of Finance, to furnish him with the 
money required for the public service, he was obliged 
to remain there several months. 

In letters of the 8th,* 15th, and 16th of February, 
to the Commander-in-Chief, he states that a general 
return in his department is forming, which, from the 
multiplicity of articles, will be voluminous, and that he 
will, as soon as possible, complete it and lay it before 
his Excellency. In the mean time, he submits to his 
consideration some things on which an early decision 
seemed requisite. 

In some of his suggestions he had regard to economy 
in the expenditure of the public money. Thus, in 
concurrence with the opinion of General Lincoln, the 

* See Sparks s " Correspondence of the Revolution," Vol. III. p. 477. 



350 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1782. 

Secretary of War, he was in favor of purchasing the 
ox-teams required for the ensuing campaign, in prefer 
ence to hiring them; as he found, on making an estimate, 
that the first mode would be attended with much less 
expense. Again, the number of horses with the army, 
he said, was so small, compared with the number when 
the horse-yard was established, that the care of the 
yard might be committed to the Wagon-master-General. 
It was then under the charge of a separate officer, 
called the Superintendent of the Horse-yard. Fur 
ther, it had been customary to have a Superintendent 
of the Roads, to direct the necessary repairs ; but he 
Said the good condition of the roads particularly con 
cerned the Wagon-master-General, and to him the 
direction of the repairs might be left. The Wagon- 
master-General, he thought, would be able to perform 
these two services without difficulty. On the other 
hand, although he confessed it was "an ungracious time 
to propose measures that would increase the public 
expenses," nevertheless, he thought it reasonable, and 
accordingly proposed, that additions should be made 
to the salaries and to the number of rations of some 
of the officers in his department. In general, his sug 
gestions met with the approval of the Commander-in- 
Chief. 

A letter to Mrs. Pickering, dated at Philadelphia, Feb 
ruary 19th, 1782, manifests a readiness to incommode 
himself rather than urge his just claims against an 
impoverished public treasury. Having mentioned that 
he had drawn upon his brother for a hundred dollars, 
and upon his brother-in-law Mr. Williams for four hun 
dred, he adds: 

" I have desired some land may be sold, if this draught 
proved inconvenient to Mr. Williams. I chose to make 



JET. 36.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 351 

this draught rather than beg even niy dues from the 
public." 

In the same letter he expresses his opinion of a 
fashion which was satirized by Addison early in the 
last century, and, after one or more intermediate revi 
vals, has lately been resuscitated. 

" There is here a Mrs. Lloyd, an English lady, celebrated 
for her beauty : she almost engrosses the conversation of 
the town. . . . She is introducing, I am told, the odious 
fashion of hoops. The emulation of all classes here (Friends 
exceptcd) to imitate the extravagance of the prevailing fash 
ions will bring many a family to distress, if not to ruin. I 
am happy that this circumstance is of so little consequence 
to me personally, and that you possess a prudence and dis 
cretion so perfectly accommodated to my situation. 

" I was never more impatient to see you and our sweet 
boys. I have yet much to do ; enough, I fear, to keep me 
here yet three weeks. General Washington is going to 
Newburgh as soon as his arrangements here are made ; per 
haps in four weeks." 

He wrote to Mrs. Pickering again on the 21st : 

" Of my private money, received for my bills on Mr. 
Williams and my brother, I have advanced upwards of a 
hundred dollars on public account ; if, therefore, you should 
need any money before my return, ask Mr. Auspach to sup 
ply you." 

On the 24th, however, he sent her forty crowns, that 
she might " not have occasion to ask any money from 
Mr. Anspach." 

On the 8th of April, the anniversary of his marriage, 
he gave utterance to his feelings in the following letter 
to his wife : 



352 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1782. 

" Hail, happy day ! May the sun ever shine upon thee, 
with rays equally bright and benign ! On this auspicious 
day, my clear Becky, we joined our hands ! On this day, 
as the years revolve, let us ever join our hearts in grate 
ful praise to that kind Providence, which, by a variety of 
unlooked-for events, effected our union ! How much hap 
piness has already resulted from it ! How much more do 
we pleasingly anticipate ! Even those untoward circum 
stances, which, for the moment, occasioned an interruption 
of it, the war especially, which has so often, and for so 
long periods, put us asunder, will ultimately heighten 
our enjoyments. We shall better know the value of domes 
tic sweets. Domestic joys apart, the world has no allure 
ments. Possessing them, with health, the world cannot 
destroy our peace." 

To the minds of many of his contemporaries, Colonel 
Pickering presented himself only in the character of 
forbidding sternness ; and the idea was countenanced 
by the general earnestness, and occasionally the vehe 
mence, of his expressions, as well in his speeches and 
writings as in conversation, against political or other 
abuses and the authors of them. But many of his 
letters (some of them already quoted) show that his 
disposition was marked by habitual benevolence and a 
ready sympathy. The following passages in two letters 
to his wife are inserted as evidence of the tenderness of 
his nature ; the rather, as they relate to his son John 
Pickering, afterwards well known as an American 
scholar. In the first letter are some just observa 
tions respecting the manner of treating children. 

" PHILADELPHIA, April 15th, 1782. 

" I spent yesterday (Sunday) at the Falls [of Schuylkill]. 
I took John* with me. General Mifflin and Mrs. Minim

returned from Reading before night, which gave an oppor 
tunity of their seeing John. He pretty readily accepted 
the General s hand, but I could not persuade him to go to 
Mrs. Miiflin. He is too much abashed before all strangers ; 
yet, in such cases, he seems to show more of a sturdy, un 
complying disposition than of shame [diffidence] . In such 
cases, most people are apt to be importunate in their ques 
tions and entreaties addressed to him ; which only makes 
the matter worse. Besides, not one in fifty uses the soft, 
alluring tone of fond affection : they do not feel it ; and 
this is riot strange. Even those who have children find 
their affections generally confined to their own offspring ; 
or, if they look on others with any degree of delight, such 
children must possess some extraordinary qualities of coun 
tenance and disposition. Parents are, I believe, too apt 
to expect a like earnest and fond attention from others, 
towards their children, as they feel themselves. I have 
taken some pains to reason myself into a contrary opinion 
and conduct, as this is to think justly, and is the way to 
prevent frequent mortifications. . . . Early last evening, 
John said he wanted to go home, that is, to Nancy, at our 
house ; and, being urgent, I indulged him, going with him 
myself. But yet I could not persuade him to stay without 
me. The moment he discovered that I was going to lodge 
at the General s, he insisted on going over with me ; and I 
was obliged ( Ah, papa ! you will cry) to gratify him. 
Before sunrise I rose and left him. He awaked before I 
returned, got up, dressed himself, and, running into the 
other room, asked eagerly, * Where is my papa? He 
waited, however, with tolerable patience, till I returned. 
To wean him a little from this attachment to me, I thought 
it best to leave him to-day with Nancy ; but it grieved me 
to slip away from him, though he had before half consented 
to stay, on my telling him I would come up again to 
morrow. Always when I have been alone with him, he 
asked questions and conversed with an air and countenance 
so sweet, he won greatly on my affections."

"PHILADELPHIA, April 29th, 1782. 

" This day, at farthest, I had fixed for my departure ; but 
Mr. Morris is not ready for me, and desires me to stay still 
longer, without determining the day when he can let me go. 
I hope, however, he will ascertain this in two or three days. 
I am extremely uneasy at this detention. 

" I was yesterday (Sunday) at Mr. Peters s. They have 
moved to Belmont. ... I took John with me. After 
dinner I crossed over to the Falls, and should have re 
turned to town in the evening, if John would have parted 
with me ; but he cried so piteously I could not leave him ; 
and he was so jealous of my giving him the slip, that when 
I proposed going over only to General Mifflin s, he said I 
meant to go to town ; and I could not pacify him until I 
pulled out my watch and left it in pledge for my return. 
This morning I brought him with me to the city." 

The late John Lowell, Esquire, in a letter to 
John Pickering, dated " Roxbury, November 8th, 
1823," says: 

" I send you an interesting letter from your father to 
Congress in 1782, a copy of which he sent to mine, probably 
because he was at that time in Congress and your father 
wished his support in a most just and honorable claim. It 
shows that, forty-one years since, your father had the same 
perspicuity of style, frankness, disinterestedness, public 
spirit, and self-devotion which have marked his whole life. 
... I think extracts from it might be very properly and ad 
vantageously used ; and surely, when Adams and Jefferson, 
two originally bitter enemies (or their friends, I know not 
who) combine to blast his fame, and that of my father, it 
is time to vindicate both ; not by paragraphs in newspapers, 
but by authentic facts in an historical form, which will for 
ever put at rest all doubts about their public services, and 
place where they ought to be their accusers. 

... " When I speak of Jefferson s combining with Mr. 
Adams, I refer to a late letter from Jefferson to Adams, in 



MT. 36.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 355 

which he tells him he does not think the worse of him for 
the horrible abuse of himself in the Cunningham Letters, and 
proceeds to frost over his old enemy with the whitest loaf- 
sugar, interspersed with cornucopias and sugar-plums.* 

" Just before Mr. Adams wore ship to follow in the wake 
of his son, who had just gone in stays, f he said in my 
presence, with great emotion, Jefferson is the deepest 
dissembler and most artful hypocrite I ever knew and no 
man knew him better. Forgiveness is an ennobling virtue. 

" I have this moment had Jefferson s letter to Adams read 
to me by one of his [Adams s] relatives, who was ordered 
never to let a copy of it go from him or from his family. It 
is, in truth, a queer document. I refused to hear it, because 
I would not be intrusted with a secret. I refused again ; 
but it was insisted upon that I should, and I submitted. 
It is nothing but that mutual enemies exasperated them 
against each other improperly, and they had now kissed and 
made up." 

A memorandum by Colonel Pickering, dated the 10th 
of November, 1823, concerning those papers, says: 

" In a letter . . . from John Lowell, Esquire, to my son, 
John Pickering, was the following statement [two letters] in 
my handwriting, done at Philadelphia in April, 1782, during 
our Revolutionary war. I copy it now, because my letter-f| 
books and papers relating to the Quartermaster s department 
are not to be found. When, in 1787, I moved with my 
family from Philadelphia to Wyoming, I left in a chest or 
chests, or trunks, all those books and papers in the office 
of the Commissary of Military Stores, then kept at Carpen 
ter s Hall, Samuel Hodgdon the Commissary. J

William Cunningham, Esq." Boston, 1823, pp. 10, 131, 145, 197 ; also, an 
extract from Mr. Jefferson s letter in The Life of Thomas Jefferson, by Ran 
dall, Vol. III. p. 493. 

t This is an allusion to the conduct of John Quincy Adams and his father 
in joining the Democratic party during the presidency of Jefferson, on the 
occasion of laying an embargo. 

J It seems not improbable that they were afterwards deposited in the office 



356 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1782. 

"The statement was found by Mr. Lowell among his 
father s papers ; and to his father, then a member of Con 
gress, I must have sent it, that he might be fully acquainted 
with the subject, and prepared to advocate the claims or 
support the objections I presented to the committee of 
Congress, so far as he should deem them well founded, when 
the report of that committee should be discussed." 

It appears that a report of the committee, consisting 
of Messrs. Cornell, Scott, and Dickinson, was referred to 
the Secretary of War, and that, on his report, Congress 
passed a resolution, April 23d, that supernumerary lieu 
tenants who should accept employments in the staff 
departments, should be entitled to the pay and sub 
sistence belonging to their rank in the line, as a com 
pensation for their services in the staff, without any 
other allowance whatsoever.* 

The same committee prepared another report, as 
follows : 

"The committee appointed to arrange the officers in the 
staff departments of the army, and to fix their pay, on con 
ference with the Secretary at War, beg leave to submit the 
following resolutions : 

"Resolved, That all resolutions passed before the 22d day 
of April, 1782, so far as they respect the several grades, 
pay, and allowances [of officers] in the Quartermaster- 
General s department, serving with the armies of the United 
States, be, and they are, hereby repealed. 

" That there be one Quartermaster-General to the armies 
of the United States, who shall be appointed by Congress, 

of the Secretary of War, and were consumed when that building was burned 
down in 1800. If not destroyed, it is remarkable that the ardor of historical 
research respecting the Kevolution has not brought them to light. Some 
books and papers relating to the accounts of Colonel Pickering, as Quarter 
master-General, have come into my hands since his death ; but very few of 
these have an historical value. 

* Journals of Congress, Vol. VII. p. 358. 



^T. 36.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 357 

and receive the same pay as a major-general, and his other 
allowances shall be the same as those of a brigadier. 

"That the Quartermaster-General appoint the following 
officers in his department, who shall do such duties in the 
department as he shall direct ; to be taken from the line of 
the army. 

" That there be one deputy quartermaster to the South 
ern army, who shall receive the pay of a brigadier-general, 
including his pay as an officer in the line of the army, and 
also the rations and subsistence allowed by the resolutions 
of the 22d of April, 1782, which shall include what he is 
entitled to in the line of the army, and forage for three 
horses. 

"That there be one deputy quartermaster to the main 
army from the line of field officers, who shall receive fifteen 
dollars per month in addition to his pay in the line, and 
as many assistant-quartermasters to the main and separate 
armies as he may think necessary and the Secretary at War 
approve of, to be taken from the lieutenants of the army, 
agreeably to the resolution of the 23d of April, 1782, who 
shall each be allowed forage for one horse. 

" That there be two wagon-masters for the main and South 
ern army, who shall not be below the rank of captain, and 
be allowed, in addition to their pay in the line of the army, 
each fifteen dollars per mouth, and forage for two horses, 
including what they are allowed in the line. 

"That there be two forage-masters for the main and South 
ern army, to be taken from the line of the army in the same 
manner, each of whom shall be entitled to the same allow 
ances as the wagon-master. 

"Resolved, That Colonel Timothy Pickering be, and he 
is, continued Quartermaster-General." 

In regard to these resolutions. Colonel Pickering 
addressed to the committee the two following; letters,

being the " statement " furnished by Mr. Lowell : 



358 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1782. 

"PHILADELPHIA, April 27th, 1782. 

" GENTLEMEN, 

" You were yesterday pleased to put into my hands your 
proposed arrangement relative to my department. I have 
read it with attention ; and, after the fullest consideration 
of it, if I give my opinion, I must pronounce it imprac 
ticable : 

" Because no gentlemen of the line will undertake some 
of the most important and burdensome offices for the trifling 
additional pay to be allowed them ; 

" Because among the deranged lieutenants suitable char 
acters to perform many duties of assistants in my department 
may probably not be found ; in which case recourse must be 
had to the line ; 

"Because, the duties of captains and subalterns in the 
line being light and easy, and not employing a fourth part 
of their time, they will not quit those stations (which at 
the same time are posts of military honor) and submit to 
the constant drudgery of business in my department for 
nothing ; 

" Because there are some duties in the department which 
commissioned officers will think it derogatory to their char 
acters to perform ; 

"Because it will compel the dismission of some staff 
officers who have served as long, and with as much merit, 
as any of the deranged lieutenants, and whose experience 
also in their offices clearly entitles them to a preference for 
the public good ; and 

"Because, by the rules prescribed by the committee, 
officers who were deranged in 1780, by virtue of the resolves 
of October 3d and 21st, but accepted offices in my depart 
ment, must now be dismissed ; while, by the same rules, 
provision is to be made for officers at this time deranged in 
the manner directed by the same resolves ; which, doubt 
less, will be deemed an unjust distinction. 
" I have the honor to be," &c. 

" TIMOTHY PICKERING, Q. M. G." 



MT. 36.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 359 

To the same committee he wrote again : 

"PHILADELPHIA, April. 29th, 1782. 

" GENTLEMEN, 

" In stating my objections to the arrangements you have 
proposed respecting my department, I passed over unnoticed 
the proposition relating to myself, for I did not observe that 
it would produce an alteration of the appointments originally 
granted to me ; but it seems I was mistaken, and that by 
the expression * his other allowances shall be those of a brig 
adier, the committee meant to comprehend only provisions 
and forage. But to this alteration I have abundant reason 
to object. 

" If the committee will recur to the Journals of Congress 
of the 5th of August, 1780, they will find the following 
resolves.* . . . 

" These resolutions, I conceive, show sufficient cause why 
my original appointments should not be changed ; and the 
committee will probably think it unnecessary for me to offer 
any other reasons. Nevertheless, I would not rest myself 
on these resolves, but willingly relinquish a part of my pay, 
if it appeared to me at all disproportioned to the importance, 
the duties, and the responsibility of the office. For my 
views were never mercenary. I never wished to make a 
fortune in a public office. That I now hold was given me 
unsolicited, and accepted with reluctance ; for the crisis was 
too important, the emergency too extraordinary, the em 
barrassments arising from the public poverty too distressing, 
to render the office desirable. If a knowledge of the per 
plexities of Congress on that occasion, if honor or profit, if 
any private views whatever, had influenced me, I might have 
made conditions, and obtained terms much more advan 
tageous. But I felt no such disposition. I wished not to 
embarrass, but to relieve, and therefore accepted the office 
with such appointments as Congress voluntarily granted me. 
The committee have proposed that my pay should be the 

* Quoted before. See page 251. 



360 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1782. 

same as a major-general s ; but I have too little vanity, or 
too much pride, to feel the least elevation on the comparison ; 
nor do I know why his pay should be the measure of mine, 
when the two offices bear so slight a resemblance. His is a 
life of ease and pleasure ; mine, of uninterrupted anxiety and 
toil. For half the year a major-general may be on furlough, 
and of the other half he may spend three fourths in his 
private amusements, or the enjoyment of his friends : but 
with my office such indulgences are impracticable ; not a 
day passes in which I am free from public business or pub 
lic cares. Though I make no pretensions to military skill, 
yet I am sufficiently informed of the common duty of a 
general officer to know that it is extremely light and easy. 
He may, indeed, be exposed to danger in battle, perhaps 
once in a year; and, if he possesses extraordinary talents, 
having a command, he will then exhibit them, and be 
rewarded with glory. But I am not exempted from danger. 
In a general action I must follow the Commander-in-Chief, 
and be exposed to every hazard that attends his person or 
the delivery of his orders. 

" In regard to the persons necessary to be employed under 
me, I desire nothing more than will induce proper charac 
ters to engage in the public service. I have no attachments 
to any now in office beyond what their conduct in office has 
produced. Among them all, one only was known to me 
previous to my appointment. Where a regard to justice 
and the public good do not require their continuance, I shall 
very cheerfully endeavor to supply their places with gentle 
men from the line, that, as far as possible, the expenses of 
the department may be reduced ; and whatever arrangements 
Congress shall adopt I will diligently strive to carry into 
execution ; only, if by blending of characters, or too rigid 
an economy, some necessary offices become vacant, for 
any failure in consequence thereof I shall not be deemed 
responsible." 



MT. 36.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 361 

It does not appear by the Journals of Congress that 
the report commented on in these letters was ever 
laid before that body. The committee may have been 
satisfied with Colonel Pickering s reasoning, and so 
have concluded to let the matter drop. An attempt 
had been made before, in March, by two members from 
New Jersey, to reduce his compensation to the pay and 
allowance of a major-general ; but their motion was set 
aside by the previous question, all but one of the other 
members voting against them.* 

* Colonel Pickering s original pay, independent of rations and forage, was 
thirty-four hundred and ninety-two dollars per annum; the pay of a major- 
general, nineteen hundred and ninety- two dollars. By resolutions of Congress 
of the 23d and 29th of October and the 3d of December, 1782, the pay of the 
Quartermaster-General was established at two thousand dollars per annum, 
and the value of his rations at seven hundred and twenty dollars, from and 
after the 1st of January, 1783.

buying and cultivating Wild Land in Vermont. 

COLONEL PICKERING S friend, Mrs. Higginson, having 
become impatient of her exile in Halifax, returned to 
Salem before the contest with the mother country was 
ended.* Finding that the animosity against her still 
existed, and apprehending persecution from some of 
her townsmen, she wrote a letter to Colonel Pickering, 
dated at Beverly, May 28th, 1782, asking for advice 
and assistance from him and Mr. John Lowell, then a 
member of Congress. She says : 

" My desire to return to my native laud has been uniform ; 
and, as I advanced in life, I have thought it every year more 
necessary, as I could not think of leaving one that I ought 
to provide for, destitute, dependent, and absent from her 
connections, in case I should be taken away. This, joined 
with your desire, and the repeated desire of many of my 
friends here, and the ardent inclination Hetty had to revisit 
and fix here, brought me last fall to a determination to take 
the first opportunity to return ; which I should have done 
then, but the only cartel after that was so crowded that I 
could not effect my purpose. My friend and father, j Dr. 
Prince, this spring got permission from Sir Andrew Snape 
Hammond for the schooner Patty to become a cartel ; and, 
after every legal step was properly attended to, and the 
strictest attention paid that nothing that could possibly give

offence should happen, I embarked, and, after a passage 
of four days, arrived in Salem harbor, where I desired the 
captain to hail a boat, and sent on shore for leave from the 
Selectmen to laud, with my daughter, which was immedi 
ately granted ; and I was met on the wharf by numbers who 
gave me a hearty welcome, and the next day I had leave 
to land my baggage. . . . Thus far I was happy; but, 
the next day, one or two (for there were no more) made 
it their business to stir up some, and a certain Doctor of 
Divinity * was doing all in his power that I might be sent 
back. My friends thought it best I should go to Boston, 
and be in the way, in case I should be called on by author 
ity. There, also, I had friends, and waited from Wednes 
day to Saturday without being notified to appear. On my 
return to Salem, I found that my being there was disagree 
able ; and my friends and relations in Beverly had been to 
see me while I was at Boston, and invited me to see them. 
On Sunday morning I went there. When I left Halifax it 
was judged we were on the eve of a peace, and I knew not 
of a law that would operate against me, but hoped to find 
you and Mr. Lowell in the Massachusetts, whose friendship 
I depended on, and whose advice and assistance would have 
been a support and comfort to me. I came to stay, and am 
too far advanced in life to take an unnecessary voyage, if I 
can avoid it without creating a disturbance in the State. . . . 
I would write Mr. Lowell, but it would be only copying 
this ; for I have endeavored to state my case as exactly as 
my fatigued situation will permit me, and hope my towns 
men will not hurry me to depart out of this State till I can 
hear from you, which I hope will be by the return of the 
post." 

Colonel Pickering replied : 

" PHILADELPHIA, June 19th, 1782. 

" I was happy to hear of your arrival, which the news 
papers first announced to me, though you were not named ; 

* The Rev. Dr. Whitaker. 



364 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1782. 

and more happy to know it of a certainty by the receipt of 
your letter, little suspecting the embarrassments you recite 
in the last part of it. 

" I have been so long absent from Massachusetts (three 
years and a half), I know very little about its affairs ; but 
Mr. Lowell gave me a very sensible relief, when he informed 
me of divers cases, clearly much more exceptionable, in the 
view of the law, than yours, where nevertheless the parties 
have been suffered to return and remain unmolested. From 
his account of the matter, I persuade myself you will meet 
with very little trouble, except from such worthless charac 
ters as a certain [Doctor of Divinity] , 

who, conscious of their infamy, greedily seize every op 
portunity of acquiring some little popularity, therewith to 
varnish over their crimes and cover their reproach. But 
the efforts of such wretches will be fruitless against the 
powerful support of such numbers of gentlemen of the 
first character and influence in Massachusetts who are your 

friends ; and, if the virulence of that (call him by 

the name he merits) should urge him to push every legal 
advantage, I should even hope an exception might be ob 
tained in your favor by a special Act of the Assembly. 

" Mr. Lowell has promised to write to divers of his friends 
on the subject, and to enumerate the various cases that have 
occurred within his recollection, to be advanced as prece 
dents against your persecutors. 

" I should be singularly happy to see you and Hetty, but 
I much doubt whether I shall be able to visit Massachusetts 
till the war is over. I beg you and her to accept my kindest 
wishes for your peace and welfare. . . . 

"P. S. Mr. Lowell observed that it would be best not 
to throw yourself in the way of inquiries, or seek any for 
mal admittance, but to be quiet and silent."

friends, and by marriage a nephew, was Dr. Joseph 
Orne, a skilful physician and a man of genius. A

few letters passed between them during the Revolu 
tion. In one, dated at Salem, June, 1782, Dr. Orne 
writes : 

DEAK SIR, 

" I won t pretend that any of my letters have miscarried, 
which, you know, is a very common apology for negligence ; 
for, in truth, I own I have not written to you these two 
years. I have observed that letter- writing is always taken 
up by idle people for amusement, or by busy people as 
business. As we grow old, and our domestic or secular 
concerns impress our attention, we give less to our friends, 
that we may have the more to ourselves ; and no juvenile 
amusement whatever is so generally and so certainly laid 
aside, as writing letters of friendship and acquaintance. 

"But, if I neglect any, I have not forgotten all my friends. 
I never recollect the many interesting and agreeable hours 
you and I have enjoyed together, but with a strange mixture 
of pleasure and regret ; and though, Heaven knows, I would 
not wish to travel again through this world, yet I would give 
much to transfer many of the happier scenes of it to this 
hour, and give them one more cordial enjoyment. 

" I am weary to death of this dreadful war. It is attended 
with such irregular distribution of property, such inversion 
of order, such decay of morals, so much public distress and 
private extravagance, that a man who knows and wishes the 
real advantage of mankind cannot look on the whole without 
pain. And I own it gives me a melancholy pang every 
time I reflect that my country will to me, probably, never 
again be in peace ; for we have been so often disappointed 
in our hopes, that I have learned to place no degree of con 
fidence in the fine stories told us of the probability of this 
blessed event. 

" I suppose you do not often get a minute account of the 
state of matters among your friends here ; and, as I feel 
unusually stupid this afternoon, I can luckily avail myself 
of your curiosity for the anecdotes and stories of the day 
at Salem.

"Now, blessed, I say, be those nimble heads (I never had 
one of them) who can run you through a hundred pages 
without treading on one matter of fact the whole way. It 
seems to me as mysterious as for a man to go from one 
place to another without passing through the intermediate 
space, a piece of legerdemain which St. Thomas Aquinas 
thinks may be a note or two above the address of common 
devils. I never could get a pair of stilts of this sort that 
suited my imagination. Whenever I have trusted myself 
only a moderate distance from good, honest terra fir ma, I 
have always repented it. ... I wove this in, my friend, 
as an interior and inherent mark of the genuineness of this

non obstante) , and as she is personally as disagreeable to 
the people as any male absentee, there was so great a fer

her friends at Beverly. P. H., by the way, poor devil ! is

when people have been raised by the war from the lowest

" This town suffers now pretty severely for the intoxica 
tion of past successes. We have almost constantly large 
men-of-war in our sight, and they take a deal of property 
from the merchants. For my part, being altogether occu

God help the while, I slide along merrily enough. Having 
(and I devoutly thank Heaven for the boon) a wife formed 
on purpose to make a man happy, when I look round, after 
so long a shipwreck, and see myself again settled entirely 
to my wishes, and my children so admirably directed and 
supplied, and attended with so much tenderness and human 
ity, I declare, Pickering, I forget I ever was miserable for 
a moment.

368 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1782. 

Colonel Pickering answered Dr. Orne in a letter 
dated at New Windsor, August 18th, 1782. 

" The business in which, for two years past, I have been 
engaged, has left me less time than I could formerly com- 
mand to write to my friends ; and yet, in all that period, I 
might have wrote often, if my leisure moments had been 
improved. But I believe you have assigned one true reason 
of our mutual silence ; to which I may add, that, however 
strong our friendships, however warm our affections, a 
long-continued separation greatly abates their force. Tis 
almost four years since we took each other by the hand, 
and in a space short of four years you have forgotten an 
affliction that drew from us mutual tears ! Happy forget- 
f illness ! We should thank Heaven for the boon, which 
lessens the miseries of human life ! I congratulate you, 
my dear Sir, that you are again so happily settled that 
you can forget the days wherein you were afflicted ; or, if 
they recur (and we would not altogether lose the powei 
of recollection), the remembrance of them serves but to 
make the heart more tender, and thence more sensible of 
present joys. 

" I thank you for the remembrance of my wife. I have 
a most affectionate one, whose highest wish is to make me 
happy. This has induced a cheerful acquiescence in all the 
circumstances (some not the most pleasing) of my varied 
life. Wearied at last with changes, and sick of the vagrant 
life of a soldier, and her family increasing, I have now fixed, 
as she wished, her residence for the war. At present she 
has an agreeable situation on the banks of the Schuylkill, 
five miles from Philadelphia. I parted from her last Mon 
day. She had greatly recovered from the ill health in which 
she left the dirty spot where I am now writing. Her three 
boys were with her, and will furnish abundant scope for her 
attention, as well as her affections. . . . 

" You will, perhaps, be surprised to hear me say that I 
do not feel that attachment to my native soil with which I 



JEx. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 369 

grew up ! But I have been absent from it so long, have 
seen so many other places where a man may be happy, 
and, where my family resides, finding that to be my home, 
I should now, with few painful sensations, relinquish it for 
ever as a place of residence. In that spot where I could 
find the best support for my family, accompanied with the 
means of educating my children, there, with satisfaction, I 
could pitch my tent, and bid to Salem and to Massachusetts 
a lasting adieu ! Not that every part of the Union is alike 
to me ; my affections still flow in what you will deem their 
natural order, towards Salem, Massachusetts, New 
England, the Union at large. I have resided a longer or 
shorter time in several of the States, and had some inter 
course with the citizens of them all. In every place we 
may form some connections to replace those we lose ; and 
in any place, other circumstances being agreeable, I find I 
could be contented. 

" I am weary of this dreadful war, but shall never live 
to see the end of it. You have not forgot, I see, to 
speak in hyperboles. But what limits have you set to 
your existence? Do you expect to quit the stage in ten 
years? or even in twenty? If Heaven or the healing art 
preserve you one,* I dare venture to say you will see your 
country in peace. With pleasure I have often looked for 
ward to this period, and ever felt a singular reluctance at 
the thought of quitting the world before its arrival ; but, 
that arrived, I could for myself, with a degree of resigna 
tion, sing, JVimc dimittis. Yet I confess my wish to live 
still longer. I wish to see my country rise in agriculture, 
arts, and commerce, beyond any former period of her exist 
ence ; and there is good ground to expect that she will 
exhibit an instance of rapid and prosperous increase, of 
which the world can produce no example. 

" I have been very angry with you and some others at 
Salem, that you have kept me in ignorance of every domes 
tic occurrence these two years. ... I still know but little 

* Dr. Orne died in 1786. 
VOL. I. 47 



370 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1782. 

of the state of most of the families of my friends, in whose 
happiness I feel myself interested. 

" I do not certainly promise myself a visit to Salem till 
the war is ended. It will give me great pleasure to see my 
friends. Some whom I include in that description are yet 
unknown ; but, for the sake of those I know, and to whom 
they are dear, I value them ; and to all, who shall inquire 
after me, I beg you to present my affectionate regards." 

Although at one time Colonel Pickering had indulged 
in sanguine expectations of engaging in a profitable 
business as a commission merchant in Philadelphia, he 
felt that the want of a larger capital stock than he pos 
sessed would be a serious obstacle to success. In con 
sequence, he entertained the idea of purchasing and 
cultivating a tract of wild land in Vermont, and wrote 
the following letter on the subject, addressed to General 
Ethan Allen. No answer, is found among Colonel Pick 
ering s manuscripts, and perhaps his letter may not 
have been sent ; but it shows his views, at the time, in 
regard to his future course of life. 

"NEWBURGH, August 4th, 1782. 
" SIR, 

" Having been engaged in public affairs from the com 
mencement of our dispute with Great Britain, and in the 
service of the United States since November, 1776, my 
employment also having precluded me from the smallest 
attention to my private concerns, my circumstances are 
by this time sufficiently distressing. When I look forward 
to thiretHudusion of the war, and view myself with a grow 
ing family totally unprovided for, I feel no small degree of 
anxiety. I see how difficult it will be to insert myself in 
business in the old States. To begin trade to advantage, a 
capital stuck will be requisite, to which my little patrimony 
is altogether inadequate ; and the public offices to which I 
might form pretensions are already filled by those who, 



j T . 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 371 

having remained at home, were at hand to step into any 
vacancy as it fell. Thus situated, my only resource is a 
new country, where lands can be obtained on easy terms ; 
where I can support myself, and make beneficial establish 
ments for my children. These views naturally point me to 
Vermont, where I shall be happy to become a proprietor ; 
and, though our acquaintance was so transient that you may 
perhaps have forgotten me, yet your own military character 
and generous disposition will, I am persuaded, induce you 
to listen with pleasure to the request of a fellow-soldier. I 
ask your friendly interposition and recommendation to those 
gentlemen who, with you, have influence in the councils of 
the State, to procure me a grant of a township, on the usual 
terms, or such as the government of Vermont shall have the 
goodness to indulge me with." 

On the presumption that the General Assembly of 
Vermont would regard the public services of their peti 
tioners, Colonel Pickering states, that, in the autumn of 
1776, he was vested with the command of a regiment 
of militia, raised in the county of Essex, with which he 
marched to reenforce the main army ; and that after 
wards he held, successively, the offices of Adjutant- 
General and member of the Continental Board of War. 
He says further : 

In 1780, on the resignation of Major-General Greene, 
being pressed by the unanimous call of Congress to fill the 
vacant office, I relinquished my seat at the War Office, and, 
though it was surrounded with embarrassments at that 
extraordinary emergency, I consented to take upon me the 
very important and burdensome, but to me unprofitable, 
office of Quartermaster-General, which I now hold. 

" This detail, I trust, you will not deem impertinent ; 
and your judgment and friendship will lead you to make 
the proper use of it. If my duty with the army will by 
any means permit, I shall, before winter, do myself the 



372 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1782. 

honor to wait on you, and gratify my wishes in viewing 
the rising State of Vermont. . . . 

" P. S. I take the freedom to enclose to your care 
and patronage a petition to the General Assembly of 
Vermont." 

In April, 1783, he says he has given up the inten 
tion of being concerned in lands in Vermont ; as the 
State of New York appeared to be determined to 
recover that territory, and the security of any grant 
which he might obtain under the government of 
Vermont would be doubtful.

CHAPTER XXVI. 

Illness of Colonel Pickering s Family. His Desire to return to 
Private Life. Toils and Vexations of his Office. Taxes. 
Sufferings of American Soldiers for Want of proper Food and 
Clothing. 

IN the autumn of 1782, Colonel Pickering was 
oppressed with the labors and perplexities of his 
office. He was likewise made anxious by the state 
of his family, whom, he had flattered himself, he had 
placed in a healthy and agreeable situation at the 
Falls of the Schuylkill. The fever and ague became 
prevalent there, and his wife, one of his children, a 
man-servant and two maid-servants, were ill, all at the 
same time, with that disheartening malady. Before 
their recovery, another child and another man-servant 
were seized with it, and the unhealthiness of the situa 
tion rendered it almost impossible to procure other 
servants to perform the duties of those who were thus 
disabled. These labors and afflictions, and his desire 
to escape from the trammels of office, are spoken of 
with much feeling in the following passages in letters 
to his wife and to his brother. 

To his wife, under the date of " Camp, Verplanck s 
Point, September 6th," he wrote : 

" The constant hurry I have been in since this day week 
(within which the army has moved) has almost prevented 
my thinking of you ; but, when a moment for recollection 
offers, I please myself with reflections on you and our sweet 
boys; and this is the only pleasure of that kind which for 



374 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1782. 

some months I expect to enjoy. We have both had great 
occasion for patience ; but the time fast approaches when 
we shall separate no more while life endures ; for I can 
scarcely contemplate anything with satisfaction but what is 
connected with the ease and tranquillity of a private citizen. 
This war once over, I shall wish to abandon for ever all 
public employments. To mark the progress of my growing 
trees, the increasing culture of my land, to reap the fruits 
of my own labor, to enjoy them with you and our smiling 
offspring, will yield more solid joys than the highest 
offices, than the most splendid titles, or than princely in- 



Again he wrote to her on the 12th of September : 

" Last Monday I received a letter from Major Hodgdon 
which greatly distressed me. By it I found that you and 
most of the family were sick. He comforted me, however, 
in the expectation that your indisposition was not danger 
ous, and that in a week or ten days all would probably be 
well. God grant it ! How happy would it make me could 
I now sit by you to administer relief with all the tenderness 
and attention which my affection could prompt ! Mrs. Flow 
er is extremely kind ; we have reason to value her friend 
ship, as well as Mr. Hodgdon s, for they are real friends in 
time of need. I hope, my dearest, that you, the children, 
and family will speedily recover. You must be careful of 
yourself, and, at all events, get such help about you as will 
prevent your having occasion for any fatigue : in such a case 
you must not regard the expense." 

In another letter to her, of the 19th of September, 
he makes inquiries about the produce of the land 
attached to the house occupied by her, and says : 

"I shall thank Heaven when my family, my fields, and 
flocks will be my only care. My life at present is a con 
stant scene of hurry, trouble, and vexation, which no per- 



2Er. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 375 

sonal considerations would influence me to endure. But 
the war will not last for ever ; I hope in God, not another 
campaign." 

In the following letter to his brother, in which he 
mentions the difficulties and vexations attending the 
execution of his office, he likewise commiserates the 
destitute condition of the sick soldiers, and contrasts it 
with the luxury indulged in by other citizens. Heavy 
taxes, he says, are the subject of general complaint. 
They would seem to be the inevitable consequence of 
every protracted war. 

" CAMP, VERPLANCK S POINT, September 22d, 1782. 

Evening, 9 o clock. 

" I received your, favor of last May by Captain Haffield 
White but a day or two since. He made an apology for its 
detention. I felt, as I ought, the kindness and affection 
expressed in it. The public is indeed to the last degree un 
grateful ; but I recollect once repeating a sentiment, that 
* the ingratitude of one s country should not deter a good man 
from serving it. Yet many times the trials of my patience 
are so severe, the difficulties and vexations I am obliged 
often to encounter are so intolerable, that I am frequently 
on the point of resolving to quit an office so burdensome 
and a service so ungrateful. No personal considerations 
would, indeed, tempt me to continue. My greatest source 
of relief is in the prospect of a speedy termination of the 
war. In this view I wish not to abandon the public service 
till I can enjoy the fruit of so much toil in the blessings 
of peace. 

"The latest accounts inform us of the embarkation of 
troops at New York, and many circumstances indicate an 
evacuation of it ; but tis an event by no means entirely 
depended on. . . . 

"I was astonished at the enormous amount of our taxes 
which you paid the last year. If all estates paid in the like 



376 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1782. 

proportion, instead of eight millions of dollars, the taxes 
would reach to as many pounds, besides the internal taxes 
of each state. Everybody, go where I will, is complaining 
of the heavy taxes ; yet those paid the United States are 
to the last degree insignificant. Hence I, among other 
public officers, am embarrassed beyond conception. But 
that is not the worst. Those brave and deserving soldiers, 
many of whom have for six years exposed their lives to save 
their country, who are unhappy enough to have fallen sick, 
have for a month past been destitute of every comfort of 
life. The only diet provided for them has been beef and 
bread, the latter generally sour ! while the citizens in gen 
eral of the United States indulge a luxury to which, before 
the war, they were strangers ! But, with all our boasted 
patriotism, virtue, and humanity, would a stranger think 
this possible ? Would to God it were not true ! Would to 
God that, in a land blessed with the best food in abundance, 
the army were not served with the worst ! that the sick 
were not left to perish for want of wholesome diet, or 
with the cold for Avant of proper clothing. But few see 
these distresses, and fewer feel them ; hence the wretched 
are left to endure an increase of misery. But I cease to 
wound your feelings with this tale of woe. You will regret 
the occasion as much as I, and both can only lament what 
we cannot remedy." 

He wrote from this place many letters to his wife, 
from which the following passages are extracted : 

" CAMP, VERPLANCK S POINT, September 24th, 1782. 

" I continue in health, but have had such a load of busi 
ness to go through, and withal so much vexation (more I 
never endured) , that I am greatly emaciated." 

"CAMP, October 3d. 

" I have been obliged by your letters of the 23d and 25th 
ultimo. I am sorry that you are like to be the last to feel 
the pleasures of health restored. Amidst your distress, 



^ET. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 377 

had I been with you, I should still have enjoyed some sat 
isfaction, the satisfaction of attending to your wants, and 
of administering the means of relief. But, denied this com 
fort, I am happy that you have not been destitute of friends. 
The proofs of real friendship I expected only from those 
who have exhibited such striking marks of it. I know you 
feel towards them all the gratitude their kindness merits, 
for you have a grateful heart. . . . 

" I feel now some regret that you left the North River, 
for I shall take rny quarters in Captain Mitchell s house, 
where I can live independently. But, were you to be with 
me, you would be a witness to all the disagreeable circum 
stances which attend the execution of my office, amidst 
clamorous creditors, and the unceasing demands of the army. 
On the whole, it is (saving this unlooked-for sickness) 
probably best as it is. I shall strive to be with you part of 
the winter, and, for this end, endeavor so to arrange my 
business as to leave it without injury to the public. I have 
some expectation that the army will go early into winter- 
quarters. When they are all hutted, I can doubtless leave 
them for a while." 

" CAMP, VERPLANCK S POINT, October 7th, 1782. 

" Mr. Hodgdon wrote me the 2d instant, informing that 
you remained very weak, and that the physician advised your 
removal to the city, where you might be better attended, 
saying that good nursing would be more beneficial than 
his medicines. I hope, my dearest, you have not hesitated 
to follow his advice, and that you are now comfortably 
lodged with John at Mrs. Hastings s. When I objected 
lately to your removal to the city, as Mr. Hodgdon pro 
posed, I referred only to a lasting one ; to a temporary 
removal, for the recovery of your health, I could not possibly 
have any objection. In this respect, I beg you, my love, 
always to follow what your condition shall require. You 
have prudence on which I can implicitly rely. In what 
concerns your own health, or that of the children, never 

VOL. I. 48 



378 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1782. 

think of the expense : health and life are too valuable to 
be sacrificed to trifles. If it should be necessary, we can 
retrieve such losses by a more rigid economy when in full 
health. Wait not a moment for my advice in cases requir 
ing a speedy decision. . . . 

" I remain in good health, and in some measure relieved 
from the toil and difficulties which deprived me of every 
pleasure, though I have still some arduous matters to ac 
complish with very inadequate means." 

" CAMP, VERPLANCK S POINT, October 24th, 1782. 

"On the 16th Mr. Hodgdon wrote me that you and the 
children were on the recovery, and that you were so sen 
sible of gaining strength that you proposed riding out. I 
was happy to hear this, especially as I considered it as a 
preparative to your journey to Newburgh. In three days I 
shall there take up my winter-quarters in the house where 
Mitchell dwelt. I had not thought it so agreeable, and 
the situation so pleasant. The house and appendages are 
already convenient; I shall render them more so. . . . 
The outhouses will be just what we want. You remember 
Captain Mitchell had a good garden ; that he kept horses, 
cows, pigs, and poultry, all that a family needs, with 
accommodations for them. Now that I am possessed of 
these conveniences, and can keep them while the war con 
tinues, do you not imagine that I have repented your 
removal with the children to Pennsylvania, especially to 
the sickly banks of the Schuylkill? General Lincoln is 
here. Three mornings ago I was conversing with him and 
the Commander-in-Chief. You bring Mrs. Pickering and 
the family to winter-quarters ? said the Secretary at War. 
* No ; but I have wrote Mrs. Pickering, proposing that she 
should take a journey to Newburgh, and tarry with me two 
months, leaving her children and cares behind, as the best 
means of restoring her health. Has Mrs. Pickering been 
sick ? said General Washington. Very ill. But she will 
be anxious about the children if she leaves them behind, 



Mr. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 379 

said the General ; and I think you had better move your 
family. Could I say nay to a thought so much in unison 
with my feelings ? and will not prudence approve what will 
so materially lessen my expenses ? But the latter will de 
pend on circumstances. Perhaps I shall cease, on the 1st 
of January next, to be a public officer : if not, the war 
may end by spring. Either of these events would render a 
total removal inconvenient. I am therefore at present only 
solicitous to have you take the journey, and to indulge me 
with your company for two months ; by the expiration of 
which I can doubtless take you back to our children." 



380 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1782. 



CHAPTER XXVII. 

New Arrangement of the Quartermaster-General s Department. 
Colonel Pickering dissatisfied as to Compensation. Importance 
and Difficulty of his Office. Misunderstanding between him and 
Dr. Cochran, Director of the Military Hospital. Mrs. Picker 
ing s extreme Illness. Colonel Pickering solicitous about the 
Means of his future Support. Financial Inconvenience in pay 
ing out Gold Coins. 

THE intimation of Colonel Pickering, in the preceding 
chapter, that on the 1st of January he might cease to 
be a public officer, is explained by a letter of the 24th 
of October, 1782, to Mr. Hodgdon. 

Mr. Hodgdon had written to him on the 23d of Sep 
tember : 

" The department of which you are principal is now under 
consideration [in Congress] . A report was formed on it, 
the 21st instant, by the Secretary of War, for the inspection 
of the committee long since appointed : since which nothing 
has transpired. The above-cited report makes great abridg 
ments in the numbers formerly employed, but is silent on 
the salaries to be allowed." 

Again, on the 9th of October, he had said : 

"Yesterday your department came under consideration. 
The report, if accepted, will in general please you. A 
major-general s pay is allowed the principal. On this I 
will make no comment. The whole to take place on the 
1st of January next." 

He had probably written another letter on the same 



JET. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 381 

subject, which is missing. A resolve of Congress was 
passed on the 23d of October, establishing the Quarter 
master-General s pay at one hundred and sixty-six 
dollars and sixty-six cents a month. 

To the above letters of Mr. Hodgdon Colonel Pick 
ering replied : 

11 CAMP, VERPLANCK S POINT, October 24th, 1782. 

"The reform of the regiments, I perceive, is not abso 
lutely certain ; the C. in C. [Commander-in-Chief] judges it 
inexpedient and impolitic. General L. [Lincoln] told me 
something of the report about my own department, but not 
a word of the pay, and I would not ask a question concern 
ing it. But what came to me from another quarter con 
vinces me that Congress are not planning any of these 
reformations with the candor and dignity which become the 
representatives of a nation. They know I am a poor man, 
and thence may think me dependent; but I thank God I 
arn a stranger to such a sentiment. I am, indeed, a poor 
man ; but I feel myself perfectly independent. I thank 
God I have courted the favor of no man ; that I have flat 
tered no man. To some I have made representations, but 
asked no favors. Why should I? Am I the servant of any 
individual in power? Did I accept this office for my own 
sake? For the pleasure, the honor, or profit that would 
attend it? I call God to witness that I did not. I have 
served my country, under circumstances and emergencies 
peculiar and extraordinary, and am now to be treated with 
ingratitude. My present pay, large as some gentlemen may 
think it, is not an adequate reward for the complicated duties 
of my office ; or, if it is, the salaries of most of the public 
servants, and of some high in office, are double, triple, and 
quadruple of what they ought to be. There are three offices 
in the United States which are arduous and important, - 
those of the Financier, Commander-in-Chief, and Com- 
mander of the Southern army : these excepted, I defy any 
man to name another requiring half the resource, that is, 



382 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKEKING. [1782. 

half so laborious, and at the same time half so difficult 
in the execution, as that of Quartermaster-General. The 
same office in the French army (an army not so large as 
ours) in point of labor and difficulty is nothing in com 
parison. He [the incumbent] has no teams to procure, no 
drivers, no forage, no camp equipage, nor the vast variety 
of other stores which are required from me ; and, particu 
larly, is not required to procure them without money. He 
is not driven to a thousand shifts and expedients, and to 
make a variety of arrangements which the peculiarity of our 
service demands, and which keep the mind continually on 
the rack : yet he is allowed one hundred and sixty-six 
louis-d ors a month, while Congress are about to reduce mine 
to as few dollars! But Congress may do as they please; 
yet it behooves them to do justice. Will it be said, lie serves 
the monarch of France, and /a poor republic? Granted. 
But let America assume the manners as well as the name of 
a republic, and let Congress set the example, and then I 
will cheerfully submit to anything. But I have done. I 
will not weary you with a longer dissertation on the subject, 
nor trouble myself about mischiefs to come ; sufficient to the 
day is the evil thereof. . . . 

" P. S. I take no copies of the letters I write you ; if you 
are at the trouble of preserving them, perhaps some may be 
eventually of use to me." 

A misunderstanding occurred between Dr. John 
^ Cochran, Director of the Military Hospital, and Colo 
nel Pickering, the Doctor complaining, in opprobrious 
language, that suitable quarters had not been asigned 
to him and other persons in his department. A 
letter from him, dated the 4th of November, ended in

jured by this reply to your scurrility, I am ready to give 
you any satisfaction you may demand, where pen, ink, and 
paper are not concerned." 

The letter which gave occasion to Dr. Cochran s 
animadversions has not been found ; but that the term 
scurrility was unjustly applied to it by an angry man, I 
have little doubt. To the one above quoted Colonel 
Pickering replied : 

"NEWBURGH, November 6th, 1782. 

SIR, 

" Although you have given me an acquittance of all obli- 
gation to continue our correspondence by letters, yet an 
unlucky conjecture in one paragraph of your last letter 
constrains me to reply. I should sooner have done it, but 
have had too much business on my hands to attend to it. 

" You imagine my feelings may be injured by the con 
tents of that letter. Be assured, Sir, they are not hurt in 
the least : it is not possible they should be ; for in all that 
mass of words, covering almost three pages in folio, there 
is not a single expression of wit* to excite ridicule, nor of 
satire to bite, nor of reproach that is founded in truth. As 
to the latter, your imagination has supplied, or given a col 
oring to, facts ; and opinions so formed (for what in your 
anger you have written you doubtless believed) will neces- 

* This is doing a little injustice to the Doctor ; for there is wit, but I sup 
pose not founded on fact, in his remark, " In assigning quarters . . . some 
of the gentlemen of the department which I have the honor to superintend . . . 
have been cooped up in a smoke-house, where the only alleviation to their 
misfortune was the want of fuel, which you, in the abundance of your eco 
nomical systems, withheld from them." 

The irritation on the part of Dr. Cochran must have been but temporary, 
for, he being in 1788 the Continental loan officer for the State of New York, 
and being assisted in his office by Peter Anspach, who had undertaken to 
adjust the accounts of Colonel Pickering as Quartermaster-General, Colonel 
Pickering wrote to Anspach, "Please to present my compliments to Dr. 
Cochran, and my thanks for so obligingly receiving my papers into his house ; " 
and in January, 1789, Dr. Cochran sends Ms compliments to Colonel and 
Mrs. Pickering.

sarily be erroneous. I therefore, unasked, forgive you all 
the wrong and all the injury you fancied it could do me. 
In this spirit I pass over every other part of your letter 
without an observation, one sentiment excepted, in which 
you manifest some regret at differing even with me. It is, 
indeed, most pleasant to live in peace with all men : besides, 
resentments entertained commonly hurt the subject more 
than the object of them ; and it is particularly disagreeable 
to be at variance with men whom our employments often 
unavoidably throw us in the way of. I may add, that a 
difference between public officers whose businesses have 
any connection or dependence one on the other, may prove 
injurious to the public interest. For these reasons we ought 
to live at least on terms of common civility ; more is not 
absolutely necessary, nor probably will ever exist ; but if 
there be less, it will not be the fault of 

Your humble servant, 

" TIMOTHY PICKERING, Q. M. G." 

Mrs. Pickering, after having nearly recovered from 
the fever and ague, had a relapse ; and on the 9th of 
November Dr. Wistar wrote to Colonel Pickering, " It 
is Mrs. Pickering s most earnest request that you may 
be as expeditious as possible in coming to Philadelphia. 
Her situation is such, that, unless an alteration for the 
better takes place very shortly, she must sink under the 
weight of her disorder in a very little time." On the 
receipt of this intelligence, Colonel Pickering set off as 
soon as possible, and arrived at Philadelphia about 
the 15th of November. The cheering influence of his 
presence, if it did not save Mrs. Pickering s life, certainly 
had a marked effect in promoting her recovery. He 
refers to her case in the following letter of condolence 
to his sister, Mrs. Sargeant, who had recently been 
bereaved of a daughter, Mrs. Pickman.

"NEWBURGH, February 9th, 1783. 

"DEAR SISTER, 

"My friends at the eastward have been so deficient in 
their correspondence, that it was not till the middle of last 
month that I was informed of the death of Betsey Pickinan. 
I felt and lamented this severe stroke. I lamented for your 
sake, for her husband s sake, and for the sake of the tender 
offspring she left behind her. At any time I should have 
mourned sincerely the loss of a niece so amiable as Betsey ; 
but I felt it more sensibly when I reflected, and that caused 
the reflection, on my own escape from a like calamity. The 
scene of distress from which Providence had so recently 
saved me, rushed on my memory, and excited every tender 
sentiment of sympathetic woe. My wife, who was endeared 
to me by every good and gentle quality a woman can possess, 
had been some time sick. She was sick when Betsey died, 
but in the following month was herself on the very verge of 
death. She was given over by her friends, and even her 
physicians almost despaired of her recovery. Knowing how 
difficult it would be for me just then to leave the army, she, 
bearing her sickness with unexampled patience, did not urge 
my being sent for. At length, however, doubting herself 
whether she should recover, with deep anxiety she asked 
for me. I flew to see her, and, to my inexpressible joy, 
found her past the crisis of danger, though still confined to 
her bed, and extremely weak. My presence gave a spring 
to the powers of returning health, and she recovered with 
unusual rapidity. While you mourn your own loss, though 
not as those who have no hope, your affection will lead you 
to join your joy with mine, that Heaven has restored to me 
and my charming boys one of the best of wives and tender- 
est of mothers." . . . 

Colonel Pickering remained in Philadelphia some 
time after his wife s recovery, partly for the purpose 
of conferring with a committee of Congress on the new 
arrangement of his department, which was to go into 

VOL. i. 49 



386 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1782. 

effect on the 1st of January, 1783.* In the following 
letter to his brother he refers to this subject, and like 
wise to his future course of life after the termination 
of the war. 

"PHILADELPHIA, December 14th, 1782. 

" A new arrangement of the Quartermaster s department 
has lately been made. In some respects it is evidently 
impracticable, on account of the inadequacy of the pay 
proposed in divers instances, which must prevent suitable 
characters continuing in or accepting of those offices. I 
have therefore objected to it, and a committee are appointed 
for the purpose of reviewing the plan. I expect to have a 
conversation with them on the subject to-morrow or next 
day, which over, I shall return to the army, where any letter 
from you will find me. My quarters are at Newburgh. 

" In the summer past I hoped we should not have another 
campaign ; but I now fear we shall. The prospect of peace 
led me to look forward for some business by which my fam 
ily might be supported when the War is over, but without 
absolutely fixing on any, from the contingencies which may 
happen in the interim to alter my views. I cannot but feel 
some solicitude on this head ; though, while I can get meat, 
clothes, and fire, my mind will not be distressed. I did 
determine to attempt a visit to my friends at the eastward 
this winter, and will yet, if it be possible, though I am not 
sanguine in my expectations of doing it. I want exceed 
ingly to see them ; and at the same time I should know 
whether any and what prospects in Massachusetts (to which 
I am now so much a stranger) would present to me in the 
way of business. In the mean time it will give me great 
pleasure to be informed of the situation of our family in 
particular. Our mother, I suppose, nearly despairs of see 
ing me or my family ; but I hope we shall all live to meet 
again. I presume my friends write much oftener than I

JET. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 387 

hear from them (for I scarcely receive a letter in six 
months) ; but committing their letters to private hands, 
they generally miscarry." 

From the two following letters it is inferred, that, as 
Quartermaster-General, he was supplied by Mr. Morris, 
the Superintendent of Finance, with gold coins from the 
bank at Philadelphia at their value by weight; that 
the weights of the coins severally were greater than 
was required by law for their current value ; that hence, 
in paying them by tale, there \vould be a loss to the 
amount of such excess in weight ; and that, if he would 
prevent this loss from falling upon the public or upon 
himself, he was under the necessity 9f reducing the coins 
to the standard weight by clipping them : and it seems 
this work was to be done either by himself or at his 
own expense. Although no injury to the public was 
designed, it is not surprising that he should complain 
of the proceeding as a " shameful business " imposed on 
him as a public officer. 

The first letter is from Mr. Hodgdon. 

" ORDNANCE OFFICE, December 23d, 1782. 

"The Financier will not permit the Continent to be a 
loser by the gold. The consequence is obvious. You must 
select all the French guineas and leave them for exchange 
in this city, as well the light as the overweight, as their 
current value is not equal in the State of York ; the other 
pieces must be clipped. The price demanded is one penny 
for each piece ; but this, it seems, cannot be allowed. It 
only remains, therefore, for you to say whether you will 
pay it, or cut the pieces to the standard weight yourself. 
This last mode has been preferred by Mr. Peirce,* and he 
informs me it is easily and speedily executed with common 
shears. Should you adopt this mode, your ingenuity would

388 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1782. 

make the process still easier. The matter should be kept 
a secret, as the army, not acquainted with circumstances, 
might suspect fraudulent intentions. I think you had better 
come in to-morrow morning." 

Colonel Pickering returned the following answer : 

" FALLS OF SCHUYLKILL, December 24th, 1782. 

"I received your favor by James. If I come to town I 
shall be harassed with a hundred applications, which may 
prevent my doing the preparatory business to my setting 
off 1 to-morrow. Be so good as to leave the French gold at 
the bank, taking notes for the amount; unless you can get 
crowns instead, which would in some degree compensate 
the loss I must sustain on the other gold, for a loss 
I am sure there will be after the utmost care. The res 
idue of the gold I will thank you to bring with you in my 
wagon. . . . 

"I must trouble you for the necessary apparatus for 
dipping. Tis a shameful business, and an unreasonable 
hardship on a public officer. I am not certain that I will 
receive any more bank gold on such odious conditions. A 
pair of good shears, a couple of punches, and a leaden anvil 
of two or three pounds weight. Will you inquire how the 
goldsmiths put in their plugs? . . . Please to get the 
rates at which all gold coins current here do pass, and at 
what weights." . . . 

Whether Colonel Pickering actually made use of the 
implements thus requested does not appear : at any 
rate, he did not save himself harmless ; for, in a letter 
dated Newburgh, January 26th, 1783, to Mr. Hodgdon, 
he says : 

" I have an opportunity of sending you some bullion ; 
which, with what I left you at Philadelphia, will go near to 
reimburse me for the loss on the gold received from the 
bank."

COLONEL PICKERING left the Falls of the Schuylkill 
on the 27th of December, 1782, for Newburgh, where 
he arrived on the 2d of January, 1783. On the way 
he met with a provoking misadventure, which, how 
ever, occasioned only a manifestation of equanimity 
and of a considerate regard for the feelings of his 
servant. He notices it in a letter to his wife. 

. " POMPTON, January 1st, 1783. 

" Thus far I am arrived in safety ; and to-morrow 1 shall 
be at Newburgh. Some time was lost by the breaking of 
the swingle-trees and pole of the wagon, about four miles 
on the other side of Morristown. These accidents hap 
pened, one on the back of the other, just as it grew dusky 
on Sunday evening. Robert said he believed we were 
bewitched; but I could assign a reason for our ill luck more 
easily, and without having recourse to necromancy , namely, 
a want of his usual care ; for, while it was yet light, he ran 
the wagon plump against a large stump three feet high, and, 
of consequence, easy to be seen, if he had had his eyes 
about him. This broke both the swingle-trees, and, soon 
after, occasioned the breaking of the pole. However, I did 



390 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKEEING. [1783. 

not drop a word of blame upon Robert. The most vigilant 
are sometimes off their guard. Instead of finding fault 
(Robert himself was not a little troubled with the misfor 
tunes), I cheerfully remarked, that it was better so than 
worse. Perhaps such a reflection in serious misfortunes 
would be one of the most useful consolations ; for, in most 
cases, it is easy to conceive that worse evils might have 
befallen us, and there are none in which we have not 
reason, amidst our calamities, to be thankful to the boun 
teous Author of all good." 

An interesting letter from General Washington 
crossed him on his journey, in which are detailed 
distresses at camp on account of the deficiency of 
forage : 

" HEAD-QUARTERS, NEWBURGH, December 25th, 1782. 

SIR, 

" The bad state of affairs in your department is such as 
makes your presence indispensably necessary with the army. 
The complaints of all, from the Major-General down to the 
lowest staff officer entitled to keep a horse, are aggravated 
to the highest possible degree, on account of the continual 
want of forage. As a specimen of the distress which has 
fallen under my own observation, you may be assured my 
horses have been four days without a handful of hay, and 
three of the same without a mouthful of grain ; since which 
I have been induced to order forage to be purchased with 
my own private money, at any expense, rather than see 
them perish before my eyes. But I am now informed it is 
fourteen days since the horses of the army have had either 
long or short feed of any kind whatever. All business 
which ought to be performed by officers serving on horse 
back must cease to be done. Some of the general officers 
have sent away every horse into the country ; others have 
notified me that it will not be possible for them to attend at 
head- quarters on any occasion, even the most pressing, their 
horses being too weak to carry them, and they unable to 



-ZEi. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 391 

walk so great a distance. Nor can I expect the field-officers 
of the day to perform their duties any longer. 

" There is another public inconvenience which will proba 
bly happen, and of which it will be proper to give the Post 
master-General timely notice ; that is, the total incapacity 
of the dragoon horses destined to escort, or rather to carry, 
the mail, to proceed any longer. He must therefore expect 
that in which this letter goes to be the last which will be 
received from the eastward through this mode of con 
veyance until new arrangements shall take place, as the 
dragoons were obliged to bring the last week s mail from 
Morristown a considerable part of the distance on their 
backs, and as their horses have had no forage from that day 
to the present. 

" How far these evils are absolutely irremediable, I do 
not undertake to decide ; but, if they can be avoided, I am 
certain I need not, in addition to all the other ill conse 
quences, attempt to enforce the ill economy which must 
result from the unparalleled scarcity, by an example which 
General Gates has just mentioned, that, for want of forage 
to the value of five pounds, he has lost a public team of 
horses worth more than one hundred pounds. 

" My principal objects, Sir, in giving you this detail of 
particulars, are, to convince you that the distresses and 
clamors for want of forage have never been so great at any 
former time as at the present moment ; to request you will 
lay a state of the matter before the Superintendent of 
Finance ; and, after making the best arrangements in your 
power to procure a future supply, that you will proceed 
without loss of time to join the army. 

" I am, Sir, your most obedient, humble servant, 

"G? WASHINGTON." 

In a letter to Mr. Hodgdon, quoted below, Colonel 
Pickering accounts satisfactorily, so far as concerns 
himself, for this scarcity of forage, alleging, at the 
same time, that it was not so great as it had been 



392 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

generally represented to be. Without calling in ques 
tion the truth of General Washington s statement, that 
his own horses had not had a handful of hay rior a 
mouthful of grain for three days, and that General 
Gates had lost a valuable team of horses from starva 
tion, indicating a sufficiently " bad state of affairs," one 
may be inclined to doubt the correctness of his infor 
mation derived from other persons, that " it is fourteen 
days since the horses of the army have had either long 
or short feed of any kind whatever." * 

In a letter to Mr. Hodgdon, dated at Newburgh, 
January 12th, 1783, is the following passage : 

" Notwithstanding all that you have read, the want of 
* forage, depend on it, was neither new nor extraordinarj^.f 
Just such clamors, from people of irritable passions, I heard 
as long ago as 1779, particularly from Baron S [teuben] . But 
all deficiencies of that period are forgotten. The fact was, 
that in December last the roads were so intolerably bad, the 
country people could not bring their forage to market, though 
actually offered the cash on the delivery. They would sell 
at their own barns ; but the Continental teams, which had 
been employed in the bad roads from the time the army 
moved to winter-quarters, were worn down. I was fully 
aware of this difficulty, and, when the army took the field 
last August, kept an office open at Newburgh on purpose to 
receive and pay for forage, of which I proposed to form 
magazines, to last till the first of January at least ; but I 

* The allegation is countenanced, however, by a paragraph in the " Boston 
Daily Evening Traveller " of April 21st, 1866, in which it is said that a " cruel 
experiment in France " has shown that a horse can live " twenty-five days with 
out solid food, merely drinking water. He may live seventeen days without 
eating food or drinking. He can only live five days when consuming solid food 
without drinking." If this statement is not incredible, it may be presumed that 
the horses were at rest while subjected to the experiments ; whereas those in 
the army would be used until they became unserviceable, and, in consequence, 
would be the sooner exhausted. 

t For instance, the like want was felt in 1780. See Marshall s "Life of 
Washington," Vol. IV. p. 216. 



MT. 37.] LITE OP TIMOTHY PICKERING. 393 

never could procure money enough to purchase the supplies 
requisite for the army in the field. As soon as the snow 
fell, the farmers readily came in. Colonel Tilghman came 
to Philadelphia about the middle of December. Speaking 
of the gentlemen in my office, says he, They do very well. 
Whence you may conclude that the evil complained of was 
not of long standing." 

Of the numerous letters from Colonel Pickering to 
his wife, the following is one of the most remarkable. 
It is dated at Newburgh, Sunday evening, January 
12th, 1783. After expressing his affection for her by 
many terms of endearment, he goes on to say : 

" My heart melts with gratitude to that kind Being who 
gave us life ; who, in ways so unlocked for and extraordi 
nary, effected our union ; who formed our minds in the 
same mould (for in what do we not think alike ?) and our 
hearts with the same tender passions, equally ardent and 
sincere, hearts which swell with mutual love with the 
dearest affection for our amiable offspring with sympathy 
for all mankind with equal gratitude to our beneficent 
Creator. 

" O thou great, almighty, self-existent Being, by whom 
are all things ; who madest the world and the inhabitants 
thereof; who didst give us understanding to see and ac 
knowledge thy wisdom, power, and goodness, all glory be 
to thee. 

" Deign, O thou exalted but beneficent Creator, deign to 
hear the humble praises, and to listen to the prayers, of thy 
lowly servants and suppliants. Thou hast condescended to 
call us thy offspring. O, accept the grateful thanks of us 
thy children. How numerous are thy mercies, O God ! 
And who can tell of all thy lovingkindness ! How won 
derful our origin ! How feeble and helpless our infancy ! 
How surrounded with dangers our childhood ! How ex 
posed to temptations our youth ! Yet, O God, we are 

VOL. I. 50 



394 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

supported and preserved. Thy watchful providence has 
been our safeguard. By thy power have we been pro 
tected. And thy goodness hath made us mutually happy. 
O, still preserve us in our riper years ; prolong our lives ; 
and let our affection be commensurate with our days. O, 
accept our ardent thanks that we are indulged with that 
alleviation to the many disquietudes attendant on humanity. 
May the happiness we feel in that affection lead us to thee, 

thou Source of love. But, while our hearts expand with 
conscious joy, may we recollect that our abode here is tem 
porary ; that we are but sojourners on earth : that there is 
another and a better country, of which those who love thee 
in sincerity shall become the blest inhabitants. With pleas 
ure, therefore, let us anticipate our departure hence, after 
we have fulfilled thy wise purposes, O Almighty God, and 
performed the various offices in life which our stations and 
connections require. O, grant us the lives of our tender 
offspring. May we see them grow up in thy fear, and 
become extensively useful in society. Enable us to per 
form our duty towards them ; and may we experience all 
those grateful returns which parental love and filial affec 
tion can give rise to. Happy in each other, happy in our 
children, and blessed with the benignant smiles of thy kind 
providence, grant, O most merciful God, that we may 
attain to a good old age ; and then, if it be thy will, may 
we not know the pangs of separation. Having our sins for 
given through the atonement of thy Son, our Saviour, and 
our minds, by the constant practice of piety and virtue, 
fitted for the society of the happy spirits in heaven, receive 
us into the mansions of eternal bliss. And thine, O gracious 
God, almighty and all-wise, shall be the glory. Amen. 

" I wrote you, my dear Becky, a letter this day : yet I 
could not restrain my inclination to dwell on so pleasing a 
subject, nor forbear to express those sentiments of warm 
affection which irresistibly urged me to give them utterance. 

1 have been conducted involuntarily to the conclusion which 
you have just read, and thus, without design, fulfilled my 



2Ex. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 395 

promise, to compose and transmit you a prayer ; that, 
though so far asunder, we might unite our hearts in one 
address to our heavenly Father. If, my dearest, these 
sentiments accord with your feelings, as I persuade myself 
they will, let us every day devoutly express them. They 
will yield us comfort in the repetition, and tend to establish 
our hearts in piety and virtue.* 

" Farewell, my dear Becky. Be Heaven s peculiar care." 

In allusion to the foregoing letter, he wrote to Mrs. 
Pickering on the 19th of January : 

"The letter which accompanies this was written, as you 
will see by the date, a week since ; but no good private con 
veyance has presented. I was sorry for the delay, for I 
fondly hoped the perusal would give you pleasure equal to 
mine in writing it." 

In the same letter of the 19th he mentions the receipt 
of one dated " Salem, the 4th of January," from his 
brother-in-law Williams, informing him of losses sus 
tained, by some of his relations, by British captures; 
also telling him that his mother grows old and somewhat 
childish, that she mourns the absence of him and his 
family, and that a few lines to her would please her 
much. Colonel Pickering says : 

* In the "London Athenaeum " for the 12th of February, 1859, is a letter 
from the late Baron Alderson to his son at school, exhibiting a similarity of 
sentiment. He says, " I think of you every day, morning and evening in 
particular, and please myself in thinking, that when papa and mamma are 
praying for their dear boy, he may be doing so for them. There is a story 
of two lovers, who agreed at the same hour to go and look at the moon every 
moonlight night ; and that was a tie between them, for they felt as if they were 
together. How much better is it to be looking, not to the thing created, but 
to God himself! That is indeed to be together really : to be praying all of us 
at once to him, is to be, as it were, united through him for ever, and to make 
a beginning of heaven on earth. My own dear boy will remember this, and 
we shall not be separated then, but every day be together in spirit, if not in 
bodily presence." 



396 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

"I will enclose you Mr. Williams s letter. You will there 
see, and regret, the misfortunes of our friends. These, 
among a thousand others daily occurring, admonish us to 
beware of indulging too fond hopes of prosperity, even 
amidst the most promising views. . . . What is there on 
earth to bind us to it? Nought, my dearest life, but the 
tender feelings of domestic connections. My wife ! My 
children ! These are the endearing names which soften 
every fibre ; which make me forget the numerous ills of 
life, and wish to live. But is it desirable to reach to great 
old age ? Certainly not. The moment our reason and use 
fulness begin to fail, we should pray, if it were the will of 
Heaven, to be taken hence. You will see in Mr. Williams s 
letter what suggested to me this reflection. In consequence 
I have written a short letter, of which the enclosed is a 
copy.* I thought it would soothe and comfort old age. 
The name of mother is to be respected. An aged mother 
demands my veneration. You know, too, my dear Becky, 
who was her darling son ! I hope I feel a becoming grati 
tude for her unbounded tenderness and care. 

"I had a large table set yesterday. Mrs. Washington 
and Mrs. Hand f honored me with their company. They 
expressed their wishes that you had been here : but what

that respect and affection which were due to you. I did hope to see Salem 
this winter, but it is impossible. The war, I trust, will soon end, and then 
I shall have that pleasure. 

" You have been informed of the sickness of my wife and children last 
fall, and of their recovery. The three boys, I persuade myself, would give 
you a great deal of pleasure could you see them. The youngest, Henry, I 
think, resembles you greatly, much more than either of the others. His 
mamma is of the same opinion. John is grown a lusty fellow. He is 
thoughtful, careful, and very docile. Tim is active, sprightly, and full of 
frolic. Harry promises to be what we could wish him. I have given you 
this account of my family because the relation I know will give you pleasure. 
I remain your dutiful son, T. PICKERING."

is divided ; and when I wish you with me, I check myself, 
and ask, What then would become of our dear boys? Be 
sides, I do not desire you to be a witness of the numerous 
disquietudes to which I am exposed. Towards evening, I 
had just handed Mrs. Washington and Mrs. Hand to their 
carriages, and turned round to go into the house, when a 
sheriff presented me with a writ ! It gave me no alarm ; and 
do not suffer it, my dear, to discompose even your counte 
nance. It was for a public debt, said to be due to a man whom 
I never saw nor heard of. It seems that he had been buying 
up my certificates,* and on them grounded his action. I 
have given bail, and mean to defend the suit to the last 
extremity. None but men who deserve worse names than 
I choose to give them would bring such vexatious suits : 
if it be possible, I will disappoint them. But what a cruel 
oppression is this, that, when the public is unable to pay 
its debts, its innocent servants must be made personally 
liable ! Congress recommended the prohibition of such 
suits ; but this State did not adopt the recommendation. 
With equal justice upwards of ten thousand such suits 
might be brought against me. If in the end I get into a 
stronger house than is necessary to hold me, I must send 
for you to live in the neighborhood. One comfort, at least, 
will arise, I shall have a respite from public business, and 
leisure to pay my attentions to you. Be cheerful and easy, 
my dear Becky, as I am at this moment : kind Heaven will 
be our Guardian. Adieu." 

On the 27th of January he tells Mrs. Pickering that 
he is solicitous to have her acknowledge the receipt of 
the letters of the 12th and 19th, adding, " I esteem 
them more (and I hope you will think them more val 
uable) than any I ever wrote you." 

Immediately after his arrest, he addressed a letter f 

* Specie certificates, signed and issued by Colonel Pickering as Quarter 
master-General. See page 256 ; also Journals of Congress, August 23d, 1780.

-to General Washington, mentioning the fact, and that, 
*to prevent any injury to the public by taking him from 
his office, he had given bail ; that the plaintiff, Melanc- 
thon L. Wolsey, was said to be a trader at Poughkeep- 
sie, who had been purchasing, at a very great discount, 
specie certificates signed by Colonel Pickering; that 
the suit was doubtless grounded on such certificates ; 
and that the State of New York had not complied with 
the recommendation of Congress to pass a law exempt 
ing public officers from such suits.* fl The letter con 
cludes : 

" I am singularly unfortunate in being subjected to suits 
on specie certificates ; for it was at my instance that Con 
gress passed the act authorizing me to issue them. My 
motive was to do the best possible justice to the public 
creditors, by fixing their dues in specie, and allowing them 
the interest of their money, which I saw it was impossible 
for the public promptly to pay." 

In a letter to Mr. Hodgdon, of January 21st, on this 
subject, he says : 

" I will disappoint the vexatious suitor. I will much 
rather go to jail than show him any public property to 
satisfy his debt ; and, thank God, I have no private prop 
erty in the State." 

He was not, however, reduced to the alternative of 
either paying the debt or going to jail. In a letter of 
the 2d of April, to Mrs. Pickering, he says : 

" With unusual pleasure, my dearest, I now write you 
concerning myself. This State [New York] has passed a 
law respecting suits against public officers for public debts, 
which will insure me from a jail at least eleven months ; 
and the same reasons which they mention as the ground of 

* Journals of Congress, March 19th, 1782.

the Act must produce a continuance of it if requisite ; so I 
am easy on this score." 

In the following passages in two letters to his wife, 
on the celebration of the anniversary of the alliance 
with France, he speaks of a building erected for the 
use of the officers of the army, and proposed to be called 
The Temple of Virtue ; but at the dedication it was better 
named simply The Temple* a name, however, seldom 
applied, as in this instance it was, to a log-house. It was 
in this building that Washington afterwards assembled 
the officers of the army, to take into consideration the 
noted " Newburgh Addresses." 

"NEWBURGH, February 5th, 1783. 

"Mr. Lloyd is still here, but will be ready to set off to 
morrow if he pleases. But perhaps he will stay to see the 
review of the troops and the celebration of the treaty of 
alliance between the United States and France, the anni 
versary of which fortunate event recurs to-morrow. 

" Perhaps you have heard of a large building erecting for 
the common use of the officers of the army. Dr. Evans, 
one of our chaplains, was, I believe, its projector. He ex 
pects to preach in it on Sundays. The officers expect to 
have their dancing assemblies there. To-morrow thev will 
meet there to give and receive the congratulations which 
the anniversary suggests. The Couimander-in-Chief has 
ordered a cold collation to be provided there for all the 
officers of the army, and the gentlemen and ladies in the 
neighborhood. If you and I took pleasure in public assem 
blies, I should wish you there with me ; but such bustling 
scenes, so far from pleasing, disturb my tranquillity. It is 
in a small, select society only that we must look for pleasure ; 
for there alone resort friendship and sincerity." 

* See Lossing s " Pictorial Field-Book of the Revolution," Vol. II. pp. 
117. 118, where the building is described and represented.

" February 6th, Evening, 9 o clock. 

"I have returned from the Temple of Virtue. Alas! 
how little will it deserve the name ! for how little virtue 
is there among mankind ! How small the number whose 
actions are not dictated by their interest or passions ! With 
that small number it would be a happiness to dwell. Some 
such there are in every society. Some such will occasion 
ally enter the army s public building, and give color for the 
title the good Doctor has chosen for it. He pronounced 
an oration in it to-day to a crowded audience. The Com- 
mander-in-Chief and all the officers were there assembled. 
Mrs. Washington, Mrs. Knox, Mrs. Hand, and some others 
of the sex were present. You have lost nothing by being 
absent. Even the oration fell vastly short of my expecta 
tions. Whole years so spent would yield me less pleasure 
than with thee, m}^ love, one single day. O, indulgent 
Heaven, hasten the time when we shall meet again, no more 
to part. But, ah ! my love, what do we promise to our 
selves in future time? You know, that though I am frugal, 
yet I am not thrifty ; and by my personal industry I must 
acquire the means of supporting thee and thy sweet boys. 
Thy diligence also must aid my labor." 

He expresses his opinion that she will be content 
to dwell in a cottage and not repine at the homely fare 
their own fields shall supply, if Heaven so ordain ; but 
his prayers will ask for her an easier lot. 

In the early part of 1783 it was supposed that Gen 
eral Lincoln was about to resign the office of Secretary 
of War; in relation to which Colonel Henry E. Lut- 
terloh, a Prussian, who had recently served as Commis 
sary-General of Forage under Colonel Pickering, wrote 
to him the following affectionate letter, dated the llth 
of February : 

" As General Lincoln s post is to be vacant, I would advise 
you, as a friend, to take it. I ani well persuaded you can 



MT. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 401 

get it ; and I am also certain that the public will have more 
decisive service done, and you wilt please the army better, 
and live happier with your own family. Mrs. Pickering will 
like it better. And in that post you can make plans for 
the best [good] of the army, and save the public large sums, 
which nobody else will be able to do. Excuse my hints, 
which flow out of a heart that wishes you well. Pray give 
my respects to Mrs. Pickering, and believe me to be, with 
great esteem," &c. 

In two letters to his brother-in-law, Mr. George 
Williams, both dated "Philadelphia, February 17th, 
1783," Colonel Pickering unfolds a plan of entering into 
mercantile business. He says: 

" I have been here two or three days on public business. 
Since my arrival, such intelligence has been received as 
renders a speedy peace indubitable. This agreeable pros 
pect has determined me to mention, what for some time 
past I have had in contemplation to propose as soon as the 
war should be happily terminated : this is, to undertake 
in this city the management of mercantile business on 
commission for my friends and such other gentlemen at the 
eastward as should think proper to employ me. Having 
spent so many years in the service of my country, person 
ally so unprofitably, and having a family to provide for, 
my thoughts have been necessarily turned to the means of 
making such provision where there was the greatest proba 
bility of success, as in the business above mentioned. A 
very considerable intercourse between the Eastern States 
and this city formerly subsisted, and I suppose will soon be 
resumed. The connections requisite for this end, I imagine, 
are not yet generally formed. I am therefore solicitous to 
have my intentions immediately made known to my friends 
and acquaintances at the eastward, and that they will do rue 
the kind office to communicate them to such others as they 
judge can forward my views. 

VOL. I. 51 



402 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

" That a prompt and punctual attention might at all times 
be paid to the commands of my friends and others, I thought 
it would be expedient to form here a connection with a gen 
tleman equally disposed with myself to serve them faithfully. 
This consideration, and a knowledge of his acquaintance 
with business, has determined me to propose to Mr. Samuel 
Hodgdon, of Boston, who is well known to you, and who 
for several years has resided here, to undertake the business 
jointly with me. This he has agreed to. ... We are 
both at present in public service ; but, as soon as peace shall 
be established, \ve shall be ready to execute the orders of 
our correspondents. . . . 

" You know my circumstances too well to suffer any mer 
chants to expect, at the commencement of the business, that 
we shall make any advances. Whatever remittances they 
shall make, and whatever merchandise they shall consign to 
us, will be diligently and faithfully applied and disposed of 
for their benefit. 

" It is possible that the Revolution in America may give a 
new turn even to our home commerce, and that the trade 
of the Eastern States may be transferred from Pennsylvania 
to Maryland and Virginia, from whence tobacco, as well as 
flour, may be now freely exported. I wish you, therefore, 
to take this into consideration, to learn the opinion of the 
merchants thereon, and to advise me accordingly." 

Mr. Williams, in his reply, dated " Salem, March 23d/ 
communicates information and advice, and promises 
his aid, but says that some of Colonel Pickering s near 
friends disapprove of his plan, thinking that he might 
get a good living in Salem, and that he has been 
much talked of as a candidate to fill a vacancy then 
existing on the bench of the Supreme Court of Mas 
sachusetts. 

Indulging in agreeable anticipations of success in his 



^T. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 403 

commercial project, Colonel Pickering wrote to his wife, 
in the letter of April 2d/- : before quoted : 

" The other cause of my present satisfaction is a letter 
from brother Williams, which is just come to hand. . . . 
He informs me that the merchants of Salem will give me 
their business at Philadelphia, and Andrew Cabot has prom 
ised all their business from Beverly. . . . Mr. Williams 
will speak to the other Eastern merchants as he meets them. 
He approves of my plan, and says he had often thought 
of it for me. My brother gives his consent. I had a 
letter from him a day or two since. He says, if I should 
go to settle at Salem again, the voice of my country would 
introduce me to any vacant office ; but you know my mind 
on that head. Upon the whole, my dear Becky, the pros 
pect is pleasing as I could wish ; and I trust we shall be 
able to live agreeably, especially as you have no vanity, and 
I no ambition, to prompt us to live above our income." 

The following letter, dated "Newburgh, the 6th of 
March, 1783," to Mr. Hodgdon, contains speculations of 
Colonel Pickering on the prospect of peace, and on the 
probable views and conduct of Great Britain : 

"You ask my opinion about peace. With pleasure I give 
it. I think it is near at hand. Or, if there be not a general 
peace, yet I think Britain will cease all hostilities against 
the United States by water. 

"Everybody sees how solicitous she is to recover our 
affections, for the sake of regaining our trade. If the war 
continues, now that the terms of peace between her and us 
are agreed on, Britain will endeavor to throw the odium of 
it on France, to exasperate her own subjects, and, if possible, 
to inspire us with the like sentiments. Suppose, besides, 
that Britain should recall her commissions for making prizes 

* See page 398. 



404 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

of American vessels, declaring that no unarmed American 
vessels should be subject to capture, what would follow? 
The merchants would, to a man, strip their vessels in 
stantly of all their warlike furniture, and, with the same 
hands, provisions, and expense, presently fit out double, 
triple, and quadruple the number of ships and vessels now 
employed, and with proportionate profits. Thus the British 
commerce would, in turn, be left unmolested by us, except 
ing only by our two public frigates, which would recipro 
cally be subject to capture ; and, with great success, the 
prizes which two frigates could make would not be worth a 
minute s consideration. I am speaking now on supposition 
that the war continues ; for we can have no peace by treaty 
without the concurrence of France, though I believe we 
shall have a peace in fact. 

" You will readily trace the numerous advantages Britain 
will derive from such a stroke of policy. We cannot trade 
directly to her dominions ; but her merchants will carry 
their merchandises to every neutral port in Europe and 
America, where the American vessels will infallibly receive 
them, whatever attempts are made to prevent it. This very 
consideration, too, may have some influence with France to 
induce her more readily to agree to a peace. And if France, 
to whom we are under so many obligations, can be satis 
fied, I confess I care little for our other associates in war. 
Neither Spain nor Holland had the smallest regard to us in 
entering into the war : * I feel, therefore, very indifferent 
about their interests ; and Britain has not gained enough 
from either to affect the balance of power in Europe. The 
time will come, if we remain united, when we shall hold the 
scales. 

" These hints are enough ; nor have I now time to en 
large. . . . 



* In an official letter of the 16th of January, 1797, to General Pinckney, 
Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States at Paris, he shows that, by their 
own declarations, this is equally true of the Court of France. See American 
State Papers, Wait s edition, Vol. II. p. 48.

"P. S. If my conjectures prove true, New York will soon 
be evacuated, part of the garrison going to Canada, and the 
rest to the West Indies." 

He wrote again to Mr. Hodgdon, on the llth of 
March, upon the same subject, giving the sentiments 
of two of his old friends (Tories), then in the city of 
New York. 

"I lately wrote you my sentiments in regard to peace. 
Since then a Salemite, from New York, passing here [New- 
burgh] , showed me some open letters from divers refugees 
there, among the rest Parson Walter (my old schoolmaster, 
who sent me his compliments) , who says, * There will doubt 
less be peace this summer, at least with America. Another 
letter announces, in the strongest terms, the near approach 
of peace. Walter talks about staying behind after the gar 
rison departs, is assured by his friends he may, notwith 
standing he is a proscribed traitor, but says he will not 
continue if he must encounter sour looks and ill treatment. 
My old chum, Upham, the lawyer, who married Murray s 
daughter, is aid to Sir Guy [Carleton]. He has, I perceive, 
a daughter in Boston, and, in his letter to his friend there, 
expresses an expectation or hope of returning. Upham is 
a good-hearted fellow, and probably would not have joined 
the enemy but for his marriage connections."

The " Newburgh Addresses." Letter from John Armstrong, signed 
"John Montgars," respecting them. Representations by Arm 
strong of the Object of the Addresses. 

TOWARDS the end of the war great uneasiness pre 
vailed among the officers and soldiers of the American 
army in regard to the compensation due for their ser 
vices. In consequence, in the month of December, 1782, 
a memorial on the subject was drawn up, and a com 
mittee of officers selected to lay it before Congress, then 
sitting at Philadelphia. A report was received from 
the committee which was not satisfactory to the officers 
of the army, and on the 10th of March, 1783, the first 
of the anonymous inflammatory letters, well known 
under the name of the "Newburgh Addresses," was 
circulated in the camp at Newburgh. At the same 
time the general officers, the field officers, and some of 
a lower rank, were requested, by an anonymous notifi 
cation, to meet, on the llth of March, 1783, to consider 
what measures should be adopted to obtain a redress 
of their grievances. The Commander-in-Chief, in gen 
eral orders, reprobated this invitation as an irregular 
proceeding, and requested the officers to assemble on 
the 15th, to hear the report of their committee.* 

On the 14th, Colonel Pickering wrote to his wife, 
then at the Falls of Schuylkill : 

" My journey to Albany is delayed on account of a meet 
ing of the officers of the army, which is to be to-morrow, to 

* See Sparks s "Writings of Washington," Vol. VIII. p. 552. 



^T. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 407 

consider of a representation they shall make to Congress for 
the purpose of obtaining such decisions as will secure the 
settlement of their accounts, and the ultimate payment of 
their debts. If the business is conducted with prudence, it 
may have the best effects in promoting the success of those 
salutary measures, proposed and proposing by Congress, for 
the purpose of establishing such permanent revenues as will 
insure the payment of the army and other public creditors. 
In this view the meeting has my hearty concurrence. But 
should rashness govern the proceedings, the consequences 
may be such as are dreadful even in idea. God forbid the 
event should be so calamitous ! " 

Nearly thirty-seven years later, a correspondence con 
cerning the Newburgh Addresses was commenced by a 
letter to Colonel Pickering, dated "Albany, January 
20th, 1820," and signed "John Montgars," in which the 
writer says he has been employed, for several years, upon 
a history of the United States, and has brought down 
the work to the time when the anonymous letters made 
their appearance ; and he requests Colonel Pickering s 
" recollections of this affair." 

Colonel Pickering sent an answer, but, as he had 
never before heard of a person named John Montgars^ 
he declined a compliance with his request. It appeared 
afterwards, by the acknowledgment of John Armstrong, 
that the letter was written by him under the assumed 
name of John Montgars. 

This correspondence will illustrate the fallibility of 
memory as to events of distant date, however im 
portant, even in persons who were deeply interested 
in them at the time of their occurrence. 

The letter signed "John Montgars" was as fol 
lows: 



408 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

SIR, 

" I have been employed, for some years past, in writing 
the military and political history of the United States, and 
have brought down the work to the last year of the war of 
the Revolution, when the anonymous letters made their 
appearance. On comparing the accounts, as well written 
as verbal, given of the character and object of these papers, 
I tind much diversity of opinion and statement. 

" 1st. They are represented by some as part of a delib 
erate and studied plan to break down the civil authority, 
and to erect on its ruins a military despotism, and that it 
required the vast influence of General Washington to pre 
vent this dreadful catastrophe. 

" 2d. That the clamor was altogether artificial, and em 
ployed only to give a sort of political and moral mushing 
to the character of Washington and the army. 

" 3d. That the letters were projected and written merely 
as auxiliaries to the fiscal measures of that day. 

" Those who hold the first of these opinions appear to 
rely on some insulated passages found in the letters them 
selves ; on the resolution of the officers rejecting the advice 
they contained ; and on the acrimony with which the General 
speaks of the designs of the writer. 

" Those who hold the second opinion quote only the im 
punity of the author, the continued friendship and confi 
dence in which he lived with the first officers of the army 
so long as it remained together, and the succession of high 
political trusts which he has held since. It is evident, how 
ever, that, striking as these facts are, they are not sufficient 
to justify the conclusion, that a man of Washington s habit 
ual dignity and uprightness would connive at a pantomime 
of the kind alleged, and much less that he would make him 
self the Punchinello of the show. 

" The third opinion holds a middle place between the 
solemnity of the first and the levity of the second, and 
takes as its foundation some highly important and acknowl 
edged facts, to wit, the derangement in the public finances ; 



.ffl-r. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 409 

the fears and sufferings of public creditors, civil and mili 
tary ; the recommendation of a national impost by Congress 
as the only efficient means of complying with the public 
engagements ; the adoption of this measure by nine States 
out of the twelve, and the very pertinacious and highly cen 
surable rejection of it by Rhode Island. Other facts, less 
known, give this opinion much appearance of probability, 
particularly the mission to the army of Colonel W. Stewart 
from the seat of government, and the representations made 
by him of the prevailing sentiment of Congress and of the 
Department of Finance, on the necessity of the army s 
speaking a more decisive language than had been hitherto 
held. But, on this supposition, the difficulty recurs, why 
such importance given to transactions of so harmless a char 
acter as to means, and so useful as to object? The supple 
mentary facts, it is said, explain this difficulty. They are 
stated to be as follows, namely : that, while these measures 
were maturing, through the agency of Stewart and other 
wise, and while appearances justified the belief that the 
course indicated for the army would be promptly and gen 
erally adopted, a letter was received by the Coinmander-in- 
Chicf from a Mr. Hardy, of Virginia, then a member of 
Congress, advising him that a conspiracy of the very worst 
character, having for object the demolition of our free con 
stitutions, and the destruction of the General s authority , 
was in embryo, and would soon show itself in some overt 
act ; and that Robert and Gouverneur Morris and Alexander 
Hamilton, &c., were at the bottom of the plan; that infor 
mation like this, coming from a quarter in the probity and 
intelligence of which the General placed entire confidence, 
could not pass unheeded ; and that so soon, therefore, as 
the first Address appeared, it was identified with the schemes 
of these supposed conspirators, and measures were immedi 
ately taken to stigmatize the author, and defeat the advice 
he had given ; that accordingly, when the officers assembled, 
the Commaiider-in-Chief opened the discussion with a speech, 
strongly marked with suspicion of the designs of the writer 
VOL. i. 52 



410 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

or writers ; and to show that this was neither hastily nor 
unadvisedly entertained, he read to the meeting the letter 
of Mr. Hardy aforesaid, or an extract from it, containing 
the statement above given ; and that upon this were founded 
the measures subsequently taken by the officers . 

" In this view of the subject most of the difficulties 
attending it disappear. Hardy s assertions or insinuations, 
though no doubt well meant, were ill founded, and led to 
suspicions which ought never to have been excited. As, 
however, this conclusion turns altogether on the truth of 
the facts alleged, and as these may have been misrepre 
sented, my apology for giving you the trouble of reading 
this long letter, and for requesting from you your recollec 
tions of this affair, is purely a desire to see truth prevail ; 
for, in the language of Tacitus, I am able to say, &lt; Mihi 
Galba, Otho, Vitellius, nee beneficio nee injurid cogniti. 1 

" Your answer, by mail, addressed to me at this place, 
and under cover to Jesse Buel, Esq., will reach me prompt 
ly and safely, and confer a great obligation on, 

" Sir, your most respectful and obedient servant,

CHAPTER XXX. 

Statement respecting the Newburgh Addresses, in a Review by 
Armstrong, in 1823. Letter to the Commander-in-Chief mis 
represented as implicating Robert and Gouverneur Morris and 
Alexander Hamilton in a Plot to displace him. The Part taken 
by Colonel Pickering relative to the Newburgh Addresses. 
Letter purporting to be written in 1797 by Washington to 
Armstrong. Its Genuineness questioned. Recollections and 
Reasonings of Colonel Pickering and Governor Brooks respect 
ing the Addresses. Armstrong s Reasons for using the Sig 
nature " Montgars." Dr. Eustis accused of writing the 
Addresses. 

No further notice was taken by Colonel Pickering of 
Armstrong s letter until after the appearance, in " The 
United States Magazine and Literary and Political Re 
pository " for January, 1823, of a review of Johnson s 
" Sketches of the Life and Correspondence of Nathanael 
Greene, Major-General," &c. In this review it is said, 
that, in the autumn of 1782, a memorial to Congress 
was drawn up, representing the sufferings of the army 
on account of their pay being in arrear, and asking for 
relief; that Major-General McDougall, and Colonel Og- 
den, and Colonel Brooks* were selected as a committee 
to present the memorial; that on the 25th of January, 
1783, a committee of Congress made a report upon the 
memorial, and thereupon Congress passed certain resolu 
tions ; f that a report to the army from their commit 
tee attending on Congress was received early in March, 

* Afterwards Governor of Massachusetts. 

f See Journals of Congress, January 25th, 1783. 



412 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

declaring the inauspicious aspect of the moment in 
relation to their commission ; * that the communica 
tion of this report to the army was thought to pre 
sent a fit occasion for assembling the officers, and for 
passing a series of resolutions, which, in the hands of 
their committee and of their auxiliaries in Congress, 
would furnish a new and powerful lever for operating 
on the two States which had refused their assent to 
the application of Congress for power to levy a duty of 
five per cent, on imported goods ; but that, (i to this 
end, there was yet wanting the interposition of a hand 
which should touch with some ability the several chords 
of sympathy and feeling that belonged to the case, and 
thus secure to the deliberations and their result that 
tone and energy without which they would be a dead 
letter ; " and that Armstrong, " yielding to the solicita 
tions of his friends, in a few hours produced an address, 
which was believed to be peculiarly adapted to its object. 
Nor, according to the historian, was its eifect less distin 
guished than its reception ; for, besides being approved 
and applauded, all appeared to be ready to act on the 
advice it contained." 

The reviewer then mentions, that the Commander-in- 
Chief had received a letter from Mr. Harvie,f of Virginia, 
informing him that a plan was matured at the seat of 
government aiming professedly at establishing public 
credit, and supporting national authority, but that its 
real object was to overturn republicanism, and to build 
on its ruins a government of despotic or monarchical 
character; that a part of the plan was to put in the 
place of Washington, as Command er-in-Chief, some one, 

* Sparks s "Writings of Washington," Vol. VIII. pp. 551, 552. 
t In the letter of "Montgars" it is Hardy. Two members of Congress 
from Virginia were named, respectively, Hardy and Harvie. 



JET. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 413 

who, holding from the faction, would be better disposed 
to support their projects ; and that agents were already 
employed with the army to accomplish these purposes. 
"Nor," continues the reviewer, "did the writer stop 
here : he went on to indicate the authors of the plan, 
and pointed distinctly at Robert and Gouverneur Mor 
ris and Alexander Hamilton." 

The reviewer further says, that this communication, 
"though utterly unfounded in the facts it assumed," 
excited in Washington "a momentary alarm for him 
self and his country." 

"Under its impulse, he identified the Address with the 
machinations of his enemies, ascribed it to the pen of one or 
more of the imaginary triumvirate, and denounced it as the 
first step in the progress and development of a deep and dan 
gerous conspiracy. When, on the 15th of March, 1783, the 
army had assembled under the general order of the llth, this 
extraordinary letter was not merely referred to, but publicly 
produced, and read, and commented on, by the Commander- 
in-Chief, and, substantially, became the basis of the pro 
ceedings of that memorable day. We ask, then, how it has 
happened, that a document so important, and which alone 
furnishes a clew to the conduct and opinions of both the 
General and the army on that important occasion, should 
not have been mentioned by any chronicler of the times, or 
biographer of Washington." 

The reviewer answers his own question by supposing 
that the letter must have escaped their research ; and 
he conjectures that it was destroyed by Washington 
himself, under a conviction of its errors and injustice, 
in order to prevent it from doing further injury. As 
circumstances in support of his conjecture, he mentions 
the particular esteem and confidence with which Wash 
ington subsequently regarded the Morrises and Hain- 



414 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKEEING. [1783. 

ilton, and the offer made by him of a high employ 
ment (" not accepted ") " to the acknowledged author of 
these very Addresses." In a note (page 43) he says : 

"To these circumstances, and with the same view, we 
may add, that Timothy Pickering (then Quartermaster- 
General, and, if we do not mistake, the only person who, 
on the 15th of March, opposed himself to the course recom 
mended by Washington and adopted by the army) became, 
at a subsequent period, his Secretary of War." 

Near the close of the review is a letter purporting to 
be from Washington to Armstrong, as follows : 

" PHILADELPHIA, 23d February, 1797. 

SIR, 

"Believing that there may be times and occasions on 
which my opinion of the anonymous letters and their author, 
as delivered to the army in the year 1783, may be turned to 
some personal and malignant purpose, I do hereby declare, 
that I did not, at the time of writing my address, regard you 
as the author of the said anonymous letters ; and further, 
that I have since had sufficient reason for believing that the 
object of the author was just, honorable, and friendly to the 
country, though the means suggested by him were cer 
tainly liable to much misunderstanding and abuse. 

"I am, Sir, with great regard, your most obedient 
servant, 

" GEORGE WASHINGTON." 

After reading the review, Colonel Pickering wrote, May 
6th, 1823, to Governor Brooks, requesting his recollec 
tions concerning the Addresses, and saying, that Judge 
Johnson has ascribed them to Gouverneur Morris ; * 

* Governor Brooks, in his answer, says, "Judge Johnson s hypothesis . . . 
is destitute of support. In reference to the second letter, the thing was im 
possible, as the Judge ought to have known. Mr. Morris was at the time in 
Philadelphia. The general order noticing the first letter was issued on the 
llth of March, 1783, and the next morning the second letter appeared." 



MT. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 415 

that his reasoning on the subject is absurd in the 
extreme ; that the review above mentioned, of which 
Armstrong was doubtless the author, had appeared, 
wherein it was stated that the letters were written by 
Armstrong ; and that he (Colonel Pickering), and he sup 
posed every officer in the army, had never doubted it. 
He thinks that, if the extraordinary letter from Harvie 
had been read to the officers, he should have remem 
bered it ; but he cannot recollect that Washington read 
anything besides his address. And as to his (Colonel 
Pickering s) being the only person who opposed the 
course recommended by Washington, he says : 

"Now, my memory must have greatly failed me indeed, 
if there was any opposition from any quarter ; and surely 
not from me, who had no interest in the question which so 
deeply concerned the officers of the line. As Quartermaster- 
General, my compensation was in my own hands. I was, in 
fact, a mere spectator." 

The answer from Governor Brooks was delayed until 
the 6th of September, 1823, in consequence of a pro 
tracted illness. Nearly two years after the receipt of 
it, Colonel Pickering wrote a letter to Armstrong, dated 
the 15th of July, 1825, in which he says: 

"On the 28th of January, 1820, I received a letter, dated 
the 20th, at Albany, and signed John Montgars, requesting 
a communication of my recollections concerning the anony 
mous letters addressed to the officers of the army, at New- 
burgh, in March, 1783. On the 29th I acknowledged the 
receipt of the letter, but declined a compliance with the re 
quest of a man of whom I had never heard. My letter was 
addressed to Mr. John Montgars, Albany. This strange 
name, connected with the subject of the letter, excited my 
curiosity to know who should call for my answer. I there 
fore wrote to the postmaster (whom I had never seen, but, 



416 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

having taken his paper, called * The Plough Boy, had cor 
responded with him on agricultural subjects), requesting 
him to take notice of the person who should call for it. 
After sending my answer to the post-office, I again atten 
tively read the letter signed John Montgars. The hand 
writing then appeared to be that of a lady, and wholly 
different from the signature and the superscription, which 
struck me as being the handwriting of John Armstrong, the 
writer of the anonymous letters ; and then, transposing the 
letters of the strangely-sounding name Montgars, I found 
it, adding one r, to be Armstrong. All these circumstances 
authorized the conclusion that you had written the letter 
signed John Montgars. This last attentive perusal of the 
letter also directed my observation to its concluding request, 
to address my answer to the care of Jesse Buel, Esquire, 
which, occupied as was my mind with the subject itself, I 
had passed over unheeded. So I wrote again to the post 
master, desiring him, with his own hand, to deliver my 
answer to Mr. Buel." 

" Montgars 9 s story of Mr. Harvie s letter was a perfect 
novelty, and I was sure had no foundation in fact. What 
could give rise to such a tale was, indeed, to me utterly 
incomprehensible. However, although I had no reason 
to be pleased that you should attempt, by such a course 
of proceeding, to draw from me a-ny sort of information, 
yet, leaving Montgars s letter on tile merely as a subject 
of amusement, I should never have troubled you with any 
notice of it, had you not introduced my name and the same 
story of Harvie s letter into your review of Judge Johnson s 
1 Sketches of the Life of General Greene. I call it your re 
view, in the full persuasion that you wrote it. In addition 
to the circumstances before mentioned, I considered the 
story of Harvie s letter recited in the review, as it had been 
before stated by John Montgars, as fixing the identity of 
authorship, and that you wrote both. 

"... Although confident that, at the meeting of the offi 
cers on the 15th, pursuant to the general orders of the llth 



^r. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 417 

of March, 1783, no opposition to the course recommended by 
Washington and adopted by the officers was made by me 
or by any other officer, and although I considered it certain 
that such a letter as you state Mr. Harvie had written to 
the General was not read by him, nor commented upon or 
adverted to by him, yet, to obtain the most perfect satis 
faction on both points, from a most unexceptionable witness, 
I wrote to Governor Brooks, who, you know, at the interest 
ing period referred to, was a colonel in the Massachusetts 
line, and one of the committee who brought in the resolu 
tions adopted by the officers. At the same time I informed 
him, that, on the receipt of his answer, I should write to 
you or to the editor of the Magazine on the subject of those 
errors. But the severe sickness of the Governor, a pro 
tracted convalescence, the necessity of some research, and 
the cares of his office, prevented his favoring me with an 
answer until September. This answer confirmed my own 
recollections ; but by that time the affair had grown old, and 
I felt much apathy concerning it. A few months ago, 
however, it was reported that you were engaged in writing 
the History of the United States, as John Montgars had 
before asserted ; and then I again intended to write, to 
inform you of the two errors above mentioned, Harvie s 
letter and my opposition. And now, after so much pro 
crastination, I give you Governor Brooks s information, 
perfectly corresponding with my own recollections. I told 
him that I had never doubted, and supposed no officer in 
the army, at the time, doubted your being the author of the 
anonymous letters ; and that on the cover of my manuscript 
copies it was noted, in my own handwriting, that the letters 
were written By J. A. Jun., * your father being then living. 
"Governor Brooks, in his letter to me, [of the 6th of 
September, 1823], says, My impressions respecting the

point for which it is adduced. See Colonel Pickering s letter of March IGth,

418 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

writer of the Newburgh anonymous letters were, at the time 
of their being published, and ever since have been, similar 
to vour own. The story told by the reviewer of General 
Washington s having publicly read and commented upon a 
letter from Mr. Harvie, is altogether fictitious. No letter 
whatever was read by the General when he addressed the 
officers ; nor was any writing, or source of information, 
touching the subject of the meeting, mentioned by him, 
excepting the anonymous letters. 

" Governor Brooks then, mentioning the report of the 
army committee at Philadelphia having been read to the 
officers and considered, recurs to the subject of the General s 
address, and says, The address was acted upon by itself; 
and, being put into the hands of a committee, of which Gen 
eral Knox was chairman, the committee reported a nurnb.er 
of resolves, which, without opposition or discussion, were 
accepted. 

"The Governor, after numerous details and observations, 
further says, I have been thus particular in order to show 
that the assertion of the reviewer, that you were the only 
person who opposed the measures recommended by General 
Washington on the 15th of March, and adopted by the army, 
is destitute of foundation. There was, as you rightly inti 
mate, no opposition from any quarter. In truth, personally 
I had no interest in the pending question about half pay or 
commutation, a question so highly interesting to the officers 
of the line.* For their sufferings, indeed, I felt very sen- 



* Although he was not entitled to half pay or commutation (see page 312), 
it would seem that he was "personally" interested in having provision made 
for the payment of the public creditors. In 1825 he wrote to Judge John 
son, " I had no arrears of pay to demand; my compensation was in my own 
hands ; " but here his memory was certainly at fault, for it appears that he did 
not apply the public money received by him to the payment in full of the sums 
due either to himself or to his assistants (see page 274) ; and in a letter to 
Robert Morris, of the 1st of April, only seventeen days after the meeting of 
the officers, he said, " I am now indebted, for moneys borrowed of my friends 
since the 22d of February, 1781, for the support of my family, upwards of 
nineteen hundred hard dollars." At the same time about four thousand dol 
lars were due to him as a member of the Board of War. See pp. 452, 454. 



JEx. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 419 

sibly, and most cordially wished them relief. Affected by 
such sentiments, I doubtless expressed them in the conver 
sations of the time. The justice of their claims was so 
palpable, apparently so irresistible, the upright heart of 
Washington, and perhaps an idea of a successful interpo 
sition from the influence of his name and character, then so 
highly exalted and in almost universal estimation supremely 
meritorious, produced a confidence that adequate provision 
for doing complete justice to the army would be made. The 
expression of this confidence by the General doubtless had 
a powerful influence on the assembled officers, and induced 
on their part a reciprocation of that confidence ; fully con 
vinced, say they, that the representatives of America will 
not disband or disperse the army until their accounts are 
liquidated, the balances accurately ascertained, and adequate 
funds established for payment ; including the half pay or 
commutation. But the separate, sovereign States withheld 
the means of providing such funds ; the army was dis 
banded, and cheated. 

"The letter dated February 23d, 1797, and published in 
the review as from Washington to you, concerning the 
anonymous letters, occasioned, generally, no small degree 
of surprise ; and some doubts have been entertained of its 
authenticity.* I have been well informed that no such 
letter is to be found among Washington s archives ; and 
the declaration in the letter, that, at the time of writing his 
Address, he did not regard you as the author of the anony 
mous letters, is an enigma. His military secretary and aids 
mingled among the officers of the army, and of these the 
united voices would have pronounced you to be the author. 
Now, in considering the anonymous letters in the military 
cabinet, the first question obviously must have been, Who 
wrote them? and the answer of the military family must 
have been, The officers, w r ith one voice, ascribe them to 
Armstrong. How, then, could you be wholly forgotten, 

* Mr. Sparks publishes the letter, without calling in question its genuine 
ness. Writings of Washington, Vol. VIII. p. 566. 



420 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

and not regarded as the author of those letters? The in 
terrogatory intimation, in the General s address, that the 
writer, instead of a friend to the army, was rather an 
insidious foe, some emissary perhaps from New York,* 
would seem to me to have been suggested to aggravate the 
offence of the writer, and to produce an increased excite 
ment in the persons addressed, rather than as indicative that 
such was the General s belief. The general strain of the 
address shows that he then thought the writer of the anony 
mous letters highly criminal, and therefore warranting the 
above-mentioned suggestion." 

Governor Brooks, in his letter to Colonel Pickering, 
considers the authorship of the Newburgh Addresses to 
be placed beyond question by Armstrong s review of 
Johnson s " Life of Greene " ; but he says : 

" I should not have expected to meet the assertions of the 
reviewer, that the author of the anonymous letters did not 
lie concealed a single month ; that in the year 1783 he made 
no secret of his having written them, and that in the year 
1803 he republished, acknowledged, and defended them. 
For, although the facts as stated might have been true, yet 
the avowal, I am confident, never reached me." 

In regard to the supposed letter of 1797, in which 
Washington is made to say of the Newburgh Addresses, 
that he had " had sufficient reason for believing that the 
object of the author was just, honorable, and friendly 
to the country," Governor Brooks says : 

"It seems most extraordinary and inexplicable that the 
President should have written such a letter to General Arm 
strong. It had not been solicited, and no circumstances 
appear which could have called for such a communication. 
. . . But there are other considerations connected with the 
President s letter to Mr. Armstrong, as there were other 



^x. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 421 

parties equally with him, under any view of the case, entitled 
to an explanation, I mean the public, and more especially 
the army. For there can be no doubt the tone of public 
opinion respecting the design and tendency of the New- 
burgh letters was given and maintained by the address 
and other documents of General Washington. A similar 
remark will apply to the army, though with some limitation. 
What the impressions on the General s own mind were, 
when, on the 15th of March, 1783, he addressed the officers 
of the army respecting the character of those letters, is best 
learned from the measures he took to counteract their influ 
ence. But they must have been strong and deep to have 
warranted, or to have drawn from him, so grave and solemn 
an appeal to the honor, the patriotism, and the sober judg 
ment of the army, as his was on that occasion." 

Governor Brooks controverts the assertion that the 
design of the writer of the Newburgh Addresses was 
honorable and friendly to the country, and states the 
disastrous consequences which probably would have 
flowed from the measures there recommended ; but he 
argues that the idea, which he says was entertained by 
some persons at the time, that a revolt of the army 
was feasible, and to be effected with the greatest facility, 
was a delusion. 

In answer to Colonel Pickering s letter of the 15th 
of July, 1825, Armstrong wrote, on the 6th of October, 
as follows : 

"The anagram which gave you so much trouble, and even 
some degree of offence, was employed with two views 
equally innoxious : the one, to secure to the documents I 
might obtain, an impartiality wholly uninfluenced by the 
name of the applicant, or by any supposed relation in which 
he stood to the transaction inquired into ; the other, to avoid 
being gazetted as a writer of history until I bad better 



422 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

assured myself that my health, and habits, and family avo 
cations would enable me to go through the labor necessarily 
connected with such an undertaking. As a device for sur 
prising you into the admission of any fact of doubtful occur 
rence, it would have been equally base and bungling, and 
quite as inapplicable to your character as unworthy of my 
own. What I asked was, not an approval of any statement 
of mine, but your best recollection of a public and interest 
ing fact; and be assured, that had my respect for you been 
less, either on the score of intelligence or integrity, you 
would not have been troubled with an application from me 
in any form or under any name." 

Then, after observing that traditionary details ought 
to be received with great circumspection, and that the 
narratives of even ear and eye witnesses often differ 
very materially, and sometimes expressly contradict 
each other, he says : 

"Between your recollection and mine, in relation to the 
southern letter and its influence on the proceedings of the 
15th of March, 1783, there is a similar discrepancy, and, of 
course, another proof of the uncertainty of historical evi 
dence. In support of your belief, you quote the respectable 
authority of the late Governor Brooks, given, at your in 
stance, upwards of forty years after the transaction to which 
it refers, and, if my inference from your letter be just, when 
Mr. Brooks was literally on his death-bed ; while, on the 
other hand, I am able to sustain mine by that of another 
and equally respectable member of the committee, whose 
statement was spontaneously made, within a month after the 
meeting, in a sound state of both mind * and body, and in 
an official letter (transmitting a copy of the resolutions 

* Colonel Pickering, in a subsequent letter to Armstrong, repels the in 
ference that Brooks was not in a sound state of mind, saying, "I am sure 
there was no ground for such a supposition ; his mind and memory appeared 
to me as clear and unclouded as at any period of his life." Brooks lived till 
March 1st, 1825, nearly eighteen mouths after the date of his letter. 



MT. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 423 

adopted) to a general officer, commanding a separate and 
distant department. You will at once perceive that I allude 
to the late General Hand.* 

" Another disagreement, though of minor importance, 
relates to the part taken by you in the hasty discussion 
given to the subject at the Public Building. That I did 
believe you to have been opposed to the course pursued on 
that occasion, is true ; and that this belief resulted from im 
pressions made by your public speech, is also true ; but, 
if even actions be liable to misconstruction, how much more 
so are words ! It is enough that you now disavow the im 
putation, as I am far from supposing that either my com 
prehension of your meaning then, or my recollection of 
your language now, can be more correct than your own. 
In any future notice, therefore, that I may have occasion to 
take of the business, I shall be careful to correct the state 
ment made in the review." 

Armstrong next examines the objections made 
against the genuineness of the letter of 1797, from 
President Washington. To the objection that the letter 
is not found in the Washington archives, he replies, 
that, were there no similar omissions in these records, 
the circumstance would barely furnish a presumption 
against its genuineness ; whereas it is well known that 
there are gaps in Washington s letter-books. 

The other objection he alleges to be merely argu 
mentative, resting on gratuitous facts, but which, even 
if granted, he says, will not support the conclusion 
drawn from them ; for, supposing that Washington 
believed as he said or insinuated that he did, with 
regard to the character and motives of the author of 
the anonymous letters, and that he was assured at the 
same time of his person, it was his obvious duty to 

* Then Adjutant-General. He was at the meeting, but was not a member 
of the committee. 



424 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

bring him to light and to punish him ; but, as he omitted 
to do either, it followed that he uttered opinions which 
he did not seriously entertain, or that, not having it in 
his power to identify the author, he was unable to do 
more than he did. But Armstrong denies that, on the 
15th of March, 1783, the anonymous letters were 
unanimously ascribed to him by the officers of the 
army. He says : 

"On the very day of the meeting I heard the letters 
ascribed to not less than five different persons, among whom 
the real author was not mentioned. Nor did this difference 
of opinion cease with the meeting, nor even with the war ; 
in proof of which I need but recall to your memory the 
persecution suffered by the late Governor Eustis, in the 
town of Boston, on the testimony of an officer of the old 
army, and on the ground that he (Eustis) was the writer of 
these very letters, a charge so seriously made, so generally 
believed, and so pertinaciously urged by a large and respec 
table party in the district, that, to escape its effects, the suf 
ferer was driven to the expedient of an expurgatory oath." 

It is difficult to reconcile these assertions with the 
statement in the review, that the author of the anony 
mous letters did not lie concealed a month, and that 
in 1783 he made no secret of his having written them. 
In 1800, when Dr. Eustis was the Democratic candidate 
for election as a member of Congress for the district of 
Suffolk, in Massachusetts, a statement by Dr. Eustis, un 
der his name, was published in the Boston newspapers, 
in which he says he has been " announced the author " ; 
and he " declares most solemnly? but not " under oath? 
that the charge is false. He was also accused of being 
at least an abettor in the production and distribution 
of the letters. To this imputation he did not reply.* 

* See, in the "Columbian Centinel" of the 29th of October, 1800, Dr. 
Eustis s declaration, and the pieces signed "A Citizen," and "An Elector; " 



MT. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 425 

If the letter attributed to Washington was genuine, 
the election in Suffolk afforded a fair opportunity to 
Armstrong to come to the rescue of Eustis, his old fel 
low-soldier and friend, and then a member of the same 
political party, by publishing that letter ; which, being 
addressed to Armstrong, would have shown that in 
1797 Washington understood him to be the writer of 
the Addresses, and so would have relieved Dr. Eustis 
from an imputation he was anxious to repel ; while, at 
the same time, the tone of the letter would have les 
sened the odium resting on Armstrong himself. 

After Armstrong had, in his review, in 1823, ac 
knowledged himself to be the author of the letters, 
Dr. Eustis admitted to Dr. Thacher that he was " in the 
secret," and communicated information respecting them ; 
which previously he had declined doing.* From this it 
would seem that Dr. Eustis had not been aware of Arm 
strong s avowal in 1803, a singular circumstance, if 
the avowal was explicit. That it was so, is the purport 
of Armstrong s statement, that in 1803 he republished, 
acknowledged, and defended the letters. 

Armstrong says further : 

" Having thus briefly examined the two objections as 
stated by you, it may not be amiss to subjoin a short sketch 
of my own impression with regard to their rise and prog 
ress. Though the General s letter was written early in 
1797, and was read by several persons entirely capable of 
deciding whether it was or was not genuine, neither surprise 
nor doubt was excited by it. It was seen and regarded as 
an act of justice to me, and even to himself, who had some 
years before actually appointed me to an office of high trust 
and confidence, without a shadow of application on my part. 

and, in the paper of the 1st of November, a piece signed "Faneuil Hall," and 
certificates of William Hull and Benjamin Russell. 
* See the letter of Dr. Thacher, on page 436. 

VOL. i. 54 



426 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

In this unimpeached condition it remained till 1803, when 
(having been forced into a political controversy of warm 
and personal character) I was charged, on the evidence of 
the anonymous letters, with enmity to Washington, and a 
design to excite the army to insurrection. In repelling 
these absurd charges, I was naturally led to mention the 
General s letter of the 23d of February, 1797, and, if I do 
not mistake, to quote a portion of it ; which produced a 
demand, on the part of my antagonist, for the letter in 
extenso. This call was promptly complied with; but, the 
printer having committed an error in the date, the letter 
itself was now required ; and not unreasonably, since a sub 
mission of it to public inspection was, no doubt, the shortest 
and surest method of determining whether the error was 
really one of the types, or the excuse a mere fiction of the 
printer. This second call was accordingly neither refused 
nor evaded. The letter was instantly placed in the office 
of the Plebeian, with instructions that it should be shown 
to any person of any party who had a desire to see it. 
When I say that my principal antagonist was the late 
Bareut Gardenier, I need hardly add that the document 
underwent a very thorough examination ; the result of 
which was a discontinuance of all further attacks on its 
genuineness. 

" Such is the real history of the first appearance of the 
doubts and surmises which have existed on this subject ; 
but, though publicly refuted by the production of the letter 
itself, what can be easier than to give them a resurrection? 
Ignorance of the facts I have just stated, or a forgetfulness 
of them, or a desire to renew the controversy, may at once 
produce this effect ; and my labors must be renewed, or I 
must submit quietly, or at least silently, to the old and ex 
ploded imputation. In discussing some of Judge Johnson s 
dreams, a year or two ago, it became necessary for me to 
mention this letter; and, anticipating a question concerning 
its genuineness, I suggested a mode by which the Judge 
might become personally, or by proxy, a party to the hives- 



Mt. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKEKING. 427 

tigation ; but, perhaps, not choosing to be convinced against 
his will, he declined the invitation ; and there rests the 
business between him and me. Fortunately men more 
competent than himself, as well with regard to the knowl 
edge as the impartiality necessary to the inquiry, have not 
declined the task ; and I accordingly subjoin a copy of a 
certificate of one who will not be suspected of being a 
dupe, and still less of combining with another in giving 
credit and currency to an imposture, which, from his inti 
mate acquaintance with General Washington s handwriting, 
it would be so easy for him to detect. I mean the late 
guest of the nation, General de Lafayette. It is in the 
following words : 1 1, the undersigned, do certify, that the 
foregoing letter is a true and literal copy of one signed by 
the late General Washington, in his proper handwriting, 
and addressed within to John Armstrong, Esq., and with 
out to General John Armstrong, Kinebec, Manor of Liv 
ingston, franked and dated Philadephia, Feb. 23d, 1797. 
LAFAYETTE. " 

To some minds the question may present itself, 
If Armstrong was conscious of the genuineness of the 
letter, and satisfied that he had produced convincing 
proof of it, why should he anticipate the probability 
that it would be again called in question? With 
respect to Lafayette s certificate, it may be observed, 
that the circumstances under which it was made, and 
the object of it, are not set forth; that it does not 
appear that his attention was called to the suspicion 
resting on the genuineness of the letter ; and that, if 
the object was to prove it genuine, no reason is given 
why he did not certify on the letter itself, rather than 
on a copy of it, that it was in the handwriting of Wash 
ington. 

Armstrong says the exculpation "was regarded as 
an act of justice to me." But why should Washington 



428 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

do any act in the premises ? He had not named Arm 
strong in his address to the officers ; nor, according to 
Armstrong, did he then suspect him to be the writer 
of the anonymous letters ; neither is it probable, that, 
even in 1797, this fact was with Washington any thing- 
more than a suspicion founded on mere rumor; for, by 
Armstrong s own statement, the authorship was a sub 
ject of controversy so late as 1800, when Dr. Eustis 
was a candidate for office.* Moreover, Dr. Eustis, his 
confidential friend, did not consider the injunction of 
secrecy removed from his lips until the appearance 
of the review, in 1823, of Johnson s Life of General 
Greene.f 

On the other hand, the allegation that the letter 
of 1797 was actually written by Washington, derives 
support from the subsequent statement of Colonel 
Pickering in relation to acts done by Washington just 
before he retired from the Presidency, as well as 
from the letter of General Cobb, quoted in the next 
chapter. J 

In writing to Judge Johnson, March 9th, 1825, 
Colonel Pickering refers to the letter from President 
Washington of the 23d of February, 1797, "eight 
days prior to the termination of his presidency," and 
states certain facts as countenancing the idea that the 
letter might be genuine. He says: 

"Just at the close of his administration, Washington 
appears to have thought it expedient to state some things 
in which his opinion and testimony might be useful, perhaps 
necessary, for the public good and the establishment of 
truth. Hence his letter to Mr. Adams, his elected succes 
sor, dated February 20th, 1797, . . . recommending to

him not to withhold merited promotion from Mr. John 
Quincy Adams, because he was his son. . . . Three days 
after his letter to Adams, that to Armstrong bears date. 
And on the 3d of March, the last day of his presidency, 
he wrote his letter* to me, as Secretary of State, in which 
he specified seven letters, to Lund Washington and others, 
which, in 1777, were published by the British or their Tory 
adherents in New York, as General Washington s; and, 
after a minute detail of facts to falsify the enemy s state 
ment concerning them, he says, * I have thought it a duty 
that I owed to myself, to my country and to truth, now to 
detail the circumstances above recited ; and to add my sol 
emn declaration, that the letters herein described are a base 
forgery. "

lish a Monarchy. Further Discussion of the Genuineness of the 
Letter purporting to be written by Washington to Armstrong.

Contemporary Letters of Colonel Pickering. Proceedings on

AFTER receiving the last-mentioned letter from Arm 
strong, Colonel Pickering wrote to General David Cobb, 
Colonel Nicholas Fish. General Ebenezer Huntington, 
General William Hull, and Dr. James Thacher, officers 
in the American army of the Revolution, giving his 
own and requesting their recollections respecting the 
Newburgh Addresses. 

In his letter to General Cobb, after mentioning Arm 
strong s assertion, that Washington read to the officers 
a letter from Colonel Harvie, in which it was stated 
that a plan was matured at the seat of government to 
overturn republicanism and set up a monarchy, and to 
put down the Commander-in-Chief, and that Robert and 
Gouverneur Morris and Alexander Hamilton were the 
authors of the plan, he says : 

" Never was I more astonished than on reading the above 
account of such a letter from Colonel Harvie. When the 
General delivered his address to the officers, I stood within 
ten feet of him ; and if such a letter had been read, and 
commented upon, by him, I deem it absolutely impossible 



MT. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 431 

that I should not have noticed and remembered it, impli 
cating, as it did, so criminally, such eminent men as Robert 
and Gouverneur Morris and Alexander Hamilton. ... I 
recollect that the General, having begun to read his address 
without his spectacles, presently paused ; and, while pulling 
them out of his pocket, he said, I have grown gray in the 
service, and am now growing blind. : 

General Cobb, who was an aid of General Washington, 
wrote, in reply, from Taunton, November 9th, 1825 : - 

" I was not present at the meeting of the officers in the 
Temple at Newburgh in March, 1783 ; but, within a fort 
night after, I joined the family at head-quarters, where the 
circumstances of that meeting and the anonymous letters 
were the subjects of our frequent conversations. From 
this source of* information, I am confident you are correct 
in saying that neither Harvie s letter nor any other writing 
or observation was communicated by the Commander-m- 
Chief at the time he delivered his address, excepting a few 
words, the purport of which you have recited. You will 
permit me to repeat them as I had them from Secretary 
Trumbull. When the General took his station in the desk 
or pulpit, which, you may recollect, was in the Temple, he 
took out his written address from his coat pocket, and his 
spectacles, with his other hand, from his waistcoat pocket, 
and then addressed the officers in the following manner : 
* Gentlemen, you will permit me to put on my spectacles, 
for I have not only grown gray, but almost blind, in the 
service of my country. This little address, with the mode 
and manner of delivering it, drew tears from [many]* of 
the officers. As you were present, you may perhaps recol 
lect this circumstance. 

" Prior to the appearance of the first anonymous letter, 
reports were in circulation, that the leading men of the 
government at Philadelphia had made arrangements for 

* Some such word as many or most seems to have been accidentally omitted. 



432 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

forming a monarchical government in the United States, 
instead of a republic. Washington was to have the offer 
of the throne; but, finding that he abhorred their system, 
and would not accept their offer, they proceeded by anony 
mous letters and agents to corrupt the army, in hopes of 
compelling him into a compliance.* General Gates and his 
aid, Armstrong, were in the plot ; . the anonymous letters 
came out of Gates s family, and were privately communicat 
ed by Armstrong to the officers in the huts. This circum 
stance, no doubt, gave rise to the report, or opinion, that 
he was the author of them ; but this was never the opinion 
of head-quarters. The first letter, in particular, was ever 
considered as coming from a pen far above Armstrong s 
mark, and perhaps from one second only to Juuius ; the 
other letter was of a minor character. It is true, as Arm 
strong observes, that others, besides himself, were charged 
with being the author of the letters. Eustis, our late Gov 
ernor, was one ; others I do not recollect. 

" I never heard of Harvie s letter before : if the Com- 
mander-in-Chief ever received such a letter, it was unknown 
in his family, or, at least, unknown to me ; but that he was 
acquainted particularly with the* machinations at Philadel 
phia I have no doubt. f Whether the characters implicated 
in Harvie s letter were concerned in the plot, is a matter 
of no importance in my mind ; for much greater characters 



* General Cobb and Armstrong agree in the statement, that, about the time 
of the Newburgh Addresses, there were machinations at Philadelphia for estab 
lishing a monarchy; but they differ in one important point, Cobb asserting 1 
that Washington was to be compelled to accept the throne ; Armstrong, that 
he was to be supplanted. Possibly both, in their indistinct recollection, had 
reference to an occurrence ten months before, when a proposal to make 
Washington king in fact, though not in name, was rejected by him in a tone 
"to preclude most effectually any further advances." Sparks s Writings 
of Washington, Vol. VIII. pp. 300, 301 (note), 393.

Kevolution," Vol. IV. p. 17. 



JET. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 433 

than they were at the head of it. I have ever considered 
that the United States are indebted for their republican 
form of government solety to the firm and determined 
republicanism of General Washington at that time. 

" The President s letter to Armstrong, in 1797, I believe 
to be genuine, from two sentiments therein expressed, the 
one, that at the time of writing his address, he did not 
regard him as the author of the anonymous letters ; the 
other, that the author had honorable and friendly views to 
his country, although mistaken ones, &c. These I believe, 
indeed I may say I know them, to be the opinions of the 
President. 

" You observe that Judge Johnson, in his Life of General 
Greene, ascribes the Newburgh anonymous letters (letter, 
I should say) to Gouverneur Morris. In this he meets my 
opinion, and, I believe, the unanimous opinion of head 
quarters. I should, therefore, say, that Armstrong s avow 
ing himself the author of those letters (of the second he 
may have been, with assistance) is to be set down to the 
score of vanity altogether.* 

" I have thus freely communicated to you, for your private 
satisfaction and amusement, some of the opinions and trans 
actions of head-quarters at the most eventful period in the 
life of Washington, and I have to request that they go no 
further; for, if I am called upon to verify my assertions, I 
can make no defence. My witnesses are all dead, and I can 
only appeal to the Court of Heaven." 

The propriety of publishing General Cobb s letter, 
in disregard of his request, may possibly be questioned; 
but his testimony seemed to be too important to be 
omitted in a history of the Newburgh Addresses. The 
letter exposes him to no imputation other than that 
of misrecollection in regard to an early occurrence, 
and of erroneous opinions. In these respects he stands 

* See Sparks s " Writings of Washington," Vol. VIII. pp. 419. But Arm 
strong s claim is sustained by Dr. Eustis, as hereafter stated on page 436. 

VOL. i. 55 



434 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

on equal ground with Colonel Pickering and other 
contemporaries here quoted, and needs "make no 
defence." 

If. as he alleges, it was never the opinion at head 
quarters that Armstrong was the writer of the anony 
mous letters, and if Cobb himself continued incredulous 
in 1825, the simple fact, that the person, whoever he 
might be, to whom, in 1783, Washington attributed the 
" blackest designs," was afterwards thought by him to 
have acted from good motives, does not furnish very 
strong ground for writing to Armstrong the letter of 
1797 on the mere surmise that he was the person in 
question. 

Without denying the genuineness of the letter of 
1797, it seems to me, that, on a view of all the cir 
cumstances, we may at least return the Scotch verdict 
in doubtful cases " Not proven." 

On the foregoing letter from General Cobb, Colonel 
Pickering has made this indorsement : 

" I never heard of the monarchical plot herein mentioned ; 
nor do 1 know of the greater men in Philadelphia (where 
Congress then sat) than Robert and Gouverneur Morris and 
Alexander Hamilton, whom Harvie, in the supposed letter, 
is made to name as the plotters. The idea of a design of 
those three, or of any members of Congress, to set up a 
monarchy, is too ridiculous to have been contemplated, at 
that time, by any man of sense ; and I am astonished that 
Cobb should believe (as his letter imports) in its reality.* 
And he most erroneously underrates Armstrong s talents, 
which are certainly of a high order. The second letter is 
just such as the occasion called for, and did not admit of 
the glowing sentiments exhibited in the first." 

* Nevertheless the establishment of a monarchy was proposed to Washing 
ton in May, 1782, as before mentioned. See page 432, note. 



Mt. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 435 

Colonel Nicholas Fish, also an aid of Washington, 
was absent in West Chester County at the time when 
Washington addressed the officers ; but he says, in a 
letter of November 30th, 1825 : 

" On my return a few days thereafter, I heard all that had 
taken place, even the circumstance of the General s spec 
tacles, as stated in your letter, and the effect produced 
by it, but never heard a word of Mr. Harvie s conspiracy 
letter." 

He is confident that if such a letter, implicating 
Eobert and Gouverneur Morris and Alexander Ham 
ilton, had been read, he should not have forgotten it ; 
and of the like opinion were Colonel Aaron Ogden, 
of New Jersey, and the officers of the New York 
Society of Cincinnati, with whom Colonel Fish had 
conversed. 

General Ebenezer Huntington, in a letter to Colonel 
Pickering, dated at Norwich, December 28th, 1825 ? 
says : 

"At the time those celebrated Newburgh letters made 
their appearance in camp at West Point, I was absent there 
from on a visit to Connecticut, and did not return until the 
meeting of the officers had been held for their considera 
tion. . . . The subject-matter under consideration at that 
meeting of the officers was, on my return, minutely detailed 
to me by the officers who attended ; . . . but I have not 
the smallest impression on my mind, that I ever heard of 
any plot to overturn the republican institutions of our 
country, at that period to which you allude, say 1783, 
excepting so far as we may apply that term to the anony 
mous letters." 

Dr. James Thacher wrote from Plymouth the 5th 
of January, 1826, and, after mentioning that Captain 



436 LITE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

James Sever, of Kingston, near Plymouth, was at the 
meeting of the officers, he says : 

"He [Sever] is positive that no such letter as Armstrong 
mentions Was ever produced on that occasion. He believes, 
with me, and with all others that I have conversed with, 
that it is a vile fabrication, and a most gross absurdity. 
The characters named as the conspirators were, it is well 
known, among the warmest friends of Washington. It is 
very strange that no one has ever exposed Armstrong s 
falsehood to the public view. When I was about to pub 
lish my Journal,* I had some conversation with Dr. Eustis 
on the subject of the anonymous letters, wishing to draw 
something from him that I might publish ; but he would 
give me no information. After Armstrong s publication in 
the Magazine I again introduced the subject to Dr. Eustis, 
and he freely acknowledged that he was in the secret ; and 
added, that Armstrong had written, besides the anonymous 
letters, something which was, as he termed it, much worse, 
but, finding himself already in trouble, he deemed it most 
prudent to suppress it. I am of opinion, that, had Arm 
strong met with much encouragement, he would have been 
the means of effecting nearly the destruction of the army 
and our country." 

In his letter to General Hull (to which no answer 
is found), Colonel Pickering wrote : 

"An attempt to use the force of the remnant of the army 
in rebellion against the government of our country, would 
have been absurd, because success was too impracticable 
to be hoped for. Besides, the army could not have been 
brought into the measure ; while the alarm to be excited 
by the intimation not to disband until funds were provided 
for the ultimate payment of the arrears due to the army, 

* It was published in 1823, under the title of " Military Journal during the 
American Revolutionary War." 



^Ex. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 437 

might have induced the delinquent States (Rhode Island, 
and I believe Maryland, which refused to grant imposts 
and other taxes) to concur with the other eleven States in 
making such just and adequate provision. The establish 
ment of such funds would have raised the final-settlement 
notes to par, or near it." 

Paley, in his " Horse Paulinas." observes, in reference 
to the authentication of historical facts, " The great 
object of modern research is to come at the epistolary 
correspondence of the times. Amidst the obscurities, 
the silence, or the contradictions of history, if a letter 
can be found, we regard it as the discovery of a land 
mark ; as that by which we can correct, adjust, or 
supply the imperfections and uncertainties of other 
accounts." * This remark is strikingly applicable, in 
the case of the Newburgh Addresses, to the following 
important letters from Colonel Pickering to Mr. Hodg- 
don, his Assistant Quartermaster-General, at Philadel 
phia, and to Mrs. Pickering. 

" NEWBURGH, March 16th, 1783. 
" MY DEAR SlR, 

"By this conveyance Congress will be furnished with "f, ru 4 
copies of the proceedings of the officers of the army at faA I 
their meeting yesterday, of which I gave you an intimation 
in my last. That you may not be kept in suspense about 
the origin and ground of this transaction, and for the grati 
fication of yourself and friends, I enclose you copies of the 
anonymous papers which gave the alarm, and of the general 
orders consequent thereon. I wish I could send you also a 
copy of the proceedings yesterday ; but I have them not. 
But I can recite them substantially. 

" The Commander-in-Chief attended, and addressed the 
assembly (composed of the general and field officers, and

438 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

an officer from each company, and the principal staff) in a 
handsome speech, which he read, having (as he said) com 
mitted his thoughts to writing, that he might express them 
with more perspicuity and connection. It was, in sub 
stance, declaratory of the merits of the army, of the repu 
tation they had gained, and which was spread through all 
Europe, of his affection for his fellow-soldiers, his 
anxiety lest they should, by a precipitate action, excited 
by such inflammatory pieces as the anonymous Addresses, 
tarnish their well-earned glory, his readiness to render 
them every aid in his power to relieve their sufferings and 
procure them justice, of his confidence in the good dis 
positions of Congress towards them, and that rash meas 
ures now might defeat the very ends they had in view. He 
also expressed his abhorrence of the insidious designs of the 
writer of the anonymous Addresses, and even intimated that 
he might be an emissary (or in league with one) from New 
York. 

"After this the General [Washington] read a private 
letter of the 27th of February (I imagine from Mr. Jones, 
of Virginia) from a member of Congress, written without 
the most distant expectation of its being used on such an 
occasion ; but, containing sentiments and information perti 
nent to the occasion, he thought himself justified in the 
communication of it. This letter was written with calmness 
and great good sense ; mentioning the measures Congress 
were pursuing to obtain permanent revenues, and his hopes 
of their succeeding, the reasons which prevented prompt 
decisions, and his wishes that the army might a little longer 
persevere in that line of patient endurance which had hith 
erto done them so much honor. 

" The General having then withdrawn, and General Gates 
assumed the chair, General Knox moved a vote of thanks 
to the Commander-m-Chief for his excellent speech. It 
was carried nem. con. 

" A committee was chosen to draught such resolutions as 
might be proper for the assembly to adopt, General Knox, 



XT. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 439 

Colonel Brooks, and a Captain Howard were the members 
of it, to report in half an hour. They reported three 
resolutions, which, as well as I can recollect, were to this 
effect : - 

" The 1st. Expressive of the patriotic motives which first 
induced them to take up arms ; and a determination not to 
sully, by any unworthy conduct, the honor they had gained 
with the price of their blood. 

"2. To desire Congress not to disband or disperse the 
army until their accounts were liquidated, the balances due 
ascertained, and funds for payment established, half pay 
or a commutation efficaciously included. 

"3. To request the Commander-in-Chief to present a copy 
of these resolutions to Congress, enforced by his own rep 
resentations. 

"After these three resolutions had been debated (if a 
conversation between three persons, in so numerous an 
assembly, deserves the name of a debate ; for there were no 
more speakers, unless of a word or two, or short motion), 
altered, amended, and agreed to, a fourth was added, of 
thanks to their committee at Philadelphia for the wisdom 
and prudence with which they had conducted their business, 
and a desire that General McDougall would continue at Phil 
adelphia until the objects of his mission were accomplished. 
Then a fifth resolution was moved, which, though it cor 
responded with the ideas of the ,* and 

doubtless was therefore produced, yet it is my private opin 
ion that the army will be ashamed of it. They had suffi 
ciently expressed, in the close of the third resolve, their 
disapprobation of insidious attempts and evil machinations 
of designing men.| I would have opposed it; but, having 

* Commander-in-Chief must be intended. See Sparks s "Writings of 
Washington," Vol. VIII. p. 397. 

f In the third resolve it is declared that a speedy decision of Congress on 
the memorial presented by the army " would produce immediate tranquillity 
in the minds of the army, and prevent any further machinations of designing 
men to sow discord between the civil and military powers of the United States." 
The resolution above called the "fifth" (in the "Writings of Washington"

been obliged, on the former resolutions, to speak so often 
(amidst the general speechlessness of the assembly) , I did 
not choose to rise again. Besides, from the evident current 
of the meeting, I found that nobody would venture to second 
me. But I could not belie my own feelings, and therefore 
would not sanctify the vote in question by holding up my 
hand. I do not know whether there was another exception. 
This fifth resolution was to this effect, That the army 
viewed with abhorrence and indignation the insidious at 
tempts of the writer of the two anonymous and infamous 
Addresses to the army, which were subversive of all order 
and discipline. And thus, my friend, that body of officers, 
in a moment, damned with infamy two publications, which, 
during the four preceding days, most of them had read 
with admiration, and talkf.d of with rapture ! Mobile vul- 
gus! Some confidential friend will explain the two last 
words. 

" Who was the author of the pieces I know not. Being 
unable to hit on any man in the army as equal to so truly 
Junian a composition, I supposed the first piece had been 
brought from Philadelphia ; but, the second making its 
appearance the very evening after the publication of the 
general order of the llth, it was clear the writer was at 
hand. If his design was insidious ; if he meant to draw 
the army to revolt and sedition ; if selfish or ambitious mo 
tives pointed his pen, let him be damned ! But examine 
calmly. Will not his pieces admit of a more favorable con 
struction? What should we expect from an enlightened 
spirit, from an officer of keen sensibility, who had sus 
tained the toils and dangers of seven campaigns? who 
(to use his own words), during that long period, * had felt 

the fourth in order), was, " That the officers of the American army view with 
abhorrence, and reject with disdain, the infamous propositions contained in a 
late anonymous Address to the officers of the army, and resent with indignation 
the secret attempts of some unknown persons to collect the officers together in 
a manner totally subversive of all discipline and good order." 

The Newburgh Addresses and the proceedings upon them are printed in 
full in " Sparks s Writings of Washington," Vol. VIII. pp. 551-566.

the cold hand of poverty without a murmur, and seen the 
insolence of wealth without a sigh, wealth growing from 
the soil which he and his fellow-soldiers had enriched with 
their blood? who, when he saw sweet Peace, with her 
attendant blessings, dawning on the land which his sword 
had contributed to save, could for himself look forward 
but to indigence and wretchedness? who, when Gratitude 
should have spread her joyful arms to embrace him, saw 
even Justice barring the door against him? What, I repeat, 
from such a character might be expected? Still longer 
patience and tame submission? or those warm effusions 
of the heart, which, with great and animating truths, mingle 
some drops of extravagance and error? Had the army 
(the most deserving of all public creditors) no cause to be 
alarmed, when they had seen the obstinacy of a single petty 
State * defeat the wise and salutary measure of the impost? 
Had they no cause to be alarmed, when that great and 
upright man, the superintendent of the finances of their 
country, had declared that circumstances had postponed 
the establishment of public credit in such manner that he 
feared it would never be accomplished ; that he must quit 
his office, because his continuance would compel him to be 
the minister of injustice? Was it manly, then, implicitly 
to believe the suspicions against that writer? Was it wise 
to adopt a resolution that would brand with infamy the man, 
the brother officer, whose watchful eye and able pen might 
discover and save them from the evils which ingratitude and 
injustice might bring, or suffer to fall, upon them?

make your own comments, and I shall be glad to see them.

what money and notes you can procure, as mentioned in 
my public letter of this date. 

I am, my dear friend, very sincerely yours, 

" TIMOTHY PICKERING." 

To Mrs. Pickering he wrote on the same day (the 
16th of March) :- 

"The meeting of the officers mentioned in my last (which 
I sent open to Mr. Hodgdon) was held yesterday : an 
account of the result I now send to Mr. Hodgdon. Tis too 
long to repeat, and I have told him to show it to you. If 
he forgets, ask him for the papers. The result of this meet 
ing has given me another instance of the fickleness of popular 
assemblies, and shown how easily a fluent orator, with plau 
sibility only to support him, may govern them as he will. 
The great object I had in view at the meeting is eifected, 
I mean, the informing of Congress, that it was the wish of 
the army not to be disbanded until their accounts were 
settled, and funds established to pay them. In this measure 
I extended my views beyond the army. I cast my eye on 
the numerous public creditors, who at present have but a 
hope that they will ever be paid. I considered the reputa 
tion of my country as at stake in this great question of 
establishing funds to pay the public debts. I did not desire 
the army to disband until this essential, all-important point 
were gained. The wish of the army to this effect being 
communicated, I knew that Congress and the governments 
of the States would make some useful and necessary reflec 
tions on it.* But by the last resolution of the meeting, / 
think the army will suffer in its reputation, and consequently 
in its present views. Some others think differently. The 
reason of my opinion you will see in the letter to the Major 
[Hodgdon]. Let him see this, as it contains some senti 
ments which I forgot to express to him." 

* See the letters of Hamilton to Washington of February 7th, 1783, in 
Sparks s " Correspondence of the American Revolution," Vol. III. p. 550, 
and March 17th, 1783, in Vol. IV. p. 6. 



Mi. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 443 

He wrote again to Mrs. Pickering on the 18th of 
March, as follows: 

In my letter of last Sunday I mentioned the meeting we 
had last Saturday. ... As I foresaw, so I find, that the 
officers generally disapprove the resolution in which the 
anonymous publications are called infamous, although none 
of them would venture to object at the meeting. They 
have conducted like the greater part of mankind, who suffer 
themselves to be overawed by those who, for their wealth 
or offices, are called great men. I should not have contented 
myself with giving that vote my silent negative, if the former 
part of the proceedings had not shown me that I should 
stand alone the butt of resentment to the C. in C. [Com- 
mander-in-Chief] and some officers who implicitly adopted 
his opinion. 

"I am in some doubt about a general peace, but I have 
very little that the British will leave New York before the 
first of June. This will relieve the United States in some 
degree, and I am not certain that it will not be more useful 
than universal peace. The union of the States is shaken by 
our own divisions ; and no funds are established to pay the 
public debts. For these reasons absolute peace might at 
this time be detrimental. 

"I feel some solicitude for our future support ; yet, as 
neither of us have so much pride as to put us above any 
honest calling, I trust in Providence that we shall not want. 
Farewell, my love ! In every possible situation I shall 
strive to make you happy." 

From these letters it appears that, when Washington 
read his address to the officers, Armstrong was most 
probably not regarded by him, and certainly not by 
Colonel Pickering, as the author of the anonymous 
letters; and that on this point Armstrong was more 
accurate in his recollection than Colonel Pickering or 
Governor Brooks. He was also right in asserting that 



444 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

a letter from a Virginia member of Congress, or an 
extract from it, was read by Washington ; but he erred 
in assigning it to Hardy or Harvie, and in alleging that 
it implicated Robert Morris, Gouverneur Morris, and 
Alexander Hamilton in the supposed conspiracy against 
Washington. General Hand, to whom Armstrong refers 
as an authority, was at the meeting of the officers, and 
may have written that a letter was read to them by 
the Commander-in-Chief ; but it is impossible that he 
should within a month have described it as implicating 
those gentlemen. Brooks and Cobb were mistaken in 
saying that no letter whatever was communicated to 
the officers by Washington, and that his address was 
acted upon by itself; while, in denying that such a letter 
was produced as Armstrong describes, implicating the 
Morrises and Hamilton, Colonel Pickering and the gen 
tlemen whom he consulted are sustained by unques 
tionable evidence. In a manuscript pamphlet, noted 
on the cover, by Colonel Pickering, "Anonymous Ad 
dresses ... by J. A., Jr.," are copies, made at the time 
by one of his clerks, of the anonymous letters, of Wash 
ington s address, of the resolutions of the officers, and 
of a "letter from a member of Congress to General 
Washington;" which last, there is no reason to doubt, 
is a copy of the paper communicated to the officers at 
the meeting. A recurrence to Sparks s " Correspond 
ence of the American Revolution" (Vol. III. p. 554), 
where the whole letter is published, shows that this 
manuscript presents only portions of it.* It agrees with 

* These portions leave out, as irrelevant, remarks on Vermont, but con 
tain the rest of the letter with the significant omission of these sentences : 
" Whether to temporize, or oppose with steady, unremitting firmness what is 
supposed to be in agitation, of dangerous tendency, or that may be agitated, 
must be left to your own sense of propriety and better judgment;" "That 
we shall have peace soon is almost reduced to a certainty ; but my fears are,

the abstract in Colonel Pickering s letter to Hodgdon, 
where it is correctly attributed to Joseph Jones. On 
a perusal of the letter as published by Sparks, the 
reader will perceive that it makes no allusion to either 
of the Morrises or to Hamilton. 

Armstrong s allegation, that Colonel Pickering 
opposed the course desired by Washington, though 
questioned by Colonel Pickering and positively denied 
by Governor Brooks, is perhaps not void of foundation. 
Brooks says, "The committee reported a number of 
resolves, which, without opposition or discussion, were 
accepted." Here his recollection is clearly inaccurate ; 
for Colonel Pickering, in his letter written to Hodgdon 
the next day, says they were " debated (if a conversation 
between three persons, in so numerous an assembly, 
deserves the name of a debate ... ), altered, and 
amended! The resolves, as reported by Knox, proba 
bly had the previous approbation of Washington ; * and, 
from the tone of the letter to Hodgdon it may be 
inferred that in their original form they were not sat 
isfactory to Colonel Pickering, and that he had spoken 
on them " so often," and in opposition to parts of them, 
in order to obtain the amendments which were adopted. 
As he says, in his letter of March 16th to Mrs. Picker 
ing, that the great object he had in view at the meeting 

it will not be attended with those blessings generally expected. There are so 
many great questions, very interesting to particular States, unsettled, that it 
is difficult to avoid uneasy impressions for the consequences." The first pas 
sage might have affected unpleasantly the minds of the officers ; the last was 
discouraging, and would have fostered their discontent. It would also seem 
to have been thought politic to keep out of sight the expectation of a speedy 
peace. Hamilton wrote to Washington on the 7th of February, "It appears 
to be a prevailing opinion in the army, that the disposition to recompense their 
services will cease with the necessity for them." Sparks s Correspondence 
of the American Revolution, Vol. III. p. 550; Sparks s Writings of Wash 
ington, Vol. VIII. p. 395.

was effected, the informing of Congress that it was 
the wish of the army not to be disbanded until their 
accounts were settled, and funds established to pay them, 
I infer that the resolutions, as amended, received his 
vote in their favor. As to the additional resolution, 
calling the anonymous Addresses infamous, he says ex 
pressly that it was displeasing to him, and that he would 
not vote for it, but that he did not express his objec 
tions at the meeting. 

The letter to Hodgdon affords an answer to Arm 
strong s earnest question, how it has happened that a 
document so important as the " extraordinary letter " 
from Harvie " should not have been mentioned by any 
chronicler of the times or biographer of Washington," 
and puts an end to his benevolent theory, that Wash 
ington must have destroyed it in order to prevent its 
being made the instrument of any new or additional 
injury. It is plain that it never had any existence, 
except in the very erroneous representation by Arm 
strong of the letter from Joseph Jones. 

In answer to Colonel Pickering s letter, Mr. Hodgdon 
wrote from Philadelphia the 26th of March: 

"I am exceedingly indebted to you for your very kind 
communications. They afforded myself and confidential 
friends a rich repast. At some leisure hour I will give you 
my sentiments on the proceedings, a part of which I think 
very extraordinary. The Addresses are read here with 
admiration, and the author universally celebrated. The 

s * letter to Congress on the occasion is said to be 

a great performance, superior to anything of the kind that 
has yet made its appearance."

CHAPTEE XXXII. 

Colonel Pickering s Attention to Public Economy. His Purpose 
to enter into Mercantile Business. His Repugnance to dwelling 
in a Slave-holding State. The Announcement of Peace. His 
Correspondence with Robert Morris on the Accounts of the Quar 
termaster s Department. His Public Spirit. His Plan for the 
Settlement of a new State in the Western Territory by Officers 
and Soldiers of the American Army. His Report on a Military 
Peace Establishment. His Plan for a Military Academy at West 
Point. 

IN anticipation of peace, Colonel Pickering manifested 
his disposition to promote public economy, by reducing 
the staff, and consequently the expenses of his depart 
ment. In a letter, dated at Newburgh, the 25th of 
March, 1783, to his wife, he expressed regret that it was 
not in his power to relieve her from the troublesome 
business of a removal from the Falls of Schuylkill to 
Philadelphia, and that he could not make her a visit on 
" the auspicious eighth of April " (their wedding-day), 
his duties requiring his presence in the State of New 
York. He said further : 

" I have no deputy. Major Cogswell * is yet absent, and 
I shall not call on Colonel Lutterloh for assistance, as I mean 
now to desire him to close immediately all the business 
of his department, and to put the purchases of forage on 
another footing, without employing a commissary of forage. 
So the whole weight of the department will lie immediately 
upon me, and undoubtedly require my continuance in this 
State until May, and perhaps longer ; but, by the first of 
June, I have strong expectations that 1 shall write you from 

* Wagon-master-General. 



448 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

the city of New York. That event will enable me to snatch 
a few days to be devoted to you. . . . 

" I have received from brother Williams a letter, ac 
knowledging the receipt of mine on the subject of my 
settling at Philadelphia. I see that he approves the plan. 
... I observe he takes hold on the idea I started, . . . 
that the trade which would now be most profitable to Mas 
sachusetts would lie with Maryland and Virginia, where 
tobacco, as well as flour, may be obtained. And what should 
you think of going farther southward? To Baltimore, for 
instance? To Alexandria, or Norfolk, in Virginia? I con 
fess my own repugnance to dwelling in a country where 
such multitudes of the human species are degraded to the 
condition of the brute creation. They begin, however, to 
emerge from this barbarous custom. . . . 

"This moment I am interrupted by a rap at the door. 
All in bed but myself, who wake for you. I let the mes 
senger in ; he presents me a paper with these words : * A 
general peace is concluded ! My heart s darling joy, you 
have already exulted in this happy news ; and soon, by 
God s will, shall I be restored to your tender embraces. 
Then we will again rejoice ; then will we pour out the grate 
ful effusions of our souls to that great and merciful Being 
who has carried us in safety through a calamitous war, and 
given us the object of our wishes. O for a country deserv 
ing of such blessings ! But God is gracious even to the 
unthankful and unjust. His mercy endureth for ever. Ex 
alted be his name. In him we will repose our confidence, 
and in his loving-kindness, to preserve our lives and the lives 
of our sweet babes, and to give us a competency with con 
tentment. Contentment will make a poor man rich." * 

* The letter was to have been handed to Mrs. Pickering by Colonel Gou- 
vion, of the French army, and she was requested to " show him every civility, 
as a most worthy man, justly beloved by all who know and will acknowledge 
his merits." But, on account of the news of peace, he postponed his journey 
to Philadelphia, writing to Colonel Pickering, " I must stay in camp to take 
my share of the joy which will be felt by all my fellow-officers, in a moment 
when they see their hardships, labors, and perseverance crowned with the 
glorious success which was the only object we aimed at." 



MT. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 449 

He wrote the next day, the 26th of March, to his 
brother : 

" The joyful news of peace will reach you ere this arrives. 
Nevertheless I will mention the substance of the intelli 
gence which arrived last night at head-quarters. 

"The Marquis de Lafayette had arrived at Cadiz, to pro 
ceed with the Comte D Estaing on the grand expedition 
against Jamaica ; but, the treaty of peace having been signed, 
the Comte and the Marquis despatched a sloop of war with 
the intelligence, which was fortunate enough to be the first. 
The despatches were delivered to the General by a youth 
whom the Marquis took with him from America, and sent 
hither for the purpose. One paper calls the treaty, which 
was signed the 21st of January by the belligerent powers, 

* the preliminaries to a general peace* But a letter from 
the President of Congress to Governor Livingston calls it a 

* definitive treaty. . . . 

" The General s letters were from the Minister of France 
and the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, in which they con 
gratulate him on the close of the war. A messenger yesterday 
arrived here from New York with information that the Brit 
ish were calling in all their cruisers. The Secretary for 
Foreign Affairs, by permission of Congress, sent his under 
secretary to Sir Guy Carleton with the intelligence received 
from Cadiz : so all doubt of the great event is precluded." 

A passage in a letter from Mr. Hodgdon, of the 26th 
of March, was the occasion of a remarkable correspond 
ence between Colonel Pickering and Robert Morris. 
Mr. Hodgdon wrote : 

" I cannot at present obtain further supplies for paying 
off Colonel Neilson s department. Mr. Morris insists upon 
a settlement of your accounts previous to any more advances. 
I have told him you were doing all in your power to compass 
this very desirable business, and that an advance of money 

VOL. I. 57 



450 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

for the purpose requested would facilitate it. I hope yet to 
prevail, but wish you would write him on the subject, as I 
think it would further my endeavors." 

Colonel Pickering, in consequence, wrote to Mr. 
Morris : 

"NEWBURGH, April 1st, 1783. 
" SIR, 

" In a letter of the 26th ultimo, addressed to me by Mr. 
Hodgdon, are these words : Mr. Morris insists upon a 
settlement of your accounts previous to any more advances. 

" I have not forgotten, Sir, your earnest desire to have 
my accounts settled ; it is impossible I should forget it ; for 
nothing hangs upon me with so great a weight. Peace is 
arrived, when I hoped to have engaged in some private call 
ing that would do more than keep my family from starving. 
But I see that the final settlement of the numerous and 
extensive accounts of my department, scattered from one 
end of the Continent to the other, will not be accomplished 
in six, perhaps not in twelve months. This, you will readily 
conceive, must render me extremely unhappy. After spend 
ing seventeen years in various public services for a bare 
subsistence, I am now arrived at a period in life which 
demands that I fix on some employment which shall be 
advantageous and permanent. Pressed by the tenderest 
concerns to make such an arrangement, every intervening 
day that postpones it gives me pain. On this account, 
therefore, the information repeated in the first paragraph of 
this letter could not but occasion me much uneasiness ; but, 
as it seemed to imply a want of confidence in me, it was 
peculiarly distressing. I have formerly felt myself happy 
in your good opinion, though I confess to you I took no pains 
to acquire it ; for I never anticipate the consequences of my 
actions, whether they will procure me censure or applause. 
When general approbation has followed my endeavors to 
promote the public good, it has given me pleasure ; but 
when disapprobation, or reproach (as it has sometimes 



^T. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 451 

happened), has ensued, still I have not been without a con 
solation, the best, indeed, an honest man can wish for, 
a consciousness of upright intentions, and the countenance 
and encouragement of a few, the wise and good. 

" Suffer me to hint at the circumstances under which I 
was induced to take the direction of the Quartermaster s 
department. 

"General Greene had abruptly resigned. Congress were 
exceedingly embarrassed. Some member (who, I know not) 
named me to succeed him. My consent was asked, and 
reluctantly given. I was not ignorant of the deranged state 
of our public affairs, and the total want of a valuable medi 
um. I foresaw the great difficulties that would attend the 
execution of the office, and therefore, in my first letters on 
the subject, declared that * I expected neither pleasure, nor 
honor, nor profit. Frgm that hour my life has been a series 
of toil and vexation. Unfortunately, too, no business in 
which I had formerly been engaged had introduced me to a 
knowledge of accounts ; and hence I was not sufficiently 
aware of the importance of the subject and of the necessity 
of making those arrangements which alone could effect reg 
ular and speedy settlements. The trifling sums received 
for transacting business of such extent added not a little to 
my difficulties on this score. Small payments were made 
on the spur of pressing emergencies, and matters left un 
finished. Early in 1781 I endeavored to procure the assist 
ance of a very accomplished accountant ; but, after keeping 
me many months in suspense, he declined serving, because 
I could not promise him a regular payment of his salary. 
After my return from Virginia, at the close of that year, I 
engaged another ; but public business, that unexpectedly 
intervened, detained him some months, which, together 
with my long stay last year in Philadelphia, prevented his 
joining me until October, 1782. 

" All these causes have conspired to put my accounts in 
arrear, and to occasion some irregularities, by which /, 
though not the public, may suffer. The agency of the 



452 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

department being soon to end, I shall, from every motive, 
public and private, close all my accounts with as much 
expedition as the nature of the business will admit. Those 
of my deputies who have not yet finished their accounts, 
promise a speedy completion of them. 

"Until I accepted this cursed office, though necessity 
compelled me to live frugally, yet I had the satisfaction of 
keeping nearly clear of private debts ; for I had resolved 
not to encumber the only hope of my family, in case an 
unlucky accident befell me, my little patrimony. But 
I have not kept my resolution. I am now indebted, for 
moneys borrowed of my friends since the 22d of February, 
1781, for the support of myself and family, upwards of 
nineteen hundred hard dollars. When I received these 
loans, I reckoned on my funded certificate of near four 
thousand dollars, given for my arrearages as a member of 
the Board of War ; but you have lately declared that you 
fear the public credit will never be established. Some of 
my friends had expressed the same apprehension, and I have 
since ordered my patrimony to be sold to pay my debts. I 
had, indeed, an additional motive, just then, to order the 
sale of my estate. The legislature of New York paying 
no attention to the recommendation of Congress, nor to my 
earnest petition, for exemption from suits for public debts, 
I expected to be left a prey to the avaricious and merciless 
speculators in public securities. But justice and gratitude 
to my friends required that their dues should not be left to 
the discretion of my public creditors. This legislature have, 
at last, enacted that execution shall be stayed until the first 
day of March next. 

"This, Sir, is my present situation. If, instead of bor 
rowing, I had appropriated public money for my entire 
support to the amount of my pay, I should have been justi 
fied ; for, when I accepted the office, I announced to Con 
gress my poverty, and that I Avas unable, without a grant of 
money for the purpose, even to equip myself for the field. 
But the public wants have not left me at liberty to do what 
more prudent people would not have omitted. 



Mi. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 453 

"You can now judge, Sir, what must have been my feel 
ings on reading the paragraph above quoted from Mr. 
Hodgdon s letter. The declaration imports either that your 
confidence in my integrity has ceased, or that, by witholding 
money, I may be induced to hasten the settlement of my 
accounts. But the latter will thereby be inevitably retarded. 
If the former has taken place, I shall have nothing more to 
say on the subject. If Mr. Hodgdon has misapprehended 
your expression, I shall be sorry to have troubled you with 
this long letter. As things are now circumstanced, it is of 
serious consequence to me to be early informed of the ground 
on which I may expect to stand. I am unhappy enough to 
read your resignation ; but to be consigned over with sus 
picions to the unequal resources of your successor will be 
worse. I remain, Sir, with great respect, your most obedi 
ent servant. 

" TIMOTHY PICKERING, Q. M. G. 

" P. S. I intended this as a private letter ; but if, for any 
cause, you choose to consider it as a public one, I shall 
acquiesce." 

The next day he wrote to Mr. Hodgdon a letter, in 
which he alludes to the preceding one to Mr. Morris, 
and says : 

"I know not how it will affect him ; I hope, agreeably to 
my wishes ; if not, I quit the army directly. But I think 
it will operate as it should do." 

The following is Mr. Morris s answer to the letter 
addressed to him. 

"OFFICE OF FINANCE, April 7th, 1783. 

DEAR SIR, 

"I have this moment received your letter of the first 
instant, and read it with as much pain as I believe you to 
have felt in writing it. I neither give nor withdraw my 



-(*" 



454 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

confidence on trivial ground. You had it fully, and you 
have it still, in the same extensive degree as ever. 

" I knew some of the circumstances which prevented the 
settlement of your accounts, and I believed there were others, 
as from your letter I am now convinced that there were. I 
did not, therefore, press you so hard on that subject as 
otherwise I should have done. I have been myself accused 
and abused in Congress for the forbearance. I shall state 
to the committee appointed to inspect my office the reasons 
you assign, and so far consider your letter a public one as 
to lay it before them. In the mean time, I pray you to urge 
on the settlement as fast as possible, I mean the settle 
ment of accounts under my administration. 

" On the subject of your own particular affairs I have but 
little to say ; but that little will, I think, be satisfactory. I 
conceive myself authorized to discharge your arrearages of 
pay as Commissioner of the Board of War, and will do so 
whenever you shall think proper. 

"I am, with very sincere esteem, Sir, your most obedient 
and humble servant, 

"ROBERT MORRIS." 

To this letter Colonel Pickering replied : 

" NEWBURGH, April 14th, 1783. 
" SIR, 

" I have been honored with your letter of the 7th, and feel 
as I ought the force of the obligations so much candor and 

_! 

friendship impose on me. I have nothing so much at heart 
as to comply with your wishes in the speedy settlement of 
my public accounts, which is at the same time so essential 
to my ease and interest. 

"In regard to my own particular affairs/ which you so 
kindly notice, while I receive the benefits to be derived 
from your indulgence, I wish it to be with the least possible 
inconvenience to you. With this view I beg leave to inform 
you, that a draft on Mr. Lovell for two thousand dollars 
will enable me to reimburse the sums borrowed of my 



JET. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 455 

friends, and conveniently, as they live at Salem. The resi 
due of my arrears as a member of the Board of War may 
be placed in any situation you think proper, in which 
I may command it. I recollect that the public were some 
time ago possessed of bank stock which it was wished to 
have disposed of: if any remains in that predicament, it 
would be agreeable to me to have three or four shares, which 
I might sell again when my business or necessities should 
require it. The balance Mr. Hodgclon will receive, and in 
my behalf attend to the whole negotiation whenever you 
shall please to call for him. With the most respectful 
attachment and esteem, I remain," &c. 

In a letter to Mrs. Pickering, dated at Newburgh, the 
6th of April, he recurs to his future course of life. 

" Peace does not yet arrive to my relief. I am impatient 
for the official accounts, that I may be released from public 
engagements and enter the paths of private life, that I 
may engage in pursuits that will insure a support for you 
and our boys, and that will enable me to live always with 
you. I am unhappy at every day s absence. I wish to con 
tribute to your pleasure, and to ease you in every burden.. 
I would smooth for you the path of life. I would wish to 
make it elegantly smooth ; that it were decked on every 
side and carpeted with joys. All things promise fairly. I 
am encouraged to expect the correspondence of merchants 
in different quarters. This morning Mr. Oilman,* of Ex 
eter, called upon me. . . . He said my character was well 
known in New Hampshire, and he doubted not that I should 
get all the business from thence. ... If in this way I 
am enabled to support you and my children agreeably, if I 
can lay up such a competent fortune as will secure us from 
want, I shall be satisfied. If I could do this without many 
years labor, I should be more pleased ; because there are 

* John Taylor Oilman, a member of Congress from New Hampshire, and 
afterwards the Governor of that State. 



456 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

some studies and pursuits which I should gladly engage in 
for the benefit of society. I have only to regret that my 
want of abilities, of learning, and of fortune forbids my car 
rying those pursuits to such lengths and to such early con 
clusions as the mischiefs I wish to check and prevent 
pressins;ly require. But I will reserve the pleasure of a 
particular explanation of my views until I can speak to you 
face to face." 

To what objects his philanthropic views had relation, 
does not appear ; perhaps agriculture and education. 

A letter of the 6th of April from Sir Guy Carleton 
informed General Washington, that he had received 
official intelligence that preliminary articles of peace 
with France and Spain were signed on the 20th of 
January, and that, in pursuance of orders from the 
King of Great Britain, he should publish, on the 8th of 
April, proclamations declaring a cessation of arms, as 
well by sea as by land. 

In a letter dated Newburgh, April 6th, addressed to 
Mr. Hodgdon, Colonel Pickering says: 

" Mr. Williams wrote to me that some of my friends were 
extremely desirous of my returning to Salem, and some 
merchants were of opinion it would be most for my interest. 
I cannot conceive on what grounds the latter form their 
opinion. However, I have sent rny final determination not 
to return to Massachusetts to peddle in trade or starve in a 
public office. I have told Mr. Williams that, if this com 
mission plan does not succeed, I will settle in a new coun 
try, where, if my life is spared for a few years, I can at 
least leave a plantation to each of my children." 

A letter of the 7th of April to Mr. Hodgdon has 
already been quoted, in which Colonel Pickering said 
he had renounced his purpose of buying wild land in 



^T. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 457 

Vermont. In the same letter he went on to speak 
of a subject of more importance than his private con 
cerns. 

" But a new plan is in contemplation, no less than form 
ing a new State westward of the Ohio. Some of the prin 
cipal officers of the army are heartily engaged in it. About 
a week since, the matter was set on foot, and a plan is 
digesting for the purpose. Enclosed is a rough draught 
of some propositions respecting it, which are generally 
approved of. They are in the hands of General Hunting- 
ton and General [Rufus] Putnam for consideration, amend 
ment, and addition. It Would be too tedious to explain to 
you in writing all the motives to attempt this measure, and 
all the advantages which will probably result from it. As 
soon as the plan is well digested, it is intended to lay it 
before an assembly of the officers, and to learn the inclina 
tions of the soldiers. If it takes, an application will then 
be made to Congress for the grant and all things depend 
ing on them. I shall have much to say to you on this 
subject." 

The propositions were, in substance, That the 
United States should purchase of the natives a tract 
of land described in the plan, being a large portion of 
what is now the State of Ohio ; that, in the first instance, 
lands should be assigned to the officers and soldiers of 
the army, to fulfil the engagements of the United States 
made by certain resolutions of Congress, and that all 
associators who should actually settle in the new State 
within one year after it was ready for settlement should 
receive certain additional quantities of land; that this 
increased provision should extend to all officers and sol 
diers who had performed, in the whole, three years ser 
vice, whether in service or not at the end of the war ; that 
the surplus lands should be the property of the State ; 

VOL. i. 58 



458 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

that every grantee should make certain improvements 
on his land within a certain time, otherwise it should 
be forfeited to the State ; that, to enable the associa- 
tors to undertake the settlement of the new State, the 
United States should defray the expenses of their march 
thither, furnish utensils of husbandry and live stock 
necessary for beginning the settlement, one ration of 
bread and meat for three years to every man, woman, 
and child, to every soldier a suit of clothes annually, 
and to every officer and soldier arms and ammunition 
for the security of the State against the Indians, the 
cost of all these articles to be charged to the accounts 
of arrearages due to the members of the association 
respectively ; that a constitution for the new State 
should be formed by the members of the association, 
at a meeting to be called for that purpose, previous to 
their beginning the settlement, "the total exclusion 
of slavery from the State to form an essential and 
irrevocable part of the constitution"; that the State so 
constituted should be admitted into the confederacy 
of the United States ; that delegates should be chosen 
by the associators, at the meeting above mentioned, to 
represent them in Congress so soon as the new State 
should be erected and that the associators should 
agree on some general temporary rules for the pre 
vention and punishment of crimes and for the preserva 
tion of peace and good order. 

The concluding proposition was as follows : 

" That, the associators having borne together as brethren 
the dangers and calamities of war, and feeling that mutual 
friendship which long acquaintance and common sufferings 
give rise to, it being also the obvious dictate of humanity 
to supply the wants of the needy, and alleviate the distresses 
of the afflicted, it shall be an inviolable rule to take 



JET. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 459 

under the immediate patronage of the State the wives and 
children of such associators, who, having settled there, 
shall die, or by cause of wounds or sickness be unable to 
improve their plantations or follow their occupations, dur 
ing the first twenty-one years ; so that such destitute and 
distressed families shall receive such public aids as, joined 
with their own reasonable exertions, will maintain them in a 
manner suitable to the condition of the heads of them ; 
especially that the children, when grown up, may be on a 
footing with other children, whose parents, at the original 
formation of the State, were in similar circumstances with 
those of the former." 

Mr. Hodgdon read the " propositions " to Colonel 
Pickering s school-fellow and friend Mr. Stephen Hig- 
ginson, then a member of Congress, who exclaimed, 
" This is Pickering, I swear." The rough draught was 
in his handwriting, and was, no doubt, his composi 
tion, but probably with the introduction of suggestions 
made by other officers with whom he had conversed. 
Mr. Hodgdon expressed the opinion, that, even if Con 
gress should grant all that was asked of them, the plan 
would never be carried into effect. This might have 
been the case. But the mode here proposed of making 
a settlement and forming a State in new territory does 
not seem to be visionary or impracticable. Even if it 
was so, an enthusiastic scheme of our forefathers, in 
which so much generosity of sentiment is shown, 
brought forward at a period in the history of the 
country presenting a condition of affairs so novel, and 
to them, after their toils, and dangers, and sufferings, 
so exciting, is entitled to a kindly regard. As the dawn 
of the State of Ohio, and, indeed, of the five great States 
formed out of the territory north-west of the Ohio River, 
particularly with respect to the perpetual exclusion of 



460 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

slavery from them, these "propositions" are interesting, 
and are worthy of preservation.* 

In a letter of the 8th of April, Colonel Pickering 
wrote to his wife : 

" This moment an officer has arrived at head-quarters 
with despatches from Sir Guy Carleton announcing the 
arrival of a packet at New York with a confirmation of 
peace. O, Heaven be praised ! Through many a doubtful 
day we have been preserved ; and now our wishes are 
crowned with peace, liberty, and independence ! How 
cheaply purchased with eight years war ! How much 
reason have they to rejoice who are alive to see this 
day ! " 

In a letter to Mr. Hodgdon, dated at Newburgh, the 

14th of April, Colonel Pickering wrote : 

t 

" There is a report that official accounts of peace are 
arrived from France at Philadelphia. I am anxious for it, 
that we may have our festival ; till then I cannot leave the 
army : not because the pleasure to be derived from it will 
detain me ; one hour s domestic bliss is of much more value. 
Yet I should be unwilling to be absent at the celebration 
of the day which crowns our toils with glory. Such cele 
brations would give more pleasure if they took place 
promptly ; but, in general, so much time is spent in prep 
aration, that expectation grows weary and indifferent. 
Those, indeed, who on these occasions anticipate nothing 
with so much delight as bacchanalian revels, have other 
feelings. But I could never derive any pleasure from 
scenes of intoxication. 

"Just now I was casting my eye over a newspaper, and 
met with Dr. Smith s advertisement of his Falls plantation 
to be leased, having been occupied last year by Colonel 
Pickering, Q. M. G., and the year before by his Excellency

the Minister of France. I was sorry to see it. My coun 
trymen eastward will, if they meet with it, think me an 
extravagant fellow. . . . 

" P. S. General [Rufus] Putnam is warmly engaged in 
the new-planned settlement over the Ohio. He is very 
desirous of getting Hutchius s map. Mr. Aitken had them 
to sell. If possible, pray forward me one." 

On the 18th of April he wrote to Mrs. Pickering 
from Newburgh : 

" No day is yet fixed here for rejoicing ; and, upon con 
sidering the treaty and proclamation,* &c., I am afraid the 
day is not so near as I had imagined. The proclamation is 
not of peace, but to cease hostilities. The final treaty of 
peace is not yet arrived." 

General Washington, having received from a com 
mittee of Congress a letter, in which they ask his opin 
ion on military establishments proper to be adopted 
by the United States on the conclusion of the war, 
requested some of the principal officers in the army, 
and among them Colonel Pickering, to communicate 
to him their opinions on the subject. Mr. Sparks 
says : *j* 

" The report handed in by Colonel Pickering, then Quar 
termaster-General to the army, is interesting from the man 
ner in which many topics are discussed, and particularly 
from the suggestions it contains respecting the establish 
ment of a military seminary at West Point." 

In this report, dated at Newburgh, April 22d, 1783, 
are the following observations : 

* Agreed upon by Congress on the llth of April, and published in the Amer 
ican camp on the 19th. See Sparks s "Writings of Washington," Vol. VIII. 
pp. 425, 567.

" I will take the liberty to add a page or two on the sub 
ject of military academies, which have been mentioned as 
proper to be erected where the Continental arsenals shall be 
established. At the same places, also, it has been supposed 
that fouuderies and manufactories for all kinds of military 
stores may be established to advantage. But, if these plans 
are not impracticable, I am clear that at present they are 
inexpedient. 

"Whence are to come the students at these academies? 
We have not (and God forbid we ever should have) either 
a nobility or noblesse; and our laws of inheritance will save 
us from elder brothers to whom business will be unneces 
sary, as well as from younger sons bred in too much indo 
lence or delicacy to acquire a living by their own industry. 
And without a standing army none will find an interest in 
studying the military art, as a profession. The few (and in 
a country of husbandmen, merchants, and mechanics, they 
will be very few) whose genius shall prompt and whose 
fortunes shall enable them to pursue extensively the study 
of the military art, can travel, and find in Europe schools 
already established on the most perfect plans, where they 
may acquire, with the greatest facility, all that knowledge 
of the military art of which they are capable. All the arts 
and sciences which form the basis of, or are connected with, 
the military art, are already, or will be, taught in the Ameri 
can universities, as soon as the respective States shall be 
able properly to endow them. 

" If anything like a military academy in America be prac 
ticable at this time, it must be grounded on the permanent 
military establishment for our frontier posts and arsenals, 
and the wants of the States, separately, of officers to com 
mand the defences on their sea-coasts. 

" On this principle it might be expedient to establish a 
military school, or academy, at West Point; and, that a 
competent number of young gentlemen might be induced 
to become students, it might be made a rule, that vacancies 



MT. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 463 

in the standing regiment* should be supplied from thence, 
those few instances excepted where it would be just to pro 
mote a very meritorious sergeant. For this end, the num 
ber which shall be judged requisite to supply vacancies in 
the standing regiment might be fixed, and the students who 
are admitted with an expectation of filling them limited 
accordingly. They might be allowed subsistence at the 
public expense. If any other youth desired to pursue the 
same studies at the military academy, they might be admit 
ted, only subsisting themselves. 

" These students should be instructed in what is usually 
called military discipline, tactics, and the theory and prac 
tice of fortification and gunnery. The commandant, and 
one or two other officers of the standing regiment, and 

O O 

the engineers, making West Point their general residence, 
would be the masters of the academy, and the inspector- 
general superintend the whole." 

* In the preceding part of his report he estimated that one standing regi 
ment, in addition to a well-regulated militia, would be a sufficient military 
peace establishment at that time.

CHAPTER XXXIII. 

Colonel Pickering s Views as to his future Course of Life. His 
Fear that the Public Debts will not be paid. His Liberality 
towards the Refugees. Correspondence with General Gates. 
Compensation to the Officers of the Army. The Army ill used 
by their Country. Mutiny of Pennsylvania Troops. Prepara 
tions to celebrate the Treaty of Peace. Refusal of the British to 
surrender the Frontier Posts. Noah Webster s Spelling-Book. 
His future Distinction predicted. 

SOON after the arrival of the news that peace had 
been made with Great Britain, Colonel Pickering pro 
ceeded to carry into effect his long-contemplated plan 
of going into business as a merchant. 

He wrote from Newburgh on the 26th of April, 1783, 
to Paine Wingate, his brother-in-law : 

" You will permit me to congratulate you on the return 
of peace. I have enjoyed with a degree of transport this 
happy event ; but I confess I should be still more happy 
could I discover a better disposition among the governments 
to make a certain provision for the payment of the public 
debts at home and abroad. No permanent revenues, I 
fear, will be established ; and positive taxes on lands and 
other property will appear so burdensome, that the people 
will probably murmur under the weight, if they do not 
refuse to bear it. By a Philadelphia paper of the 19th 
instant, I see that the Assembly of South Carolina have 
rejected the impost act by a majority of sixty-three to 
twenty-three. 

" It has for some time past been my intention to settle at 
Philadelphia. I bave had enough of public offices to be 
tired of them. By returning to Massachusetts, I might 



^Er. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 465 

i 

obtain one deemed respectable ; but I know not one in the 
State which will yield a man more than a decent support, 
without enabling him to lay up a penny for old age or a 
destitute family. I have made known to my friends at the 
eastward my determination to undertake, at Philadelphia, 
commercial business on commission. . . . The prospects 
promise success. Should I be disappointed, I should much 
prefer a settlement in some part of the back country to any 
other mode of life which I can pursue. I wish, indeed, I 
were younger; but, even at this time of life, a new country 
presents me with prospects more advantageous for my 
family than any other business I could engage in, that 
above mentioned excepted. . . . Perhaps it may fall in 
your way to aid my designs." 

In pursuance of these designs, he entered into 
copartnership with Mr. Hodgdon, by articles of agree 
ment dated the 10th of May, 1783, for the term of two 
years. The connection was continued, however, much 
longer. This business did not answer his expectations, 
not yielding him an income sufficient for the support 
of his family. 

In his correspondence of that period, incidents are 
mentioned and sentiments expressed by him which 
have an interest, some of them in relation to himself, 
his family, or his friends ; others, to public affairs. 

On the 19th of May, General Gates, in a despond 
ing letter concerning the illness of his wife, requests 
Colonel Pickering to lay her case before Dr. Eustis 
and Dr. Townsend. He likewise makes inquiries re 
specting the prospects of the officers of the army. 
He says : 

" The beginning of last winter I took leave of you upon 
your setting out from Newburgh for Philadelphia. Little 
did I then think your very great distress would so soon be 

VOL. I. 59 



466 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

my unhappy lot. You were presently relieved by the 
recovery of Mrs. Pickering; but of such relief I have no 
prospect. All looks dark, and threatens a fatal issue. I 
have too much cause to fear you will never see your old 
friend again. Thus am I upon the verge of being left the 
most forlorn of mankind ; and there is only wanting my 
death to close the shocking scene. God s will be done. . . . 

" I think it will be impossible for me to join the army 
before their dissolution, as I am told the whole are to be 
disbanded ; but you may know better, who are so much 
nearer head-quarters. It would give a moment s relief to 
the melancholy that oppresses me, could I hear from you. 
Your kind remembrance will come up through the hands 
of [Major John] Armstrong, who is fixed in Philadel 
phia. . . . 

"How do you go, and how have you been able to go 
on ? I have heard of different schemes that have been pro 
posed to the army. They appeared to rne Utopian ; I dare 
say they did so to you. Is the commutation generally 
accepted? And, if so, is there the smallest probability of 
the Assemblies of all or any of the States confirming it to 
the officers? If not, how basely and ungratefully are we 
treated ! I can live, it is true, without it ; but I feel as 
poignantly for the distresses of the poor fellows who have 
been our faithful companions through the war, as if those 
distresses were all my own. . . . 

" That Heaven may preserve you and yours is the wish 
of, dear Colonel, your affectionate friend and humble ser 
vant, 

" HORATIO GATES." 

Although Colonel Pickering was not personally inter 
ested * in the half pay for life, or commutation, prom 
ised by Congress to officers who should serve until the 
end of the war, his answer shows his sympathy for 

* See page 312. 



MT. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 467 

such officers, and his strong sense of the injustice 
which he rightly anticipated would be done to them 
by individual States. In his reply to General Gates, 
dated Newburgh, May 2Sth, he wrote : 

" Your favor of the 19th I duly received, and lament for 
your distress. Should the event your heart forebodes take 
place, your situation, I confess, will be forlorn. My own, 
so similar at the time you mention, enables me to feel a 
sympathetic woe. Yet I will not pretend that in any event 
my distress could equal yours ; for, amidst the anguish of 
my heart under the expected loss of Mrs. Pickering, I had 
still some source of consolation in the dear pledges of our 
mutual love. In that distressing hour I felt relief in appeal 
ing to the mercy of that Being to whose wise providence you 
express your resignation. It is at such periods we are wont 
to make these appeals. We then see the frailty of every 
earthly thing, the uncertainty of every earthly enjoyment, 
and thence we are led to look for support where indeed it 
can alone be found in the goodness of our all-wise, almighty 
Parent. But when brighter scenes present, such serious 
impressions are too apt to wear off, and at length to disap 
pear. In kindness, therefore, we are visited with repeated 
afflictions, if haply we may thence be influenced to fulfil 
the gracious intentions of the Deity. If I preach, the sol 
emn occasion will excuse it ; and I beg you to receive it as 
a proof of my sincere regard. . . . 

" I am inclined to think that the want of money may 
induce Congress to consent to the wishes of the Financier 
in discharging speedily the men engaged for the war. / 
wish it for many reasons, public and personal. . . . 

" The commutation is, I believe, universally accepted by 
the army. Some, I hope the most, of the States will make 
it good ; but some, there is too much reason to think, will 
never consent to it, Connecticut in particular.* While the

468 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

army was necessary to their safety, they were willing the 
officers should believe in the justice of their country, and 
that the promised compensation for their extraordinary suf 
ferings and services should never be denied them. But 
these are already forgotten ; the hour of danger is past, 
and avarice and meanness have usurped the places of grati 
tude and justice. I have seen, in a life by some years 
shorter than yours, so many instances of public and private 
injustice and baseness, as to have often made me sick of the 
world ; but then the goodness of a few, and especially the 
tender ties of wife and children, have again reconciled me 
to it. For their sakes I still wish to live ; and still do I 
hope to see you relieved from the melancholy which now 
oppresses you, in the recovery of Mrs. Gates, the confirma 
tion of her health, and the continuance of your own : being, 
my dear Sir, with great sincerity, your friend and servant, 

" TIMOTHY PICKERING." 

Mrs. Higginson, in a letter of the 19th of May, 
informs Colonel Pickering that, after living in Beverly 
some months in a retired manner in order to escape 
persecution from Whigs in Salem, she has returned to 
Salem ; that she has taken possession of her house 
there, and, with her daughter, has opened a school; 
that she has much pleasure in supporting herself; and 
that she hopes it may be consistent with his interest 
to return to Salem to live. 

She adds : 

" In this I suppose I am selfish ; but I readily forgive my 
self, as I think this spot, where all your connections and 
former friends are, must be more agreeable to you when 
you return to private life. . . . We want you here to 
stem the torrent of curses that are vented on Sunday even 
ings by the reverend Doctor [Whitaker]. If you recollect 
Ernulphus s curses in Tristram Shandy, they are weak, 
insignificant, childish things, compared with that patriotic 



Mi. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 469 

divine s against the poor refugees. Our Saviour says, 
Bless your enemies ; the Doctor bids all his hearers curse 
them, and says they tt be cursed if they don t." 

Colonel Pickering s reply, dated at Newburgh, the 
15th of June, is evidence of his liberality towards the 
refugees (but with discrimination), as well as of the 
constancy of his affection for an old friend who belonged 
to that class. 

" DEAR MADAM, 

"I have this evening received your favor of the 19th 
ultimo, and wait not a moment to acknowledge the pleasure 
it gave me. ... I admire the spirit that determined you 
to the means of independence. It was a virtuous pride, 
which no one more eminently possesses, which no one can 
support with more honor. . . . Happy should I be, could 
I make it consistent with my interest to become your neigh 
bor, as I am your friend. But, though my residence will 
probably be fixed in Philadelphia, I hope ere long to visit 
Salem. . . . 

" I have been sorry to see the virulent temper so generally 
manifested against the absentees and refugees indiscrimi 
nately. There have been many who have been suffered to 
remain always amongst us, by whose exchange for an equal 
number of refugees the country would be gainers. The 
ravings of the reverend Doctor are such as I should expect. 
His natural disposition, religious principles, and insignifi 
cance but on subjects of popular clamor, will account for 
his bitter curses on refugees. Some there are, indeed, 
whom the country can never forgive ; and, unfortunately, 
their crimes are imputed to the whole body without distinc 
tion. I find it is worth a man s popularity to say a word in 
favor of the most deserving of characters truly innocent 
of men who, instead of injuring, have, during the war, 
been rendering benefits to this country ! For speaking in 
favor of such, I perceive, many good men have this year 



470 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKEKING. [1783. 

lost their elections in Massachusetts. Dispositions still 
more violent appear in other States. Time, which works 
wonders, may cool them ; but it will then be too late to 
repent. 

" You call Hitty my pupil ; but I claim no right to the 
title of her preceptor : yet, if she can fancy herself under 
any obligations of duty, I beg she would discharge them by 
writing me, with her own hand, two lines of acknowledg 
ment. I will then immediately sign a quitclaim to every 
thing but her friendship ; yours and hers I hope ever to 
preserve." 

After the receipt of satisfactory intelligence that 
peace had been made, Colonel Pickering, was much 
occupied in the disbanding of the troops, and in 
making sale of various military stores. In general, 
his directions for the latter purpose to the subordinates 
in his department would not interest the reader ; but 
the following inquiry concerning the chain which was 
stretched across the Hudson River at West Point, to 
prevent the passage of British ships of war, a few 
links of which are preserved at that place as a Revo 
lutionary relic, is deemed an exception. It is in a 
letter to Mr. Hodgdon, dated at Newburgh, the 22d of 
May. 

" I wish also to be informed weekly of the price of bar 
iron. Application has been made for old cannon, shot, and 
shells. Nancarron once run up some cannon. I suspect he 
will give so much higher price for them as will pay for their 
transportation to Philadelphia. Please to inquire of him 
what he will give per ton. The great chain at West Point 
contains upwards of sixty tons of excellent Stirling iron. 
The links, you may recollect, are about thirty inches long, 
made of bars about two inches square. If it be sold here, 
I am doubtful if it will fetch much more than half the price 



^T.37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 471 

of bar iron. Pray inquire if it will answer to send it to 

Philadelphia." 

t 

On the 26th of May, Congress passed a resolution, 
that furloughs should be granted to the non-commis 
sioned officers and soldiers enlisted to serve during the 
war, who should be discharged as soon as the defini 
tive treaty should be concluded, together with a propor 
tionate number of commissioned officers ; and that the 
Secretary of War and the Commander-in-Chief should 
take the proper measures for conducting those troops, 
in a manner convenient to them and to the States 
through which they should pass, to their respective 
homes. 

Not knowing of the passage of this resolution, 
Colonel Pickering wrote to his brother, on the 27th 
of May, from Newburgh : 

" I am impatient to have the army disbanded, that I may 
return to dwell with my family and engage in private pur 
suits. I am impatient, because, from the slackness of the 
States in paying taxes, the embarrassments of public officers 
are rather increasing. I am impatient, because, by the dis 
solution of the army, our public burdens will be so essen 
tially lessened, and the States thereby enabled to commence 
those measures which are necessary to do justice to the 
army and the public creditors. I hope the men enlisted for 
the war (which comprehends more than half the army) will 
shortly be discharged. It is the wish of the Financier ; and 
his opinion, grounded on the most cogent reason, I hope 
will prevail. That reason is, that, if the whole army be long 
continued together, they will eat up the money with which 
he could otherwise give them two or three months pay when 
discharged. If the definitive treaty were arrived, I think 
the whole army would be discharged, and the few troops 
necessary on frontier posts, and for guards of the arsenals, 



472 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

engaged on new and cheaper terms. This will be called 
the peace establishment, which Congress now have under 
consideration." 

On the same day he informed Mr. Hodgdon that he 
had requested money of Mr. Morris, because the sale 
of some public horses yielded neither money nor notes. 
He added : 

" I told the officers of the army that, as they had not 
received their notes for their three months promised pa}^ 
I would accept their orders on their paymasters. This was 
agreeable to them, and raised the average price of the 
horses to fifty-two dollars." 

Mrs. Pickering wrote to him on the 27th of May, 
from Philadelphia, that their three children were ill, 
one of them dangerously ill, and that, in conse 
quence, she herself was not well, and she much needed 
his presence. 

He replied on the 5th of June, from Newburgh : 

" I was grieved at your situation as described in your 
letter, surrounded with sick children, yourself unwell ; and 
grieved I am, also, that it is impossible for me to go to 
your assistance. I pray God to preserve you and them, 
and to restore all to perfect health. . . . 

" The army are beginning to separate. All the men en 
listed for the war (which comprehends a great majority) 
are to be immediately sent home. A proportion of the 
officers are to go with them.* . . . When the army is 
thus diminished, my cares will be somewhat lessened. This 
movement of the army will prevent my journey to Albany, 
&c., until the troops which are to be discharged shall be 
gone." 

* See Journals of Congress, May 26th, 1783. 



JET. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 473 

In several letters he wrote in strong terms of dis 
approbation of the manner in which a large portion 
of the troops were sent home on furlough, in pursu 
ance of the resolution, before mentioned, of the 26th 
of May. 

Thus, on the 7th of June, to Mr. Hodgdon : 

" The army is disgusted at the manner in which they are 
sent about their business, without pay, and without even 
thanks, for eight years toils and dangers ! Tis painful to 
think of it, and of the wretched condition of great numbers 
in consequence of the service." 

To Mr. Hodgdon again, on the 12th : 

" The army has been separated in a manner the most 
disgusting that could have been invented. Universal dis- 

O O 

satisfaction has appeared. Neither Congress nor the C. in 
C. [Commander-in-Chief] have paid the smallest tribute 
to, or even acknowledgment of, such meritorious services. 
This circumstance, joined to the distress of the army for 
want of even as much pay as would defray the expenses 
of their journey home, has justly excited general disgust. 
The officers of the York line have presented a manly, ele 
gant, and affectionate address to the Baron S[teuben], but 
have not even taken leave of the C. in C. The address and 
answer, I understand, will be published." 

To Mrs. Pickering, on the 17th: 

"The army think, and justly, that they are ill used by 
their country. They have been dismissed abruptly, with 
out money, and even (what it was easy to give) without 
thanks." 

And to his brother, on the 18th : 

" We have yet no news of the definitive treaty ; the 
greater part of the army is, however, discharged, though 
VOL. i. 60 



474 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKEKING. [1783. 

not in a manner that was acceptable. For want of pay 
their distresses were unexampled. They had neither the 
means of paying their little debts in camp, nor their neces 
sary expenses in going home. Their sufferings and services 
seem already to be forgotten by multitudes. I hope in time 
that, on proper information to the people and Assemblies, 
they will feel the demands of justice and gratitude, and take 
effectual means to satisfy them. The half pay, or commu 
tation, is as really due to the officers, by solemn contract, 
as their original pay. It does not concern me ; but I wish 
the army to receive their dues, and that the country may 
recover its reputation for justice and good faith." 

On the 24th of June he wrote to his wife concerning 
the mutiny of troops in Philadelphia, where she then 
resided : 

" Though in the midst of tumult, I hope my dear Becky 
remains undisturbed. An express has arrived this after 
noon, by whom Mr. Hodgdon has sent me an account of 
the mutiny of the Pennsylvania troops.* Before this reaches 

* Mr. Hodgdon, in a letter dated at Philadelphia, the 22d of June, says : 
" The bearer comes express from the President of Congress to the Com- 
mander-in-Chief. The business I believe to be the mutiny of the day, of 
which take the following as an authentic account : 

" Soon after the arrival of the troops from Charleston, it was judged best 
to remove some of the others out of the barracks for their reception, as they 
were incapable of holding all of them. Previous to the removal, the furloughs 
were tendered them, and refused. The consequence was, an order to pay no 
man his three months but such as should receive a furlough. A few com 
plied, and did receive them ; the remainder were marched out of town for 
Lancaster. On the road they mutinied, and, having again appointed their 
sergeants to command, determined to return to the city. They arrived here 
about one o clock, and immediately paraded before the State House, from 
whence they made detachments to the several deposits of stores. I was hon 
ored with five sentries, and no person could approach. These precautions 
being taken, they demanded an audience with Congress. General St. Clair, 
Colonel Porter, and others addressed them, but for some time to little effect. 
The President, coining out of Congress, was arrested and ordered back, but 
afterwards suffered to proceed. About four o clock they were prevailed on to 
retire to the barracks, and depute six of their number to meet Congress at six 



^ET. 37.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 475 

you, I trust the uproar will cease : should it be otherwise, 
I think you will have nothing to fear. Nobody can be 
interested to disturb you, and you dwell in a quiet part of 
the town. However, if the mutiny continues, it may be 
advisable to suspend John s going to school, and to keep the 
children out of the street. But your prudence would man 
age all this as it should be, without any suggestion from me ; 
but a husband s and a parent s care is wont to be officious. 

" Orders are given for the march of troops hence to quell 
the mutineers ; but I have no idea that it will be necessary 
to march far. Tis a pity that five hundred undisciplined 
troops (and such I understand are the mutineers) should 
spread and continue terror through that great city." 

In the following letter to Mr. Hodgdon, dated at 
Newburgh, the 27th of August, are shown the prepara- 

o clock, and relate their particular grievances. Thus the matter rests at the 
writing of this, five o clock. It seems they demand one month s pay in 
specie, three months pay in notes payable at six months, and a full settle 
ment of their accounts, with a funded certificate for the balances due them 
respectively." 

In a second letter from Mr. Hodgdon, dated the 23d of June, is the fol 
lowing passage : 

"Another express is called for, the business the same as by the last. At 
six o clock last evening, Congress met ; and, though nothing of their doings has 
transpired, appearances evince that they sensibly feel the insult of yesterday. 
The soldiery has had no communication with them, nor will they have, be the 
event what it may. I sincerely pity Congress in their present unprotected 
state. They feel themselves of no importance, and, if something is not done 
to give energy to their proceedings, they must shortly appear contemptible. 
What they have done to occasion a total desertion by the States, and make 
themselves a derision to individuals, I am yet to learn. That the army at 
large is hardly treated, they and all men allow ; but that they have been the 
cause of it, they positively deny. The present commotion springs from a 
mutinous disposition, once and again successful, and C. [Congress] think it 
has been cherished and nursed by the officers of the line, a belief that aggra 
vates the insult exceedingly, as they suppose that this line has, upon a general 
scale, fared as well or better than any other in the Union. But I will not 
enlarge. The foregoing observations were collected from a recent interview 
with two or three principal characters, and is in confidence." 

See, on this subject, Journals of Congress, June 21st and July 1st; Mar 
shall s "Life of Washington," Vol. IV. p. G15; and Sparks s "Writings of 
Washington," Vol. VIII. pp. 454, 458.

tions making by the army for the celebration of the 
definitive treaty of peace, the early arrival of which 
was expected. The refusal of the British to surrender 
the frontier posts is also mentioned. 

" I missed of the General ; he went down the river. He 
will not return again, unless to celebrate the definitive treaty 
at West Point, when he will invite Messieurs le Congres 
to accompany him. There is a mighty colonnade erecting, 
near two hundred feet long and eighty broad. Twenty 
thousand lamps are made, and the posts erected to display 
the fireworks extend a hundred and fifty or two hundred 
yards. I wish the winter storms may not demolish the 
colonnade before the treaty arrives. 

"Head-quarters are moved, bag and baggage, which will 
ease me of some trouble. 

" Colonel Villefranche and Captain Fairley, who went with 
Baron Steuben to Canada, returned yesterday. Haldimaii 
would not suffer, the Baron to see the frontier posts. He 
said the war was not over ; there was only a cessation of 
hostilities ; and that he should surrender no post until he 
received explicit orders from home. So Steuben is come 
back ; but, being unwell, he stopped at Saratoga, and sent 
the two gentlemen forward with despatches to the General. 
Villefranche is gone on to Princeton. By him I wrote to 
the General that I should suspend all preparations * until I 
received his further orders. But for this I should have set 
out to-morrow for the northward. I am really glad that 
this unexpected turn has stopped expensive proceedings 
that must have been fruitless. You will judge a little of 
that northern climate by this circumstance, that on the tenth 
instant they had ice in Canada as thick as a dollar. It was 
indeed extraordinary, but the winter there sets in early. 
The two gentlemen told me, they said in Canada it was too 
late to visit the frontier posts on the lakes, even if they 
were permitted to proceed. . . . 

* For taking possession of the frontier posts. 



MT. 38.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 477 

"If the whole detachment should not have marched, 
be pleased to get my unmade suit of clothes forwarded 
under Davis s care. My wife will give them to you. The 
definitive treaty may arrive, and I have only a turned coat 
to appear in. Please to desire my wife to wrap up the 
bundle in divers folds of osnaburgs, to prevent its wearing 
or staining." 

In general, Colonel Pickering was indifferent to pub 
lic shows ; but he was so much exhilarated by the news 
of peace, that he appears to have entered heartily into 
the celebration of the definitive treaty. He alludes to 
it in the following letter to his wife, dated at Newburgh, 
the 29th of August : 

" It is not a fortnight since I left you. ... As I was 
musing, on my journey, I endeavored to contrive how you 
should pay me a visit. We all hope the definitive treaty 
will soon arrive. Great preparations have been and are 
making at West Point to celebrate that event. I asked 
myself why you could not be present. We have a chair, 
and the Major [Hodgdon] will be solicitous to come. Why 
can t you come together? * But the roads are bad. True, 
on one route ; but you may travel by Princeton, Brunswick, 
Elizabeth town, and so to King s Ferry, where I can meet you 
in my barge, and bring you to West Point and Newburgh. 
What say you to this? But this will be an occasion so 
extraordinary, and the exhibition so splendid, I wish greatly 
that John could accompany you. He is old enough to re 
member it as long as he lives. . . . 

" By the post I desired the Major to call on you for my 
unmade suit, that I might get it made up here before the 
event in question takes place." 

Colonel Pickering informed his wife, on the 27th of 
May, that he intended shortly to make a tour to the 
northward, to Albany and other places, to dispose of 



478 I^IFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

public property in that quarter, and said he should " also 
be gratified in viewing the scenes of action at Benning- 
ton and Saratoga, which led to the important event of 
the capture of Burgoyne." The excursion, however, 
was postponed. On the 8th of September he wrote to 
her on that subject : 

" To-morrow morning I set out on a tour of pleasure and 
of business jointly. Dr. Eustis, and Major Cogswell, and 
Mr. Anspach are in the company. We intend to visit Sara 
toga, Ticonderoga, and Crown Point ; on our return, to 
see Bennington, the capital of Vermont, Schenectady, and 
possibly Fort Schuyler. It may be a ten days or a fort 
night s tour. 

"September 9th. It rains, and our journey must be 
suspended till the weather changes. Every information 
concurs to show that the British will probably leave New 
York early in October." 

On the same day (the 9th) he wrote to his brother : 

"I believe that New York will be evacuated early in 
October. The madness of the violent*Whigs has retarded 
this measure by exciting the fears of thousands of well- 
disposed people, who have been within the British lines, and 
thereby driving them from the country, to its great injury, 
and the no small emolument of the British, who will get 
Nova Scotia, &c., well peopled." 

He wrote again to his wife on the 29th of Septem 
ber, from Newburgh, respecting the celebration : 

"Last evening I returned from the northward. . . . 
And you had, as I proposed, determined to make me a 
visit. . . . But must it depend on a contingency the 
arrival of the definitive treaty ? or the departure of the Brit 
ish from New York? Whichever event comes first will 
occasion a public entertainment and display of the fireworks 



MT. 38.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKEEINO. 479 

at West Point, and I will expect you. But if neither hap 
pens while the weather and the roads are tolerable, I will 
save you the trouble of so long a journey. In three days I 
can easily travel to Philadelphia. I do not, however, mean 
to forbid your coming hither, but only to save you from 
the fatigue of a journey, if it should not be your choice, 
independent of a public exhibition of fireworks, &c., on 
so joyful an occasion as either of those events before 
mentioned." 

In a letter, dated at Springfield, the 29th of Sep 
tember, Mr. Sargeant, his brother-in-law, wrote to him 
as follows : 

"We had some pleasing expectations that you would 
come to the northward this fall. I hope we shall not be 
disappointed. I want to talk over many of the affairs of 
the war. . . . Your sister wants to catechize you a little 
for your spending so much of your time in the service of the 
public. She fears you have not sufficiently regarded your 
own interest. Tis the only fault she has, I can t make the 
dear woman quite so much of a patriot as I could wish." 

The celebrity which the name of Noah Webster has 
attained lends an interest to the following letter. It 
appears by it that the numerous duties of Colonel Pick 
ering s office did not prevent him from turning his 
attention to the subject of education, in regard both to 
its public importance and to the instruction of his own 
children. The letter is addressed to his wife, and is 
dated at Newburgh, the 31st of October. 

" By the eastern post yesterday I was lucky enough to 
receive the new Spelling-Book [Webster s] I mentioned in 
my last, and, instead of sleeping (for I had a waking fit 
which prevented me) , I read it through last night, except 
that I only examined a part of the different tables. I am 



480 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

much pleased with it. The author is ingenious, and writes 
from his own experience as a schoolmaster, as well as the 
best authorities ; and the time will come when no authority, 
as an English grammarian, will be superior to his own. 
It is the very thing I have so long wished for, being much 
dissatisfied with any spelling-book I had seen before. I 
now send you the book, and request you to let John take it 
to his master, with the enclosed letter ; for I am determined 
to have him instructed upon this new, ingenious, and at the 
same time easy plan. There are, you will see by the Intro 
duction, two more parts to come to complete the plan. I 
am a stranger to Mr. Webster, but I intend, when I can 
find leisure, to write him on the subject, using the liberty 
(which he requests) to suggest some little matters which 
may be altered and improved in his next edition ; for I think 
the work will do honor to his country, and I wish it may be 
perfect. Many men of literature might think it too trifling 
a subject ; but I am of a different opinion, and am happy 
that a gentleman of Mr. Webster s genius and learning has 
taken it up. All men are pleased with an elegant pro 
nunciation, and this new Spel ling-Book shows children how 
to acquire it with ease and certainty."

CONGRESS having issued a proclamation, dated the 
18th of October, 1783, thanking the armies of the 
United States for their faithful services, ordering that 
such part of the troops as were enlisted for the war 
should be discharged, and permitting the officers on 
furlough to retire from the service, General Washing 
ton, on the 2d of November, issued his "Farewell 
Orders to the Armies of the United States." 

It does not appear that Colonel Pickering ever had 
any cause for enmity to General Washington, or that 
Washington ever addressed to him an angry word ; so 
that it is difficult to account for a hardness towards 
Washington which occasionally betrays itself in his 
letters. A reason suggested by some of his observa 
tions about flattery, as well as by his natural disposi 
tion, may have had an influence in the case ; but it is 
not an entirely satisfactory explanation. This is, that, 
as he entertained a less exalted opinion than most of 
the officers did of Washington s military talents, the 
fulsome adulation on the part of some of them excited 
his disgust, and so drew from him expressions of an oppo 
site character. The application of these remarks will 

VOL. i. 61 



482 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

be seen on reading his letters relating to the " Fare 
well Orders," and to the answer presented by the offi 
cers ; which was drawn up by him. His opinion that 
the " Orders " were too long, and that the title given 
to them -was not a happy one, may be just ; but he 
undervalues them. He refers to them in the following 
passage in a letter to Mr. Hodgdon, dated at New- 
burgh, the 5th of November. After intimating that 
he shall not go to Philadelphia until towards the end 
of the month, he proceeds : 

" This delay will disappoint one whose expectations I 
wish ever to gratify ; but more business remains to be done 
this mouth, preparatory to the winter s settlement, than I 
looked for. I expect, too, that the British will leave New 
York ; and I would not choose, nor would it be proper for 
me, to be absent then. The dissolution of the army will 
follow of course, and this will require my being here. 

" Yesterday General Knox sent me General Washington s 
* Farewell Orders. You will doubtless see them in print, 
with the answer (if the term is admissible as the counter 
part of orders), though orders seems to be an unlucky 
title (given by son Excellence himself) for an affectionate 

taking of leave. Truly but it will be safest for you to 

make your own comments when you see them ; or wait a 
little, and some zealous devotee will save you the trouble, 
and at a dash declare, that they proceeded from the imme 
diate inspiration of Heaven. They are very long ; which 
I am sorry for, unless they contained more. I wish they 
would better correspond w^ith such an answer as might be 
given. What sort of answer will be made, I know not. 
Knox desires me to go to the Point [West Point] to-day, 
to consult upon it ; and I am going. You will imagine to 
what kind of address I shall put my name : to such a one 
you will see it, or not at all. He [Washington] has virtues 
to which I would pay the tribute due." 



J3x. 38.] LITE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 483 

In the same letter he speaks as follows of two brass 
cannons, trophies taken from the British, intended to be 
presented to the Comte De Grasse : 

" By the way, General Knox wrote me, a day or two since, 
that the Commander-in-Chief was importunate to have sent 
on the two six-pounders designed for Comte De Grasse. 
They are finished by Billings, of Poughkeepsie. I saw 
them yesterday, and they are neatly done, with pertinent 
emblems. But, pray, to whom are those two to be pre 
sented which the Frenchman is doing in Philadelphia? 
You carried me to see one of them ; and it has ever lain 
in my mind, that those were for Comte De Grasse. How 
ever, the two engraved by Billings will be forwarded in a 
day or two, and that pair preferred which are most elegantly 
executed ; for I am confident there are these duplicates." 

He received from General Knox the following letter, 
dated at West Point the 12th of November : 

" The officers universally agree to the Address. If you 
will please to come down to-morrow, we will present it. 
The General has not yet arrived, but he will be here cer 
tainly to-day. I am," &c. 

On that day he wrote to Mrs. Pickering, from New- 
burgh : 

" Mr. Hodgdon told me (what I expected) that you had 
sent me a letter in the mail that was stolen. But do not let 
that accident prevent your writing by the post. If imper 
tinent people now and then open our letters, they will dis 
cover no mischief; but if they have hearts, they may learn 
to love as we do ; and surely the world will be nothing the 
worse for it. ... 

" The Commander-in-Chief was to be at West Point 
to-night. You have doubtless seen in the newspapers his 



484 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

Farewell Address (called Orders) to the army. It was 
thought proper that the officers here should return an 
answer. The answer agreed on universally is enclosed. 
Tis to be presented to the General to-morrow. Perhaps 
your curiosity may prompt you to read it ; but let nobody 
else read it, the Major [Hodgdon] excepted, until you see 
it published in the newspapers. The answer is to be pre 
sented to the General by a committee, who are General 
McDougall, General Knox, and your humble servant. 
Though it is rather modest, or, in other words, does not 
abound with panegyric, yet I think it will be graciously 
received; for there is enough in it to please a modest 



On the 16th of November he wrote to Mrs. Pick 
ering : 

" Those happy events, the hopes of which animated me 
during the war, at length have arrived. The definitive 
treaty of peace is concluded, and will be celebrated by the 
Commander-in-Chief and the officers of the army in New 
York on the 1st of December. The British are to evacuate 
the city on the 22d instant.* I have informed Mr. Hodg 
don of this, and invited him to meet me there. I have also 
told him that I was almost tempted to ask the favor of your 
company, . . . but I am almost afraid to hazard you on 
such a journey at this disagreeable season. . . . By the 
last post I sent you the proposed address of the officers to 
the Commander-in-Chief. A few words were afterwards 
altered; and yesterday we presented it to him. I send by 
this conveyance a copy of it to Mr. Hodgdon for publica 
tion : of course you will see it complete in the news 
papers." 

To Mr. Hodgdon he wrote on the same day as fol 
lows : 

* Delayed till the 25th. 



J3T. 38.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 485 

"I have the pleasure of announcing to you, that Sir Guy 
Carleton has fixed on the 21st instant for the evacuation of 
his outposts, and on the 22d for the complete evacuation of 
the city of New York and its dependencies. In consequence, 
two companies of artillery commanded by Major Bowman 
[Baumau?], with four six-pounders (all trophies, engraved 
with the times and places of their capture from the enemy) , 
the light infantry, and the First and Fourth Massachusetts 
Kegiments, have this day marched for the environs of 
Kingsbridge, to be prepared to take possession as the 
British relinquish the posts. The whole detachment will 
amount to eight hundred or a thousand men. On the 1st 
of December the Commander-in-Chief intends to celebrate 
in New York the definitive treaty of peace : and, that all 
persons disposed to be present may have notice thereof, 
the enclosed garrison order is to be published in the news 
papers. You will be pleased to hand it to the printers in 
Philadelphia without delay. 

" I also enclose you a letter and address, w^hich were 
presented to the Commauder-in-Chief yesterday. The 
whole are written just in the manner the printers are to 
publish them.* . . . 

" By Tuesday or Wednesday next I shall leave this place 
and join the detachment near Kingsbridge, and enter the 
enemy s posts with them. I shall probably remain at New 
York until the celebration of the peace is over ; soon after 
which (perhaps directly from the city) I purpose to visit 
Philadelphia. You will have an inclination to be present 
at the celebration, and I shall be happy to meet you there. 
I am almost tempted to invite Mrs. Pickering ; but the season 
is disagreeable, and I do not know to whom she could com 
mit the care of the children in her absence. At any rate, 
I would not have her come crowded and jolted in the stage. 

" Mrs. Knox tells me she shall go, with all her family, 
into the city in three or four days after we have possession, 

* Instructions are here inserted in regard to punctuation, Italics, and 
capitals. 



486 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

remain till the celebration of peace, and then proceed home 
to Boston, no more to return. 

" West Point and dependencies will be left with one regi 
ment ; all the rest of the troops will be discharged in De 
cember, as soon as the New York business is finished. So 
large a body of troops go in to prevent the mischiefs which 
the violence of parties might otherwise occasion, before the 
civil power obtains its due influence.* . . . 

" The public business on which Kell is sent, I hope, will 
be promptly accomplished. It will be impossible for me to 
fulfil my duty or the General s orders without cash."f 

Mr. Hodgdon and Mrs. Pickering determined to 
attend at the celebration, and he informed Colonel 
Pickering that he had engaged a passage from Phila 
delphia to New York " in the stage-wagon that goes 
through in two days," and that for their comfort in the 
carnage he had agreed to pay for three seats. 

Supposing the fireworks to have been previously 
prepared at West Point, the small sum of one thousand 
dollars, still required for the celebration at New York 
of so important an event as a general peace, and the 
difficulty of procuring that small sum, may, in these 
days of wealth and profusion, excite a smile. 

Colonel Pickering wrote another letter to Mr. Hodg 
don, on the 16th of November, on the same all-important 
article of " cash," saying : 

"I have sent Kell express to Philadelphia for the purpose 
of bringing on the five thousand dollars for which I last 
wrote you, and an additional sum of one thousand dollars 

* On the 19th, Sir Guy Carleton wrote to Washington, "I have received 
repeated information, . . . that a deliberate combination has been formed to 
plunder the town whenever the King s troops shall be withdrawn." If such a 
plan was contemplated, no attempt was made to put it in execution. See 
Sparks s " Writings of Washington," Vol. VIII. pp. 546, 501. 

t See the next letter. 



^ET. 38.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 487 

in cash, or in orders on somebody at New York who will 
certainly answer them. The movement of the detachment 
of artillery, light infantry, and two regiments of infantry to 
the city, and their demands for wood and forage for one 
month, or at least three weeks, together with the expenses 
to which I shall be put in fulfilling the views of the Com- 
mander-in-Chief relative to the celebration of the peace, 
require that I be supplied with one thousand dollars in cash. 
To insure to me a supply in time, and to furnish the Pay 
master-General [Peirce] with another thousand dollars, to 
enable him to give their subsistence to those officers who go 
with the troops to New York, the Commander-in-Chief has 
written to Governor Clinton, requesting the loan of two 
thousand dollars, to be repaid by Mr. Peirce and me as soon 
as we receive the money from Philadelphia. But whether 
the Governor has any money by him is uncertain. . . . 
Be pleased to apply instantly to the Superintendent of 
Finance with information of the nature and necessity of 
this demand." 

To Mr. Hodgdon he wrote again from Newburgh 
on the 17th of November. He says: 

"Mr. Demler has returned from the Governor, who un 
fortunately had no money ; so that a supply by Kell, either 
in cash or orders payable in New York at sight, is of abso 
lute necessity. . . . 

" By Kell you will receive authentic copies of the officers 
answer to the Orders. I think it may be marked as the 
Italians do some strains of their music, moderate ; and yet 
I think it must have been tolerably acceptable. In one 
passage the word magnanimity was proposed where I had 
written prudence; and, as there is magnanimity in a firm 
perseverance, I did not scruple to make the alteration. 
The committee for drafting the answer were General McDou- 
gall, General Knox, and T. P. The first was busy, and 
wrote nothing; the second had written, but said he had 
not finished. There is a boldness in his conceptions which 



488 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

pleases me ; there were many passages which struck me 
very agreeably ; but he declared his preference of the other, 
and it was universally adopted, with a few verbal altera 
tions. It is sufficiently long, and it seemed proper that it 
should bear some proportion to the Orders.* These gave 
fair openings to the remarks on the conduct of some of the 
States, which appeared to be well warranted, and which 
gave a due length to the answer, without stuffing it with 
fulsome adulation. When I next hear from or see you, I 
shall learn what opinion is formed of it." 

The answer was presented on the 15th, with the 
following note : 

SIR, 

" The officers of the part of the army who agreed on the 
enclosed address having committed to us the honor of 
presenting it, with great pleasure we now offer to your 
Excellency this testimony of their affectionate attachment 
and respect. 

We have the honor to be, with perfect consideration, Sir, 
your Excellency s most obedient and most humble servants, 
"A. McDouGALL, Major- General. 
" H. KNOX, Major- General. 
"T. PICKERING, Quarter master- General." 

The answer was as follows : 

" To HIS EXCELLENCY, GENERAL WASHINGTON, COMMANDER- 
IN-CHIEF OF THE ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES OF 
AMERICA. 

"We, the officers of the part of the army remaining on 
the banks of the Hudson, have received your Excellency s 
serious and farewell address to the armies of the United 
States. We beg your acceptance of our unfeigned thanks 

* General Washington s address occupies five pages in Sparks s " Writings 
of Washington," Vol. VIII. p. 491 ; the answer is about half as long. 



MT. 38.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 489 

for the communication, and your affectionate assurances of 
inviolable attachment and friendship. If your attempts to 
insure to the armies the just, the promised rewards of their 
long, severe, and dangerous services have failed of success, 
we believe it has arisen from causes not in your Excel 
lency s power to control. With extreme regret do we 
reflect on the occasion which called for such endeavors. 
But, while we thank your Excellency for these exertions in 
favor of the troops you have so successfully commanded, 
we pray it may be believed, that in this sentiment our own 
particular interests have but a secondary place, and that 
even the ultimate ingratitude of the people (were that pos 
sible) could not shake the patriotism of those who suffer by 
it. Still, with pleasing wonder and with grateful joy shall 
we contemplate the glorious conclusion of our labors. To 
that merit in the Revolution, which, under the auspices of 
Heaven, the armies have displayed, posterity will do justice ; 
and the sons will blush whose fathers were their foes. Most 
gladly would we cast a veil on every act which sullies the 
reputation of our country. Never should the page of his 
tory be stained with its dishonor ; even from our memories 
should the idea be erased. 

"We lament the opposition to those salutary measures 
which the wisdom of the Union has planned; measures 
which alone can recover and fix on a permanent basis the 
credit of the States ; measures which are essential to the 
justice, the honor, and interest of the nation. While she was 
giving the noblest proofs of magnanimity, with conscious 
pride we saw her growing fame, and, regardless of present 
sufferings, we looked forward to the end of our toils and 
dangers, to brighter scenes in prospect. There we beheld 
the Genius of our country dignified by sovereignty and in 
dependence, supported by justice, and adorned with every 
liberal virtue. There we saw patient Husbandry, fearless, 
extend her cultured fields, and animated Commerce spread 
her sails to every wind. There we beheld fair Science lift 
her head, with all the Arts attending in her train. There, 

VOL. I. 62 



490 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1783. 

blessed with Freedom, we saw the human mind expand ; 
and, throwing aside the restraints which confined it to the 
narrow bounds of country, it embraced the world. Such 
were our fond hopes, and with such delightful prospects 
did they present us. Nor are we disappointed. Those 
animating prospects are now changed and changing to reali 
ties ; and actively to have contributed to their production 
is our pride, our glory. But JUSTICE alone can give them 
stability. In that JUSTICE we still believe. Still we hope 
that the prejudices of the misinformed will be removed, and 
the arts of false and selfish popularity, addressed to the 
feelings of avarice, defeated. Or, in the worst event, the 
world, we hope, will make the just distinction. We trust, 
the disingeuuousness of a few will not sully the reputation, 
the honor, and dignity of the great and respectable majority 
of the States. 

"We are happy in the opportunity just presented of 
congratulating your Excellency on the certain conclusion 
of the definitive treaty of peace. Relieved at length from 
long suspense, our warmest wish is to return to the bosom 
of our country, to resume the character of citizens ; and it 
will be our highest ambition to become useful ones. To 
your Excellency this great event must be peculiarly pleas 
ing ; for, while at the head of her armies, urged by patriot 
virtues and magnanimity, you persevered, under the pressure 
of every possible difficulty and disappointment, in the pur 
suit of the great objects of the war, the freedom and safety 
of your country, your heart panted for the tranquil enjoy 
ments of peace. We cordially rejoice with you that the period 
of indulging them has arrived so soon. In contemplating 
the blessings of liberty and independence, the rich prize 
of eight years hardy adventure, past sufferings* will be 
forgotten ; or, if remembered, the recollection will serve to 
heighten the relish of present happiness. We sincerely 
pray GOD this happiness may long be yours, and that, when 
you quit the stage of human life, you may receive from the

oppressed, of patriotism and disinterested virtue. 

"WEST TOINT, 15th November, 1783." 

Many Whigs in the State of New York, some of them 
members of the legislature, manifested a disposition to 
adopt harsh measures, contrary to the treaty of peace, 
against the Tories who remained in the State after the 
termination of the Revolution ; and Colonel Pickering 
wrote an article, dated in April, 1784, under the sig 
nature " Spectator," addressed to " The Printer of the 
New York Packet," (but whether published or not I do 
not know,) in which he urged a more humane and 
generous course of conduct. He had previously been 
happy to avail himself of an opportunity to exemplify 
his views in the following letter to Mr. Joshua Upham,* 
his classmate and chum at Harvard College, who had 
borne arms on the side of the mother country, and who 
was about to depart from the city of New York with 
the British army. Mr. Upham entertained like liberal 
sentiments. 

" WEST POINT, November 14th, 1783. 

" DEAR SIR, 

" After an absence of so many years and a long contest 
which had continued the separation, when peace returned 
I expected the pleasure of seeing you ; but, the time of 
your departure is so near at hand, an interview will be im 
possible. I beg you therefore to accept this evidence of my 
remembrance of you as a valued acquaintance and friend, 
the impressions of whose worth the prejudices of party have 
not obliterated ; being, dear Sir, with great regard, your 
most obedient servant,

Brunswick.

To this the following answer was returned : 

" NEW YORK, November 18th, 1783. 
"DEAR SlR, 

" I thank you for your obliging letter of the 14th. Since 
the termination of the late unhappy public contest, I have 
ever promised myself the pleasure of meeting you before I 
should leave the country. The time of iny departure is 
now so near that I cannot have that pleasure. This I very 
much regret. Ani exceedingly gratified at the liberality I 
have experienced from the gentlemen of your army. Hope 
their example will soon be followed by my countrymen in 
general. The public quarrel at an end, why should indi 
viduals continue the contest? 

" I leave the country for the winter from pecuniary con 
siderations, not from resentment ; nor am I ashamed to 
confess that I very much regret the separation, though for a 
time only. I need not assure you that I look back to our 
former friendship with much pleasure. It is not possible 
that difference in opinion on national questions could have 
abated private friendships. I hope, at some future period, 
not far distant, to meet you in peace and quiet, and when 
every personal animosity and individual resentment shall be 
forgotten by all parties and descriptions of our countrymen. 
Accept my best wishes for your happiness, and believe me 
to be, dear Sir, most sincerely, your friend and humble 
servant, 

" JOSHUA UPHAM."

CHAPTER XXXY. 

Necessities of the Officers on the Disbanding of the Army. 
Colonel Pickering a Candidate for the Office of Secretary of 
War. He declines being a Candidate for an Office in the 
Treasury Department. Traits in his Character. His Re 
marks on Magistrates in a new Country. Death of his 
Mother. 

THE following letter to Mr. Hodgdon repeats the 
story of the poverty of the public treasury, the neces 
sities of the army officers, and Colonel Pickering s 
sympathy for them : 

"NEWBURGH, January 12th, 1784. 

... "A larger portion than I expected of the money I 
last received has also heen paid to officers in lieu of trans 
porting their baggage. I was prompted by my own feelings, 
and General Knox s very urgent representations, to make 
the gentlemen liberal allowances, as essentially requisite 
to enable them to travel home without begging or extreme 
distress ; they having received no pay these six months, 
nor any subsistence * for the last month." 

General Lincoln, the Secretary of War, having sent 
in his resignation, Congress, on accepting it, voted 
that he should continue to perform the duties of the 
office until the 12th of November, 1783.f Afterwards, 
on the 26th of January, 1784, when the subject of 
a successor was in agitation, Mr. Hodgdon wrote to 
Colonel Pickering, saying that, in a letter to Mr. 

* Money in lieu of rations.

Elb ridge Gerry, he had put the question, " Might not our 
friend Pickering be eligible ? . . . I only suggest it 
for your consideration, as I have never heard him say 
a syllable on the subject." This occasioned a corre 
spondence between Colonel Pickering on the one part 
and Mr. Gerry and General Mifflin on the other. 

To Mr. Gerry Colonel Pickering wrote, under date 
of Philadelphia, February 20th, 1784, as follows: 

" Since my arrival here, Mr. Hodgdon has handed me 
your favor, ... in which you kindly answer his intimation. 
I have hence been led to reflect on the matter, and for many 
reasons cannot but express a wish to obtain the appointment. 
The business of the war office in time of peace will not 
exclude one from an attention to private concerns; and, on 
that principle, I imagined an appointment (if any were 
made) would be fixed. I mean, that, the duties of the office 
being in time of peace greatly circumscribed, a moderate 
salary would be allowed, in expectation that the Secretary 
might engage in private business. On this principle it 
would be agreeable to me ; and, I should suppose, advan 
tageous to the public. With every part of the business of 
the office I have been conversant ; and the office I have last 
held in the army has made me acquainted with every addi 
tional object which can now come under consideration at 
the war office. If any troops are to be kept up, if any estab 
lishments are to be made for frontier posts, the method of 
furnishing and transporting the necessary supplies will be 
familiar to me ; and the management of the whole business 
may be committed to the Secretary at War as the principal 
executive officer for what, during an extensive war, is neces 
sarily distributed into many departments. 

" I might mention some grounds for claiming the office, 
such as, that the appointment of Quartermaster-General was, 
in fact, only a suspension of my seat at the Board [of War] ; 
. . . that, instead of receiving any gratuity at the close of 
my service, my pay was declared to be reduced, from the 



JEx. 38.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 495 

commencement of 1783, to near one half the original ap 
pointment ; and that I never made any claims for half pay 
or commutation, although a very large proportion of officers 
who received it were in service for much shorter periods. 

" I have not a doubt of your friendship in the matter, as 
far as shall consist with the public good and the justice due 
to others. It would give me pain to see the office held as 
a sinecure by a man who did not need or deserve the indul 
gence, but none to find it bestowed on one more deserving 
than myself." 

Mr. Gerry replied, in a letter dated at Annapolis, the 
26th of February, 1784 : 

" I have communicated your letter of the 20th to several 
confidential friends, who assure me of their disposition to 
appoint you to the office therein mentioned. Another gen 
tleman * is nominated, as I am informed, by the General ; 
and I cannot say whether it will produce a competition, or 
what will be the issue thereof. This you may rely on : you 
have a preference in my mind, and will be proposed, unless 
there is the strongest probability of the inefficacy of such a 



To General Mifflin, President of Congress, Colonel 
Pickering wrote, on the 5th of March, 1784, that, tired 
of public offices, it had been his intention, so soon as he 
should have done with the office he then held, to continue 
the rest of his life a private citizen ; but that a sugges 
tion to him, that he might probably obtain the appoint 
ment of Secretary of War, had led to reflections on 
the duties of the office during peace, and his own 
situation and future prospects in private business ; and 

* Probably General Knox. See a letter of March 24th, 1785, from Knox to 
General Washington, in Sparks s " Correspondence of the American Revolu 
tion," Vol. IV. p. 98, and one from Washington to Knox, of June 18th, 1785, 
in Sparks s "Writings of Washington," Vol. IX. p. 108. 



496 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1784. 

neither of the latter appeared such as to relieve him 
from anxiety in regard to the support of his family and 
the education of his children. He was therefore solici 
tous to secure u a certain subsistence " in the War Office. 
He sets out his pretensions to the appointment, and 
says, if he should obtain it, he should consider the 
present office of Quartermaster-General as merged in 
the other, and manage the business of both offices for 
the pay annexed to the office of Secretary of War. 

The election of a Secretary of War, however, was 
postponed until the next year. 

In the beginning of April, 1784, Colonel Pickering 
removed his office from Newburgh to New York, where 
he expected it would continue some months. 

The following correspondence between him and his 
relatives, the Rev. John Clarke and Dr. Joseph Orne, 
exhibits their views of some points in his character, 
and likewise their affectionate regard for him. 

In a letter dated Boston, the 3d of March, 1784, Mr. 
Clarke wrote : 

" I have lost my dear little son. He died of a quinsy. 
My bosom still bleeds : Mrs. Clarke is inconsolable. Time, 
however, will effect the cure, which philosophy and religion 
often attempt in vain. But I need not wound your heart 
with those sorrows which pierce my own. I know the 
strength and ardor of your affection, and that you can 
easily feel for me on this very distressing occasion." 

Colonel Pickering returned the following answer, 
dated New York, the llth of April: 

" It is more than a month since a letter from Mr. Williams 
announced to me the sudden death of your child. Having 
left him in perfect health but a few days before, it was mat 
ter of surprise, as well as grief, to learn that he was no more. 



&T. 38.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 497 

Had I imagined that any topic of consolation could have 
been suggested by me, which had not previously occurred 
to your own mind, I should have written to you without 
delay. But I even doubt the efficacy of any such attempts. 
When the heart is deeply wounded, I believe that time alone 
can heal it. All the efforts of art, I suspect, serve only to 
retard its cure, or make it bleed afresh. My writing now, 
perhaps, will but renew your sorrow. There is, however, 
at some stages of it, a placid grief, which is rather soothing 
than painful. The heart is softened, and conscious tender 
ness gives us pleasure. 

" Some time since I recollect meeting with a volume of 
Sir William Temple s Works, and I chanced to read his letter 
to (I think) the Countess of Essex, on the death of her 
favorite son. I was charmed with it; but my mind, in 
respect to myself, was at ease. No son had been torn from 
me ; and I will not pretend to judge, in such case, what 
must be the feelings of a parent s heart. Yet, if you have 
not read that letter, I would recommend the perusal 
of it." * 

In the same letter he requests Mr. Clarke to send 
him "Dr. Chauncy s work on the duration of future 
punishments, as soon as it arrives from London." 

Mr. Clarke wrote to him again on the 30th of August, 
1 784, as folio ws: 

"I am sorry to hear of the inflammation in your eyes. 
. . . You want them on many accounts. As a merchant, 
you cannot do without them. But, as a passionate admirer 
of female beauty, it would be happy for you if you had the 
hundred eyes of Argus. 

"I am very glad you received the book.j It will afford 
you the highest entertainment when you are able to peruse

498 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1784. 

it. The criticisms are all just. And I think the arguments 
must convince all persons of ingenuity and candor. At 
least, it must excite them to examine the principles of their 
education, and to have abundant charity for persons of a 
different sentiment." 

Dr. Orne, in a letter dated October 10th, 1784, 
says: 

" You are such a Proteus in character, that I do not know 
how to address you. Formerly I could always touch the 
very string I wished, and be in unison with you at a thou 
sand miles distance. Under the -semblance of a Plough- 
jogger, a Military Citizen, or a Lover of Truth,* I could 
always detect and prattle with my honest friend, whom 
the revolutions of time and the casualty of war have now 
removed out of my sight, and, what is worse, beyond my 
knowledge. However, as I always thought your heart as 
immutable as anything human, I will confidently go on as 
usual ; and, notwithstanding the fictitious attributes which 
accidents have thrown round the man, I will appeal plainly 
to that interior spirit, which, I trust, is still simple and un 
changed, as it was always void of decoration. The many 
vibrations you have made (now you must forgive my impu 
dent speculation, but), your vibrations from music through 
law and arms, and thence to trade, make me suspect that 
you are not fixed yet. I do not believe you will die a mer 
chant, for I think that your probity is not of the right sort 
to make you rich, since it is not merely professional and 
accommodating, as it ought to be for that purpose ; and, 
as I firmly believe that you were made to stand at the head 
of one of your various professions, and supposing that the 
pendulum of your vocations has vibrated to one extreme, 
and is now on its return in a contrary direction, so I am 
persuaded that either music or law will bring you up, and 
that you will be for life either a singing-school master or

JET. 39.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 499 

a judge ; but, as singing masters and eunuchs are equal 
objects of my loathing, I cannot abide this as any part of 
the alternative, and my scheme obliges me to place your 
Honor on our Superior Bench, where God grant you may 
long flourish. If you should make one more aberration and 
wander up to the Ohio, won t this be called oscillating in a 
cycloid ? I don t know ; but this is certain, that tis utterly 
beyond my plan, and demolishes more plausible speculations. 
It would, however, be a curious circumstance that a judge 
of the Superior Bench of the sovereign Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts should come within one of being a school 
master ; but not without its parallel, for the learned judge 
Sewall came within half a one ... of being a minister 
at Beverly ; which, in the day of it, of all human degradations 
on the clerical scale, would have been the vilest." 

Congress having determined to put the treasury in 
commission, Dr. Holten, a member from Massachusetts, 
in a letter dated at Trenton, the 4th of December, 1784, 
inquired of Colonel Pickering whether it would be 
agreeable to him to be appointed one of the com 
missioners. In his answer, dated at Philadelphia, the 
7th of December, Colonel Pickering desired to be made 
acquainted with the plan on which the Board was to 
be constituted before giving a decisive answer. He 
observed : 

" The duties of the Board may require other abilities than 
I possess, or may be incompatible with my present views 
and situation. You will permit me, Sir, to observe, that, 
after devoting my whole mature life to the public to my 
fortieth year, I deem it my duty to aim at some provision 
for my family when I leave it. I am attempting something 
in the commercial line ; but I confess my prospects are not 
very flattering. I should, therefore, more readily listen to 
overtures for a public employment. But in this case the 
necessary style of living might consume at least my whole 



500 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1784. 

salary. At the same time you will readily believe that my 
desires are confined within bounds of moderation. 

" At present there remain various services to be performed 
in the Quartermaster s department, which require some 
knowledge of the office ; besides adjusting a multitude of 
outstanding debts. So long also as any troops are kept up, 
such services will be called for. To have them performed as 
to the directory part, without any expense to the public, I 
once proposed to the late President of Congress [Mifflin], 
that during peace the office of Quartermaster-General should 
be annexed to that of Secretary at War. At the same time, 
the duties of both offices were so familiar to me, I thought 
it would not be deemed officious that I offered myself as a 
candidate for that of Secretary at War, with the Quarter 
master s duties annexed. This office would be perfectly 
agreeable to me. It would afford me leisure to settle all 
accounts and demands in the Quartermaster s department, 
and not absolutely exclude me from paying some attention 
to private business when it fell in my way. I am led to 
mention private business because I imagine the salary to be 
annexed to the office will not be considerable enough to 
maintain even me, with decency, in this expensive place, 
without the aid of private business." 

On the llth of December, Dr. Holten replied, saying, 
that the powers of the Board were the same as those of 
the late Financier, but that the subject of alterations 
was before a committee of Congress. He added : 

" There is to be a Secretary at War appointed, and some 
of your friends here wish you to be in this department, and 
some, in the other. As to myself, I wish you to have that 
place which is most agreeable to you, knowing that the -place 
you accept will be well filled. However, I have nominated 
you to the Board of Treasury, as I think it is not likely the 
two offices you mentioned will be joined, and I consider the 
Board of Treasury as being likely to be most profitable." 



JST. 39.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 501 

Colonel Pickering wrote a second letter to Dr. Hoi- 
ten, dated at Philadelphia, the 26th of January, 1785, 
respecting the office of Commissioner of the Treasury, 
saying : 

" I learnt from your answer [to the first letter] , that the 
powers of the Board had not been defined. One, term will 
probably be an abjuration of all private business. Of this I 
was apprehensive j and Mr. Gerry s information confirms it. 
But divers other reasons . . . had determined me to decline 
the office before I conversed with Mr. Gerry concerning it. 
I find also, by him, that the candidates are numerous ; 
and I should be sorry to stand in the way of gentlemen 
better qualified for the station. ... I am highly obliged 
by your attention to me, and beg your acceptance of my 
sincere thanks ; but I also request you to withdraw your 
nomination of me to the office in question. 

" There is another office to which I should have no objec- / 
tion, that of Secretary at War. To this perhaps I have 
some pretensions, and this I should gratefully accept. . . . 
But even for this office I am not so solicitous but that I shall 
cheerfully acquiesce in the appointment of some other per 
son, whose abilities and disposition will enable him to render 
to the public more valuable services than I can presume to 
promise." 

On the 8th of March, 1785, General Knox was chosen 
Secretary of War. On this subject General Gates wrote, 
on the 18th of May, 1785, to Colonel Pickering, "I 
most sincerely wished you to succeed to the War Office ; 
but you have been an honest Quartermaster-General, 
and, of course, deserve to starve." General Knox, how 
ever, for his important services in the Revolution, was 
equally entitled to the favorable regard of Congress. 

An officer in the Quartermaster-General s depart 
ment, of whom Colonel Pickering entertained a very 



502 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1785. 

favorable opinion, was Major Thomas Cogswell, Wagon- 
master-General : Colonel Pickering wrote to him on the 
14th of January, 1784:- 

" The great object of our warfare being accomplished, the 
army disbanded, and your services as Wagon-master-General 
to cease to-morrow, be pleased to accept my sincere thanks 
for the judicious and effectual assistance you have given at 
all times in the execution of your office, and your readiness 
to lend your aid in any services of my department. I wish 
you every success in your future life, and remain, with 
much esteem, dear Sir, your friend," &c. 

It appears that Major Cogswell, having a tender of 
the offices of a judge and a justice of the peace in " a 
new country," manifested his confidence in Colonel 
Pickering by consulting him on the expediency of 
accepting them, and that Colonel Pickering gave him 
his views on the subject in a letter dated at Philadel 
phia, the 1st of February, 1785, as follows: 

" You ask my advice about a matter of which you, from a 
knowledge of circumstances, can form the best judgment. 
In new countries, as well as old ones, magistrates are neces 
sary. A knowledge of the law is doubtless requisite to 
enable a gentleman to act as a judge or justice most accepta 
bly to his fellow-citizens and to his own satisfaction. But 
in a new country an extensive or accurate knowledge of the 
law is not looked for ; there is no object to induce gentle 
men to acquire that knowledge. All therefore which can be 
expected is, that government will put in commission men of 
integrity and of good understanding. The latter I am sure 
you possess, and of the former your own consciousness will 
determine. Were I on the spot, I am pretty certain that 
I should advise you to accept of both offices. As you 
are disposed to read, you will very soon acquire more law 
knowledge than most of your brethren in office possess. 



JET. 39.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 503 

Purchase immediately Blackstone s "Commentaries on the 
Laws of England," Burn s "Justice of the Peace," and your 
own State laws. 

... " But, however important is the knowledge of the 
law to a justice of the peace, there is one quality which I 
deem much more important, especially in the country ; that 
is, a benevolent disposition, which shall induce him to com 
pose differences among his neighbors, and discourage their 
going to law one with another. Such a magistrate is an 
honor and a blessing to his country ; but a pragmatical fel 
low, who, like a pettifogging lawyer, encourages strifes 
among his neighbors, is one of the greatest mischiefs a 
country can be cursed with. I need not say you have a 
mind superior to such conduct. But the former character 
you will certainly aspire after : for that you will be held in 
honor; for that you will be revered as a magistrate, and be 
loved as a father." 

Colonel Pickering s brother having written a letter 
informing him that their mother died on the 12th of 
December, 1784, intestate, and offering to pay him a 
small sum for his share of her effects if he consented, 
but, if not, asking what he would have done with the 
property, he replied, February 5th, 1785: 

"An aged person, with her infirmities, could not wish a 
continuance of life ; and, when an aged Christian dies, the 
relatives cannot mourn. I am happy that my other relatives 
are well ; especially that you are much better than you were 
last winter. . . . You need not have doubted my being 
perfectly satisfied with your allowance . . . for my share 
in our mother s effects. 1 know you are inviolably just, 
and am therefore always content with your determinations 
on our connected interests ; and I trust we are both of so 
accommodating dispositions, that an umpire between us will 
never be called for."

THE subject of disposing of the territory ceded by 
individual States to the United States being before 
Congress, then sitting at New York, Colonel Pickering 
wrote to Mr. Elbridge Gerry, a member from Massa 
chusetts, as follows : 

" PHILADELPHIA, March 1st, 1785. 

" As you have expressed your wishes to be concerned in 
the purchase of lands on the other side of the Alleghany 
Mountains, through our agency, we think it very material 
to your interest as well as our own, that we be informed, 
if possible, what plan Congress will probably adopt in dis 
posing of those lands which lie north-west of the Ohio. If 
they mean to permit adventurers to make a scramble for 
them (as has been the case in this State and Virginia), it 
will behoove us to engage seasonably with some enterprising 
but confidential character, to explore the country and make 
locations. But I should rather suppose Congress would fall 
on a more regular plan, as that of surveying a district or 
districts for a State or States, dividing the same into coun 
ties and townships, and then selling these townships at public 



JEx. 39.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 505 

auction ; the surveyors to be ordered to add to their surveys 
such explanations as would enable purchasers to judge of the 
value of the lands. The officers and soldiers of those States 
which have made no provision of lands for their troops, may 
perhaps have their district alike surveyed, and their several 
portions assigned to them by lot. I am aware these surveys 
would be expensive ; but this is an expense which must inevi 
tably be borne, in whatever way the locations and divisions 
shall be made. If the surveys be made, as above proposed, by 
persons appointed by Congress, the expenses may neverthe 
less be charged to the purchasers or assignees, who are now 
obliged to bear the like expenses of locations, surveys, and 
patents in this State and Virginia. In this way the settle 
ment of that country may be effected with regularity and 
with much more safety than in the desultory way practised 
in the States before mentioned, and with much greater 
advantage to the United States. If but a single State be 
sold on the other side of the Ohio, settlers will flock thither 
immediately. As soon as more lands shall be wanted, 
another adjoining State, surveyed into townships as before 
(and these townships, too, should be divided into lots), 
may be set up for sale ; and so in succession as lands are in 
demand. 

" All subsequent sales, in this way, would probably be 
increasing in their amount in proportion to the increase of 
settlers in the adjoining State or States. But, if adven 
turers should be permitted to ramble over that extensive 
country, and take up all the most valuable tracts, the best 
lands would be in a manner given away ; and the settlers 
thus -dispersed it will be impossible to govern : they will 
soon excite the resentments of the natives, and bring on an 
Indian war, to the destruction of multitudes of the settlers, 
and to the injury of the public. 

"The ideas here suggested, I am sensible, are rather 
foreign to the interest of persons who would speculate in 
those lands ; but they appear to me adapted to promote the 
public interest, and therefore I shall be pleased if a plan 

VOL. I. 64 



506 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1785. 

of the kind proposed be pursued. But if there must be a 
scramble, we have an equal right with others ; and therefore 
the information desired in the beginning of this letter may 
be of essential importance. How soon do you expect to go 
to the eastward ? 

" Your answer to this letter will very much oblige your 
sincere friends, who wish to advance your interest with 
their own." 

Mr. Gerry enclosed to Colonel Pickering a draught 
of the ordinance* for disposing of the lands in the 
western territory, and, being about to return home, 
requested him to communicate his views to Mr. Rufus 
King, then a member of Congress from Massachusetts, 
to whom Mr. Gerry handed Colonel Pickering s letter. 
In consequence, Colonel Pickering wrote at much 
length to Mr. King, under date of March 8th, 1785, 
commenting on the proposed ordinance. He says: 

" The first paragraph orders the manner of dividing each 
new State [into hundreds] ; but it seems to me it will be 
found impracticable. Each hundred is to be ten miles 
square, and each mile to consist of six thousand and eighty- 
six feet. Yet the lines making the eastern and western 
boundaries are to be true meridian lines ; but meridian lines 
converge as you increase the latitude, and to such a degree, 
that, if you take any meridian, say at the thirty-ninth de 
gree of latitude, and on that parallel set off ten geographi 
cal miles (equal to sixty thousand eight hundred and sixty 
feet) from such meridian, and then proceed northward to 
the forty-first degree of latitude, and there from the same 
meridian set off the like number of ten geographical miles, 
their extremity will be about eighteen hundred feet beyond 
the meridian of the like extremity at the parallel of thirty-

^ET. 39.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 507 

actual surveys may not be expected ; but a difference of six 
hundred yards in ten miles must surely produce material 
errors." 

This objection was disregarded by Congress ; for, by 
the ordinance of May 20th, 1785, it was determined 
that the territory should be divided into townships of 
six miles square, "by lines running due north and south, 
and others crossing these at right angles, as near as may 
be, unless," &c. The Act of Congress of the 10th of 
May, 1800, obviates the difficulty by providing for a 
survey of fractional sections. 

Colonel Pickering offered some verbal amendments 
of the ordinance reported, and made several sugges 
tions respecting the survey and sale of the lands. He 
observed, that, if they should be sold by auction, the 
United States, to prevent their selling too low, might 
bid once on every sale ; or might fix a minimum price 
per acre. He repeated his proposition, that the lands 
in one State should be first sold, and then, as a de 
mand arose, those in another, and so on in succession. 
Although there were difficulties in the mode of sale 
suggested by him, he thought it would be more advan 
tageous to the treasury, and cause extensive settle 
ments to be made sooner, than if all the best lands 
were suffered to be picked up at a limited price all over 
that vast country, as they might be, on the plan proposed 
in the ordinance ; at least so far as the purchase from 
the Indians extended. He put the question, whether, 
instead of leaving each register to devise distinguishing 
marks for his land-warrants, as proposed, it would not 
be best, as a guard against counterfeits, to have the 
same devices for the whole ; and, in illustration, he 
added, " The Paymaster-General, in issuing his notes, 
intended, by having the blanks filled up by different 



508 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1785. 

hands, to guard against forgeries ; but in the event it 
facilitated the practice of counterfeiting." He intimat 
ed that it might be expedient for Congress to reserve 
salt-licks and salt-springs, with lots around them well 
wooded, for the supply of fuel for salt-works which 
might be erected ; and to make proper regulations 
respecting them, in order to prevent their falling into 
the hands of persons who might neither manufacture 
salt themselves nor suffer others to do so, or of persons 
who would extort from the settlers exorbitant prices 
for an article so indispensable : and he said that 
perhaps coal and lead mines might deserve a like 
consideration. 

He remarked farther : 

" Water communication in that country will always be in 
the highest degree interesting to the inhabitants. It seems 
very necessary to secure the freedom of navigating the rivers 
to all the inhabitants of all the States. I hope we shall have 
\^\ O-^ 110 $c/ie?e?fe in that country. To obviate this difficulty in 
part, a division of it into States by natural boundaries has 
been thought of; but this will make some of the States too 
large, and in many of them throw the extremes at such 
unequal distances from the centres of the governments as 
must prove extremely inconvenient. Whether the divis 
ions agreed to by Congress the 23d of April last be the best 
possible, seems doubtful. They are certainly very unequal." 

Since that day they have been much altered. The 
letter concludes thus : * 

" There is one article in the report of the committee on 
which that act was made, which I am extremely sorry to 
see was omitted in the act. The committee proposed, that 
after the year 1800 there should be no slavery in the new 
States. I hardly have patience to write on a subject in 
which what is right is so obvious and so just, and what is 



JET. 39.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 509 

wrong is so derogatory to Americans above all men, so 
inhuman and iniquitous in itself. But I have no time to 
proceed without hazarding the loss of a conveyance by this 
post. I may use the freedom of another letter by the next, 
if time will permit." 

Accordingly, in another letter of the same date, he 
resumed the subject. In this he states, that the holders 
of Virginia land-warrants, who did not go in person to 
make locations, had been obliged to give to adventurers, 
who undertook to explore the country and make loca 
tions for them, one quarter, one third, or perhaps more 
generally one half, of the lands, for their trouble, and 
had been exposed to impositions ; that, on his plan, 
these exorbitant allowances will be done away with, 
and, every acre expressed in a warrant being secured 
to the purchaser, he will be disposed (as he can well 
afford) to give, on an average, one third more than 
if the locations were made in the other way ; and 
that Congress may require the purchaser to pay fees 
at such rates as will eventually reimburse to the United 
States all the expenses of the surveys and sales. 

He says further : 

" In looking over the Act of Congress of the 23d of April 
last, and the present report of an ordinance, relative to these 
lands, I observe there is no provision made for ministers of 
the gospel, nor even for schools and academies. The latter 
might have been brought into view ; though, after the admis 
sion of Slavery, it was right to say nothing of Christianity. 
Yet so glaring an inconsistency would not have occasioned 
much surprise. It is easy to be inconsistent. Congress 
once made this important declaration, * that all men are 
created equal ; that they are endowed by their Creator with 
certain unalieuable rights ; that among these are life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of happiness ; and these truths were held 



510 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1785. 

to be self-evident. These great truths were echoed through 
the United States. Nevertheless, a proposition for prevent 
ing a violation of these truths in a country yet unsettled, 
and from which such violation might easily have been ex 
cluded, did not obtain ! What pretence (argument there 
could be none) could be offered for its rejection? I should, 
indeed, have objected to the period proposed (the year 1800) 
for the exclusion of slavery ; for the admission of it for a 
day or an hour ought to have been forbidden. It will be 
infinitely easier to prevent the evil at first, than to eradicate 
or check it in any future time. How would Congress wish 
the new States to be settled ? By slaves or by freemen ? 
Take any given period, say fifty years : Will those States, 
in that time, have more acres of improved lands by the 
admission than by the exclusion of slaves ? In respect to 
population and improvement, compare Pennsylvania with 
Maryland and Virginia, particularly the latter. The con 
clusion is obvious. But why do I expostulate with you, 
who already see all the reasons on this subject in points of 
view more striking than I can place them? Forgive me 
if my solicitude to prevent the greatest of evils has ren 
dered me prolix. To suffer the continuance of slaves till 
they can gradually be emancipated, in States already over 
run with them, may be pardonable, because unavoidable 
without hazarding greater evils ; but to introduce them into 
countries where none now exist countries which have been 
talked of, which we have boasted of, as asylums to the 
oppressed of the earth can never be forgiven. For God s 
sake, then, let one more effort be made to prevent so terrible 
a calamity. The fundamental constitutions for those States 
are yet liable to alterations, and this is probably the only 
time when the evil can certainly be prevented. . . . 

" I hope, Sir, you will find no cause to regret the trouble 
of reading my three long letters. The subject is of the 
first importance ; and the hints I have thrown out, I flatter 
myself, will not be deemed uninteresting." 

To these letters Mr. King replied : 



JET. 39.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 511 

"NEW YORK, 15th April, 1785. 

"The best return in my power to make you for your 
ingenious communications on the mode of disposing of the 
western territory, is, to enclose for your examination the 
form of an ordinance reported to Congress on the subject.* 
You will find thereby, that your ideas have had weight with 
the committee who reported this ordinance ; and I have only 
to add, that I shall hold myself particularly obliged by your 
further communications on this subject. 

" I likewise enclose you the report of a committee on a 
motion for the exclusion of slavery from the new States. 
Your ideas on this unjustifiable practice are so just, that it 
would be impossible to differ from them." 

On the 19th of April, 1785, Colonel Pickering wrote 
to Mr. Hodgdon on the same subject, as follows : 

" Mr. King has sent me the last report [in Congress] 
about the western territory. I see a great and general con 
formity to my ideas suggested to him. I am still confident 
that plan is the most eligible for the public interest ; and, 
if it be thrown aside, I should believe it to be done to give 
an opportunity for speculators (or rather land-jobbers) to 
make immense fortunes at the public expense." 

Colonel William Grayson, of Virginia, wrote a letter 
to Colonel Pickering, dated New York, April 27th, 
1785, making a little addition to the history of the 
western territory, and showing a warm friendship for 
Colonel Pickering. He says : 

" Since my arrival I have been busily engaged in assisting 
about framing an ordinance for the disposal of the western 
territory. I think there has been as much said and wrote 
about it as would fill forty volumes ; and yet we seem far 

* Reported on the 14th of April by a committee of which Mr. King and 
Colonel Grayson were members. 



512 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1785. 

from a conclusion : so difficult is it to form any system 
which will suit our complex government, and where the 
interests of the component parts are supposed to be so 
different. I made a motion . . . three days ago, which has 
nearly divided the Continent [meaning Congress] into equal 
moieties : the object of it was to double the quantity of 
surveying, and to sell the lands in townships and sections 
alternately.* This I did under the impression that it would 
accommodate both the Eastern and Southern States. How 
ever, this has been strongly objected to, and both sides 
adhere to their opinions ; so that here we stick, without any 
movement either retrograde or progressive. I enclose you 
the draught of the ordinance as it stands, which you will 
be kind enough to keep in your hands in such a manner as 
to prevent it from being published, this being against rule. 
1 believe it will pass ultimately in a shape very like this. 
At least, none of the great principles, except, perhaps, the 
one alluded to, will be changed. By it you will observe, 
that there is no office created by it worth your acceptance. 
If, in the arrangement of the Post-Office, or any other 
matter, anything occurs which may be worth your notice, 
I will do myself the pleasure of informing you of it ; and 
I can assure you, with great truth, it will give me real sat 
isfaction to clo everything in my power towards accomplish 
ing any object which you may have in view. 

"I am, with my compliments to the family, your affec 
tionate friend," &c. 

The ordinance reported was adopted by Congress May 
20th, 1785, modified, however, in the details; and altera 
tions were subsequently made, April 21st, 1787, and July 
9th, 1788. The ordinance of the 20th of May was silent 
on the subject of slavery; but, on the 16th of March 
preceding, Mr. King offered a proposition, that there 

* This motion does not appear in the Journals of Congress ; but a motion 
for the sale of the lands in the way suggested was afterwards made by Mr. 
McHenry, and adopted. See the Journals for May 4th, 5th, and 20th, 1785. 



MT. 39.] LITE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 513 

should be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in 
any of the States to be formed out of the territory above 
mentioned, otherwise than in punishment for crimes ; 
;; and that this regulation should be an article of com 
pact, and remain a fundamental principle of the consti 
tutions between " each of those States and the thirteen 
original States. It was voted that this proposition be 
committed ; but I find no further notice of it until it 
makes its appearance in the celebrated ordinance of 
July 13th, 1787, "for the government of the territory 
of the United States north-west of the River Ohio." * 

One section, numbered 16, in each township, was 
reserved for the maintenance of public schools; and this 
example has been followed generally, since the adop 
tion of the Federal Constitution, in the disposition of 
public lands, but no section has been reserved for re 
ligious or charitable uses. Salt-springs, with adjoining 
lands for the manufacture of salt, have sometimes been 
reserved from the general sales, subject to future dis 
position by Congress. 

In 1785 Colonel Pickering was elected a member 
and Secretary of the Philadelphia Society for promoting 
Agriculture. In a letter, dated Philadelphia, April 
20th, to his brother, he says : 

"The founders are among the principal characters here. 
. . . The society, without my knowledge, elected me their 
secretary. On account of my business I wished to be 
excused ; but they were urgent, and, as the chief of the 
writing (arising at its establishment) was already done, and 
the election was but for one year, I acquiesced. There may 
be honorary members residing in other States. If you 
have no objection, I will nominate you. . . . The society

wish to promote a general attention to the subject of agri 
culture, and hope their institution will give rise to a similar 
one in each State." 

An appointment of much importance to the public 
was proposed to Colonel Pickering in the following 
letter from Mr. Rufus King : 

"NEW YORK, May 8th, 1785. 

" When Congress accepted the cession of western terri 
tory from Virginia, they engaged to reimburse Virginia the 
amount of her expenses in protecting the lands ceded during 
the late war.* A commissioner is to be appointed by Con 
gress, another by Virginia, and a third by the two first, 
who, or a major part of whom, are to ascertain the sums to 
be reimbursed as aforesaid. If your engagements are such 
as would permit your acceptance of the appointment under 
Congress, it would give great satisfaction to a number of 
your friends, and remove an apprehension that at present 
obtains, that the United States are in danger of being charged 
with a very enormous sum to defray the expenses of Gen 
eral Clark s expedition to the Kaskaskies. 

" It may require three months or more to execute the 
business. The salary is at the rate of fifteen hundred dol 
lars the year, and authority [is given] to employ as many 
clerks as may be necessary at five hundred dollars the year. 
The pecuniary consideration, I am sensible, cannot be an 
inducement ; but the opportunity of essentially serving the 
United States will be a powerful motive. If you can con 
sistently accept this appointment, I should thank you to [let 
me] know it. I think Congress will know the interest of 
their constituents too well not to elect you if you can serve. 

"The lands ordinance is not yet through. We have 
been obliged so far to give up the plan of townships as to 
admit the sale of one half of the townships in lots of a mile 
square. 

* See Journals of Congress for October 10th, 1780, and April 13th, 1785. 



-^T. 39.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 515 

" I will enclose you the ordinance so soon as it passes ; 
which I hope will be the case in two or three days." 

In answer. Colonel Pickering wrote, May 12th, that 
his engagements were incompatible with the service in 
question. Congress subsequently appointed General 
Samuel H. Parsons, and Virginia, Colonel Edward Car- 
rington, their respective commissioners, and these two 
made choice of Colonel Pickering for the third ; but 
he wrote, on the 23d of September, to General Par 
sons : 

" To ascertain the sum due to Virginia for defending the 
western territory is of great moment to the United States, 
her demands being very great. It would, Sir, give me great 
pleasure to join you and Colonel Carrington in executing 
this business of your commission ; and I am sorry to decline 
it, because it will occasion delay : but it would so materially 
interfere with my own engagements, particularly in settling 
the accounts of my late department, that I cannot accept the 
appointment with which you have proposed to honor me." 

Colonel Carrington, having resigned, was succeeded 
by Colonel William Heth, of Virginia, who, on the 13th 
of February, 1786, wrote to Colonel Pickering as fol 
lows (after alluding to General Parsons) : 

"It is our mutual wish to appoint you the third com 
missioner, and, if you can be prevailed on to join us, I shall 
engage in the business with much more satisfaction than I 
can at present promise myself; but, that you may see my 
sentiments in full on this head, and that you may judge of 
the kind of men with whom I wish to be concerned, I have 
handed you the enclosed [letter to General Parsons] with a 
flying seal. I will therefore only add, that I feel a pleasure 
in thus having an opportunity of assuring you that I am, 
dear Sir, with much aifection and esteem, your friend," &c. 



516 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1785. 

Eeferring to Colonel Heth s proposal, General Par 
sons wrote, " To this I do most cordially agree, if you 
can consent to afford your assistance." 

These urgent letters being unavailing, Colonel Car- 
rington, then a member of Congress, wrote to Colonel 
Pickering, April 16th, 1786, as follows: 

"In consequence of a request of Colonel Heth, my suc 
cessor in the commission for western accounts, and with the 
consent of General Parsons, who is now here, I again try 
you upon the point of acting as a third person in that busi 
ness. I am well assured that, upon the allowance hitherto 
held out by Congress, it could not be expected that any 
gentleman could afford to go from home upon it; but if you 
will go, provided an adequate allowance can be obtained, 
Congress must again be tried thereupon. Be good enough 
to write by the next post how far you may possibly be 
brought into the measure, that I may judge whether it will 
be worth while to make a trial ; in which communication, I 
assure you, I will not conceive you in any terms to have so 
committed yourself as to be under an obligation to accept 
after the allowance is fixed upon." 

Colonel Pickering persisted in declining the appoint 
ment. 

He received a letter from Mr. King, dated New York, 
May 30th, 1785, stating that the question of abolishing 
the department of Quartermaster-General was before 
a committee of Congress, and inquiring what, if any, 
advantage would arise from keeping the department in 
existence. In the same letter Mr. King says : 

" I transmit you a copy of the land ordinance as it finally 
passed. All parties who have advocated particular modes 
of disposing of this western territory have relinquished 
some things they wished, and the ordinance is a compromise 
of opinions." 



MT. 39.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 517 

Colonel Pickering wrote on the 1st of June to Mr. 
King: 

"In respect to the Quartermaster s department, I reply, 
that as soon as other provision shall be made for performing 
the few occasional duties required of it, it may be abolished. 
More than a year ago I proposed to some gentlemen that 
those duties should be given in charge to the Secretary at 
War. He may need an agent or agents, according to cir 
cumstances, to execute his orders. . . . 

" You favored me with a draught of your motion for the 
exclusion of slavery on the other side of the Ohio. Did it 
prevail, or was avarice powerful enough to reject it?" 

The office of Quartermaster-General was abolished 
on the 25th of July, 1785, Colonel Pickering having 
continued to hold it until that time. 

In the "Life of General Greene," edited by Mr. 
Simms, afte% a statement that Greene had placed the 
Quartermaster-General s department " in very good con 
dition, all things considered," it is remarked : 

" His successor, though of unquestionable ability and in 
tegrity, was not so fortunate. The department suffered in 
his hands, and six months experiments were sufficient to 
satisfy the worst enemies of Greene, as well as his best 
friends, how much injury had been done to the country by 
the captious and cruel interference which had driven him 
from duties he was so peculiarly calculated to fulfil.* 

Specific instances of short-coming on the part of 
Colonel Pickering are not pointed out in that volume, 
and I am not aware of the grounds on which his 
administration of the department is justly a subject 
of disparagement. Towards the close of the war (in 

* See " The Life of Nathanael Greene," edited by W. Gilraore Simms, 
p. 89. 



518 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1784. 

December, 1782), as before mentioned,* the want of 
forage was complained of; but, in 1780, when General 
Greene was Quartermaster-General, there was a like 
deficiency : concerning which Marshall says, " The sup 
plies for the forage department had failed ; and a great 
proportion of the public horses had perished or been 
rendered unfit for use." f General Greene and Colo 
nel Pickering have each the same justification for such 
a condition of affairs, namely, that he was not furnished 
by the government with the money required to pur 
chase the necessary supplies. Under Colonel Pickering 
the scarcity of supplies would have been still greater 
than it was, had not Congress, at his suggestion and 
solicitation, enacted that the payments and the prom 
ises in his department should be made on a specie 
standard by means of his " specie certificates." 

Ifi however, it be true that " the department suffered 
in his hands" (which is by no means conceded), let it 
be remembered, that General Greene relinquished it 
because, in his opinion, the performance of the duties, 
under the new arrangement, was a " physical impossi 
bility ; " J that Colonel Pickering, nevertheless, under 
took the management of the department, and, with slight 
variations in the compensation of his assistants, carried 
it into effect ; that he was appointed " in the most crit 
ical and interesting season of the campaign," and when 
the public treasury was empty ; that the memorable 
inarch of the army, and the transportation of artillery 
and stores from the State of New York to Virginia, for 
the siege of Yorktown and capture of Cornwallis, was

successfully effected under his direction ; and that he 
was continued in the office of Quartermaster-General 
until long after the war of the Revolution was brought 
to a close. It is not to be doubted that Greene would 
have conducted the department under the new arrange 
ment as well as any man could have done ; how much 
better than Colonel Pickering, must be a matter of 
opinion. With respect to the latter, I rest satisfied 
with the following remarks of Chief Justice Marshall. 
The last clause of the quotation is applicable equally 
to Colonel Pickering and to his predecessor. 

"Colonel Pickering, who succeeded General Greene, pos 
sessed in an eminent degree those qualities which fitted him 
to combat and subdue the difficulties of his department. To 
great energy of mind and body he added a long experience 
in the affairs of the Continent, with an ardent zeal for its 
interests ; and General Greene himself, and some of the 
former officers, at the request of the Commander-in-Chief, 
continued, for some time after their resignation, to render 
all the services in their power ; but there was an absolute 
defect of means, for which neither talents nor exertions 
could compensate." * 

Perhaps no one estimated Greene s talents more 
highly than Colonel Pickering. He regarded him as 
a sagacious statesman, and as the ablest general in the 
American Revolution. 

As to the supposed injury to the United States 
occasioned by the change in the head of the Quarter 
master s department, it is well known, and the fact is 
shown by the volume edited by Mr. Simms, that it was 
more than counterbalanced by Greene s eminent services 
in the Southern States; services, too, which probably no 
other man in the country was competent to render.

CHAPTER XXXVII. 

Colonel Pickering desires to be appointed Treasurer of the United 
gtates. Declines being a Commissioner to treat with the In 
dians. Is a Member of the Society of the Cincinnati. His 
Remarks on the Constitution of Phillips Academy at Andover, 
and on Education. Noah Webster s Spelling-Book and Gram 
mar. Webster s Ingenuity, Learning, and Vanity. Plan of 
Colonel Pickering for the Education of Boys ; also for a Farm- 
School for Boys and Girls. He would have the Poor taught 
gratis. He purposes returning to Salem on a certain Event. 

UPON information that Mr. Hillegas, the Treasurer 
of the United States, intended to resign, Colonel Pick 
ering wrote to Mr. King, from Philadelphia, the 9th 
of June, 1785:- 

"If such vacancy happen, I shall then be willing to stand 
a candidate to supply it, if there be a prospect of obtaining 
an election. But for this I do not mean to become a soli 
citor. If there be several candidates, let him who is equal 
to the duties of the office, and at the same time most deserv 
ing of the confidence of his country, be elected." 

Mr. King, in his answer, dated the 17th of June, 

says : 

" I do assure you that my duty could not be more faith 
fully discharged in the appointment of a successor to Mr. 
Hillegas than by aiding your election." 

On the 16th of June Colonel Pickering wrote, on 
the same subject, to Mr. Samuel Osgood, saying : 

" I have since considered of the connection that will sub 
sist between the Treasury Board and the Treasurer; and 



MT. 39.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 521 

that you, as a member of that Board, would naturally wish 
for a Treasurer whom, while your judgment should approve, 
your friendship might embrace. If I have an interest in 
either, you will excuse the trouble of this letter. Its sole 
object is to authorize you to say I will serve, if elected : 
though this you will not say, unless you deem the public 
good connected with the appointment." 

On the 19th, after the receipt of Mr. King s letter 
of the 17th, he wrote to him : 

" I beg leave to enclose a copy [of the letter to Mr. Os- 
good] , in which you will see my motive for addressing him. 
The extent of the motive is, perhaps, not quite obvious. In 
directing the finances of these States, there will occur many 
points of equal difficulty and importance to resolve. Diffi 
culties may arise particularly from the oppositions of inter 
ests of different States. In all cases of difficult determination, 
it was ever a relief to me if I could previously discuss the 
subjects with a confidential friend. If this friend were wiser 
than myself, so much the better ; if otherwise, yet the mere 
act of putting questions, if answered only by monos}dlables, 
would tend to elucidate the subject. If I do not deceive 
myself, Mr. Osgood would repose a confidence in me as a 
friend, and, besides the common acts of society, would, in 
the view above suggested, derive some satisfaction from my 
appointment. This explanation could not have been given 
in my letter to Mr. Osgood ; and to you I make it in perfect 
confidence. For, while those who know me would know 
that it proceeded from a different source, yet others might 
place it to the account of vanity. We often form the truest 
judgments by changing situations. Were Mr. Osgood s 
and mine reversed, with eagerness I should seize the occa 
sion which would give me a friend like him." 



Mr. Osgood, writing to Colonel Pickering on the 
26th of June, says: 
VOL. i. 66 



522 LirE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1785. 

Should a new choice take place, it would give me the 
sincerest pleasure if the appointment should fall upon you. 
Your past faithful services entitle you to much more than 
this appointment." 

The expected vacancy in the office, however, did 
not take place. 

Mr. Wolcott having resigned his place as one of 
the commissioners for holding treaties with the Indians, 
Colonel Pickering, in July, was nominated in Congress 
to succeed him ; but he declined being a candidate for 
the office. 

The Society of the Cincinnati, formed by officers of 
the army on the termination of the war, was organized 
on the 13th of May, 1783. The mode by which it was 
to be perpetuated occasioned much clamor. On the 
decease of a member, he was to be succeeded by his 
eldest male descendant, or, in failure of such descend 
ant, by a collateral relative who might be judged worthy 
of becoming a member of the Society. From this it 
was apprehended that the institution was creating an 
incipient order of hereditary nobility. Colonel Pick 
ering did not regard it as threatening danger to the 
community ; but he became a member with some reluc 
tance on account of its insignificance compared with 
its lofty pretensions. One of the original articles of its 
constitution proposed "an incessant attention to pre 
serve inviolate those exalted rights and liberties of 
human nature, for which they have fought and bled, 
and without which the high rank of a rational being 
is a curse instead of a blessing." At the first general 
meeting in Philadelphia, in May, 1784, a more modest 
constitution was drawn up, and was recommended to 
the State branches for adoption, in which the heredi 
tary provision was omitted j and thereupon the public 



MT. 39.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 523 

dissatisfaction gradually subsided ; * but a majority of 
the State branches did not agree to this change in the 
mode of admitting new members.^ The Society has, 
nevertheless, proved harmless, showing that the outcry 
against it might well have been spared ; and the benev 
olent distribution of its income among indigent officers 
and their families has been extremely useful. Colonel 
Pickering had many pleasant interviews with his friends 
at the annual meetings, in Boston, of the Massachusetts 
branch of the society. His diploma bears the date of 
October 31st, 1785; but the following remarks, made by 
him in 1823, in reference to a passage in Johnson s 
"Life of General Greene," J indicate that he became 
a member of the Society at the time when it was 

organized. 



" This institution is here noticed, and the idle alarm it 
created through the United States. I presume it origi 
nated with Knox, and that the draught of the project was 
his. It bore the marks of his pomposity, and assumed an 
importance &lt;fo preserve the rights and liberties of human 
nature corresponding with his disposition. 

" Nothing could more surprise me than the general alarm 
to which it gave rise ; for I felt a solid objection to subscribe 
to the institution, because it assumed so much importance, 
when I saw it was really so insignificant. That a small 
number of officers, who, compared with the great body of 
their republican fellow-citizens, were but as a drop in the 
bucket, should arrogate to themselves the sublime duty of 
preserving the rights and liberties of human nature, cer 
tainly by maintaining them in our own country, when

they were the common and interesting care of all our 
fellow-citizens ! I did, however, subscribe to the institu 
tion, but absolutely and purely to avoid the reproach of 
singular it y ; for I supposed all the officers of the army 
would become members of the society." 

Mr. Samuel Phillips, Jr., has already been mentioned 
as a friend who generously and patriotically encour 
aged Colonel Pickering, in the beginning of the Revo 
lution, in the publication of his " Plan of Discipline for 
a Militia." * The same liberal spirit, but on a larger 
scale, was exerted by him, in conjunction with Mr. 
John Phillips, in 1778, in founding Phillips Academy 
at Andover; and some letters passed between him 
and Colonel Pickering in relation to the statutes of 
the Academy. 

Mr. Phillips wrote the following letter, dated at 
Boston, the 6th of May, 1785: 

" I might make many apologies for so long delaying to 
comply with your request respecting the constitution of the 
Academy with which I am connected. ... I have now 
sent you a copy of the whole instrument (bounds of land 
and sums of money excepted), for your inspection, wish 
ing to communicate such parts only as may be of service. 
My main object in being ,o particular was, that you might 
have the fullest view of the design, and that I might, with 
more propriety, ask the favor of his remarks whose counsel 
and aid as a trustee I much relied on, had we been so for 
tunate as to have had his residence in the State. The 
general plan I still think good ; and, although difficult to 
be executed, I do not despair. The composition in some 
parts I wish to have altered, and propose making a new 
draught before the next trustee meeting, which will be 
early in July : if, before that time, you can find it conven- 

* See page 86. 



JEi. 39.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 525 

lent to favor me with such thoughts as shall occur, both as 
to form and substance, you will much oblige your sincere 
friend." 

In his answer, dated Philadelphia, May 29th, Colonel 
Pickering said : 

" Your obliging letter of the 6th, enclosing a copy of the 
Constitution of the Academy at Andover, was handed me 
last evening by Mr. Parsons. I have not since found time 
to consider it in such a manner as would be requisite to 
comply with your request. I w r ill endeavor to do it within 
the limited time ; though I can hardly flatter myself with 
being able to make any communications of consequence 
enough to merit your attention. 

" I am charmed with the leading thought in the institu 
tion, that the master s attention to the morals and dispo 
sitions of the youth is to exceed every other care. But there 
is one article which I should wish to see materially altered. 
And this alteration would, in my view, render it more con 
formable to the first and principal object of this institution, 
the promotion of true piety and virtue. 1 The article I 
refer to defines the fundamental principles of the Christian 
religion. Now, as Christians, and serious and enlightened 
Christians, have never yet been able to agree on what 
should be deemed the fundamental principles of their reli 
gion, I really wish it had not been attempted to define them 
in laying the foundation of this institution.* To instance 
in one point : All Christians believe in the existence of 
One True God ; but multitudes of devout and well-informed 
Christians cannot admit of a plurality of persons in the 
Godhead, because it is a doctrine not merely beyond their 
reason, but inconsistent with their ideas of possible exist 
ence, and a doctrine which they do not find in the words of 
Christ or his Apostles. I am sure the institution originated 

* The statutes of the founders specify the prominent doctrines of Calvinism, 
and make it the duty of the master to inculcate them upon the students. 



526 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1785. 

in benevolent motives, and that it was intended to be a 
liberal one ; yet the position above mentioned (to say 
nothing of some others) greatly narrows its foundation. 
If it be practicable now to alter the article in question, the 
hint here given will be sufficient ; if no alteration can be 
admitted, I rest satisfied in your discernment and charity 
for the continuance of your good opinion, any difference of 
sentiment on controverted points notwithstanding. 

" I may resume the consideration of this article in a future 
letter : at present, I have only time to add, that I am, with 
the truest respect and esteem, dear Sir, your friend and 
servant." 

In a second letter to Mr. Phillips, dated June 18th, 
he says : 

" On the 29th ultimo I acknowledged the receipt of your 
letter of the 6th of that month, and made, in haste, a few 
observations on that part of the plan of your Academy which 
describes the principles of religion in which the scholars 
shall be instructed ; expressing my opinion, that it were 
better to leave the articles of religion undefined. This 
opinion seems to be warranted by the Constitution itself; 
for, in stating the qualifications of the principal instructor, 
it is only required that he be a Protestant professor of the 
Christian religion, and of exemplary manners. And what 
more would you demand or wish for in the pupils committed 
to his charge ? Establishments in matters of religion or gov 
ernment once made, and confirmed by the practice of some 
years, it is in the highest degree difficult to alter, whatever 
errors, absurdities, or follies may, in the progress of man 
kind in knowledge, be discovered. The Liturgy and Ser 
vice of the Church of England are a familiar instance of the 
former, and every government in the world of the latter. 
Even the recent Constitution of Pennsylvania, though pal 
pably defective in the formation of its legislature,* yet, 

* Then consisting of only one body. 



-ffii.40.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 527 

after seven years confirmation, appeared to be unalterable. 
The most enlightened members of the State repeatedly en 
deavored to bring the Constitution under a review, in order 
to supply that and other defects ; but in vain. Nothing but 
the flagrant evils which may result from these defects, and 
be sensibly felt by the people, will ever effect a change : 
such, at least, are my fears. And I am apprehensive that 
the provision made in different Constitutions of these 
States for revising and altering them at regular periods a 
provision so wise and pleasing in theory will too seldom 
be realized. 

"It is submitted to the discretion of the trustees, at some 
future period, to erect a large building for the accommo 
dation of at least fifty scholars with boarding, besides the 
master and his family. I have heard colleges compared to 
monasteries, as tending to produce, in a degree, the vices of 
monks. Be this as it may in respect to youth in the strict 
est sense of the word, it seems evidently inexpedient to 
throw children together in such numbers. So many as 
would compose an ordinary family would be enough to com 
mit to the care of one couple, the heads of a private family. 
I say couple, because I would never place children to board 
but in the houses of married people, or of those who had 
been married, and of choice with those who were or had 
been parents. 

" The plan in general appears to be so well digested, that 
I should not have hazarded any remarks upon it, if you had 
not requested them ; much less should I have noticed any 
defects in the composition. But, as you suggested such de 
fects by your proposed amendments, I read the plan with 
some attention to that particular. The remarks on the com 
position you will find in the enclosed paper. 

"I observe that the trustees, at their annual meeting, are 
to examine into the proficiency of the scholars. Is it not 
also expedient to provide for a quarterly examination ? But 
what avail examinations, if conducted in the usual way? 
I mean, by previously instructing the scholars in those par- 



528 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1785. 

ticular lessons to which the examinations are to be confined. 
If we would know what progress a boy has made in a dead 
or foreign language, does not common sense obviously show 
that his books should be opened at the discretion of the 
examiner, and the boy there set to construe and to parse ? 
If we would discover his knowledge in geography, shall we 
hear him repeat certain articles which he has purposely been 
directed to commit to his memory ? Or shall we not rather 
ask the solution of any problem, or description of any coun 
try, taken at discretion ? ... 

" What ought a Commencement to be ? A real representa 
tion of the abilities and knowledge of the youth proposed to 
be graduated. What is a Commencement 9 A farce. Is 
it not a prostitution of the honors of a university to bestow 
degrees on scholars who cannot stand an examination in its 
prescribed course of education? ... Is this evil past a 
cure? Is it impracticable to make a better provision for 
the tutors at Cambridge ? Cannot the tuition money be so 
increased, as, with the salaries granted by government, to 
enable the tutors to marry and support families? And if 
such provision were made, are there any so opposed to 
nature, to reason, and to religion, as to forbid to marry ? 
When, by such an early provision, the best instructors might 
be procured and retained, shall the provision actually made 
be capable of permanently retaining only the worst? The 
modes of education in our schools and universities, especially 
the latter, are greatly defective. A reform is evidently to 
be wished for. In this I know not whose exertions in Mas 
sachusetts would be more effectual than yours ; and to you I 
wish the honor, and to society the happiness, which such 
effectual exertions cannot fail to produce." 

Colonel Pickering proposed a few verbal alterations, 
by winch the phraseology of the Constitution of the 
academy would have been improved : no change, how 
ever, was made, either in form or substance, in con 
sequence of his suggestions. 



MT. 40.] LITE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 529 

Having several sons, he felt deeply interested in the 
subject of education; and, in October, 1785, he began 
a correspondence with Mr. Noah Webster, to whom he 
was at that time a stranger. He tells him that he is so 
well pleased with his Spelling-Book and Grammar (the 
first and second parts of his " Grammatical Institute "), 
that he wishes to have them introduced universally 
into our schools, being convinced of their superiority 
to any other used in America, but that he has failed 
in an attempt to have them adopted in the Episcopal 
academy in Philadelphia, the trustees, he was informed, 
being fearful of injuring the academy if they should 
introduce a spelling-book with which the people were 
totally unacquainted. He believes no one of them 
had taken the pains to examine the " Institute." The 
practical character of his mind is shown, in a small but 
not unimportant matter, in his remarks to Mr. Webster. 
He suggests the expediency of printing the Spelling- 
Book in two parts. He says : 

"The master of one of my children was so obliging 
as to let him use your Spelling-Book ; but before he had 
learnt his letters and a dozen of the tables, the book was 
worn out. It is true he was a careless boy ; but there 
are many such boys. I therefore earnestly wish you to 
think of such a division. The key for pronouncing the 
vowels, arranged in the clearest order, and fully explained 
the alphabet the double letters and about half a dozen 
tables of words most proper for children to begin with, 
perhaps would be enough for their primer. These would 
be comprehended in a few leaves ; but the leaves should be 
of thick strong paper, and of a tolerable fineness, to take a 
fair impression from a large and good type. That called 
[pica?] appears to rne most suitable; for the letters ought 
to be perfectly fair and accurate, to enable a child to dis- 

VOL. I. 67 



530 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1785. 

tinguish them. The utility of such a primer will be obvious ; 
but I have this further view in requesting you to undertake 
it. In the first place, the pronunciation and spelling will 
be formed on true principles. In the next, as nothing of 
the kind is extant, there will be no Dil worth, or any other 
imperfect spelling-book, to interfere with it ; and, being 
comprised in a few leaves, its cheapness will recommend it 
to parents. Then, your principles and plan being once 
adopted in the primer, I think the introduction of your 
whole Institute will follow of course." 

Mr. Webster replied from Baltimore, October 28th : 

"I have just had the satisfaction of receiving your favor 
of the 19th current, and acknowledge myself honored by 
your attention to my publications. I have ever been a 
little surprised that the f Institute found little or no sale in 
Philadelphia, the first city in America, when it is generally 
received in the Northern States, in New York, and in 
Charleston, South Carolina. I must impute it to inatten 
tion. 

" Your idea of dividing the first part strikes me favorably, 
and it is probable will have its effect. The edition you have 
seen is the second ; the third and the fourth are printed on 
larger types, pica, which is probably the type you left 
a blank for in yours. . . . 

" I have begun a reformation in the language, and my plan 
is yet but in embryo. . . . 

"On my return I shall make some stay in Philadelphia, 
and probably shall read my Lectures in that city. As I am 
the first American who has entered on such important plans, 
and a youth, as well as a Yankee, I shall need the counte 
nance of gentlemen of your established character. 

"In order to prepare the minds of people for such an 
event, I could wish that a paragraph may be inserted in a 
Philadelphia paper, informing, that I may be expected to 
read a course of Lectures on the English language some 
time this winter." 



JET. 40.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 531 

From letters of Mr. Webster and memoranda of 
Colonel Pickering, it appears that the latter examined 
the first part of the Institute very carefully, and 
noted minutely inaccuracies, omissions, and instances 
of spelling and pronunciation in which he differed 
from Mr. Webster, and that Mr. Webster acquiesced in 
the justness of many of his criticisms. 

In a letter of April 28th, 1786, to some person in 
New York, he sketches a plan of education for boys 
until they arrive at the age of fifteen years, varied 
according as they design to enter a college, or to become 
merchants, masters of vessels, mechanics, or farmers. 
Although superseded now, perhaps, in the progress of 
society, the following testimonials tend to show that it 
was an improvement on the systems of education then 
prevalent. Mr. Webster, in a letter of May 21st, 1786, 
said : 

"I am in haste, and can only observe, that the mode of 
education you have described is generally agreeable to my 
ideas. I wish it might be adopted in all our commercial 
towns, and shall use my influence for this purpose." 

The Rev. John Clarke, of Boston, wrote, June 9th : 

" I admire your system of education. I have shown it to 
several gentlemen of superior judgment : they also admire 
it; and, with some additions, they request it may appear in 
print. To say the least, you have furnished an excellent 
groundwork for a treatise upon that subject." 

Colonel Pickering also, probably about the same time, 
drew up, at much length, a " plan for establishing 
schools in a new country, where the inhabitants are 
thinly settled and the children are to be educated with 
a special reference to a cowdry lifer His plan proposes 



532 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1786. 

that three or four hundred acres of land, consisting of 
meadow, tillage, and wood land, in convenient propor 
tions, should be appropriated for the use of a school, 
and that " both boys and girls should be taught to read, 
write, and cipher. The boys should also be instructed 
in every useful branch of husbandry and gardening, 
and the girls in every kind of work necessary for farm 
ers wives to know and practise." 

Nor was he unmindful of the cause of education 
when he was a member of the Pennsylvania Conven 
tion in 1789, 1790, for revising the Constitution of that 
State. The following proposition being before the con 
vention, to wit, " A school or schools shall be established 
in each county for the instruction of youth, and the State 
shall pay to the masters such salaries as shall enable 
them to teach at low prices," Chief Justice McKean 
moved an amendment by adding the words " and the 
poor gratis! Colonel Pickering introduced as a sub 
stitute for the whole, "The legislature shall provide, 
by law, for the establishment of schools throughout the 
State, in such manner that the poor may be taught 
gratis! This clause, amended by inserting after legis 
lature, the words " as soon as conveniently may be" was 
adopted by the Convention and ratified by the people 
as a part of the Constitution.* 

Having been informed that his brother was in the 
last stages of consumption, Colonel Pickering wrote him 



* See "Minutes of the Convention," &c., 21, 44, 140, 144; and " Minutes of 
the Grand Committee of the Whole Convention," &c., 75. The merit of intro 
ducing the provision that the poor should be taught gratis, has been ascribed 
to Colonel Pickering ; and, as he was familiar with the fact that they were so 
taught in Massachusetts, it is not unlikely that he suggested it, either in debate 
or in conversation ; but, according to the official statement in the text, the 
honor of formally proposing it to the Convention is due to Mr. McKean. 
Colonel Pickering concurred with him, only substituting a better form of 
expression. 



^ET. 40.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 533 

the following letter, intended to soothe his last moments. 
The religious sentiments therein expressed show a wide 
departure from the Calvinistic doctrines in which Colo 
nel Pickering had been educated. The letter is dated 
at Philadelphia, January 26th, 1786. 

"DEAR BROTHER, 

" By Mr. Williams and Mr. Clarke I have been informed 
of your illness ; and by the latter, that, riot expecting a con 
tinuance of life, you wish for that relief which death only 
can afford. Long, my dear Brother, did I hope might be 
spared a life so valuable to your friends and to society. In 
this last stage of it, your own reflections will console you. 
The mixed pleasures of this world can, indeed, keep but 
slender hold of the dying Christian, who sees in prospect an 
immortal reign in happy life. If not here on earth, yet in 
that blest state, I firmly believe, we shall meet again. The 
benevolence of the Deity is unbounded as his power, and 
unlimited as his existence. Man was made for happiness, 
and shall not miss of it. Even the unthankful and unjust 
shall eventually be saved ; much more they whose lives have 
been spent in doing good. With unfeigned affection, my 
dear Brother, I bid you farewell, commending you to God, 
our Father who is in heaven." 

On the same day, at Philadelphia, he wrote to Mr. 
Williams, his brother-in-law : 

" Since my last I have daily reflected on the hint you gave 
me of returning to Salem. I have also taken a general view 
of my expenses and income in this place, and am convinced 
the latter will not defray the former. I am no longer in 
public office, and see no prospect of an adequate increase of 
commercial business to support me. It was an apprehen 
sion of this which last year induced me to purchase a large 
interest in the new lands in this State, that I might retire 
to them as a resource for rny present support, and a valuable 



534 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1786. 

estate for Ay children, in case the failure of commercial 
business should render it necessary. But to return to 
Salem will be much more agreeable, provided I can there 
obtain a competency. 

"The disposition my brother has made of his estate is 
perfectly agreeable to me ; and, if he had thought proper to 
order it in any other manner, still I should have been con 
tent.* If I return, I suppose the farm may continue entire, 
on my allowing a suitable rent to each proprietor. I have 
considered of the management of it, and am inclined to think 
it practicable to pay sufficient attention to it, although I 
should hold the offices enjoyed by my brother. To obtain 
these offices will be a matter of considerable consequence. 
You mentioned Mr. Phillips s f wish to know my intention. 
I shall now be much obliged to him and my other friends for 
their assistance in procuring me the Register s office and a 
seat on the bench of the inferior court, should they become 
vacant." 

Writing the next day to Mr. John Gardner, his 
nephew, and referring to the probable decease of his 
brother, he says : 

"This circumstance will induce me to return to Salem, 
where I expect to spend the remainder of my days, pro 
vided I obtain the same offices your uncle now holds, and 
which formerly were held by me." 

In furtherance of his design, he prepared a circular 
letter to the Selectmen of the several towns in the 
county of Essex, to be communicated to the electors in 
case his brother should die, saying that he resigned the 
office of Register of Deeds when called to the field, and 
that, prompted by the wish to return to Salem and 

* Colonel Pickering s brother owned a valuable farm within the township 
of Salern, and he had probably made a will devising portions of it to his sisters, 
or some of them, and to Colonel Pickering, in severalty.

-ZET.40.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 535 

dwell among his friends, lie desired to be reinstated in 
that office. His intention of returning to Salem was 
relinquished in consequence of an improvement taking 
place in the health of his brother, who was reflected. 

Had the illness of his brother terminated in death, 
it would probably have changed materially the current 
of Colonel Pickering s life. He would have returned 
to Salem, and probably have been reinstated in the 
offices of Register of Deeds and Judge of the Court of 
Common Pleas for the county of Essex, in which case 
he and his family would have escaped the distresses 
hereafter mentioned, occasioned by his removal to 
Wyoming. On the division of the people of the United 
States into two great parties after the adoption of the 
Federal Constitution, he would doubtless have been a 
decided Federalist; and this, in conjunction with his 
reputation and his exactness in the business of the 
office, might perhaps have assured his reelection as 
Register of Deeds for several years ; but it is not im 
probable that President Washington would have se 
lected him for some employment under the general 
government. 

In the winter and spring of 1785 and 1786, Mr. 
Noah Webster delivered his course of lectures on the 
English language in Philadelphia, New York, and other 
places, as well as in Baltimore. From the following 
passage in a letter of Colonel Pickering to Mr. John 
Gardner, his nephew, it appears that he could do justice 
to Mr. Webster s merits, although displeased by his 
vanity and egotism : 

" PHILADELPHIA, July 4th, 1786. 

" With respect to Mr. Webster, you must have noticed, 
that, with a competent share of good sense, he possessed a 
quantum sufficit of vanity, so that he really overrated his 



536 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [1786. 

own talents. He imagined that he was a good reader, but 
I had so much friendship for him as to point out his defects ; 
and, though it was evidently a little mortifying, he thanked 
me then, and has since made his acknowledgments by 
letter. He was particularly defective in reading poetry; 
and this, perhaps, as much as anything, disgusted his audi 
ence. In. truth, there was so much of egotism, especially 
for a young man, apparent in his communications, as to 
prevent his hearers receiving the satisfaction which might 
otherwise have been derived from many ingenious observa 
tions. For my own part, I esteem him for his ingenuity, 
learning, and industry. The object of his pursuit is an im 
portant one, and divers of his lectures received the private 
approbation of several of the most discerning and critical 
hearers. Dr. Shippen told me that his son attended one 
evening, and was very much disgusted; but added, that his 
son had not given him a fair chance. The Doctor himself, 
one evening particularly, expressed himself to me in terms 
of very sensible pleasure, and acknowledgment of Webster s 
spirit and ingenuity. I have taken the liberty, in a letter 
since his departure, to tell him that diffidence in a public 
lecturer, especially in a young man, was essential to the art 
of pleasing. As to the encouragement he met with, I do 
not think it was to be boasted of; at the same time, 
bating the truly displeasing marks of vanity, I think the 
encouragement received was less than he deserved. But 
Philadelphians have ever appeared to me to have an over 
weening opinion of their own literary acquirements, as 
well as other excellences. Some time ago, Dr. Ewing, in 
recommending for the college at New York a mathematician 
who had been in a subordinate station at the University here, 
to complete his eulogium, added, He was sure he would 
have no equal eastward of the Hudson. Mr. Webster has 
repeated his lectures at New York, and, he wrote me, to an 
audience about as numerous as that at Philadelphia. He 
said that Dr. Ramsay and other members of Congress 
approved and patronized his design, and his execution of 



MT. 40.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 537 

it thus far, and encouraged him to go on ; particularly to 
attempt a reform of the English alphabet, so as to give a 
distinct character to every distinct sound, and to let no one 
sound be signified by more than one character. This would 
introduce some new letters and expunge several of the old 
ones. Dr. Franklin wrote a paper, some years ago, on this 
subject, which he showed to Mr. Webster. By the way, 
the Doctor treated Mr. Webster with respect, and expressed 
himself thus on his * Sketches of American Polities (a pam 
phlet written by Mr. Webster with that title), that it was 
very well written. This remark regarded that part of the 
pamphlet which, in a forcible manner, pointed out the 
necessity of altering the Federal government, and enlarging 
the powers of Congress. Mr. Webster has since written 
to the Doctor, submitting to his censure a plan for reform 
ing the alphabet, and requesting the Doctor s permission 
of dedicating to him his lectures, which he intends shortly 
to publish. 

"I believe you did not hear Mr. Webster s lectures. 
Among other things, he showed the glaringly improper pro 
nunciation of many words in all the States ; but there seemed 
to be fewer in New England than elsewhere. . . . The 
lectures were, I believe, never intended as a catchpenny 
scheme ; but they served to explain and recommend the 
principles on which his Grammatical Institute was 
founded."

BATTLE OF LEXINGTON. 

THE imputation or insinuation of pusillanimity or dilatoriness 
on the part of Colonel Pickering, in regard to the battle of Lexing 
ton, appears in several historical works. Gordon, in his " History 
of the Rise, Progress, and Establishment of the Independence of the 
United States of America," * says, " Colonel Pickering, of Salem, 
had the command of a fine provincial regiment. Had he pushed on 
with his men, so as to have headed the British before they had gained 
Charlestown Neck (and he was near enough), they must have clubbed 
their firelocks, for they were quite wearied out with the services of 
the day, and had but a round or two of ammunition remaining. No 
satisfactory reason has been assigned for the want of greater alert 
ness in Colonel Pickering s regiment." 

In Mrs. Mercy Warren s " History of the American Revolu 
tion," | it is said, " Had the militia of Salem and Marblehead 
have come on, as it was thought they might have done, they would 
undoubtedly have prevented this routed, disappointed army from 
reaching the advantageous post of Charlestown. But the tardiness of 
Colonel Pickering, who commanded the Salem regiment, gave them 
an opportunity to make good their retreat. Whether Mr. Pick 
ering s delay was owing to timidity, or to a predilection in favor of 
Britain, remains uncertain ; however it was, censure at the time fell 
very heavily on his character." 

General Heath s "Memoirs" contains the following passage : J 
" The militia continued to hang on the rear of the British, until they 
reached Bunker s Hill, in Charlestown ; and it had become so dusk, 
as to render the flashes of the muskets very visible. At this instant 
an officer on horseback came up from the Medford road, and in-

quired the circumstances of the enemy ; adding, that about seven 
hundred men were close behind, on their way from Salem to join 
the militia. Had these arrived a few minutes sooner, the left flank 
of the British must have been greatly exposed, and suffered con 
siderably ; perhaps their retreat would have been cut off. As soon 
as the British gained Bunker s Hill, they immediately formed in a 
line opposite to the Neck ; when our General [Heath] judged it ex 
pedient to order the militia, who were now at the Common, to halt 
and give over the pursuit, as any further attempt upon the enemy, 
in that position, would have been fruitless." 

Colonel Pickering s regiment was composed of the militia of 
Salem, Beverly, Danvers, Middleton, and Lynn. The foregoing 
extracts seem to suppose the whole regiment to have been with him ; 
whereas the Salem " Memorial " * puts it beyond controversy, that he 
was accompanied by only the Salem companies, four in number, 
mustering, on this occasion, " near three hundred men." f Con 
sidering the uniform and prominent opposition of Colonel Pickering 
to the arbitrary measures of the British government from the year 
1770, and perhaps from an earlier date, and his military services in 
the regular army during the Revolution, besides his twice coming 
forward as a volunteer in the early part of the contest on a call for 
militia, the accusation of timidity, or of a predilection in favor of 
Britain, is absurd. That his character did not suffer contempo 
rary injury, with those best acquainted with it, is proved by the 
facts, that, besides the important offices conferred upon him, as men 
tioned in his letter to Jacob Dodge, j his name stood first, in October, 
1775, on the Committee of Safety chosen by his townsmen ; that, on 
an election of Register of Deeds, in the beginning of 1776, by the 
inhabitants of his own county, " all the votes were for him " ; that 
in July, 1776, by a resolve of the General Assembly of Massachusetts 
Bay, the company of sea-coast men and the company of rnatrosses 
stationed at Salem were put under his order and direction ; and 
that in May, 1777, Washington appointed him Adjutant-General of 
the army of the United States. 

* See before, page 74. 

t General Heath s mistake as to the number may have arisen from the fact, 
that in December, 1776, Colonel Pickering took the command of a new regi 
ment of seven hundred men, furnished from the whole county of Essex, for 
three months service, which marched into the State of New York, and there 
became subject to the orders of General Heath, as before related. 

t See page 78. 



1775.] LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. 541 

In Frothingham s " History of the Siege of Boston," * &c., it is 
said, ..." While Colonel Pickering, with the Essex militia, seven 
hundred strong, threatened to cut off their retreat to Charlestowii." 
The author cites as an authority a letter of Washington, dated May 
31st, 1775, in which he says, u If the retreat had not been as precipi 
tate as it was, and God knows it could not well have been more so, 
the ministerial troops must have surrendered or been totally cut off; 
for they had not arrived in Charlestown (under cover of their ships) 
half an hour, before a powerful body of men from Marblehead and 
Salem was at their heels, and must, if they had happened to be 
up one hour sooner, inevitably have intercepted their retreat to 
Charlestown. "t 

The erroneous number " seven hundred " seems to have been adopt 
ed by Frothiugham from Heath s " Memoirs." The statement of 
Washington has the appearance of being made on his own knowl 
edge of facts, and derives importance from the weight of his char 
acter. But, on turning to the letter in Sparks, it is seen that it was 
written at Philadelphia, and that the paragraph from which the quo 
tation is taken begins, " From the best accounts I have been able 
to collect of that affair, indeed from every one, I believe the fact, 
stripped of all coloring, to be plainly this, that if the retreat," &c. (as 
above). These accounts probably exaggerated the force from Salem, 
and in regard to Marblehead were certainly incorrect. The militia 
of this town did not begin their march, on the 19th of April, until ten 
o clock at night ; J before which hour the British troops were safe in 
their position on Bunker s Hill. 

In a more recent publication is the following passage : Had the 
retreat of the British troops " been delayed a half hour longer, or 
had Pickering, with his fine regiment from Salem and Marblehead, 
been alert enough to have intercepted them in front, it was thought 
that, worn down as they were by fatigue, and exhausted of ammu- 

* Page 78. 

f See Sparks s "Writings of Washington," Vol. II. p. 407. 

J See a statement on the authority of Captain Russell Trevett, who com 
manded the Marblehead militia on the occasion, in the "North American" (a 
newspaper published at Baltimore) of April 13th, 1808. It is there said, that, 
in consequence of there being two ships of war (the Lively, of twenty guns, 
and another ship, of sixteen) in the harbor of Marblehead, and of the absence 
of many of the inhabitants on fishing voyages, the Selectmen and the Com 
mittee of Safety determined that the minute-men should not depart till ten 
o clock at night, when they should proceed without noise ; and that this was 
done accordingly. 



542 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [APPENDIX. 

nition, they must have surrendered." * As has already been stated, 
Colonel Pickering s force consisted, not of his whole regiment, but 
of the four Salem companies alone ; and the militia of Marblehead 
did not belong to his regiment. 

It is remarkable, that the most authentic and trustworthy docu 
ment relative to the Salem militia in connection with the battle of 
Lexington, the contemporary "Memorial" of Salem, seems to 
have escaped the notice of every one of these historians. It was 
in printf before the publication of Frothingham s work and of the 
seventh volume of Bancroft. 

I subjoin other statements concerning the battle of Lexington, 
giving, as I believe, a more correct view of Colonel Pickering s 
conduct in reference to that event, than is contained in the Histories 
above quoted. 

Major Joseph Hiller, an officer in one of the Salem companies in 
1775, and subsequently the collector of the ports of Salem and Bev 
erly, wrote the following interesting letter to my brother, the late 
John Pickering: 

"LANCASTER, March 13th, 1809. 
" SIR, 

" The desire you intimated, when I lately saw you, to know any 
circumstances I could inform you of respecting the events which 
took place in Salem on the 19th of April, 1775, has engaged my 
attention, and the following observations are the result. Being 
unable to find in my possession any private memorandums relating 
particularly to the subject, few opportunities having occurred to con 
verse with contemporaries upon it, and thirty-four years, singularly 
marked with events, having elapsed, little or nothing interesting is 
left within my recollection to communicate, which you have not 
already obtained from the best sources. 

" The calamities and apprehensions which prevailed throughout 
the American Provinces previous to that period, and the patriotic 
virtues they brought into action, must be familiar to you, and that 
in the display of these latter Salem was behind none. 

" In every well-regulated community there are generally some 
prominent characters whose discretion, activity, and firmness are 
resorted to on all momentous occasions. Such characters that town 
could then boast. I need not tell you who was eminent amongst the

eminent ; the various places where Colonel Pickering stood may 
for ever tell with pride who occupied them. 

" The march of the British troops, under Colonel Leslie, into the 
town of Salem, the last of February, 1775, and the attendant circum 
stances, had increased the apprehensions of the people, and a general 
expectation of an eruption somewhere was manifest ; nevertheless, 
the alarm which shook the town on the morning of the 19th of April, 
that the British troops had marched out of Boston and had attacked 
our people at Lexington, lost none of its force. The sensations 
it excited are beyond my powers of description. The report was 
vague, but its probability was believed. The people collected in 
various parts of the town, and concentrated in Court Street. Colo 
nel Pickering was upon the ground ; his usual energies were put 
into action. After a short consultation with the Selectmen, Com 
mittee of Safety, and other gentlemen was held, the several militia 
companies were embodied and equipped with a rapidity correspond 
ent to the occasion, and soon after marched, in hopes to receive 
some direct information on their route. The companies halted a short 
time in Danvers, I think near the confluence of the roads ; but, no 
intelligence being obtained, they resumed their march with increased 
rapidity, which, with trifling interruption, was uniformly continued 
till they arrived at Medford, and from thence to Winter Hill ; and, 
in this last part of the march more especially, a serious expectation of 
actual engagement and a solemn determination to act with firmness, 
so far as I could judge from what I heard and saw, was generally 
manifest ; but, when we arrived at the summit of the hill, we saw we 
were too late : the British troops had gained the opposite hills, and 
were fast collecting in force. It was naturally a subject of regret, 
that we had not been able to arrive sooner ; but from no circum 
stance which I was ever acquainted with did I ever think, that 
blame could attach, either to the officer or those under his command, 
for this event. Attempts of this kind, however, have been made ; 
but I believe they have universally failed of effect with every im 
partial and fair mind, and that those who have obtained correct 
information upon the subject have been satisfied that it was only a 
subject of regret as an event that could not be controlled. It has, 
nevertheless, been fashioned into a weapon by party malice, and 
occasionally brandished, for the vilest purposes, against the inflexible 
patriot whose life has been devoted to the best interests of his coun 
try ; but those who know Colonel Pickering know that these and 
similar efforts cannot affect him, and that their buzz can excite only 
his pity or contempt. 



544 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [APPENDIX. 

" I have given you evidence, Sir, that I could communicate noth 
ing new to you upon the subject of your inquiry ; and my only 
apology for writing upon it is the respect I owed to your request. 
" I am, Sir, with great regard, yours, 

"Jos. KILLER." 

In a memorandum, dated April 13th, 1811, given to my brother 
John Pickering, and labelled, in his handwriting, " Captain Jos. 
White s observation at Essex Bank as to T. Pickering s conduct 
April 19, 1775," Mr. White is represented as saying, " he did not like 
Colonel Pickering, as he considered him a man who delighted in 
controversy, &c. ; but said, that before the Revolution he was a very 
active and useful man in public affairs, no man more so ; and, as 
to the Lexington affair, he ought not to be blamed for that, for he did 
all that a man could do, all that was in his power to do (or words to 
that effect), and added, i This I can say from my own knowledge. " 
Mr. White was the elderly gentleman who was murdered at Salem in 
1830. He is entitled to credit for manliness and candor ; for, at the 
period of his remarks, the Democratic party, to which he belonged, 
was much incensed against Colonel Pickering. 

Having expressed to my friend, Mr. John C. Gray, a wish that 
he would put on paper his recollections of what his father, the late 
William Gray, an eminent merchant, and at one time Lieutenant- 
Governor of Massachusetts, had said on this subject, he wrote to me, 
under date of August 24th, 1858, as follows : 

" In reply to your request, I have to say, that my father, as has 
been more than once stated in the public prints, marched from Salem 
under your father s command on the 19th of April, 1775. It is well 
known that the Salem troops did not arrive in time to take part in 
the memorable conflict of that day. I recollect distinctly, that I 
once inquired of my father whether this failure to arrive was owing 
to any want of due exertion on the part of the troops or their com 
mander, and that his answer was decidedly in the negative. . . . 
The conversation to which I refer was held, I think, about the time 
of our last war with England. I have always inferred from it, as 
well as from other conversations with my father in relation to the 
events of that day, that Colonel Pickering and every man under his 
command exerted themselves to the utmost to come within reach of 
the enemy."

BATTLE OF BRANDYWINE. 

Two newspapers, published in Boston, namely, the " Continental 
Journal," of November 6th, 1777, and the "Boston Gazette," of 
November 10th, (and doubtless newspapers published elsewhere in 
the United States,) contain the following statement, but without any 
voucher for its authenticity : 

" State and Disposition of the British Forces at the Battle of Brandy- 
ivine, September 11, 1777, at the Upper Ford, under Lieutenant" 
General Lord Cornwallis :

These figures, denoting the number of the British forces in the 
field and of their loss in the battle, coincide with those in a kt Life 
of Washington " by Headley (p. 258), except that he states the loss of 
Lord Cornwallis s brigade of Hessians to be seventy, instead of sixty, 
and consequently makes the total loss of the British nineteen hun 
dred and eighty-six. 

In the "Historical Magazine" for March, 1867, (published by 
VOL. I. 69 



546 LIFE OF TIMOTHY PICKERING. [APPENDIX. 

Mr. Henry B. Dawson, Morrisania, New York,) at page 148, are sev 
eral letters from Captain William Beatty, of the Maryland line, to his 
father. In one, dated Skippack, October 13th, 1777, he says he had 
previously sent the particulars of the battle of Brandy wine " except 
a return that was taken at Germantown battle, which gives an 
account that the enemy s loss at Brandywine was nineteen hundred 
and seventy-six killed and wounded." 

This evidence, if reliance is to be placed on it, supports Colonel 
Pickering s impression that the British loss in killed and wounded 
exceeded that of the Americans (see page 1C2) ; and that their force 
on the field, which he speaks of loosely as amounting to eight or nine 
thousand men (see page 175), was less than it is usually represented 
to have been. But he, and more especially General Washington, 
must have been informed of the above statement of the British loss, 
and I know not how to account for their silence respecting it (for I 
am not aware that it is alluded to by either of them), except on the 
presumption that they did not deem it worthy of credit.
