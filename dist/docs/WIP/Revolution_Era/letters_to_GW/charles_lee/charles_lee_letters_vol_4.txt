Sir, 
For a few days past, the Assembly has been engaged upon the subject of the Federal Constitution. 
The House of Delegates, in Committee, has come to 
several resolutions with respect to putting it into 
operation. One of them distributes the Commonwealth into ten districts, each of which is to choose 
a Representative in Congress ; and another appoints 
that there shall be twelve districts, each of which is 
to choose an Elector of the President; and every free 
man is at this election to have a vote. These matters were introduced by Mr. Corbin, who seems to 
me not to have the confidence even of those who are 
friends to the fair trial of the new Government ; and 
as they have made but small progress, I cannot tell 
what will become of them. For Mr. Henry to-day 
took occasion to declare, that he should oppose every 
measure tending to the organization of the Government, unless accompanied with measures for the amendment of the Constitution; for which purpose he proposes that another General Com^ention of Deputies 
from the different States shall he held, as soon as 
practicable. 
</p><p>
He offered to the Committee of the Whole House 
several resolutions to be agreed to upon this point ; 
one of them, that the Legislature of Virginia should 
apply to the new Congress, expressive of the desire 
of this State, that another General Convention be immediately held to amend the Constitution. The language of this resolution contains a direct and indecent censure on all those who have befriended the 
new Constitution, holding them forth as the betrayers 
of the dearest rights of the people. Applying to 
the Constitution, these words are used, â€” " Whereby 
the most precious rights of the people, if not cancelled, are rendered insecure." With some difficulty, and 
after much entreaty, Mr. Henry conceded (I use his 
expression) to suffer the resolution to lie on the 
table for consideration till to-morrow. Mr. Corbin, 
who spoke several times, but never against the resolution, concluded with saying that the resolution, 
as proposed, was unobjectionable; and Zachariah Johnson was the only member who declared his disapprobation in positive terms. If Mr. Henry pleases, he 
will carry the resolution in its present terms, than 
which none, in my opinion, can be more exceptionable or inflammatory; though, as he is sometimes kind 
and condescending, he may perhaps be induced to 
alter it. The other resolution proposed that a Committee should be appointed to answer the circular 
letter of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and, in conformity with the object of that letter, to address the Assemblies of the 
other States. 
I am told Mr. Henry has publicly said, that no 
person, who wishes the Constitution to be amended, 
should vote for Mr. Madison to be in the Senate ; 
and there is much reason to fear he will not be 
elected. Colonel K H. Lee is considered as certain ; 
and Colonel Grayson is expected to be the choice 
for the Senate. 
</p><p>
Mr. Mayo has completed his bridge, and the greater part is strong and substantial ; and this is now 
the common passage for wagons, chariots, &c., across 
the river. 
</p><p>
You will please to pardon the abrupt manner of 
my communication, as I have been much fatigued 
with the business of the Court, and have been much 
chao-rined with the conduct of the federalists in the 
Assembly, who seem, in general, to stand in fear of 
their opponents. I remain, with every consideration 
of respect and esteem. Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
Charles Lee.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have very little doubt, that Mr. John Marshall 
would not act as a Commissioner under the treaty 
with Great Britain, for deciding on the claims of 
creditors. I have been long acquainted with his private affairs, and I think it almost impossible for him 
to undertake that offico. If he would, I know not 
any objection that subsists against him. First, he is 
not a debtor. Secondly, he cannot be benefited or injured by any decision of the Commissioners. Thirdly, 
his being employed as counsel, in suits of that kind, 
furnishes no reasonable objection; nor do I know of 
any opinions that he has published, or professes, that 
might, with a view to impartiality, make him liable 
to be objected to. 
</p><p>
Mr. Marshall is at the head of his profession, in 
Virginia, enjoying every convenience and comfort; in 
the midst of his friends and the relations of his wife 
at <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>; in a practice of his profession that 
annually produces about five thousand dollars on an 
average ; with a young and increasing family ; and 
under a degree of necessity to continue his profession, 
for the purpose of complying with contracts, not yet 
performed. 
</p><p>
I think it probable that Colonel Innes would accept 
of this appointment. Of him I cannot speak with as 
much certainty as I have done of Mr. Marshall; but 
I believe he is neither a debtor nor a creditor ; that 
he will not be benefited nor injured by any decision 
of the Commissioners ; nor do I know of any opinions 
that he professes or has published, that would make 
his impartiality be suspected. He and Mr. B. Randolph married sisters ; and, though Mr. B. R. is himself clear of British debts, there are some of his relations much involved. This circumstance affords, in 
my mind, no just objection to the appointment of 
Colonel Innes ; and the only one, which I can think 
of, is his reluctance to business and want of diligence. 
As the Commissioners wdll have a Clerk, and sit as 
Judges, I suppose he will, if he undertakes this office, 
be sufficiently active for its duties. 
</p><p>
I am, &c., 
</p><p>
Charles Lee.
