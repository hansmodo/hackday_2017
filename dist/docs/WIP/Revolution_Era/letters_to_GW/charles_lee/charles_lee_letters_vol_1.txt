DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
We have been so baffled by the weather, that we 
only arrived here last night. I believe we shall find 
no difficulties in procuring a sufficient body of volunteers for the <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> expedition. The unhappy 
accounts from Canada seem to animate these people, 
rather than depress. Indeed, we have new occasion 
for exertion and decision. I am apprehensive that 
the Congress must be inspired by you. They have 
just given a strong, and, I think, unfortunate instance 
of indecision. Colonel Waterbury had raised a regiment. The regiment was equipped, and ready for embarkation. They were to have landed in Oyster Bay, 
to have attacked the Tories in Long Island. Lord 
Stirling was to have attacked them on the other side. 
All this by order of Congress; when suddenly Colonel Waterbury received an order to disband his regiment ; and the Tories are to remain unmolested till 
they are joined by the King's assassins. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Governor Trumbull</a></a>, like a man of sense and spirit, has ordered this regiment to be reassembled. I believe it will be ready on Sunday, the day on which 
I shall march from this town. I shall send immediately an express to the Congress, informing them of my situation, and, at the same time, conjuring them 
not to suffer the accursed Provincial Congress of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to defeat measures so absolutely necessary to salvation. 
</p><p>
The affairs of Canada will, I suppose, very soon, if not instantly, require a very considerable force from this Province. Neither will the circumstances of New 
York admit of its being too much stripped of men, for which reason I should think it advisable immediately to raise some additional regiments in Massachusetts Bay. Adieu, dear General. God prosper you and the arms of virtue ! 
</p><p>
Yours, most sincerely,

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
It was unnecessary sooner to trouble you with my 
scrawl, as I could give you no information the least 
interesting. I find the people through this Province 
more alive and zealous than my most sanguine expectation. I believe I might have collected ten thousand 
volunteers. I take only four companies with me, and 
Waterbury's regiment, which is so happily situated on 
the frontier. Ward's regiment I have ordered to remain at their respective homes, until they hear further. These Connecticutians are, if possible, more 
eager to go out of their country, than they are to 
return home, when they have been out for any considerable time. 
</p><p>
Inclosed I send yon my letter to the General congress. That of the Provincial Congress of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
to me, with my answer, I hope will have your approbation. 
</p><p>
The Whigs, I mean the stout ones, are, it is said, 
very desirous that a body of troops should march and 
be stationed in their city. The timid ones are averse, 
merely from the spirit of procrastination, which is the 
characteristic of timidity. The letter of the Provincial 
Congress, you will observe, breathes the very essence 
of this spirit. It is wofully hysterical. I conclude I 
shall receive the orders of the General Congress be 
fore, or immediately on,, my arrival; otherwise I should 
not venture to march into the Province, as, by their 
late resolve, every detachment of the Continental 
troops is to be under the direction of the Provincial 
Congress in which they are ; a resolve, I must say 
with submission to their wisdom, fraught with difficulties and evils. It is impossible, having two sovereigns, that any business should be carried on. 
</p><p>
Have you seen the pamphlet, Common Sense? I 
never saw such a masterly, irresistible performance. 
It will, if I mistake not, in concurrence with the 
transcendent folly and wickedness of the ministry, 
give the coup-de-grace to Great Britain. In short, I 
own myself convinced by the arguments, of the necessity of separation. Poor brave Montgomery ! But it 
it is not a time to cry, but to revenge. God bless 
you, my dear General, and crown us with the success 
I am sure we merit, from the goodness of our cause. 
My love to the ladies. I shall write a long letter to 
Gates, when I have time and materials. Adieu. 
Yours, most affectionately,

MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I arrived here yesterday, but not without some difficulty. My disorder increased rather than diminished, so that I was under the necessity of being carried in a litter a considerable part of the way. I 
consider it as a piece of the greatest good fortune 
that the Congress have detached a Committee to this 
place, otherwise I should have made a most ridiculous figure, besides bringing upon myself the enmity of the whole Province. My hands were effectually 
tied up from taking any step necessary for the public service by the late resolve of the Congress, put ting every detachment of the Continental forces under the command of the Provincial Congress where such detachment is. 
</p><p>
I should apprise you that <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>General Clinton</a></a> arrived 
almost at the same instant with myself. lie has 
brought no troops with him, and pledges his honor 
that none are coming. lie says it is merely a visit 
to his friend Tryon, If it is really so, it is the most 
whimsical piece of civility I ever heard of. He in 
forms us that his intention is for North Carolina, 
where he expects five regiments from England ; that 
he only brought tAVO companies of light infantry from 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. This is certainly a droll way of proceeding. 
To communicate his full plan to the enemy is too 
novel to be credited. 
</p><p>
The Congress Committees, a certain number of the 
Committee of Safety, and your humble servant, have 
had two conferences. The result of these conferences 
is such as will agreeably surprise you. It is, in the 
first place, agreed, and justly, that to fortify the town 
against shipping, is impracticable ; but w T e are to fortify lodgments in some commanding part of the city 
for tw r o thousand men. We are to erect inclosed batteries on both sides the water near Hell Gate, which will answer the double purpose of securing the town 
against piracies through the Sound, and secure our 
communication with Long Island, now become a more 
capital point than ever, as it is determined to form 
a strong fortified camp of three thousand men on the 
Island, immediately opposite to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. The pass 
in the Highlands is to be made as respectable as possible, and guarded by a battalion. In short, I think 
the plan judicious and complete. The two brass 
pieces and other articles will be sent down as you 
request. You have heard of the fate of the cannon 
near King's Bridge. As I write with pain, you will 
excuse my abrupt conclusion. 
</p><p>
Yours, dear General, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=daw" rel="me">CHARLES LEE</a>.

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I should have written to you more constantly, but 
really had no means of conveying my letter. A Mr. 
Buchanan and Tolby, bound for head-quarters, will 
deliver you this. You will excuse the conciseness, 
as my time is short. The Governor and Captain of 
man-of-war had threatened perdition to the town if 
the cannon were removed from the batteries and 
wharves; but I ever considered their threats as a brutum fulmen, and even persuaded the town to be of 
the same way of thinking. We accordingly conveyed 
them to a place of safety in the middle of the day, 
and no cannonade ensued. Captain Parker publishes 
a pleasant reason for his passive conduct. He says 
it was manifestly my intention, and that of the New 
England men under my command, to bring down destruction on this town, so hated for their loyal principles ; but that he was determined not to indulge 
us, so remained quiet out of spite. The people here 
laugh at his nonsense, and begin to despise the menaces which formerly used to throw them into 
convulsions. To do them justice, the whole show a 
wonderful alacrity; and in removing the cannon, men 
and boys, of all ages, worked with the greatest zeal 
and pleasure. I really believe that the generality are as well affected as any on the Continent, The Provincial Congress have ordered on fifteen 
hundred minute-men. A number equal to two battalions are coming from Pennsylvania and the Jerseys. 
Lord Stirling's regiment is already here, but not 
complete. When the major part, or a sufficient number, arrive, we shall begin our works. My intention 
is to pull down that part of the fort on the town 
side, to prevent its being converted into a citadel for 
the enemy, and to erect a battery on a traverse in 
the street, to prevent their making a lodgment in it. 
A redoubt and battery at the pass of Hell Gate will 
prevent their ships and tenders passing and repassing 
to and from the Sound. 
</p><p>
We have fixed on a -spot in Long Island for a retrenched camp, which I hope will render it impossible for them to get footing on that important Island. 
As this camp can always be reenforced, it is our intention to make it so capacious as to contain four 
thousand men. The batteries on the pass of Hud 
son's River will be secured as soon as possible. Some 
of the heavy cannon from hence must be sent up for 
the purpose. It is really a fine train we are in possession of. You shall have a return of the guns as 
well as stores by the post. 
</p><p>
Captain Smyth is an excellent, intelligent, active 
officer, and I take the liberty of commending him to 
your protection. Captain Badlam, of the artillery, is 
likewise a man of great merit in his way. You 
must pardon me, dear General, for a liberty I have taken. You know that Sears was to collect our volunteers in Connecticut, but he thought he could not 
succeed unless he had some nominal office and rank. 
I accordingly, most impudently, by the virtue of the 
power deputed by you to me (which power you never 
deputed), appointed him assistant Adjutant-General, 
with rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, for the expedition. 
It can have no bad consequences. The man was 
much tickled, and it added spurs to his heat. He 
is a creature of much spirit and public virtue, and 
ought to have his back clapped. 
</p><p>
With respect to the Canada expedition, which you 
indirectly propose to me, I have only one answer to 
make. Wherever I can be of most service, there I 
should choose to be. I have, indeed, just at this in 
stant, one objection, which is, I am not without apprehensions that facing the cold may throw me into 
a relapse, so as not only to render me unfit for service there, but everywhere else. I am, indeed, much 
better, but extremely tender. I begin to walk it 
has been a d d attack; a constant violent fever 
attending it. I neither ate nor slept for eight days; 
but my fever is passed, and I begin to eat; a week 
I hope will set me up. 
</p><p>
Several members of Congress have indicated a desire I should go to Canada. I have explained to 
them my apprehensions, but assured them most honestly of my willingness ; but, in fact, unless they Expedite an army, and some heavy artillery, it will 
be in vain to trouble their heads about a General. 
Colonel Richmore, who lately left Montreal, tells us 
that what few troops are HOAV there will infallibly

take, ])e assured, dear General, that I am, with the greatest readiness, prepared to receive and execute 
your and their commands. Canada is, I confess, if I am only to be ably accoutred, a glorious field, which must flatter the ambition of

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I am extremely happy that there is any opening 
for a more comfortable establishment for poor Palfrey 
than his present. He is a valuable and capable 
man, and the pittance of a simple Aid-de-Camp-ship 
is wretched for a man, who has a family to support. 
On this principle, and in obedience to your commands, I shall send him to head-quarters without 
delay. I must, at the same time, confess that the 
loss will be irreparable to me, particularly if I am 
detached to Canada, of which there is the greatest 
probability, as I have received letters from divers 
members of the Congress, expressing their wishes 
that I should be employed in that department. 
Messrs. Griffin and Byrd are very good young men, 
but pretty much in the predicament of your Baylor. 
They can ride, understand, and deliver verbal orders, 
but you might as well set them the task of translating an Arabic or Irish manuscript as expect that 
they should, in half a day, copy a half sheet of orders. However, I must bustle through the difficulties, and not keep Palfrey out of the channel of a 
better provision. If I go to Canada, I suppose I 
shall be allowed secretaries, one French and one 
English. I do not see now it is possible to manage 
matters with less. Apropos., my dear General, if this 
is to be my province, shall you take it ill if I apply 
for one of my two Brigadiers, either Greene or Sullivan? It is a pleasure to have some officer about us 
in whom we can place confidence. 
</p><p>
The ships of war, which were here, have been frightened away. The Asia lies betwixt Nutten's and Bedloe's Islands; the Duchess of Gordon, with his Excellency Governor Tryon, is under her stern ; the Phoenix 
is stationed a league below the Narrows. The Mercury and <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>General Clinton</a></a> must inevitably fall into 
the hands of our fleet, unless they are fast asleep. 
We have taken strong hold of Hell Gate, so that the 
passage betwixt Long Island and the continent is 
absolutely blocked up to the enemy. I wait for some more force to prepare a post, or retrenched encampment, on Long Island, opposite to the city, for 
three thousand men. This is, I think, a capital object; for, should the enemy take possession of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, when Long Island is in our hands, they will 
find it almost impossible to subsist. The Jerseys are two well manned, and Connecticut, you know, will not furnish them, with any thing. 
</p><p>
What to do with the City, I own, puzzles me. It 
is so encircled with deep, navigable water, that who 
ever commands the sea must command the town. 
To-morrow I shall begin to dismantle that part of 
the fort next to the town, to prevent its being converted into a citadel. I shall barrier the principal 
streets, and, at least, if I cannot make it a Continental garrison, it shall be a disputable field of battle. 
</p><p>
Inclosed I send you a return of the good and in 
different pieces of cannon. The number of the bad, 
those, I mean, totally unfit for service, is, I believe, 
about sixty. As no Commissary of Stores has been 
appointed until this instant, it is impossible to give 
you a return of the other stores by this post, but 
you shall have it by the next. Lord Stirling is a 
great acquisition. He is a most zealous, active, and 
accurate officer. 
</p><p>
A captain of a ship from Cadiz, who is a very intelligent person, tells us that Lord Howe and Captain Barrington, or Admiral Barrington, are appointed commissioners to propose terms to the Congress. This 
he had from the Consul Hardy. What d d fools 
the Ministry are ! How does your recruiting go on 
for the standing army ? Be so good as to tell Gates, 
to whom I shall write by the next post, that Mr. Nourse inclosed no letters for him. If little Eustace 
is not provided for in your army, and I should go 
to Canada, I think he had better be sent to me, and 
I will consign him to his uncle. I am got quit of my 
gout and fever, but remain extremely weak and tender. God preserve you, my dear General, from all 
disorders, at least until we have trampled Satan under our feet, 
</p><p>
My love to Mrs. <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> and all the ladies. 
Adieu. Yours, most faithfully,

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I am now so far recovered, though far from well, that I shall set out in two days. The stripping 
<a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> so entirely of its heavy cannon, is a most unfortunate circumstance, as the transportation 
of them from this place is a business of monstrous difficulties, expense, and labor. 
</p><p>
The Congress have, as yet, not taken the least step 
for the security of this place. The instant I leave it, 
I conclude the Provincial Congress and inhabitants in 
general will relapse into their former hysterics; the 
men-of-war and Mr. Tryon will return to their old 
station at the wharves; and the first regiments, who 
arrive from England, will take quiet possession of 
the town and Long Island. I have written letters 
till I am tired, on the subject, to the Congress, but 
have received no answer. The Committee of three, 
who were here to confer with me, agreed it was 
necessary that five thousand men should be in the 
place. They left us, and no notice has been taken 
of the affair since. Great and extensive works were 
resolved upon ; and we have scarcely sufficient numbers to mark out the ground, much less to throw 
up the works. In short, I know not what to make 
of this apathy on so important a subject. 
</p><p>
Messrs. Price, Walker, and, since them, the volunteer Melchior, are arrived from Canada. It is very 
lucky, for they can communicate all the necessary 
lights to the Congress with respect to the measures which must be taken in that country. By their accounts, nothing is so much wanted as artillerymen. 
Captain Lamb's company were all taken prisoners. I 
wish, indeed it is necessary, you should spare us a 
company from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. We cannot possibly do with 
out them. We have none here. I entreat, dear General, you would detach Captain Badlam's company. 
The Captain and I are now well acquainted, and agree 
wonderfully. The Pennsylvania and Jersey troops march for Canada; are good and strong in numbers. 
The spirit of enlisting prevails through the whole 
country. I am told, but cannot believe it, that the 
New England Delegates oppose the enlisting for a 
year. They say, by means of a shorter engagement 
the whole country would be soldiers. A curious whim 
this. Who the d 1 can fill their heads with such 
nonsense ? 1 should think a letter from you on the 
subject, to either of the Adamses, would have a good 
effect, 
</p><p>
I have this moment received yours of the 22d. It 
is a sort of reprimand for not having more exactly 
informed you of the occurrences here. I do assure 
you, General, that I have wrote fully and frequently. 
It is true, I believe, two posts have carried no letters 
from me, but I would not trouble you when I had 
nothing material to communicate. I shall not in 
trench myself behind the parade of great business, 
for my first business is to be attentive to my General. Nor shall I make a plea of the loss of Palfrey, 
since whose departure I have been obliged to write 
with my own hand every the most trifling note. But, 
in fact, though I confess I am naturally remiss, I 
have not neglected my duty in this point. I have 
suffered no safe opportunity to escape me. But 
enough of this. 
</p><p>
I shall now give you a detail of what we have 
been doing, and in what circumstances we arc. Our 
force, including the minute-men, amounts to about 
seventeen hundred men. Ward's regiment, which is 
the strongest, I have stationed on Long Island. They 
are employed in making fascines, and preparing other 
materials for constructing three redoubts, one of which will, in great measure, (in correspondence with a battery which I have sunk opposite to it in the city), 
secure the entrance of the East River. Waterbury's and Stirling's regiments are quartered in the city; the former in the upper barracks, the latter in the 
lower. Two hundred minute-men are likewise lodged in the town. Drake's regiment of minute-men, and one more company (in all about two hundred), are 
stationed at Horen's Hook, which commands the pass of Hell Gate. They are employed in throwing up a redoubt to contain three hundred men. 
</p><p>
As to the town, having few hands, and the necessary duty being hard, I have been able to effect little. I have indeed thrown down the side of the fort next 
the town, to prevent its being converted into a citadel for the use of the enemy. It was absolutely impossible to be moulded into any thing which could 
annoy their ships. I have likewise thrown a traverse, 
or barrier, across the Broadway, two hundred yards 
in the rear of the fort, with four pieces of cannon, to 
prevent the enemy lodging themselves in the remains 
of the fort, and repairing it. It is likewise my intention to barricade all the streets leading into the 
Broadway, both on the right and left, to secure us 
against being taken in reverse. Batteries are to be 
erected on the eminence behind Trinity Church, to 
keep their ships at so great a distance as not to 
injure the town. As we are surrounded by navigable 
waters, I consider inclosed works as rather dangerous. It was, therefore, my intention to throw up a 
great number of large fleches or redans at certain Distances, one behind another, so as to render it a Disputable field of battle against any force. King's 
Bridge, being a most important pass, without the 
command of which we could have no communication 
with Connecticut, I had resolved to make as strong 
as possible. 
Such were my schemes ; but as the Congress have 
not furnished the force which I was taught to expect 
from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, we have not had it in our power 
to effect more than I have related. Governor Tryou 
and the Asia still continue betwixt Nutten's and Bedloe's Islands. It has pleased his Excellency, in violation of the compact he had made, to seize several 
vessels from Jersey, laden with flour. It has, in 
return, pleased my Excellency to stop all provision 
from the city, and cut off all intercourse with him, a 
measure which has thrown the Mayor, Council, and 
Tories into agonies. The propensity, or rather rage, 
for paying court to this great man, is inconceivable. 
They cannot be weaned from him. We must put 
wormwood on his paps, or they will cry to suck, as 
they are in their second childhood. 
</p><p>
Captain Smith is just returned from Fort Constitution. He gives me a most terrible account of it. 
The expense of its construction has been enormous. Its defects, both in point of situation, laying out, finishing, &c., are numerous. He has made the plan 
of another, which will command, as far as I can judge from it on paper, the river effectually. 
</p><p>
I have now related, as minutely as necessary, our situation. As I shall set out very soon, it will probably be my last from this place. I must entreat, once more, dear General, that you will spare us a 
company of artillery. Badlam seems rather averse, on proposing it. 
</p><p>
Adieu, dear Sir. Yours, with the greatest respect 
and affection,

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
My destination is altered. Instead of going to 
Canada, I am appointed to command at the south 
ward. There has been a great promotion of Brigadier-Generals ; Armstrong, Thompson, Lewis, Moore, 
Stirling, and Howe, are the six. Four are to serve 
under my orders, namely, Armstrong, Lewis, Moore, 
and Howe. As I am the only general officer on the 
Continent, who can speak and think in French, I confess I think it would have been more prudent to have 
sent me to Canada; but I shall obey with alacrity, 
and hope with success. Griffin has resigned, as he 
flatters himself he can do better in the commercial 
line. I have, in his room, appointed one of the sons 
of Lewis Morris, to whom I was under a sort of engagement. Lord Stirling will take the command until 
the arrival of Schuyler. His Lordship is active and 
distinct. 
</p><p>
In my last I gave you my plan of defence for this 
city and environs; but, from want of men, I shall be 
obliged to leave it in a poor condition. A regiment 
of Associators are, I am told, ordered from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. I have likewise sent for a battalion from the 
Jerseys ; but, on the other hand, Ward's and Waterbury's regiments will, I suppose, according to their 
laudable custom, leave the place the moment their 
time is expired, which is the 12th of this month. I 
heartily pray that you may give Mr. Howe a hand 
some salute on his leaving <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. I am not yet 
informed who is to take the command in Canada. No 
time, I am sure, is to be lost. As I am ordered away immediately, I must consign the affairs of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
to Lord Stirling. He will acquit himself well. I 
have nothing material to trouble you with at present, 
further than to assure you that I am, and ever shall 
be, dear General, 
</p><p>

MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I most sincerely congratulate you, I congratulate 
the public, on the great and glorious event, your 
possession of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. It will be a most bright page 
in the annals of America, and a most abominable 
black one in those of the beldam Britain. Go on, 
my dear General ; crown yourself with glory, and 
establish the liberties and lustre of your country on 
a foundation more permanent than the Capitol Bock. 
</p><p>
My situation is just as I expected. I am afraid that I shall make a shabby figure, without any real 
demerits of my own. I am like a dog in a dancing-school. I know not where to turn myself, where to 
fix myself. The circumstances of the country, intersected by navigable rivers, the uncertainty of the 
enemy's designs and motions, who can fly in an instant to any spot with their canvas wings, throw me, or would throw Julius Caesar, into this inevitable 
dilemma. I may possibly be in the North, when, as Richard says, I should serve my sovereign in the West. I can only act from surmise, and have a very 
good chance of surmising wrong. 
</p><p>
I am sorry to grate your ears with a truth ; but must at all events assure you that the Provincial Congress of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> are angels of decision, when 
compared with your countrymen, the Committee of Safety assembled at <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>. Page, Lee, Mercer, and Payne are indeed exceptions; but from Pendleton, Bland, the Treasurer, and Company, libem nosy Domine! 
</p><p>
I shall not trouble you with a detail of the army, 
ordnance, stores; but compendiously say, that the 
regiments in general are very complete in numbers, 
the men (those that I have seen) fine, but a most 
horrid deficiency of arms, no intrenching tools, no 
guns (although the Province is pretty well stocked) 
for service. Had I only eight eighteen-pounders, I 
would immediately, at all events, take post on Craney Island, by which measure I should drive out the 
enemy, and exclude them from the finest and most 
advantageous port in America. I have ordered, with 
this view, the artificers to work night and day. If 
I succeed, I shall come in for a sprig of laurels. 
</p><p>
This essential measure might have been effected 
long ago, but the same apathy and oblique squinting 
towards what the milk-and-water people call reconciliation, the prodigious flattering prospect opened by 
the appointment of Commissioners, were strong arguments against the expense of gun-carriages and in 
trenching tools. 
</p><p>
But this is not all. They have distributed their 
troops in so ingenious a manner as to render every 
active offensive operation impossible. An equal number of their battalions are stationed on the different 
necks. They say, very acutely, that, as the expense 
is equal, the security ought to be equal. I cannot 
help persuading myself, that their object will be to 
take possession of <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>, not only from its 
tempting advantageous situation, commanding, in great 
measure, two fine rivers, and a country abundant in 
all the necessaries for an army; but the possession 
of the Capital would give an air of dignity and decided superiority to their arms, which, in this slave 
country, where dominion is founded on opinion, is a 
circumstance of the utmost importance. Perhaps I 
may be mistaken, but, as the surmise is not irrational, I have called three regiments down the country. 
</p><p>
You will excuse, my dear General, the blots and 
scratches of this letter, for the post is just going out. 
By the next, I will inform you of the steps we have 
taken for the security of this place. I have been 
desired to recommend Colonel Grayson as a man of 
extraordinary merit. He sets out soon to make application to the Congress for an establishment. If 
we have, as we must, a Continental Hospital in the 
Southern Department, Dr. McClary, I suppose, will 
be the man to direct it. I need not mention his 
qualifications, they are so well known. I beg you 
will make somebody write to me from time to time. 
</p><p>
Indeed, I think I may modestly insist on Mr. Palfrey's pen being employed often in this service. 
Adieu, dear General. 
</p><p>
Yours, most respectfully and sincerely, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The most compendious method to give you an idea 
of the state of your Province, is to inclose to you 
the result of a Council of Officers, every article of 
which is approved by your Convention. We have 
just received an express from North Carolina, informing  us of the arrival of eight large transports in 
Cape Fear River, in the whole containing, as it is 
supposed, about two thousand men. I had before, on 
a suspicion of their arrival, detached a battalion of 
riflemen, and shall set out myself the day after tomorrow. 
The Convention has ordered twelve hundred militia 
or minute-men to that Province. My command, as 
you may easily conceive, is extremely perplexing 
from the consideration of the vast extent of the 
valuable parts of this country, intersected by such a 
variety of navigable waters, and the expedition with 
which the enemy, furnished with canvas wings, can 
fly from one spot to another. Had we arms for the 
minute-men, and half a dozen good field engineers, we 
might laugh at their efforts; but in this article (like 
the rest of the Continent) we are miserably deficient. 
Engineers we have but two ; and they threaten to 
resign, as it is impossible that they should subsist 
on a more wretched pittance than common carpenters 
or bricklayers can earn. I have written to the congress, entreating them to augment the pay. A word 
from you would, I make no doubt, effect it. 
</p><p>
I wish, my dear General, you would send me Captain Smith, on condition Congress make it worth his 
while ; otherwise, I have not the conscience to propose it. I am well pleased with your officers in 
general, and the men are good, some Irish rascals 
excepied. I have formed two companies of grenadiers to each regiment, and with spears of thirteen 
feet long. Their rifles (for they are all riflemen) 
sling over their shoulders ; their appearance is formidable, and the men are conciliated to the weapon. I 
am likewise furnishing myself with four-ounced rifle-amusettes, which will carry an infernal distance ; the 
two-ounced hit a half sheet of paper five hundred 
yards distant. So much for military. 
</p><p>
A noble spirit possesses the Convention. They are 
almost unanimous for independence, but differ in their 
sentiments about the mode ; two days will decide it. 
I have the pleasure to inform you that I am extremely well in the opinion of the senatorial part, as 
well as of the people at large. God send me grace 
to preserve it ! But their neighbours of Maryland (I 
mean their Council of Safety) make a most damnable 
clamor (as I am informed) on the subject of a letter 
I wrote to the Chairman of the Committee of <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>, to seize the person and papers of Mr. Eden, 
upon the discovery which was communicated to me 
of his treacherous correspondence with the Secretary 
of State. It was a measure not only justifiable in 
the eyes of God and men, but absolutely necessary. 
The Committee of Safety here are indeed as deep in 
the scrape as myself. The Congress must, and will, 
I dare say, support and vindicate the measure. 
</p><p>
Captain Green and his party are upon their march, 
as you ordered. I was a d d blockhead for bringing  them so far, as their accounts will be intricate ; 
but I hope not so intricate as not to be unriddled. 
I send you an account of the money I advanced to 
the different officers, to Captains Smith, Lunt, and 
Green. I have taken the liberty to appoint a sergeant Denmark, of the Rifle battalion, to do duty as 
Ensign. lie is a man of worth, and I beg you 
will confirm his commission. Another Sergeant, of 
the same battalion, I have promoted to the rank of 
second Lieutenant in the Artillery of this Province. 
He is a German, his name Holmer, and very deserving . If little Eustace cannot be provided for with 
you, I could wish, if there is a cheap method of doing  it, you would send him to me, as I have it in 
my power to please him, and quite doat upon him. 
</p><p>
My love to Mrs. <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>, Gates, and her bad 
half, to Moylan; but Palfrey is a scoundrel for not 
writing. Adieu, my dear General.

</p><p>
MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have the happiness to congratulate you on a very signal success (if I may not call it a victory), 
which we have gained over the mercenary instruments of the British tyrant. I shall not trouble you with a detail of their manoeuvres or delays, but defer it to another time, when I have more leisure to 
write, and you to attend. Let it suffice, that having lost an opportunity (such as I hope will never again present itself) of taking the town, which, on my arrival, was utterly defenceless, the Commodore thought proper, on Friday last, with, his whole squadron, consisting of two fifties, six frigates, and a bomb (the 
rates of which you will see in the inclosed list), to attack our fort on Sullivan's Island. 
</p><p>
They dropped their anchors about eleven in the 
forenoon, at the distance of three or four yards be 
fore the front battery. I was myself, at this time, 
in a boat, endeavouring to make the Island; but the 
wind and tide being violently against us, drove us 
on the main. They immediately commenced the most 
furious fire I ever heard or saw. I confess I was in 
pain, from the little confidence I reposed in our 
troops ; the officers being all boys, and the men raw 
recruits. What augmented my anxiety was, that we 
had no bridge finished for retreat, or communication ; 
and the creek, or cove, which separates it from the 
continent, is near a mile wide. I had received, like 
wise, intelligence that their land troops intended at 
the same time to land and assault, I never in my 
life felt myself so uneasy; and what added to my 
uneasiness was, that I knew our stock of ammunition 
was miserably low. I had once thoughts of ordering 
the commanding officer to spike his guns, and, when 
his ammunition was spent, to retreat with as little loss 
as possible. However, I thought proper previously to 
send to town for a fresh supply, if it could possibly 
})e procured, and ordered my Aid-de-camp, Mr. Byrd, 
(who is a lad of magnanimous courage) to pass over 
in a small canoe, and report the state of the spirit 
of the garrison. If it had been low, I should have 
abandoned all thoughts of defence. His report was 
flattering. I then determined to maintain the post at all risks, and passed the creek or cove, in a small 
boat, in order to animate the garrison in proprid persona ; but I found they had no occasion for such encouragement. 
</p><p>
They were pleased with my visit, and assured me 
they never would abandon the post but with their 
lives. The cool courage they displayed astonished 
and enraptured me, for I do assure you, my dear 
General, I never experienced a hotter fire. Twelve 
full hours it was continued without intermission. The 
noble fellows, who were mortally wounded, conjured 
their brethren never to abandon the standard of li 
berty. Those who lost their limbs deserted not their 
posts. Upon the whole, they acted like Romans in 
the third century. However, our works were so 
good and solid, that we lost but few; only ten killed 
on the spot, and twenty-two wounded, seven of whom 
lost their legs or arms. The loss of the enemy, as 
you will perceive by the inclosed list, was very 
great. As I send a detail to the Congress, I shall 
not trouble you with a duplicate ; but, before I fin 
ish, you must suffer me to recommend to your esteem, friendship, and patronage my (though young) 
Aids-de-camp, Byrd and Morris, whose good sense, 
integrity, activity, and valor, promise to their country 
a most fruitful crop of essential services. Mr. Jenifer, 
of Maryland, a gentleman of fortune, and not of the 
age when the blood of men flows heroically, has 
shown not less spirit than these youngsters. I may 
venture to recommend in these high terms, because 
the trial was severe. 
</p><p>
Colonel Moultrie, who commanded the garrison, deserves the highest honors. The manifest intention 
of the enemy was to land, at the same time the 
ships began to fire, their whole regulars on the east end of the Island. Twice they attempted it, and twice 
were repulsed by a Colonel Thompson, of the South 
Carolina Rangers, in conjunction with a body of 
North Carolina regulars. Upon the whole, the South 
and North Carolina troops and Virginia Rifle battalion we have here, are admirable soldiers. The enemy 
is now returned to their old station on this side the 
bar. What their intention is, I cannot divine. One 
of the five deserters, who came over to us this day, 
is the most intelligent fellow I ever met with. The 
accounts of their particular loss and situation are his, 
and I think they may be depended upon. 
</p><p>
For God's sake, my dear General, urge the congress to furnish me with a thousand cavalry. With 
a thousand cavalry I could insure the safety of these 
Southern Provinces ; and without cavalry, I can an 
swer for nothing. I proposed a scheme in Virginia 
for raising a body almost without any expense. The 
scheme was relished by the gentlemen of Virginia, but 
I am told the project was censured by some members 
of the Congress, on the principle that a military servant should not take the liberty to propose any 
thing. This opinion I sincerely subscribe to, when 
our distance from the sovereign is so small, and the 
danger so remote, as to admit of proposing, deliberating, resolving, and approving ; but when a General is 
at a vast distance, and the enemy close to him, I 
humbly conceive that it is his duty to propose and 
adopt any thing, without other authority than the 
public safety. From want of this species of troops, 
we had infallibly lost this Capital, but the dilatoriness and stupidity of the enemy saved us. 
</p><p>
I this instant learn that the Commodore is fixing 
buoys on the bar, which indicates an intention of 
quitting the place. It is probable that they will bend 
their course to Hampton, or Chesapeake Bay. 
</p><p>
I am extremely happy, dear General, that you are 
at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, for their counsels sometimes lack a 
little military electricity. 
</p><p>
I have ordered the Adjutant-General to send you 
a return; I mean only a return of the strength of 
this place. I suppose it will be imperfect, for it is 
an Herculean labor, to a South Carolina officer, to 
make any detail. God bless you, my dear General, 
and crown you with success, as I am, 
</p><p>
Most entirely and affectionately, yours, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=daw" rel="me">CHARLES LEE</a>.

P. S. I am made quite happy by the resolution of Congress to keep Canada. Had it been relinquished, all would have been lost.

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
This instant came express, from Colonel Tupper, 
(stationed opposite to Dobbs's Ferry), one David Keech. The substance of his intelligence is as follows. That the enemy began their march at nine 
this morning, down the river, with their baggage, artillery, &c. ; that the man-of-war and two store-ships 
had just set sail, and were making down (I mean 
those which came up last); that three ships still lie off Tarry town and Sing Sing, two at the former, and 
one at the latter. Keech says the whole army have 
quitted Dobbs's Ferry, and imagines the rear have 
by this time reached King's Bridge. 
</p><p>
I am far from being satisfied with the conduct of 
our scouts. I do not think they venture far enough, 
for they generally bring back very lame, imperfect 
accounts. But I have projected a plan for breaking 
in, at least, upon Rogers's party, and believe I shall 
succeed. The sentence on Austin is, that he should 
be reprimanded; but I have ordered a new court-martial, with a charge of wanton, barbarous conduct, 
unbecoming, not only an officer, but a human creature. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a></a> and the Massachusetts Committee 
are using their efforts to detain the militia; whether 
they will succeed, heaven only knows. Hitchcock 
and Yarnum do not recollect the recommendation of 
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a></a>, but I have ordered them to give me 
a list of those who they think ought to be recommended ; for it is now too late to refer to Greene, 
as the Commissioners are expected every hour. I 
wish to God you were here, as I am in a manner a 
stranger to their respective merits. When the list is 
made out, I shall inform myself, as well as I can, if 
their recommendation is impartial, and proceed accordingly. I am, dear General,

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The recommendation of <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a></a>, which you 
transmitted to me ; threw the officers to whom. I communicated it into so great a flame of discontent, that 
I ventured, notwithstanding your orders, to hesitate. 
They accused him of partiality to his connections and 
townsmen, to the prejudice of men of manifestly superior merit. Indeed, it appears, from the concurrent 
testimony of unbiased persons, that some of the subjects he recommended were wretched. In short, I 
was so stunned with their clamor, that I delayed till 
the arrival of the Committee, for which I ought to 
ask your pardon. But, at the same time, I think the 
delay has been salutary. 
</p><p>
My objections to moving from our present post 
are, as I observed before, that it would give us the 
air of being frightened; it would expose a fine fertile 
country to their ravages ; and I must add, that we 
are as secure as we could be in any position what 
ever. We are pretty well disencumbered of our impediments, which I propose depositing in or about 
Crompond, which (though I confess I have not reconnoitred the place), from its situation, must be full as 
safe, and is much more centrical than <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>. If, on further examination, it has any material disadvantages, we can easily move from thence. 
</p><p>
As to ourselves, light as we are, several retreats 
present themselves. In short, if we keep a good 
look out, we are in no danger; but I must entreat 
your Excellency to enjoin the officers posted at Fort 
Lee to give us the quickest intelligence, if they observe any embarkations of troops in the North River. 
Our scouts are of late grown more vigilant, and make 
prisoners. The militia, according to their laudable 
custom, would not stay a moment beyond their usual 
time. Oh, General, why would you be overpersuaded 
by men of inferior judgment to your own? It was 
a cursed affair. 
</p><p>
Yours, most affectionately, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=daw" rel="me">CHARLES LEE</a>.

to the mode you require, are not yet made out, but 
will soon, and shall be sent.

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
It never was my idea to leave the Highlands unguarded, but only for expedition's sake that Heath 
should detach two thousand of his corps immediately 
over the river, and to replace these two thousand by 
the same number, the most lightly accoutred, from 
this body here, till the main body, with their bag 
gage, cannon, &c., could move. I conceived this movement could be attended with no risk, as he has now 
nothing to guard but the western passages; for there 
is no possibility of their approaching by the eastern, 
having, as I can learn, no vessels on the eastern 
river to transport their cannon, and the road from 
King's Bridge by land is now almost impracticable.
</p><p>
Yesterday they drew T themselves in, and we made 
a sweep of the country from Phillips's house. Part of 
the army have moved on. I set out to-morrow. JNo 
militia are come in to cover the country. I have 
wrote most pressing letters on this subject to Trumbull, and hope they will have effect. I have been 
equally urgent with Mr. Bowdoin for blankets, shoes, 
&c. Indeed, our soldiers are not in a moving condition, but seem well disposed, and engage themselves 
beyond expectation. But we are in great want of 
money for bounty. I have been under the necessity, 
without authority, to draw for this purpose. Several 
deserters, come out to-day, inform us that a consider 
able embarkation is made for Amboy. 
</p><p>
I shall take care to obey your Excellency's order, 
in regard to my march, as exactly as possible; and am,

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The consequences of the enemy's possessing themselves of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> have appeared to me so terrible, 
that I have scarcely been able to sleep from apprehensions on the subject. These apprehensions daily 
increase. You have it in your power, at present, to 
prevent this dreadful event. If I do not mistake, the 
Congress have given you authority to take any step 
in that place, as well as here, which you shall think 
necessary for the public service ; but if they have not 
given you expressly and literally authority with respect to the city of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, I am confident that 
any measure you think right to plan and put in execution will be approved of. 
</p><p>
I have the greatest reason to believe, from the most authentic intelligence, that the best members of the 
Congress expect that you would take much upon your self; as referring every matter of importance to them 
is, in fact, defeating the project. We have an instance of this in the fate of the motion for seizing the person of Mr. Tryon. To you they look up for decision 
by your conduct they are to be inspired with decision. In fact, your situation is such that the salvation 
of the whole depends on your striking, at certain crises, vigorous strokes, without previously communicating your intention. On this principle I venture to 
propose the following scheme, and to offer myself for the execution. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> must be secured ; but it will never, I am 
afraid, be secured by direct order of the Congress, for 
obvious reasons. They find themselves awkwardly 
situated on this head ; you must step in to their relief. 
I am sensible that no men can be spared from the 
lines in our present circumstances; but I would propose that you should detach me into Connecticut, and 
lend your name for collecting a body of volunteers. 
I am assured that I shall find no difficulty in assembling a sufficient number for the purposes wanted. 
This body, in conjunction (if there should appear occasion to summon them) with the Jersey Regiment 
under the command of Lord Stirling, now at <a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a>, will effect the security of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and 
the expulsion or suppression of that dangerous banditti of Tories, who have appeared in Long Island, 
with the professed intention of acting against the 
authority of the Congress. Not to crush these serpents, before their rattles are grown, would be ruinous. 
</p><p>
I am assured, likewise, that the Connecticut volunteers, who will offer themselves for the service, will 
expect no pay, but, at most, the expenses of their 
provisions and perhaps of carriages for the conveyance 
of their baggage. When once we have secured the 
place with strict fortifications, and engaged the Friends 
of Liberty so far that they cannot recede, purged the 
City and Long Island of the leading Tories, the residence of these Connecticut volunteers will be no longer necessary; for there is no reason to doubt that 
the Congress will detach troops from Pennsylvania to 
garrison the place, although, from reasons hinted at, 
they may not choose to commence the operation. This 
manoeuvre I not only think prudent and right, but 
absolutely necessary to our salvation ; and if it meets, 
as I ardently hope it will, with your approbation, 
the sooner it is entered upon the better. Indeed, 
the delay of a single day may be fatal. I am, dear 
General, 
</p><p>
Yours most respectfully, 
</p><p>
