SIR, 
</p><p>
Since my last, of the 30th ultimo, per Barry, I had 
the honor of receiving and presenting to Congress 
your Excellency's favor of the 29th of that month, 
which, having been taken under consideration, the in 
closed act was this day resolved, for empowering 
your Excellency, when you shall judge it necessary, 
to call on the States of Maryland, Pennsylvania, and 
New Jersey, for five thousand militia-men, armed and 
accoutred. I have the honor to be, with great esteem 
and respect, Sir, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hel" rel="me">HENRY LAURENS</a>, President of Congress. 
</p><p>
P. S. Evening, 9 o'clock. M. de Francis this moment delivered me your Excellency's favor of the 1st 
instant, which shall be presented to Congress on 
Monday. Meantime permit me, Sir, to intimate that 
I had backed the report of your Excellency's letter as part of a speech in Parliament, May 26th, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>, with the following preliminary remarks ; "I accompanied my letter to Congress by 
one to General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>, wherein, upon an opinion of his character, I asked him for his support to an application that could not interfere with the public duties of our respective situations. I shall 
beg leave to read his answer as part of my speech ; and I do it. 
Sir, not only lest, in these times of doubt and aspersion, I should 
incur censure for holding private correspondence with an enemy, but 
likewise because I think the letter, though from an enemy, does 
honor to the human heart." 
</p><p>
While <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel=''>General Burgoyne</a> was at <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel=''>General Schuyler</a>'s house, in <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, he wrote as follows to Lord George Germain, October 20th, 
<a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>, concerning the American troops. 
</p><p>
"I should now hold myself unjustifiable, if I did not confide to 
your Lordship my opinion, upon a near inspection, of the rebel troops. 
The standing corps, which I have seen, are disciplined. I do not 
of the 27th of February with an information to Congress, that one gentleman of the late Committee on 
the <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> inquiry had retired, and that it was 
impracticable for me to give that attention which 
was due to an affair of such importance. A new 
Committee was immediately appointed. These gentlemen, some eight or ten days ago, offered a report, 
when Mr. Duer interposed arguments, which induced 
the House to postpone the consideration for two 
days. 
</p><p>
I have taken the liberty to name that gentleman, 
because his declared motives for delay were coupled 
with assurances of particular considerations respecting 
<a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel=''>General Schuyler</a>. This very morning I called on 
Mr. Duer, and reminded him of his engagements, 
urging the painful situation in which his friends and 
the other General Officers remained. He replied, " I 
will soon bring on that business." Your Excellency's 
present letter will prove a further incitement. I 
have very long felt for the gentlemen who are subjects of the inquiry ; and, although it was with extreme reluctance I obeyed the order of Congress to 
be of the original Committee, after having urged 
such reasons for exemption as appeared to me very 
forcible, yet I cannot charge myself with delinquency at any stage in the course of our proceedings. 
To account for the uncouth and entangled state of 
this inquiry, would not be half so difficult, as it hard the term, but apply it to the great fundamental points of 
military institution; sobriety, subordination, regularity, and courage. 
The militia are inferior in method and movement, but not a jot less 
serviceable in woods. My conjectures were very different after the 
affair of <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, but I am convinced they were delusive; and 
it is a duty to the state to confess it. The panic of the rebel troops 
is confined, and of short duration ; the enthusiasm is extensive and 
permanent." might be impertinent to the proper line of my correspondence. From this consideration I shall only 
add, that I trust your Excellency's present application will have that weight which is justly due.

SIR, 
</p><p>
I had the honor of writing to your Excellency, the 
4th, by Jones ; since which I have presented to Congress your Excellency's favors of the 1st, 3d, and 4th. 
Upon reading the first, I took occasion to intimate 
to Mr. Duer the distressed situation of his friend 
<a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel=''>General Schuyler</a>, as described by the General himself in a late letter of the 15th of March, and this 
morning suggested again to the House the demands 
of all the General Officers, subjects of the suspended 
inquiry. I shall repeat the same to-morrow ; and, 
having just now obtained the concurrence of gentlemen in private conversation, that Congress are 
guardians of the honor of their officers, I flatter 
myself there will be no further delay of this business. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will receive, under the present inclosure, an act of Congress of the 7th, for promoting 
Captain Lee to the rank of Major of horse, and to 
the command of a separate corps. I perceive it is 
not expressed in the act; but I am warranted to as 
sure your Excellency it is the particular desire of 
Congress that suitable declarations of that gentleman's 
merit should be expressed, either within the intended 
commission, or by annexing to it the above-mentioned 
act, a certified copy of which Major Lee will receive 
by the present despatch.* 
</p><p>
Consideration of Colonel Lee and Major Swasey's 
application is postponed a few days for particular reasons. I shall direct the Secretary of Congress to 
collect the dates of the late resignations of Colonels 
in the Virginia line, and transmit an account to your Excellency, when obtained. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's last letter of the 4th is at present the subject of a special Committee. It is probable a report will be offered to-morrow morning. 
</p><p>
Previous to the receipt of your Excellency's ad 
vis, Congress had determined to make a purchase 
of divers articles, set forth in Captain Cottineau's 
schedule of his cargo ; and for this purpose a gentle 
man will proceed, to-morrow, on his journey to Cape 
Lookout, by whom your Excellency's letter will go 
forward. I have the honor to be, with the highest esteem and regard, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's obedient and humble servant,

SIR, 
</p><p>
I had the honor of writing to your Excellency the 
24th instant, by McKlosky. Yesterday, about half 
past 5 o clock, P. M., your Excellency's favor of the 
25th was brought to me in Congress, and was immediately presented. The person who had been the 
bearer of it was anxious to obtain a receipt of the 
letter to express the time of delivery, and he complained of unnecessary detention half the day at the 
Suscjuehanna Ferry. This intimation will answer his 
purpose. 
</p><p>
I am directed, by Congress, to request your Excellency will immediately require all officers, civil as well 
as military, in the army, who are at present delinquent, to comply with the terms of an act of Congress 
of the 3d of February last, by taking the oath of 
allegiance and abjuration, and that your Excellency 
will be pleased to cause the necessary certificates as 
speedily as possible to be returned, and if occasion 
shall be given, which is supposed to be scarcely possible, the name or names of such persons as shall 
refuse. 
</p><p>
The bearer hereof will deliver three packets, containing about six hundred blanks, which will hasten 
the business of administering oaths. More shall be 
sent by the next messenger. 
</p><p>
In considering the article of provision to be made for officers, who shall continue in the army to the end 
of the war, Congress had proceeded so far last night 
as resolving, that one half the present pay be continued during life, without exceptions of country, to 
all such officers as shall also take the oath of allegiance, and actually reside within the United States. 
This resolution, and the whole plan for the military establishment, is subject to further discussion, respecting the propriety of transmitting it to the several 
States for concurrence. I have the honor to be, with 
the highest respect and esteem, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant,

</p><p>
SIR. 
</p><p>
The newspapers which I received, from your Excellency, in company with the honor of your Excellency's letter of the 18th, afford me sometimes amusement in intervals from the necessary duties of my 
present station ; and I am particularly indebted to 
your Excellency for the notice which is included in 
the kindness of this favor. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency is too well acquainted with the 
integrity of your own heart, and too well assured of 
the good opinion of your countrymen., to admit any 
anxious impression from the forgeries of an enemy. 
I am disposed to vote for every exertion in our power, in order to defeat their designs against us, 
except following such of their examples as will, when 
related in history, greatly abate from that character 
for generosity, which England, and upon good ground, 
once boasted. The late attempt, by publishing forged 
resolves of Congress within a garrisoned town, immediately under the eye of a Commander-in-chief, appears to me to be mean and scandalous, and must be 
considered in the same light by every good English 
man, military, or in public or private life. 
</p><p>
We are now 7 verging towards a most important 
crisis, when all the wisdom of these States will be 
required. Permit me, Sir, to lay before you my private sentiments. If the time shall come for appointing a deputation for treating with British Commissioners on terms for establishing peace, 1 hold it necessary that able men be called forth for that purpose from any place within the Union, without con 
fining our election within any one State or body. I 
entreat your Excellency's pardon for this freedom, and 
that you will believe me m to be, with the most sincere esteem and attachment, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your obliged, and most obedient servant,

SIR, 
</p><p>
My last trouble to your Excellency was dated the 
30th ultimo, by Rosse. The present will cover an 
act of that date for ascertaining the rank and pay 
annexed to Brevet commissions. Whether this is, or 
is not, intended to have a retrospective effect, I think 
is not clearly expressed by the letter ; and, as I apprehend such operation may, in many instances, give 
umbrage, I shall embrace the first proper opportunity 
of obtaining an explanation of the act, or information 
to my own understanding. 
</p><p>
I despatch this messenger principally to inform 
your Excellency of an event, the knowledge of which 
may nevertheless very probably have reached camp that body I have, therefore, commended your desire, and with it havo 
lodged the copies you sent. 
</p><p>
" Had proposals of this kind been properly and sincerely made by 
the Court of Britain to the Supreme Authority of America, before 
the wanton cruelty which has marked the progress of the British 
arms in this country had taken place, or prior to our declaring ourselves independent, and entering into allians with foreign powers, 
they would have been accepted with sentiments of gratitude. But at 
this time, all proposals, except for a peace upon honorable and equal terms, must be ineffectual." 
</p><p>
Copies of the same Bills were sent to <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel=''>Governor Trumbull</a> by Governor Tryon from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. The following extracts are from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel=''>Governor Trumbull</a>'s answer. 
</p><p>
" Your letter of the 1 7th instant, from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, is received, with 
its inclosures, and the several similar packets of various addresses 
with which it was accompanied. 
</p><p>
"Propositions of peace are usually made from the supreme authority of one contending power to the similar authority of the other; 
and the present is the first instance, within my recollection, where a 
vague, half-blank, and very indefinite draft of a Bill, once only read 
before one of three bodies of the Legislature of a nation, has ever 
been addressed to the people at large of the opposite power, of an 
before this can arrive there, as our messenger from 
France, Mr. Simeon Deane, had spoken, everywhere 
on his journey to <a href='/results.php?city=york' rel='city'>York</a>, of the treaties between the 
Court of Versailles and the United States of Ame 
rica, which were executed on the 6th of February. 
<a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>. These were read in Congress late last evening, and will probably be ratified and published in 
the course of the present week, except a secret article, which it is also probable is very well known 
abroad. Be this as it may, I view the treaties of 
alliance and commerce, although not free from exception, as circumstances of advantage to these United 
States, and which afford a bottom for vast improvements. I beg leave, therefore, to congratulate with 
your Excellency, and with every friend to the great 
American cause. I shall move Congress, to-morrow, 
to order duplicates of the treaties to be immediately 
transmitted to your Excellency ; in the mean time 
this of a letter from Doctor Franklin and Mr. 
</p><p>
Deane, which will go inclosed, will communicate the 
great outlines. I have the honor to be, with the 
highest esteem and regard, Sir,

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
In a public letter, which I had the honor of writing to your Excellency the 3d instant, by Major 
Price, I sent a number of handbills calculated for 
giving satisfactory information to the public, who were 
anxious to learn the recent intelligence from France. 
One article of this has been questioned, respecting 
the King of Prussia's promise, the only part of the 
performance that can be called mine. I believe my 
authority is good. Ird, under the 16th February, 
informs me, " the King of Prussia has given the most 
explicit and unequivocal assurance, that he will be 
the second power in Europe to acknowledge the in 
dependence of America." It is true our Commissioners, in their public advices, are not so express, nor 
are they, in my opinion, so full and clear in some 
other respects, as they might have been. 
</p><p>
Human nature pervades every human breast. A 
residence at Paris will not exempt men from infirmities of the mind ; nor is even the momentous concern 
of guardianship to thirteen United States, an infant 
world in danger of being crushed by the hand of 
violence, paramount to those curses upon mankind, 
pride and covetousness, sours from whence all the 
evils of this life spring. Our Ambassadorial Commissioners, of which your Excellency cannot be ignorant, 
are unhappily divided in sentiments. Jarrings and 
appeals have followed. Intelligence, intended for the 
public, loses part of that fulness and perspicuity, 
which would have appeared in candid and united 
counsels. I have seen so much of the world as to be 
guarded against surprise at any thing. No inconsiderable benefit results from attempts to reconcile, and 
even sweeten, the most untoward circumstances which 
happen in one's journey through it. I apprehend it 
would break in on your Excellency's time,, otherwise 
I would have troubled you with Mr. Ird's letter, not 
merely for information, but for a hope that something 
might be devised for promoting concord between our friends onder, or the public good, by a wise cooperation. But I will not dwell upon this subject. 
</p><p>
Last night I had the honor of receiving your Excellency's favor of the last of April, and am happy 
in finding a confirmation of my sentiments respecting 
persons proper for treating with the expected deputation from our adversary. I fear the determination, 
where only this point can be determined, will be contrary. Be it so ; thank God we have here some men 
of abilities and integrity. I hope we shall make a 
judicious choice. The act of Congress of the 22d 
April will blot out pages of the British instructions. 
The Commissioners from that side will perceive a 
necessity for taking a new departure from the Tower 
of Independence ; and what happened in France, on 
the 6th of February, will oblige them to shape a new 
course. From the absence of the Commissioners, I 
presume they had not sailed from England on the 
10th of March. It may have been found expedient, at 
St. James's, to vest them with more ample powers, it 
they meant to come, than were originally intended, 
and under new sanctions of Parliament ; a work of 
slow progress. The people would have much to say. 
That the nation were more than a little agitated, appears from a letter, which I take the liberty of in 
closing for your Excellency's perusal. I have like 
wise a letter from the mercantile line in London, 
which proves to me the people in general had very sensibly felt the weight of the war, were ardently desirous of peace, and anxious lest Congress should reject the intended propositions. 
</p><p>
The long, arid, as I humbly think, unnecessary delay of the army arrangement, is very afflicting. I 
know it must give extreme pain to your Excellency. 
It is improper for me to touch upon the cause, especially when it is so well known that Congress have 
been engaged in very important business. The plan 
introduced for that part of it which is intended to establish a half-pay for officers during life, I have 
been uniformly averse from, and in a committee of 
Congress delivered my objections. These appear to 
me, at this moment, of more weight, because they have 
not been removed by the reasonings which have been 
offered against them, and I may, without vanity, think 
myself not obstinate. I am open to conviction, and 
always, without murmuring, submit to a majority. I 
view the scheme as altogether unjust and unconstitutional in its nature, and full of dangerous consequences. It is an unhappy dilemma to which we 
seem to be reduced. Provide for your officers in terms dictated to you, or lose all the valuable soldiers 
among them ; establish a pension for officers, make 
them a separate body, to be provided for by the 
honest yeomanry, and others of their fellow-citizens, 
many thousands of whom have equal claims upon 
every ground of loss of estate, health, &c,, or lose 
your army and your cause. That such provision will 
be against the grain of the people, has been unwarily 
testified by its advocates, whom I have heard con 
verse upon the subject. Indeed, they have furnished 
strong ground for opposition against an immediate 
compliance with the demand. If we cannot make 
justice one of the pillars, necessity may be submitted to at present; but republicans will, at a pro 
per time, withdraw a grant which will appear to have 
been extorted. 
</p><p>
Were I in private conversation with an officer on 
this point, I should not despair of fairly balancing 
every grievance he might suppose to be peculiar to 
the army, by instances of losses and inconveniences 
in my own property and person ; and I count myself 
very happy, compared with thousands who have as 
faithfully adhered to our original compact. It is said, 
gentlemen did not think the war would have continued so long. Forgive me, Sir, a ludicrous remark 
which I made early in our contest, indeed in Eng 
land, before the commencement of the contest. " I 
know my countrymen are good for the quarter, but I 
have doubts of their going the course." There is a 
certain versatility, habitual if not almost constitutional, in men born south of thirty-eight degrees of 
latitude, in these States. circumstances, which have 
occurred in the progress of this war, have given 
strength to my observation. 
</p><p>
There are, within that division of America, not only 
objects inviting, but temptations almost irresistible, to 
change, to say nothing of the general train of education. Hence, it is easy to account for a resignation of a commission, which had been anxiously solicited by 
scores. The want of something is made an excuse, 
and even sometimes by worthy characters, who do 
not suspect themselves. Would to God, gentlemen 
had followed the noble, patriotic example of their 
Commander-in-chief, a plan which, reflection will show 
them in a shade of disgrace, would never have found 
place in their minds. How superior are many of the 
gentlemen, now in my contemplation (for I know 
many with whom I do not converse), to the acceptance of a half-pay, contributed to by widows and orphans of soldiers who had bled and died by their 
sides ! shackled with a condition of being excluded 
from the privilege of serving in officers, in common 
with their fellow-citizens voted in every House of 
Assembly as the drones and incumbrances of society, 
pointed at by boys and girls, there goes a man, who 
every year robs me of part of my pittance. I think, 
Sir, I do not overstrain. This will be the language 
of republicans ; how pungent, when applied to gentlemen who shall have stepped from the army into a 
good remaining estate ; how much deeper to some, 
who, in idleness and by speculation, have amassed estates in the war ! 
</p><p>
This, Sir, is a large field. Virtue and honor might 
be summoned to answer, but it is time for me to for 
bear. I am obliged to write in haste, called upon by 
particular public duties. Besides, I feel a full assurance, notwithstanding the present seeming contrariety, that my sentiments, when fully explained, will 
not differ essentially from your Excellency s. I must 
not, however, conclude without these declarations, that 
I am not among those to whom may be applied, 
" Our God and soldier we adore, in time of danger, 
&c." I am most heartily disposed to distinguish the gallant officers and soldiers, by the most liberal marks 
of esteem, desirous of making proper provision for all 
who shall stand in need. I would not except even 
some of the brave, whose expenses have been princely in extravagance, while they complained of insufficiency of pay. 
</p><p>
I have ever detested, and never practised, Parliamentary jockeyings for procrastinating an unpalatable 
business, which, as a silent auditor and spectator, I 
have, within some time past, known to be alternately adopted. I most sincerely wish the army had been 
wisely attended to. The high esteem I from gratitude bear for your Excellency, whose sufferings from a contrary conduct I know must have been great, 
as well as my love of despatch, makes me wish it ; 
and I lament that, in some degree, we are likely to 
be indebted more to the policy and deep projects of 
other men for our deliverance, than to our own wisdom and fortitude. I am, with the most sincere respect, and the most respectful affection and esteem, 
dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obliged servant.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
My colleague, Mr. Drayton, having shown me, about a fortnight ago, the draft of a report which he had 
prepared, stating charges against the General Officers 
who lately abandoned <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, and flattering me 
with assurances that he would soon offer it to Congress, I delayed replying to your Excellency's favor 
of the 29th ultimo, hoping for ground to intimate 
that that business was ready to be despatched to your Excellency, for the further necessary order ; but, to 
my great mortification, it continues to be procrastinated. Some of the gentlemen of the Committee are, 
or have been, desirous of new lights. In a word, Sir, 
I am quite in opinion with those gentlemen who say, 
"the not proceeding in this matter is cruel and oppressive," although I am as well convinced the delay has not been calculated or intended to distress 
the parties affected. It has arisen from a vapid, desultory habit, which, if I am not mistaken, I have 
seen squander millions, and endanger States. I speak 
with warmth, and, I believe, with equal truth. On 
my country's account, as well as from a feeling for 
the culprit officers, I am really ashamed of our con 
duct respecting the particular affair in question. How 
ever, as I can always take a decent freedom with my 
colleague, who is really a diligent man, I will not let 
him pass a day unreminded of the necessity for bringing forward his report. I sent off a messenger to 
day, with a letter to <a href='/results.php?city=lancaster' rel='city'>Lancaster</a>, at his request, for 
collecting somewhat relative to the business, and I 
think he hinted, that when that ingredient should be 
obtained, the report would be complete. 
</p><p>
Frequent items have been given in public of the 
disagreements of our Commissioners. This day a private perusal of papers, treating on that subject, gave 
me much pain. I fear an investigation, upon the arrival of Mr. Dearie, who is every hour expected, will spread the trouble wide. I have suppressed all that 
has been written to me, and have sealed my lips, except to your Excellency and one other gentleman. I 
know all the gentlemen onder, some of them very 
intimately; know their tempers and habits, and think 
I can mark out causes ; but I can only deplore their 
impolitic, and, I was going to say, school-boy jarrings, 
and dread the consequences of a heated and injudicious discussion on this side. 
</p><p>
Wi. Late last night your Excellency's public letter of the 7th was brought to me. I shall lay it 
before Congress at 10 o clock. Lord Abingdon's protest does honor to <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel=''>Mr. Morris</a>, of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> ; the 
merit of our resolves, of 22d April, is fairly to be 
ascribed to him. 
</p><p>
I have lately much regretted that I had it not in 
my power to transmit to your Excellency some of the 
English papers which we had received, and which, 
indeed, came originally into my own hands ; but judged it my duty to present them to the House, w T here 
they were so and so suddenly dispersed, as to 
</p><p>
deprive me of the reading even of one of them; yet 
I dare not say I will take better care another time ; 
my own duty will be to do as I have done. 
</p><p>
In order to save time, I have sent to the Secretary's office a young man to copy the resolves of 
Congress, required by your Excellency, and which 
will be found here inclosed. 1 am, with the most 
sincere regard and esteem, Sir, your Excellency's 
Much obliged, and most obedient servant,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
It has not been in my power ; with any convenience, to make an earlier acknowledgment of your Excellency's favor of the 11th. 
</p><p>
There were letters in the Commissioners packet 
only for Congress, and particular members then present in the House. One, for Mr. E. Rutledge, unsealed, and several, also unsealed, were brought, as 
being taken from the express. The utmost caution 
is necessary, in the present conjuncture of our affairs ; 
and, therefore, had any suspicious directions turned 
up, such should have passed under the eye of Con 
gress. The idea of opening other people's letters is 
exceedingly abhorrent to me ; but I think Congress 
have a power over letters equal, at least, to that 
which necessity obliges them sometimes to exercise 
over persons; but Governor Johnstone is too well 
hackneyed in the ways of men to trust his deep 
schemes within our reach. 
</p><p>
His private letter to me, by the by, is, notwithstanding all his good sense, no proof of an infallible 
judgment; I am sure it is one of his having mis 
taken his man. I take the liberty of transmitting it, 
together with my intended answer, and the letters 
from Mr. Oswald and Mr. Manning, under this cover, 
for your Excellency's perusal. There are some traits 
in Mr. Oswald's, which strongly imply a determination, on the part of Great Britain, but reserved as 
the ultimatum, to submit to our independence. I am 
much inclined to believe the Commissioners now are, 
or soon will be, vested with powers for that purpose. 
Mr. Oswald is a gentleman of solid understanding 
and quick perception, of a very large, independent 
fortune, much exceeding a quarter of a million sterling ; often consulted by administration. For the 
goodness of his heart, I refer you to this particular part of his character; he is no placeman, but much esteemed by the first men of each of the political 
parties. Great reliance may be placed upon what he 
writes, or even hints. 
</p><p>
Yesterday there was an extraordinary motion on 
our floor for calling upon members to lay before 
Congress such letters as they had received from the 
Commissioners, or other persons, meaning persons in 
Great Britain, on political subjects. I could not for 
bear offering some objections. It appeared to be a 
dangerous attempt to stretch the power of Congress. 
My letters had been read by many members, and 
were at the service of every gentleman who should 
request a perusal; but I would never consent to 
have my property taken from me by an order from 
my fellow-citizens, destitute of authority for the purpose. This circumstance, and some remarks that fol 
lowed, have induced me to put Governor Johnstone's 
letter, and my intended answer, into Mr. Drayton's 
hands, who is collecting materials for displaying the 
Governor's good designs, and no doubt he will, ac 
cording to his usual tone, add pretty severe strict 
ures. Among other papers, I transmit to your Excellency copies of the Commissioners Address to Congress, and of their commission. These are to be published by order. If no mistake was made, the copy 
of the answer of Congress was sent to your Excellency yesterday, in my public letter.
</p><p>
The following is an extract from a letter written by Josiah Bartlett,a Delegate in Congress from New Hampshire, to Mr. "Whipple, of the 
same State, dated <a href='/results.php?city=yorktown' rel='city'>Yorktown</a>, June 20th. 
</p><p>
" I have the pleasure to inform you that every member of Congress 
was firm and steady, never to make a peace, but on the principles 
of absolute independence. I am sorry that the answer was deferred some 
I pray God to support and direct your Excellency 
in this moment of extraordinary trial ; and I am, with 
the most sincere esteem and regard, dear Sir, you rmuch obliged and obedient humble servant,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have had the honor of presenting, to as many 
members of Congress as have been convened in this 
city since the adjournment from <a href='/results.php?city=york' rel='city'>York</a>, your Excellency's several favors, of the 28th and 30th of June, 
and 1st instant, and, at their special instance, have 
caused them to be printed, for the information of the 
public. 
</p><p>
I arrived here on Tuesday last, but hitherto have 
not collected a sufficient number of States to form a 
Congress; consequently I have received no commands. 
Your Excellency will therefore be pleased to accept 
this as the address of an individual, intended to assure 
you, Sir, of my hearty congratulations with my countrymen on the success of the American arms, under 
your Excellency's immediate command, in the late 
battle of Momnouth, and more particularly of my own 
happiness in the additional glory achieved by your Excellency in retrieving the honor of these States in 
the moment of an alarming dilemma. 
</p><p>
It is not my design to attempt encomiums upon 
your Excellency. I am as unequal to the task as 
the act is unnecessary. Love and respect for your Excellency is impressed on the heart of every grateful American, and your name will be revered by posterity. Our acknowledgments are especially due to 
Heaven for the preservation of your Excellency's per 
son, necessarily exposed, for the salvation of America, 
to the most imminent danger in the late action. That 
the same hand may at all times guide and shield 
your Excellency, is the fervent wish of, dear Sir, 
</p><p>

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Yesterday I had the honor of writing to your Excellency a public letter by James Martin, and also 
of presenting to Congress your Excellency's favor of 
the 14th, which the House received with satisfaction. 
</p><p>
Permit me, Sir, to recommend to your Excellency's protection two packets from the Sieur Gerard to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel=''>Count D Estaing</a>, which will accompany this. I have 
assured Monsieur Gerard that it is altogether unnecessary to urge your Excellency to give these despatches the quickest safe passage to the Vice-Admiral. 
</p><p>
Prizes are finding the way into the Delaware. One, 
laden with rum, limes, &c., intended for the enemy's 
refreshment, embraced one of our wharves the evening before last, and I learn a rich ship is on her way 
up. 
</p><p>
I have this moment received a second letter from 
the British Commissioners. If I dared to venture an 
opinion, from a very cursory reading of the performance, it would be that this is more puerile than any 
thing I have seen from the other side since the commencement of our present dispute, with a little dash 
of insolence, as unnecessary as it will be unavailing. 
If the Marquis de Vienne will indulge me, till I 
return from Congress, your Excellency will find a 
copy of that letter within this. At present, as he is 
on the wing, I must send to obtain his permission ; 
and in order to be quite ready, in case he shall re 
fuse to wait, I conclude this with repeated assurances 
of being, with the highest esteem and respect, dear Sir, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Obliged and obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hel" rel="me">HENRY LAURENS</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. Returned from Congress at 9 o clock. A 
resolve, relative to the Commissioners letter, that it 
ought not to be answered, &c., with the letter, will 
appear in print.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I did myself the honor of writing to your Excellency yesterday, by Jones, to which I beg leave to refer. 
</p><p>
This morning, upon inquiry, I was confirmed in my 
belief that the former Camp Committee had made no 
application to Congress for gold or silver, to be deposited in your Excellency's hands for public uses; 
wherefore, I suggested to two or three members the necessity and utility of establishing such a fund, and 
prevailed upon one of the gentlemen to move the 
House for that purpose. The motion was accepted, 
and, without a pause, the sum of five hundred guineas 
voted. These I shall presently receive, and, if possible, convey them to your Excellency under the protection of Captain Josiah Stoddard, of the light dragoons. 
</p><p>
I have just received new addresses to Congress 
from the British Commissioners at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. Governor Johnstone, in graceless and almost scurrilous terms, without exonerating himself from the charges 
alleged against him, submits to the decree of inter 
diction, lately pronounced by Congress.* Nor do the 
gentlemen, late his coadjutors, so highly resent the 
proceedings on our part, as to refuse to treat with 
out the support of the Governor's name. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will judge best from their respective performances on the present occasion ; copies of 
which shall- accompany this letter. 
</p><p>
I take the liberty of inclosing, with the present 
despatches, a letter directed " To Lieutenant-<a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel=''>Colonel Laurens</a>," under a flying seal, and to request your Excellency to peruse a paragraph contained in it, 
which speaks of a Monsieur Gal van. 
</p><p>
Monsieur Gerard is exceedingly affected by the late 
determinations on the water, near Rhode Island, and 
has communicated his sentiments to me with great 
candor. Good accounts from <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel=''>General Sullivan</a> will do more towards recovering him from a slight intermittent, which really seized that gentleman, immediately 
after he had received Monsieur Chouin's letter, than 
four ouns of bark. Indeed, I never saw people in 
general more anxious than my acquaintance, under 
the present suspense. Within the next two hours, I 
make no doubt, there will be fifty inquirers for news 
within this door. I remain, with the utmost regard, 
dear Sir, 
</p><p>

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
An accident, which has very seldom happened to 
me in the course of thirty years business, has deprived me of the honor of making an earlier, and 
puts it out of my power even now to make a more 
proper acknowledgment of three of your Excellency's 
favors, which I remember to have been indebted for, 
antecedent to the receipt of this of the 3d instant, 
which now lies before me. Those, in removing my 
desks and their contents from one part of the house 
to a more convenient, I have mislaid among my private papers, and, after as much search at different 
times, and particularly this morning, as the fleeting 
and pressing moments which I dare borrow from 
public attentions have permitted me to make, remain 
undiscovered, although I am sure they are safe in a 
wrong class. 
</p><p>
I recollect, however, and shall never forget, a new 
obligation, which, in one of them, your Excellency 
was pleased to lay on me by a very kind notice of 
my son's behaviour at Rhode Island, and that you 
had returned the gold which I sent to head-quarters, 
by Jones, and also the letters of Governor Johnstone, 
Mr. Oswald, and Mr. Manning. In the present circumstances of Great Britain, rendered deplorable by 
the waste of another campaign on this Continent, by 
the loss of Dominique, in the West Indies, and of a great marine battle at her own doors, it is exceedingly difficult to determine what will be her next 
step, although I do not think it is to see the only 
measures remaining for her salvation. 
</p><p>
With respect to South Carolina, I cannot yet treat 
the idea of an attack, as altogether chimerical. I 
am well warranted to say the British Administration 
held that State and Georgia in reserve, for a stroke 
of necessity, which might, at any time, be made with 
success, and they well know the immense value of 
those States, and great things may be done by drawing their forces to one point. They may, indeed, 
have stayed a day too late. Be that as it will, I 
have fully advertised my countrymen; and, if the 
alarm, shall prove to have been unnecessarily sounded, 
their intermediate exertions towards a defence will 
do them no real injury. Congress have ordered the 
proceedings of the Court-Martial on Major-General 
St. Clair to be printed, and have appointed Friday, 
the 16th, for considering and determining on those 
of the Court on Major-General Lee. 
</p><p>
I have nothing further to offer at present, Sir, but 
the repeated assurances of being, with the highest 
sense of esteem and respect, your Excellency's 
Most obedient and most humble servant,

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I feel myself doubly honored by your favor of the 
14th instant, from the confidence of General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> in the free communication of his sentiments, 
and in the coincidence of his ideas with my own 
upon a question, upon the wise decision of which the 
inheritance, possibly the establishment of the freedom 
and independence of these States, seem to depend. 
The respect, Sir, that I owe you demands an immediate reply, and yet the variety of avocations in 
which I am engaged does not afford me moments for 
arranging or expressing my thoughts suitably to the 
importance of the subject. I am, nevertheless, encouraged to proceed, without hesitation, from a conviction that, were I to deliver my opinions at full 
length, I should be obliged to borrow your Excellency's words, which I have the honor of assuring 
you, Sir, are, in more than one instance, repetitions 
of my own, and that in every other, one excepted, 
our sentiments on this momentous discussion exactly 
accord. 
</p><p>
I believe, and upon good ground, the scheme for 
an expedition into Canada, in concert with the arms 
of France, originated in the breast of the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel=''>Marquis De Lafayette</a>, encouraged, probably, by conferences with 
<a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel=''>Count D Estaing</a>, and I also believe it to be the off 
spring of the purest motives, so far as respects that 
origin; but this is not sufficient to engage my concurrence in a measure big with eventual mischiefs. 
As deeply as my very limited time and faculties had 
suffered me to penetrate, I had often contemplated 
our delicate connection with France ; and, although it 
is painful to talk of one's own foresight; had viewed 
and foretold, fifteen months ago, the humiliating state 
to which our embryo independence would be reduced 
by courting from that nation the loan of more money 
than should be actually necessary for the support of 
the army and of our unfortunate navy. 
</p><p>
I was one of the six unsuccessful opponents to the 
resolution for borrowing money from France for paying the interest of our Loan-Office certificates. We 
have, in this single article, plunged the Union into a 
vast amount of debt; and, from neglecting to exert 
our very small abilities, or even to show a leading disposition to cancel any part of the former demand 
against us, our bills for that interest are now floating, 
in imminent danger of dishonor and disgrace. Fully 
persuaded of the true value of national honor, I 
anxiously wished to support our own by a propriety 
and consistency of conduct, and I dreaded the consequences of subjecting our happiness to the disposal 
of a powerful creditor, who may, upon any specious 
grounds, interpret national honor to our destruction. 
I warned my friends against the danger of mortgaging these States to foreign powers. Every million 
of livres you borrow implies a pledge of your lands ; 
and it is optional in your creditor to be repaid at 
the Bank of England, with an exorbitant premium, 
or to collect the money due to him in any of your ports, and according to his own mode, whenever national interest shall require the support of pretended 
national honor. 
</p><p>
Hence your Excellency will perceive what were 
my feelings, when the propositions for subduing Canada, by the aid of a French fleet and army, were 
first broached to me. I demurred exceedingly to the 
Marquis's scheme, and expressed some doubts of the 
concurrence of Congress. This was going as far as 
I dared, consistently with my office, or considering 
him as a gentleman of equal honor and tenacity. 1 
trusted the issue of his application to the sagacity 
of Congress; the business was referred to a Commit 
tee., who conferred with the Marquis; their report 
was framed agreeably to his wishes; but the House 
very prudently determined to consult the Commander-in-chief previously to a final determination; and al 
though your Excellency's observations are committed, 
I am much mistaken if every member in Congress is 
not decided in his opinion in favor of them. If the 
prosecution of so extensive an object is, from the 
present state of our army and funds, impracticable 
on our part, it becomes altogether unnecessary to 
discuss the point in a political view. And I trust 
the Marquis will be satisfied with such reasonings, in 
apology for our desisting from the pursuit of his favorite enterprise, as our circumstances will dictate. 
</p><p>
The immense debts which we are involved in, 
abroad and at home, demand the utmost serious attention, and call for an exertion of the collected wisdom of all these States, in order to secure what we 
have saved from the ravages of the enemy. I am 
very short-sighted if there be, at this time, any encouragement for attempting distant conquests. I have 
been uniformly averse from every proposition which 
is intended to dissipate our strength and to accumu 
late our debt. Events have confirmed my opinion; 
and at this instant, taking in view all circumstances, 
I have doubts of the policy, and more of the success, 
of the pending expedition against East Florida. Congress will probably recommend to the States to raise a tax of near twenty millions the ensuing year. This, 
I hope, will have a good effect, by returning many 
of us to first principles, from which we have been too 
long wandering. This almost intolerable burden will 
rouse and animate our fellow-citizens ; they will probably send men of ability to investigate causes, to 
inquire into expenditures, and to call delinquents for 
unaccounted millions to severe reckonings ; they will 
do, what they have hitherto shamefully neglected, pass 
necessary laws for this purpose. 
</p><p>
This heavy tax, and the prospect of increasing impositions, will show our constituents the necessity for 
consolidating our strength, as well as the impropriety 
and danger of new extensive military enterprises. 
Virtue and patriotism were the motto of our banners, 
when we entered this contest. Y/here is virtue, 
where is patriotism, now; when almost every man 
has turned his thoughts and attention to gain and pleasures, practising every artifice of change-alley, or 
Jonathans ; when men of abilities disgracefully neglect the important duties for which they were sent 
to Congress, tempted by the pitiful fees of practising 
attorneys; when members of that body artfully start a point, succeed, and then avail themselves of the 
secrets of the House, and commence monopolizers, 
and accumulate the public debt for their private 
emoluments ? I believe many such tricks have been 
acted. The particular instance which I allude to cost 
these States a large sum of money without putting 
the criminal to the expense of a blush. When men, 
in almost every important public department, are actually concerned in commerce, incompatible with the 
strict duties of their respective officers; when the most 
egregious delinquents meet with support in Congress, 
and escape examination. I am tired, and fear tiring 
you, Sir, with this horrible, half-finished picture. 1 
will therefore leave it, but not before I add that the 
United States of America are in most deplorable circumstances ; that the requisitions of a foreign Minister 
have fixed the eyes of Europe upon them; that their 
weaknesses, their wickednesses, are no longer hidden, 
and that the States respectively are much to blame, 
and that, without speedy reformation, their shame 
and ruin collectively will follow. 
</p><p>
The disaster of Admiral Byron's fleet, and the 
successful departure of <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel=''>Count D Estaing</a>'s, are events 
much in our favor; that is to say, if we are pleased 
to make a wise improvement of them; but, from experience fearing the contrary, I am almost tempted 
to wish they had not happened. These fortunate circumstances will lull us to sleep again, and, while ourally is gaining honor, aggrandizement, and the highest national advantages, we shall be sinking into a 
state little better than tributary and dependent. Be 
this as it may, the world will ever honor by acknowledging the virtues of the man, who, from my inmost 
soul, I believe keeps us at this moment from crumbling. I have the honor to be, with the most sincere 
respect and esteem, dear Sir, 
Your much obliged and obedient humble servant,

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
In obedience to the direction of Congress, I am to 
acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th 
instant. Congress, with great concern, perceive that 
your sensibility is wounded by their resolutions. 
Placing the firmest confidence in your prudence, abilities, and integrity, they wish to preserve that harmony with you, which is essential to the general 
weal. You may rest assured, that, far from any intention to give you pain, their resolutions have no 
other motives or end but the public good. They therefore hope that you will not, in future, be distressed by apprehensions as injurious to their honor 
as they are to your own feelings. 
</p><p>
However different the views of Congress may seem 
to you now from what you supposed them to be 
when you entered into your late engagements with 
General Howe, Congress certainly had nothing in 
view but a proper respect to the dignity, safety, and 
independence of these States. The duplicity of General Howe, and authentic information that the gentlemen appointed by you to negotiate the cartel held 
opinions repugnant to the sense of Congress, con 
strained them, in a matter of such high moment as 
forming a general cartel, to express their sentiments 
in an explicit manner, lest they might have only to 
lament, when it was out of their power to remedy, a 
misapprehension on points deeply affecting, in their 
judgment, the safety and honor of these States. 
</p><p>
Congress expected you would consider their resolutions of the 30th ultimo in the light of private instructions, calculated to show their sense with respect 
to the general outlines of the proposed cartel ; a 
practice usual with the supreme power of every State 
in similar cases. You observe that a strict adherence 
to all the resolutions of Congress must, of necessity, 
destroy all idea of a cartel ; but, as a distinction can 
easily be made betwixt such of the resolutions of 
Congress as flow from general principles of policy, 
and those which arise from circumstances which have 
rendered a variation from time to time necessary, it 
is conceived that an attention to this discrimination 
will rid you of those embarrassments, which you may, 
at first view, think yourself entangled with. The re 
solution of Congress of the 19th December, respecting 
the mode of settlement for supplies to the enemy's 
prisoners, seems not to have been sufficiently attended to. It is left at the option of the enemy to pay 
either in coin, dollar for dollar, or in provisions 
equal in quantity and kind to what is furnished. 
Whatever objections may be made against the first 
mode, there surely cannot be a more just and equal 
ratio than the latter. <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel=''>General Burgoyne</a> lately made the same objections on this point, which are carried 
to you; but, on being reminded of the alternative 
offered by the resolution, he acquiesced, and the victualling-ships are now actually delivering provisions 
in payment for what they received. The Commissaries of Prisoners, on each side, may pass receipts 
for the rations received, expressing the quantum of 
each article received for the subsistence of the prisoners in the power of the contracting parties, and 
the balance may be paid in provisions or in coin, at 
the option of either party. 
</p><p>
The mode suggested by you is liable to this strong 
objection; that it would lay us under the necessity 
of furnishing the enemy's prisoners with us, as well 
as ours with them, with provisions; which certainly 
would be a capital advantage to them, if we consider 
the distance whence they must derive their supplies. 
The resolution of the 30th December was a measure 
naturally flowing from the treason acts, which the 
respective States have passed in consequence of the 
express recommendation of Congress. On a mature 
deliberation, they are convinced that a deviation from 
it would be subversive of our character as an independent people, in consistence with sound policy. No 
act of Congress can suspend the operation of the 
laws of the different States, and therefore they can 
not consent that any measure should be adopted in 
the proposed cartel, which may contravene this resolution. 
</p><p>
It does not, however, appear to Congress that any 
embarrassment will arise in this matter, unless the 
enemy should insist upon an article in the cartel, 
that Americans, taken in arms, shall be entitled to the 
benefits of an exchange. Under the terms u officer for officer, soldier for soldier," which are generally 
used in cartels, traitors would no more be included 
by the laws of nations than deserters. The carrying 
this resolution into practice can depend only on the 
will of the several States, who, in this respect, must 
be presumed to be governed by principles of policy.
