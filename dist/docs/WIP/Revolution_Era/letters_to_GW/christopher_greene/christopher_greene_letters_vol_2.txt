Fort at <a href='/results.php?city=red bank' rel='city origin'>Red Bank</a>, <a rel="day origin" value="14">14</a> <a rel="month origin" value="10">October</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1777' rel="origin">1777</a>. 
</p><p>
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 
</p><p>
I arrived here on Saturday last with my regiment. 
They were much fatigued with the march, as I forced 
thirty-five miles one day. They are now in high 
spirits, and go to their duty with the greatest cheerfulness. The inclosed return shows our strength. I 
have found it necessary to contract the fort, but it is too large for our numbers, as we have very little to expect from the militia. 
</p><p>
I saw General Newcomb last evening. He informs 
me that the small number now on duty expect to 
return home in a day or two ; those that relieve them 
expect to be relieved in three days. The General 
thinks your Excellency's intentions were, for the 
militia only to help complete the fort ; after that, to 
fall on the rear of the enemy, in case of an attack. 
Should we be attacked, they must be so scattered as 
to be able to give us little or no assistance. 
</p><p>
The strength of the navy, and of <a href='/results.php?city=fort mifflin' rel='city'>Fort Mifflin</a>, your Excellency will have by the express who bears this, 
from the officers commanding them. They are certainly very weak for so important a post. I have 
already, and shall still give them all the assistance 
in my power. Could your Excellency give us the 
assistance of Colonel Angell's regiment, I doubt not 
this post would be secure, without dependence on 
militia. If they are to be relieved in the manner I 
understand they are, it is my opinion they will do 
us no service. General Newcomb gives very little 
encouragement of any to supply the place of those 
that are going off the ground. Could we be reenforced, we probably might frustrate the enemy's designs in three batteries they are erecting against 
<a href='/results.php?city=fort mifflin' rel='city'>Fort Mifflin</a>, and so near as to do much injury when 
opened. 
</p><p>
I find it necessary, for the security of the post, to 
keep my men all on fatigue daily. This I doubt will 
cause them to be less spirited in action, if I should 
be under the necessity to continue it, which must be 
the case, unless I am reenforced. The post I have in 
charge I am determined to defend, with the small 
number I command, to the last extremity ; yet I 
doubt my number is much too small to answer your Excellency's expectations. I am, with the greatest 
respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

<a href='/results.php?city=red bank' rel='city origin'>Red Bank</a>, <a rel="day origin" value="17">17</a> <a rel="month origin" value="11">November</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1777' rel="origin">1777</a>; 4 o clock, P. M.

SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency, I dare say, has been informed of 
the evacuation of <a href='/results.php?city=fort mifflin' rel='city'>Fort Mifflin</a>, and the gallant defence there made by Major Thayer. The evacuation 
of that fort, the removal of our navy, the movements 
of the British fleet, and our own situation at present, 
have put it wholly out of my power to answer those 
important purposes for which your Excellency was pleased to order me to this command. 
</p><p>
Our fleet here are now moving as fast as possible 
to Timber Creek. The river is so open to the enemy's shipping, that topsail and other vessels are now 
passing between Mud Island and Province Island to 
the Schuylkill, unmolested. Fort Mercer is tolerably secure against a storm only. A bomb-proof magazine is nearly finished; no other security in the 
fort against shells. A strong breastwork partly finished on the bank, takes up a considerable part of 
the floor of the fort; and the magazine takes up so 
much, that the remainder of the floor is insufficient 
to spring tents on for more than one third of the garrison. 
</p><p>
The proposal for building a bomb-proof under the 
bank is now at an end, since <a href='/results.php?city=fort mifflin' rel='city'>Fort Mifflin</a> is lost. 
The communication to Red Bank, by water, is nearly 
intercepted; and, should a party of the enemy in 
vest this fort by land, our whole supply would be 
cut off; and, should they erect bomb-batteries on the 
land side, they would be able to throw shells to 
us on all sides; from all of which I conclude, that 
an army investing us, sufficient to keep the field, 
will reduce the garrison, and make the survivors 
prisoners, as we could have no retreat. 
</p><p>
Thus, having given your Excellency what appears 
to me, with the unanimous voice of all the Field Officers of the garrison, a true state of our circum 
stances, and observations thereon, I wait your Excellency's particular commands and directions, for an 
invariable rule for me to pursue ; for which purpose 
Major Ward will wait on your Excellency, to whom 
I refer for a more particular account of matters here. 
</p><p>
With every sentiment of respect and esteem, I am, 
Your Excellency's humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=chg" rel="me">CHRISTOPHER GREENE</a>.
