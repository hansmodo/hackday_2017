Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received your letter of the 25th of April, 
for which I am much obliged to you. I am sorry 
for the melancholy occasion which has induced you 
to leave <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>, and for the affliction which the loss of such near relations must involve Mrs. Washington in. 
</p><p>
The ordinance for disposing of the western territory has been under consideration ever since I wrote 
you last, and has undergone several alterations ; the 
most considerable of which is, that one half of the 
land is to be sold by sections or lots, and the other 
half by entire townships; and the dimension of each 
township is reduced to six miles. I now expect the 
ordinance will be completed in a few days, it being 
the opinion of most gentlemen that it is better to 
pass it in its present form nearly, than to delay it 
much longer, and incur the risk of losing the country altogether. As soon as it is finished, I shall do 
myself the honor to inclose you a copy ; and, though 
it will be far from being the best that could be 
made, yet I verily believe it is the best that, under 
present circumstances, can be procured. There have 
appeared so many interfering interests, most of them 
imaginary, so many ill-founded jealousies and suspicions throughout the whole, that I am only surprised the ordinance is not more exceptionable. Indeed, if 
the importunities of the public creditors, and the reluctance to pay them by taxation, either direct or 
implied, had not been so great, I am satisfied no 
land ordinance could have been procured, except under such disadvantages as would, in a great degree, 
have excluded the idea of actual settlements within 
any short length of time. This is not strange, when 
we reflect that several of the States are averse to 
new votes from that part of the Continent, and that 
some of them are now disposing of their own vacant 
lands, and of course wish to have their particular 
debts paid, and their own countries settled in the 
first instance, before there is any interference from 
any other quarter. 
</p><p>
With respect to the different places of sale, it is 
certainly open to the objections you mention; but it 
was absolutely necessary to accede to the measure, 
before we could advance a single step. Since the receipt of your letter, I have hinted to some of the 
members the propriety of altering this part ; but find 
that the idea of allowing the citizens of each State 
an equal chance of trying the good lands at their 
own doors, was one of the strongest reasons with 
them for consenting to the ordinance. As to the individual States interfering in the sale, it is guarded 
against; and in case the Loan-Officer, who is responsible only to Congress, cannot dispose of the land in 
a limited time, it is to be returned to the Treasury 
Board. With respect to the fractional parts of townships, the ordinance has now provided for all cases 
which can occur, except with respect to the Pennsylvania line. The course of the new State from the 
Ohio will be due north ; and the dispute with Pennsylvania will be open to discussion hereafter. 
 I am sorry to observe, tliatj thronglioiit this measure, there has been a necessity for sacrificing one's 
own opinion to that of other people, for the purpose 
of getting forward. There have never been above ten 
States on the floor; and nine of these were necessary 
to concur in one sentiment, lest they should refuse 
to vote for the ordinance on its passage. The price 
is fixed at a dollar the acre, liquidated certificates ; 
that is, the land is not to be sold under that. The 
reason for establishing this sum was, that a part of 
the House "were for half a dollar, and another part for 
two dollars, and others for intermediate sums between 
the two extremes ; so that, ultimately, this was agreed 
upon as a central ground. If it is too high (which 
I am afraid is the case), it may hereafter be corrected by a resolution. I still mean to move for some 
amendments, which I think will not only advance the 
sale, but increase the facility of purchasing to foreigners; though, from present appearances, I own I have 
but little hopes of success. 
</p><p>
After this affair is over, the requisition for the current year will be brought forward. The article of 
thirty thousand dollars, for the erection of federal 
buildings at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, I have already objected to, and 
shall continue to oppose, by every means in my power, as I look upon the measure to be fundamentally 
wrong ; and I am in hopes nine States cannot be 
found to vote for it. Should those in opposition to 
the measure be able to put off the execution for the 
present year, it is to be expected that the Southern 
States W'ill open their eyes to their true interests, 
and view this subject in a different light. What I at 
present fear is, that, failing to get this article allowed in the requisition, they will attempt to draw the 
money from Holland by a vote of seven States, inasmuch as a hundred thousand dollars were voted at 
<a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a> for that purpose, although no particular fund 
was assigned. I own this matter has given me some 
disgust, as I see an intemperate ardor to carry it 
into execution before the sense of the Union is 
known; and I have no doubt that some gentlemen 
have come into Congress expressly for that purpose. 
</p><p>
I take the liberty of introducing Mr. Sitgreaves, a 
Delegate from North Carolina, a gentleman of great 
worth, who is travelling through our own State to 
his ow^n country He will be very happy to communicate to you the news of this place. I inclose you 
the report of a Committee for altering the first paragraph of the ninth article of the Confederation, which 
embraces objects of great magnitude, and about which 
there is a great difference of sentiment. I have the 
honor to be, with the highest respect, 
Your affectionate friend and most obedient servant,

Dkvr Sir, 
</p><p>
The inclosed letters were handed to me the other 
day by young <a href='/results.php?tla=jqa' rel='met'>Mr. Adams</a>, son of <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague'>Mr. John Adams</a>, 
who has arrived in the last packet ; and, no private 
opportunity offering, I do myself the honor of transmitting them by post. 
</p><p>
Congress are informed, by a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague'>Mr. Adams</a>, 
that he has been introduced to the King of Great Britain in due form, and received as a public Minister from the United States of America. They have 
also received from the Commissioners for forming commercial treaties, projects of two treaties ; the one with 
the King of Prussia, the other with the Grand Duke 
of Tuscany. The former, it is expected, is signed 
before this by the American Ministers. Don Diego 
de Gardoqui, who has plenipotentiary powers, has 
been received; and Congress have passed a commission to INIr. Jay, Secretary for Foreign Affairs, to negotiate with him. 
</p><p>
Congress have lately paid great attention to the 
proposed alteration of the ninth article of the Confederation, and it has been debated several times. I 
did myself the honor to inclose this paper some time 
ago. There seem to be three opinions. Some are 
for the alteration as reported, provided eleven, and 
not nine States, have the exercise of the powers. 
Others are for forming a act, and submitting 
</p><p>
the same to the States. A third opinion is against 
any change whatever. I expect, after the subject has 
been thoroughly investigated, it will, by consent, be 
put off till the members have had an opportunity of 
consulting the Legislatures. The requisition for the 
current year is nearly finished. By this the States 
are called upon to pay three millions of dollars, that 
is, one million in specie, and two millions in interest 
on liquidated certificates ; the whole containing a provision as well for the purposes of government as for 
the interest on the foreign and domestic debt. 
</p><p>
I beg leave to inclose propositions respecting the 
coinage of gold, silver, and copper, which are at present before Congress. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., &c., 
</p><p>

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I should have done myself the honor of writing to 
you sooner, if any thing had occurred at this place 
worth communicating. There has been a great dearth 
of foreign news, and, till within a short time, the representation has been so thin as to render it impracticable for Congress to undertake any matter of importance, although there are many which require their 
serious attention. Of late, there has been a tolerably 
full representation; but the time of Congress has been 
chiefly taken up with an investigation of the Connecticut cession of western territory. 
</p><p>
That State, some time ago, offered to cede all her 
claim to western territory within the following limits; — 
beginning one hundred and twenty miles westward 
of the Pennsylvania line, at the beginning of the 
forty-second degree, extending north as far as two 
minutes of the forty-third, w^est to the Mississippi, 
the meanders thereof the same breadth; east to the 
beginning, reserving out of this cession the one hundred and twenty miles between the ceded lands and 
the Pennsylvania line, with the jurisdiction of the 
same. This cession was at first much opposed, but 
Congress have at length agreed to accept it, whenever the Delegates of that State shall be authorized 
to make a proper deed ; the consequence of which 
is, I apprehend, a clear loss of about six millions of 
acres to the United States, which had been already 
ceded by Virginia and <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> ; for the Assembly 
of Connecticut, now sitting, will unquestionably open 
a Land-Office, and the Federal Constitution has not 
given a Court in this instance. 
</p><p>
The advocates for this measure urged, in favor of 
its adoption, that the claim of a powerful State, although unsupported hy right, was, under present circumstances, a disagreeable thing, and that sacrifices 
ought to be made for the public tranquillity, as well 
as to acquire an indisputable title to the residue ; 
that Connecticut would settle it immediately with 
emigrants well disposed to the Union, who would form 
a barrier not only against the British, but the Indian 
tribes upon the Wabash and Lake Michigan ; that the 
thick settlement they would immediately form, would 
enhance the value of the adjacent country, and facilitate emigrations thereto. 
</p><p>
Some alterations have been made lately in the 
land ordinance. The Surveyors are now allowed to 
survey by the magnetic meridian, and are limited to 
the territory lying southward of the east and west 
line, as described in the said ordinance ; the navigable waters and the carrying-places between them are 
made common highways, and forever free to the Atlantic States, as well as any new States that may 
be created, without any tax or impost therefor. An 
attempt was made to change the system altogether, 
but negatived. Indeed, the Eastern States, and some 
others, are so much attached to it, that I am satisfied no material alteration can ever be effected. The 
Geographer and Surveyors have directions to proceed 
without delay to carry the ordinance into execution, 
which, I presume, they will execute, provided the Indians will permit them, of which, however, I have 
very great doubts. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel=''>Mr. Adams</a> has informed Congress, by letters lately received, that he has made a demand of the posts, 
and has been refused. The Marquis of Carmarthen 
has given, as a reason for the refusal, that many of 
the States in the Union have violated the treaty with 
respect to the debts ; that the King of Great Britain 
will comply with his engagements, when the States 
shall show a disposition to perform their part of the 
contract respecting this matter. The States not included in the accusation are New Hampshire, Rhode 
Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Delaware. T 
beg leave to inform you, confidentially, that there does 
not appear, at present, the most distant prospect of 
forming a treaty either with Spain or Great Britain ; 
that the treaty with Portugal is in a proper train ; 
that peace can be procured with Tripoli and Tunis 
on reasonable terms, that is, for thirty-three thousand 
guineas each ; and probably with Morocco and Algiers 
for double that sum, respectively, if money can be 
loaned in Holland for that purpose. The late treaty 
with Algiers cost Spain one million three hundred 
thousand dollars. 
</p><p>
My compliments to Mrs. Washington ; and I remain, 
with the highest respect and esteem, &c., 
</p><p>
