Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
In a letter, which I have lately received from the 
Secretary of State, I am desired to make such arrangements as may be necessary, previous to a mission which you have prepared for me as Envoy Extraordinary to the Court of Spain. Although, from a 
knowledge of the extent of your unavoidable correspondence, and of the value of your moments, I 
have generally avoided addressing you directly, yet, 
while I officially express my readiness to undertake 
a business in which you think I may be of utility, I 
cannot refrain from thus assuring you, that I trust I 
feel the full import of the kindness and delicacy of 
this proceeding, as it personally concerns myself; and 
I beg leave to add the expression of the true respect 
and grateful attachment, with which I am, &c., 
</p><p>
