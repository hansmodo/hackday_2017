Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been honored with your Excellency's despatches of the 18th of December and 29th of January. I am made happy by your full approbation 
of my conduct, and the army under my command, 
during the southern operations. The evacuation of 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, and the proposals of peace, are matters 
highly interesting to this country, whose finances and 
political arrangements are in the most deplorable situation. <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> remains without a platform, or a 
single cannon for its defence. The subsistence of the 
troops, for some time after the evacuation of this 
place, depended on military collections ; but, happily, 
we have made a contract for their future subsistence. 
On this subject I should feel easy, but for the critical situation the Financier writes me his department 
is circumstanced. 
</p><p>
The States have rejected the five per cent, duty 
act generally, and few pay any thing into the Continental Treasury any other -way. I wrote a letter to 
this State on the subject a few days past, stating 
some facts respecting the discontents prevailing in 
the Northern army respecting pay, and what might 
be expected in this to the southward. I thought it 
my duty to warn the State of what I apprehended. 
The impost act was rejected, notwithstanding, and 
the Assembly offended. I will ever speak my sentiments, and act with candor. I wish to know the nature and extent of the discontent ]3revailing in the 
northern troops. Matters are represented here in 
dark colors. The report spreads among our troops, 
and threatens a convulsion. I shall give you the 
best information on the subject in my power ; but 
these things often come to a crisis from accident and 
indiscretion, before one expects it. I could wish to 
be fully informed respecting the temper of the Northern army ; it would enable me to counteract many 
aggravations here. 
</p><p>
I have communicated to the Assembly your orders 
for marching the troops to the northward ; but I am 
much at a loss how to act in the matter. Your Excellency seems to leave a latitude of discretion respecting the tranquillity of these States ; but your 
comment upon a desultory and predatory war, appears 
to be intended to limit m}' discretionary powers to 
matters of serious invasion. We have none at present, 
and yet there are parties continually making inroads 
upon different sides of both Georgia and South Carolina, from St. Augustine. 
</p><p>
If I put the troops in motion, as you mention, it 
leaves the Southern States a prey to every invader. 
A small force, in their present distracted state, would 
overrun the country, and <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> may be repossessed, at any time, by a few frigates, with a regiment or two of inftmtiy. I would wish to follow 
your intention. If I could conceive you had a clear 
idea of the weakness and distress of this country, the 
troops should march immediately ; hut the prospects 
of peace, and the possibility of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> being evacuated, if the war should continue, induce me to 
wait until the arrival of the next despatches. In the 
mean time, I shall have every preparation made for 
their marching as soon as may be. The men are 
well clothed, and pretty well disciplined. Some few 
days before the arrival of your last letter, from an 
appearance of an invasion upon Georgia, I put the 
Virginia troops in motion for the protection of that 
quarter ; and, as their numbers are small, and will be 
of little consequence in the siege, I shall not march 
them until your further orders. 
</p><p>
The people of this State are much prejudiced 
against Congress and the Financier. Those who came 
from the northward think they have been amazingly 
neglected by both in their distresses. Their General disposition leads more to an independence of Congressional connection, than I could wish, or is for 
their peace or welfare. This State has contributed 
more than any other State, it is true, towards the 
Continental expenses; but necessity obliged them. I 
wish all the States could see how much the tranquillity of each depended upon giving effectual support 
to Congress. I have the honor to be, with great 
respect. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,

Sir, 
</p><p>
I beg leave to congratulate your Excellency upon 
the returning smiles of peace, and the happy establishment of our independence. This important event 
must be doubly welcome to you, who have so successfully conducted the war, through such a variety 
of difficulties, to so happy a close. If universal respect, and the general affections of a grateful country, 
can compensate for the many painful hours which 
you have experienced in your country's cause, you 
are richly rewarded. Every heart feels, and every 
tongue confesses, the merit and importance of your 
services. The polite attention, which I have experienced since I have had the honor to serve under 
your command, claims my particular acknowledgments ; and I feel a singular satisfaction in having 
preserved your confidence and esteem through the 
whole progress of the war, notwithstanding man}'- jarring interests. 
</p><p>
This pleasing event has relieved me from a load 
of anxiety on account of this country. I was much 
perplexed about withdrawing the troops from these 
States. 
</p><p>
I wished to comply fully with the spirit of your 
orders on this subject, but was at a loss how, without involving us both in difficulties. Happily for us, 
these are removed. I have sent an express-boat to 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, to get your final orders respecting the 
troops, and to see if transports can be got to take 
the army to the northward, as I am anxious to get 
it away from here as early as possible. I hope this 
may find you in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and that you will be 
able to return me an answer in a few days. The 
cavalry must march by land, unless the horses are 
sold here. I suppose I shall have liberty to come to 
the northward, as soon as I can make it convenient, 
where I have many calls, both of a public and private nature. I have the honor to be, with great respect and esteem, 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
When I wrote you last, I did not expect to address you from this place again ; but Colonel Carrington has detained me upwards of a week, to complete 
the business of his department. On Thursday next 
we set off, by land, for the northward. 
The Assembly of this State have rejected the impost act recommended by Congress. Had your circuLar, letter been printed a fortnight earlier, I am 
persuaded it would have brought them into the measure. On once reading in the House, it produced an 
alteration of sentiment of more then one quarter of 
the members. The force and affection, with which it 
was written, made every one seem to embrace it with 
avidity. You were admired before ; you are little less 
than adored now. The recommendation of Congress 
had but a feeble influence until it was supported by 
yours. Although the State did not come into the 
plan recommended by Congress, they have laid a tax 
of five per cent., under the authority of the State, to 
be solely for the Continental use. This I attribute 
entirely to your letter. Its effects have been astonishing. 
</p><p>
I see, by the papers, the Northern army does not 
choose to be furloughed. The people here begin to 
be alarmed at it. I hope every thing will terminate 
both for the honor of the army and satisfaction of 
the people, notwithstanding. There have been several little mobs and riots lately in this town, owing 
to the indiscretion of some of the British merchants, 
and to the violence of temper and private views of 
some of the Whig interest. Tranquillity now prevails, 
and there is little probability of any further disturbances. I hope to be at <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a> in about 
three weeks ; but, from all I can learn of the northern affairs, there is little probability of my having 
the pleasure of meeting your Excellency there. Present me, respectfully, to Mrs. Washington, if with 
you, and to all the firmily. I am, with esteem and 
affection. 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I return your Excellency many thanks for your 
polite letter, accompanying the resolution of Congress, 
complimenting me with a couple of cannon. I am \ 
not very certain where those cannon^ are, but I believe two are in Virginia, and three in South Carolina; and it is no less difficult for me to determine 
where I would wish those sent which are made choice 
of for me. If those in South Carolina should be fixed 
upon, I would wish them to remain in <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>. 
But if those in Virginia should be appropriated for 
this purpose, if agreeable, let them be sent to Newport. Should any thing happefi before this business 
is executed, which should enable me to be more explicit on the subject, I shall take the earliest opportunity of signifying to your Excellency my further 
wishes in the matter. I am, with the highest respect, 
and greatest esteem. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,
