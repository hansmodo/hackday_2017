SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency has made me very unhappy. I 
can submit very patiently to deserved censure ; but 
it wounds my feelings exceedingly to meet with a 
rebuke for doing what I conceived to be a proper 
part of my duty, and in the order of things. 
</p><p>
When I left your Excellency at Haverstraw, you 
desired me to go forward and reconnoitre the country, and fix upon some proper position to draw the 
troops together at, I was a stranger to all this part 
of the country, and could form no judgment of a 
proper place, until I had thoroughly examined the 
ground. 
</p><p>
Croton River was the only place I could find 
suitable to the purpose, all circumstances being 
taken into consideration. I wrote your Excellency 
what I had done, and where I was, that if you had 
any thing in charge I might receive your orders. I 
wrote you the reasons for my not waiting upon you 
in person were, I had many letters to answer, and 
many matters to regulate in my department, which 
prevented me from returning. Besides which, it 
was almost half a day's ride, the weather exceeding 
hot, and myself not a little fatigued. And here I 
must observe, that neither my constitution nor 
strength is equal to constant exercise. 
</p><p>
As I was a stranger to all the lower country, I 
thought it absolutely necessary for me to come for 
ward. A thorough knowledge of the country is not 
easily obtained ; such a one, at least, as is necessary 
to fix upon the most eligible position for forming a 
camp. The security of the army, the ease and convenience of the troops, as well as to perform the du 
ties of my office with a degree of reputation, all 
conspired to make me wish to fix upon the properest 
ground for the purpose. This it was impossible for 
me to do, unless I came on before the troops. And 
I must confess I saw no objection, as your Excellency had wrote me nothing to the contrary, and 
what I wrote naturally led to such a measure. 
</p><p>
I expected you on every hour, and was impatient 
to get forward that I might be able to give some 
account of the country when you came up. Before 
I left Crompond, I desired Mr. Pettit to wait upon 
you at your arrival, and take your orders, and if there was any thing special to forward it by ex 
press. 
</p><p>
If I had neglected my duty in pursuit of pleasure, 
or if I had been wanting in respect to your Excellency, I would have put my hand upon my mouth, 
and been silent upon the occasion ; but, as I am not 
conscious of being chargeable with either the one or 
the other, I cannot help thinking I have been treated 
with a degree of severity that I am in no respect 
deserving. And I would just observe here, that it is 
impossible for me to do my duty if I am always at 
head-quarters. I have ever given my attendance there as much as possible, both from a sense of duty 
and from inclination ; but constant attendance is out 
of my power, unless I neglect all other matters ; the 
propriety of which, and the consequences that will 
follow, I submit to your Excellency's consideration. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency well knows how I came into this 
department. It was by your special request, and you 
must be sensible there is no other man upon earth 
would have brought me into the business but you. 
The distress the department was in, the disgrace that 
must accompany your operations without a change, 
and the difficulty of engaging a person capable of 
conducting the business, together with the hopes of 
meeting your approbation, and having your full aid 
and assistance, reconciled me to the undertaking. 
</p><p>
I flatter myself, when your Excellency takes a, view 
of the state things were in when I first engaged, 
and consider the short time we had to make the 
preparations for the opening campaign, and reflect 
with what ease and facility you began your march 
from <a href='/results.php?city=valley forge' rel='city'>Valley Forge</a>, and continued it all through the 
country r notwithstanding we went great part of the 
way entirely out of the line of preparations, you 
will do me the justice to say I have not been negli 
gent or inattentive to my duty. 
</p><p>
I have, in every respect, since I had my appointment, strove to accommodate the business of the department to the plan of jour Excellency's operations. 
And I can say, with great truth, that ever since I 
had the honor to serve under you, I have been more 
attentive to the public interest, and more engaged in 
the support of your Excellency's character, than ever 
I was to my own ease, interest, or reputation. 
</p><p>
I have never solicited you for a furlough to go 
home to indulge in pleasure, or to improve my interest, which, by the by, I have neglected, going on 
four years. I have never confined myself to my 
particular line of duty only. Neither have I ever 
spared myself, either by night or day, where it has 
been necessary to promote the public service under 
your direction. I have never been troublesome to 
your Excellency, to publish any thing to my advantage, although I think myself as justly entitled as 
some others, who have been much more fortunate, 
particularly in the action of the Brandywine. 
</p><p>
I have never suffered my pleasures to interfere 
with my duty ; and 1 am persuaded I have given 
too many unequivocal proofs of my attachment to 
your person and interest, to leave a doubt upon your mind to the contrary. I have always given you my 
opinion with great candor, and executed your orders 
with equal fidelity. I do not mean to arrogate to 
myself more merit than I deserve, or wish to exculpate myself from being chargeable with error, and in 
some instances negligence. However, I can speak, 
with a becoming pride, that I have always endeavoured to deserve the public esteem, and your Excellency's approbation. 
</p><p>
As I came into the Quarter-master's department 
with reluctance, so I shall leave it with pleasure. 
Your influence brought me in, and the want of your approbation will induce me to go out. 
I am very sensible of many deficiens, but this 
is not so justly chargeable to my intentions, as to 
the difficult circumstances attending the business. It 
is almost impossible to get good men for the con 
ducting all parts of so complex a business. It may,therefore, naturally be expected that many things 
will wear an unfavorable complexion ; but, let who 
will undertake the business, they will find it very 
difficult, not to say impossible, to regulate it in such a manner as not to leave a door open for censure, 
and furnish a handle for reproach. I am, with all 
due respect, your Excellency's 
</p><p>

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's favor of the 21st came to hand 
the evening of the 25th. 
</p><p>
In my last I communicated to your Excellency the 
departure of the <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague'>Count D Estaing</a> with his fleet, for 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. This disagreeable event has, as I apprehend, 
ruined all our operations. It struck such a panic 
among the militia and volunteers, that they began to 
desert by shoals. The fleet no sooner set sail, than 
they began to be alarmed for their safety. This mis 
fortune damped the hopes of our army, and gave 
new spirits to that of the enemy. 
</p><p>
We had a very respectable force, as to numbers ; 
between eight and nine thousand, rank and file, upon 
the ground ; but of these we attempted to select a 
particular corps to possess ourselves of the enemy's lines, partly by force, and partly by stratagem; but 
w r e could not make up the necessary number that 
was thought sufficient to warrant the attempt, which 
was five thousand, including the Continental and 
State troops. This body was to consist of men, who 
had been in actual service before, not less than nine months. However, the men were not to be had, and, 
if they could have been found, there was more against 
it than for it. <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Colonel Laurens</a> was to have opened 
the passage by landing within the enemy's lines, and 
getting possession of a redoubt at the head of Easton's beach. If we had failed in the attempt, the 
whole party must have fallen a sacrifice, for their 
situation would have been such that there was no 
possibility of getting off. 
</p><p>
I shall inclose your Excellency a plan of the enemy's works, and of their strength, from the best ac 
counts we are able to get. They have never been 
out of their lines since the siege began, till, night be 
fore last, Colonel Bruce came out with one hundred 
and fifty men, to take off a small picket of ours, 
posted at the neck of Easton's beach. He partly succeeded in the attempt, by the carelessness of the old 
guard. He came over after dark, and lay in ambush, 
that when the new guard went down to take their 
post, the enemy came upon their backs before they 
discovered them, it being very dark. We lost twenty-four privates and two subalterns. Ten of the picket got off. 
</p><p>
Our strength is now reduced from nine thousand 
to between four and five thousand. All our heavy 
cannon on garrison carriages, and heavy and superfluous stores of every kind, are removed to the main, 
and to the north end of the Island, where we intend 
to intrench and attempt to hold it, and wait the 
chance of events. <a href='/results.php?tla=joh' rel='colleague'>General Hancock</a> is gone to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> to forward the repairs of the fleet, and to prepare the mind of the Count for a speedy return. 
How far he will succeed, I cannot pretend to say. I 
think it a matter of some doubt yet, whether the 
enemy will reenforce, or take off this garrison. If 
they expect a superior fleet from Europe, they will 
reenforce ; but, if not, they will remove the garrison. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency may rest assured, that I have done every thing in my power to cultivate and promote a 
good understanding, both with the Count and the 
Marquis, and flatter myself that I am upon very good terms with them both. The Marquis's great thirst 
for glory, and national attachment, often run him into 
errors. However, he did every thing to prevail on 
the Admiral to cooperate with us, that man could 
do. People censure the Admiral with great freedom, 
and many are imprudent enough to reproach the 
nation through the Admiral. <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> very 
imprudently issued something like a censure in general orders. Indeed, it was an absolute censure. It 
opened the mouths of the army in very clamorous 
strains. The General was obliged to explain it away 
in a few days. The fermentation seems to be now 
subsiding, and all things appear as if they would go 
smoothly on. The Marquis is going to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, also, 
to hasten the Count's return, and, if possible, to get 
the Erench troops to join the land forces here, which 
will more effectually interest the Count in the success 
of the expedition. 
</p><p>
Five sail of British ships have got into <a href='/results.php?city=newport' rel='city'>Newport</a> 
within two days past. We have heard nor seen no 
thing of the fleet of transports your Excellency mentioned, in your letter to <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> of the 
23d. If they arrive with a large reenforcement, our expedition is at an end, unless it is by way of 
blockade, and that will depend upon the French 
fleet's being superior to that of the British, 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> has done every thing that could 
be expected, and had the fleet cooperated with us as 
was at first intended, and agreeably to the original 
plan of the expedition, we must have been successful. 
I wish it was in my power to confirm <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a>'s prediction of the 17th, but I cannot flatter my 
self with such an agreeable issue. I am sensible he 
is in common very sanguine, but his expectations 
were not ill-founded in the present case. We had 
every reason to hope for success, from our numbers, 
and from the enemy's fears. Indeed, General Pigot 
was heard to say, the garrison must fall, unless they 
were speedily relieved by a British fleet. If we could 
have made a landing upon the south part of the 
town, two days would have put us in complete possession of it. Nothing was wanting to effect this, but 
the cooperation of the fleet and French forces. The 
disappointment is vexatious and truly mortifying. 
The garrison was so important, and the reduction so 
certain, that I cannot with patience think of the 
event. The French ship that was missing has got 
into <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. The rest of the fleet have not got there 
yet, or at least we have no accounts of their arrival. 
</p><p>
We are very anxious to learn the condition of Lord 
Howe's fleet. The French seventy-four that has got 
into <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> had an engagement with a British sixty-four. The Captain and Lieutenant of the former were 
both wounded; one lost a leg, the other an arm. 
</p><p>
Our troops are in pretty good health, and well furnished with provisions, and every thing necessary for 
carrying on the expedition. 
</p><p>
Our approaches were pushed on with great spirit, 
while we had any hopes of the fleet cooperating with 
us ; but the people lost all relish for digging, after 
that. 
People are very anxious to hear the issue of General Lee's trial. Various are the conjectures ; but 
everybody agrees he is not acquitted. 
</p><p>
August olst. Camp Tiverton. I wrote the foregoing, and intended to have sent it by the express 
that went off in the morning, but while I was writing, I was informed the express was gone; and the 
change of situation and round of events that have 
since taken place, have prevented my forwarding 
what I had wrote, as matters seemed to be coming 
to a crisis. 
</p><p>
On the evening of the 29th, the army fell back to 
the north end of the Island. The next morning, the 
enemy advanced upon us in two columns upon the 
east and west road. Our light troops, commanded by 
Colonel Livingston and <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Colonel Laurens</a>, attacked the 
heads of the columns about seven o'clock in the morning, but were beat back they were reinforced with a regiment upon each road. The enemy still proved 
too strong. <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> formed the army in order of battle, and resolved to wait their approach 
upon the ground we were encamped on, and sent 
orders to the light troops to fall back. The enemy 
came up and formed upon Quaker Hill, a very strong 
piece of ground, within about one mile and a quarter 
of our line. We were well posted, with strong works 
in our rear, and a strong redoubt in front, partly 
upon the right of the line. 
</p><p>
In this position a warm cannonade commenced, and 
lasted for several hours, with continual skirmishes in 
front of both lines. About two o'clock the enemy 
began to advance in force upon our right, as if they 
intended to dislodge us from the advanced redoubt. 
I had the command of the right wing. After advancing four regiments, and finding the enemy still gaining ground, I advanced with two more regiments of 
regular troops, and a brigade of militia, and at the 
same time <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> ordered Colonel Livings 
ton, with the light troops under his command, to ad 
vance. We soon put the enemy to the rout, and I 
had the pleasure to see them run in worse disorder 
than they did at the battle of Monniouth. Our troops 
behaved with great spirit; and the brigade of militia, 
under the command of General Lovell, advanced with 
great resolution and in good order, and stood the fire 
of the enemy with great firmness. Lieutenant-Colonel 
Livingston, Colonel Jackson, and Colonel Henry B. 
Livingston, did themselves great honor in the transactions of the day; but it's not in my power to do 
justice to <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Colonel Laurens</a>, who acted both the General and the partisan. His command of regular troops 
was small, but he did every thing possible to be 
done by their numbers. He had two most excellent 
officers with him, Lieutenant-Colonel Henry and Major Talbot, 
</p><p>
The enemy fell back to their strong ground, and 
the day terminated with a cannonade and skirmishes. 
Both armies continued in their position all day yesterday, cannonading each other every now and then. 
Last night we effected a very good retreat, without 
the loss of men or stores. 
</p><p>
We have not collected an account of the killed and 
wounded, but we judge our loss amounts to between 
two and three hundred, and that of the enemy, to 
much more. 
</p><p>
We are going to be posted all round the shores 
as a guard upon them, and in that state to wait for 
the return of the fleet, which, by the by, I think will 
not be in a hurry. 
It is reported that Lord Howe arrived last night 
with his fleet and the re enforcement mentioned in 
your Excellency's letter to <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a>. If the 
report is true, we got off the island in very good 
season. 
</p><p>
The <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague'>Marquis</a> went to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> the day before the 
action, and did not return until last night, just as we 
were leaving the Island. He went to wait upon the 
Admiral, to learn his further intentions, and to get 
him to return again and complete the expedition, if 
possible. 
</p><p>
I observe your Excellency thinks the enemy design 
to evacuate <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. If they should, I think they 
will <a href='/results.php?city=newport' rel='city'>Newport</a> also; but I am persuaded they will do 
neither for the present. 
</p><p>
I would write your Excellency a more particular account of the battle and retreat, but I imagine <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Colonel Laurens</a> have done it already, and I am myself very much unwell. I have had 
no sleep for three nights and days, being severely 
afflicted with the asthma. I am, with great respect,

SIR, 
</p><p>
The growing extravagance of the people, and the 
increasing demand for the article of forage in this 
quarter, have become a very alarming affair. Hay is 
from sixty to eighty dollars a ton, and upon the 
rise.* Corn is ten dollars a bushel, and oats four; 
and every thing else, that will answer for forage, in 
that proportion. Carting is nine shillings a mile by 
the ton, and people much dissatisfied with the price. 
I have represented to the States of Rhode Island 
and Connecticut the absolute necessity of legislative 
interposition, to settle the prices of things upon some 
reasonable footing, of all such articles and services as 
are necessary for the use of the public in my department. I am going to do the same to the Council of this State. What effect it will have, I cannot 
say; but, if there is not something done to check 
the extravagance of the people, there are no funds 
in the universe that will equal the expense. 
</p><p>
The late affray that happened in this place, between the people of the town and those of the fleet, 
has been found to originate from a parcel of soldiers 
belonging to the Convention troops, and a party of 
British sailors which were engaged on board a privateer. The secret enemies to our cause, and the British officers in the neighbourhood of this place, are 
endeavouring to sow the seeds of discord as much as possible between the inhabitants of the place and the 
French belonging to the fleet. The French officers are 
well satisfied this is the state of the case, and it 
fills them with double resentment against the British. 
The Admiral and all the French officers are now 
upon an exceeding good footing with the gentlemen 
of the town. <a href='/results.php?tla=joh' rel='colleague'>General Hancock</a> takes unwearied pains 
to promote a good understanding with the French 
officers. His house is full from morning till night. 
</p><p>
I had a letter from the Marquis, day before yester 
day. He writes me he is endeavouring to represent 
every thing in the most favorable colors to the Court 
of France, in order to wipe away the prejudices that 
the letters of some of the more indiscreet may make 
upon that Court, All the French officers are extravagantly fond of your Excellency; but the Admiral 
more so than any of the rest. They all speak of you 
with the highest reverence and respect. General 
Hancock made the Admiral a present of your picture. 
He was going to receive it on board the fleet by 
the firing a royal salute. But <a href='/results.php?tla=joh' rel='colleague'>General Hancock</a> 
thought it might furnish a handle for some of the 
speculative politicians to remark the danger of characters becoming too important. He therefore dissuaded the Admiral from carrying the matter into 
execution. 
</p><p>
I find, by your Excellency's letter to <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a>, that you expect the enemy are going to evacuate <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and that it is probable they are 
coming eastward. I can hardly think they mean to 
make an attempt upon <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, notwithstanding the 
object is important; and, unless they attack <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>,there is no other object worthy their attention in 
New England. I am rather inclined to think they 
mean to leave the United States altogether. What 
they hold here now, they hold at a great risk and 
expense. But, suppose they actually intend to quit 
the Continent, they will endeavour to mislead our attention, and that of our allies, until they can get 
clear of the coast. The Admiral is fortifying for the 
security of his fleet; but I am told his batteries are 
all open in the rear, which will be but a poor security against a land force. <a href='/results.php?tla=wih' rel='colleague'>General Heath</a> thinks there ought to be some Continental troops sent here : 
but the Council will not turn out the militia; they 
are so confident the enemy are not coming here. If 
your Excellency thinks the enemy really design an 
attack upon <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, it may not be useless for you 
to write your opinion to the Council Board, for I 
suspect they think the General here has taken the 
alarm without sufficient reasons. The fortifications 
round this place are very incomplete, and little or 
nothing doing upon them. I have given General 
Heath my opinion what parts to take possession of, 
if the enemy should attempt the place before the 
Continental army gets up. From four to five hundred troops have arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=halifax' rel='city'>Halifax</a>; their collective 
strength will make a formidable army. 
</p><p>
I wish to know your Excellency's pleasure about 
my returning to camp. I expect Mrs. Greene will 
be put to bed every day. She is very desirous of 
my stay until that event; and, as she has set her 
heart so much upon it, I could wish to gratify her, 
for fear of some disagreeable consequences, as women 
sometimes, under such circumstances, receive great 
injury by being disappointed. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> granted me leave to come here 
upon the business of my department. I expect to 
return in a few days. Major Gibbs is with me, and 
is going to Portsmouth. 
This is the third letter I have wrote since I have 
had a line from your Excellency. Should be glad to 
hear from you when at leisure.

I am your Excellency's obedient servant,

SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's favor of the 22d was delivered 
to me this afternoon. I am happy to find you have 
wrote so fully to Congress, upon the disagreeable consequences that may follow from starving the Quarter 
master's department at this critical season. I wish it 
may have the desired effect, and rouse their attention; but I must confess I am afraid the stupor is 
so great, that nothing can alarm their fears, or pro 
mote a spirit of industry. 
</p><p>
I had but very little prospect, from my own application, of obtaining the necessary supplies of cash. 
What additional influence your Excellency's letter will 
give to my reasons and representation, time only can 
manifest. 
</p><p>
The treasury appears to be hard pressed on every 
side ; and the demands of this time are infinitely 
greater than it is in their power to satisfy with the 
greatest exertions, upon the present plan of striking money. The truth of the affair is, there has been a 
great degree of negligence and want of timely attention, to prepare seasonably for the present demands. 
When I was in town in the winter, I reported to the 
Treasury Board what I thought would be absolutely 
necessary for the Quarter-master's department to the 
2d of March; not one half of which have we been 
able to get, although every thing has been urged to 
induce them to supply our wants. 
</p><p>
On my arrival here, I laid your Excellency's letter 
respecting wagoners, before a Committee of Congress. 
They immediately confirmed it by a resolution, not 
withstanding they had been hammering upon the 
business for almost two months, off and on; and 
finally had put it (before the receipt of your letter) 
upon a very restrictive plan. 
</p><p>
The business of financing is in a poor way. There 
is no plan found, or scheme digested, for mending our money. There are a thousand projects on foot; but 
none appears to be taken up on a practical footing. 
</p><p>
There are complaints and murmurings in Congress 
against the people of this State, and the people of 
the State complain against the proceedings of Con 
gress. It is said, days and weeks together are spent 
upon the most trifling disputes in the world; and 
those generally of a personal nature. What will be 
the issue of this policy", I know not, 
</p><p>
I have wrote circular letters to all the deputies in 
my department on the east side of the Susquehanna, 
to enlist as many wagoners as they possibly can by 
the middle of next month; and to have all the pub 
lic teams forwarded so as to be in camp by that 
time. I expect our wagon-horses will fall short, as 
our agents have but a scanty supply of money. 
However, I will do the best I can. 
</p><p>
I wish to know whether I must increase the number of pack-horses. Orders have been given for one thousand; but <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> thinks near five hundred more will be wanted. It does not appear so to 
me ; but I am not a good judge of the business. 
The Board of War are out of lead ; and I fear the 
ammunition will not be ready. This is only conjectural. 
</p><p>
I wrote your Excellency before, that the Minister 
of France sets out for camp on Tuesday next. Don 
Juan will accompany him. There is a French ship 
just arrived from the West Indies; but I cannot 
learn that she brings any thing new. 
</p><p>
I intended to have set out for camp to-morrow, 
but I believe I shall not be ready until Monday in 
the forenoon. I have desired Congress to give me leave to resign, as I apprehended a loss of reputation, if I continued in the business. They are not 
disposed to grant my request at all. But unless 
they change their system, or publish their approbation upon the present, I shall not remain long in the 
business. I will not sacrifice my reputation for any 
consideration whatever. I am willing to serve the 
public ; but I think I have a right to choose that 
way of performing the service which will be most 
honorable to myself. I should be willing to serve in 
the department I am in for a proper consideration, if 
I could serve without the loss of reputation; but not 
without. 
</p><p>
I believe it has been a received opinion, that I 
was so very fond of the emoluments of the Quarter 
master's office, that nothing but absolute necessity 
would induce me to quit it, I will not deny but 
that the profits are flattering to my fortune, but not 
less humbling to my military pride; and he who has 
entertained such sentiments is a stranger to my feelings. While I had a prospect of pleasing your Excellency, the army, and the Congress, the service 
was agreeable ; but if a combination of circumstances 
changes these prospects, nothing shall induce me to 
continue in the business, even if the profits were 
made five times as large as they are. 
</p><p>
There is a great difference between being raised to 
an office and descending to one ; which is my case. 
There is also a great difference between serving where 
you have a fair prospect of honor and laurels, and 
where you have no prospect of either, let you discharge your duty ever so well. Nobody ever heard 
of a Quarter-master in history, as such, or in relating 
any brilliant action. I engaged in this business as 
well out of compassion to your Excellency as from a 
regard to the public. I thought your task too great, 
to be Commander-in-chief and Quarter-master at the 
same time. Money was not my motive. For you may 
remember I offered to serve a year unconnected with 
the accounts, without any additional pay to that which 
I had as Major-General. However, this proposition 
was rejected as inadmissible. Then I told the Committee that I would serve upon the same terms that 
Mr. Cox and Mr. Pettit could be engaged upon; and 
I have nothing more now, although I have a double 
share of duty, and am held responsible for all failures. 
</p><p>
Before I came into the department, your Excellency 
was obliged often to stand Quarter-master. However 
capable the principal was of doing his duty, he was 
hardly ever with you. The line and the staff were 
at war with each other. The country had been plundered in a way that would now breed a kind of civil 
war between the staff and the inhabitants. The manner of my engaging in this business, and your Excellency's declaration to the Committee of Congress, 
that you would stand Quarter-master no longer, are 
circumstances which I wish may not be forgotten ; as 
I may have occasion, at some future day, to appeal 
to your Excellency for my own justification. 
One thing I can say, with truth and sincerity, that 
I have conducted the business with as much prudence and economy, as if my private fortune had 
been answerable for the disbursements. And I believe your Excellency will do me the justice to say, 
the department has cooperated with your measures 
as far as circumstances were to be governed by me ; 
and this you had reason to apprehend would not 
have been the case had I not taken direction of the 
business. And here, in justice to my colleagues, I 
shall mention that I think them entitled to your Excellency's personal esteem, from the warmth of 
their wishes, and a desire to promote your ease and 
convenience. 
</p><p>
I am more acquainted with Mr. Pettit's mode of 
doing business than I am with Mr. Cox's ; but I 
think the public under great obligations to the for 
mer for his method and economy. I am, with the 
most perfect esteem, your Excellency's 
</p><p>

SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's favor of the 24th I had the 
honor of receiving last evening. I dined yesterday 
with the Minister of France, and find him still deter 
mined to set out for camp to-morrow. He sets out 
at seven in the morning, and intends lodging at 
<a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>. On Wednesday, he will be in camp, if no 
accident attends him ; but at what hour, cannot be 
ascertained, as the place he dines at is not yet determined on. I intend to wait upon him some time 
this morning, and learn more particularly his stages. 
Don Juan accompanies him. 
</p><p>
I thank your Excellency for your generous and 
obliging offer. Most certain, my inclination leads me 
to a resignation. My reputation I value more than 
any advantages of gain ; and I consider it in great 
danger. I wrote your Excellency lengthy upon this 
subject yesterday, and therefore shall say but little 
upon it to-day. I intend to write to Congress to 
day, upon the subject of my apprehensions and determination ; and, if they do not give me those kinds 
of assurances, which are necessary to guard my reputation from malice and detraction. I shall insist 
upon leaving the business. The politics of Congress 
are really alarming, and the state of the finances 
astonishing ; where they will end, time only can unfold. 
</p><p>
Mr. Holker made many inquiries yesterday, respecting the temper and disposition of our army. He 
seemed desirous to know, whether peace, upon a plan of independence agreeable to the state of the alliance, would be satisfactory ; the fishery to be con 
fined to the limits of the States. This would well nigh ruin the Eastern States. Upon the whole, I 
think there have been some overtures made upon the 
subject of peace. It is said Russia on the part of 
England, and Spain on the part of France, are to 
stand mediators. This is merely conjectural. Mr. 
Jay says the Congress have no official propositions 
of peace ; but I believe it is beyond a doubt there 
have been debates upon the subject for several days 
past, particularly with regard to the fishery. 
</p><p>
I spent last evening with Governor Reed. I took 
occasion to hint that <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> was to command the western expedition. lie took the alarm at 
once, and insisted he had no hopes of success, if he 
was to direct the operations. So deep are the prejudices of human nature. I had several hours conversation with him; and, I believe, satisfied him, as 
far as is possible, that the appointment was the result of the maturest deliberation. We were in private. 
</p><p>
If I leave the Quarter-master's department, I should 
be glad of the South Carolina appointment. How 
ever, I shall wish to consult your Excellency upon 
the affair. 
</p><p>
We have an agreeable piece of intelligence from 
the eastward ; which is, that Colonel Campbell and 
thirty or forty officers, and six or eight sail of transports, bound to Europe, were taken lately, by a couple of our frigates, and carried into <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. 
</p><p>
I had letters, last night, from South Carolina, 
which indicate a great disgust between the State 
and the Congress. They think themselves neglected. 
There is a large number of public vessels now on 
pay in the harbour, loaded with rice, which want to 
sail ; but the State is so much soured, that they will 
not grant exclusive privileges to the Continental vessels from the embargo. The express is waiting ; I 
can only add, that I am, with esteem and affection, 
Your Excellency's obedient servant,

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency undoubtedly has frequently had 
under consideration a proper position for winter-quarters. It is not always in the power of a General to 
take a position most favorable to his wishes, on ac 
count of provision and forage, or to place himself in 
the most advantageous point of view for covering the 
country and securing his capital posts. A certainty 
with respect to provision and forage is an object of 
the first consideration in taking a position. All inferior evils, of whatever nature, may, in some sort, be 
remedied by foresight and precaution; but there is 
no contending with hunger. Therefore, what would 
be considered only as secondary objects in some cases, 
become principals here. 
</p><p>
In the choice of a position, we must pay some regard to the enemy's collected force, and to our divided condition, in which the army must of necessity 
be cantoned. The enemy now appear to be putting 
their troops into winter-quarters ; but it cannot be 
supposed they will remain inactive all winter, if we, 
by the manner of cantoning the army, open to them 
an opportunity of insulting us to advantage. The 
mischievous consequences of having our quarters beat 
up, in the dead of winter, cannot readily be foreseen. 
That it would be their duty and interest to lay hold 
of such an opportunity, nobody can deny; and that 
the character of the General, and many national circumstances, lead to the supposition, must be agreed 
to. It is necessary, therefore, to take a position which will secure us from a surprise, and have as much 
force together as possible, to free us from insult. The 
place where, and the force necessary, to these ends, 
are the two capital points to decide upon. 
</p><p>
The command of the North River is an object of 
such importance, that the force and supplies necessary for this purpose must be had at all events. The 
force requisite for these garrisons, I suppose, has been 
very judiciously calculated by General Duportail; and 
I imagine there cannot be any great variation from 
his report. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will find, after detaching a proper 
force for this place, a covering party for the State 
of Connecticut, and the other necessary guards for 
King's Ferry, stores, and posts of communication, 
your force will be greatly inferior to that of the enemy ; and it will be growing more and more so as 
the service of the soldiers expires. It will be necessary, therefore, to endeavour to remedy, by the strength 
of ground, the deficiency of force. 
</p><p>
I have no doubt but that every State bordering 
upon the enemy, will apply for a proper force, to protect them against their ravages. To comply with 
these demands, will hard the safety of the whole 
army. Divide your force,, and you will fall a prey 
in every quarter; and, I am persuaded, were you to 
adopt the plan which would be most flattering to the 
wishes of the people, it would be so far from affording them that protection and security which they 
promise themselves, that it would become one of the 
principal causes of the enemy's making inroads, and 
committing depredations upon them. 
</p><p>
There can be but two modes of cantonment, to 
prevent the enemy from disturbing us in quarters. 
One is, to keep such a force together as to bid defiance to all their menaces ; the other is, to disperse 
the troops in such a manner as to afford no object. 
The first is infinitely the most favorable to discipline and economy. To disperse the troops among the 
inhabitants, will be attended with a certain loss of 
discipline to the soldiers and a general corruption of 
manners among the people. They will mutually debauch each other. Besides these disadvantages, the 
expense and waste of stores will be nearly double, 
and a great addition to the list of Staff Officers (al 
ready too numerous from the state of our money) 
will be found necessary. For these, and many other 
reasons too obvious to need explanation, dispersing 
the troops should be avoided at all events. 
</p><p>
Whatever covering is given to any part of the 
country, except where the principal force is stationed, 
should be so calculated as to be able to check the 
enemy's small ravaging parties, and yet not be an 
object worthy any considerable movement of theirs. 
</p><p>
From the representation of both the Commissary-General and the Foragemaster-General, I find your Excellency will be obliged to quarter the troops in 
New Jersey. The great consumption of forage, that 
has taken place in this State for five months past, 
will render it very difficult to provide for this garrison, and the different posts of communication. 
</p><p>
In cantoning the troops and drawing supplies for 
their subsistence, it may not be amiss to have an eye 
to the affair of next campaign. The expense and difficulty of transportation from the Western States, your Excellency is perfectly acquainted with. You are 
also sensible that the long tract of barren country, 
through which the supplies must come, will only admit of a certain quantity of transportation; therefore 
I conceive, that good policy points out the necessity 
of keeping as many stores in reserve in this State 
as possible. This is necessary, not only to be prepared for any emergency that may happen from the 
enemy's turning their force against the Eastern States, 
but to have a magazine in readiness for a secret 
purpose, which your Excellency hinted to me a few 
days since. 
</p><p>
The further we move our main force to the westward, and still be within supporting distance of this garrison, the better, both for the preservation of the 
provision and forage of this State, as well as to les 
sen the general expense of transportation. And the 
greater stock of provision and forage we can leave 
in this State, and upon the communications, the less 
difficulty we shall find in giving support to this 
place, should the enemy approach it. I should re 
commend, therefore, to quarter the army as far wesir 
ward as <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a> or <a href='/results.php?city=baskingridge' rel='city'>Baskingridge</a>. The country is 
strong, secure from a surprise, happily situated to receive supplies of provisions and forage, and not very 
inconvenient for giving protection and cover to the 
inhabitants. It is true, it is considerably removed 
from this place. But were we to take a position at 
Suffern's or <a href='/results.php?city=pompton' rel='city'>Pompton</a>, the consumption of forage would 
be so great that it would destroy the possibility of 
keeping up a communication with the Western States, 
however pressing the necessity, before the grass sea 
son. Suppose the enemy should move up, early in 
the spring, and lay siege to <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, and the 
supplies of this State prove unequal to our support, 
should we not be obliged to abandon it to its fate ? 
</p><p>
There is another objection to the Suffern's or <a href='/results.php?city=pompton' rel='city'>Pompton</a> position, which is, the advantage it gives the 
enemy of dividing our attention, by taking post at 
King's Ferry. It will be impossible for us to deter 
mine which is their object, the camp or <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>; 
and it will be almost as dangerous to expose our camp as these garrisons, especially early in the 
spring, when we have all our baggage about us, and 
no possibility of moving it off. If we take a position 
near Morris, we can always tell, by the motions of the 
enemy, what is their object; and, having our camp 
in a secure situation, should they turn their force to 
wards this place, we can march to its relief in such 
force as to give certain support, and at the same 
time leave our camp in perfect security. 
</p><p>
The fortifications here are so strong, and the garrison will be so numerous, that I think we have but 
little to fear, either from a surprise or storm ; and therefore we have only to guard against an investiture or siege. 
</p><p>
As the enemy have the advantage of a water transportation, and the spring is the most difficult part of 
the year for a land conveyance, it is most probable, 
if they have any designs upon this post, they will 
commence their operations before the grass season. 
Will it not be worth while, therefore, to form a small 
magazine of provision and forage, at or near Mr. Erskine's Iron Works, for the purpose of subsisting the 
army on their march to this place ? And another 
considerable magazine of provision and forage at 
Chester or Warwick for the support of this army in 
whatever position it may take for the relief of this garrison? These magazines should be formed from 
the westward, in the winter season, when there is 
the least call for transportation, and the roads the 
most favorable for the purpose. 
</p><p>
I imagine there will be great interest made for 
the eastern troops to be posted on the east side of 
the North River, to favor their recruiting. These 
reasons have something plausible in them, but I have 
my doubts with respect to their truth and reality. 
Men, when they are near home, are much more influenced by domestic attachments than they are when 
they are at a great distance. The friends and relations of the soldiers very seldom use their influence 
to engage them in the service. On the contrary, 
they commonly make use of every argument to dissuade them from it. I am of opinion, therefore, the 
further the troops are removed from home, the more 
favorable it will be to the recruiting service in camp. 
</p><p>
There is but one reason for cantoning the eastern 
troops on the east side of the North River; and that 
is, they are more convenient to receive their State 
stores. But this is so trifling a consideration, that it 
ought to have no weight, when it is opposed to so 
many more important considerations. 
</p><p>
My present opinion favors the following disposition 
of the troops for winter-quarters. The garrison here 
should consist of Patterson's, Learned's, Clinton's, and 
the North Carolina brigades, which, I believe, will forma force sufficient for the purpose. If the horse is 
posted in Connecticut, as seems to be thought on, I 
think the troops coming from Rhode Island, in con 
junction with the horse, will form a sufficient covering party for the exposed parts of Connecticut and 
Westchester. I would only wish Clinton's brigade to 
be here, because it may interest the inhabitants to 
furnish supplies in the winter, and to encourage the 
militia to turn out with spirit, should the enemy make a sudden move towards the post. The connection between the army and country will have an influence 
in both these respects. 
</p><p>
The Delaware regiment can furnish guards for 
King's Ferry, and the stores at Ilingwood, should 
your Excellency think proper to establish a magazine there. I mention this regiment for this service, be 
cause it seems to be unconnected with any brigades ; 
or, at least, the Maryland brigades are complete with 
out it. 
</p><p>
The rest of the troops I would quarter, as before mentioned, somewhere not far distant from Morris or 
<a href='/results.php?city=baskingridge' rel='city origin'>Baskingridge</a>, according as wood and water may favor a position. 
</p><p>
Should the enemy make any considerable detachments from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, a larger covering party may 
be necessary for the State of Connecticut, as I should 
have more apprehensions of their committing depredations, if they detach, than if they do not; for then 
they will have nothing left but to play the small game. 
</p><p>
The earlier the position is fixed upon, the better 
for quartering the army. I wish your Excellency,therefore, as soon as you have decided in your mind 
the places and force requisite for each side of the 
North River, and the garrison for these fortifications, 
would please to acquaint me therewith, as it will 
be a more perfect guide to my conduct, in making 
the preparations for cantoning the army. I am, with 
great respect, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
The situation of my department has been, for a 
long time, peculiarly embarrassed. My greatest solicitude and efforts have scarcely satisfied the common 
exigencies of the service ; and I have the mortification to find that, in spite of all my endeavours, the 
difficulties are every day increasing. 
</p><p>
I have repeatedly mentioned to your Excellency, 
for some months past, that the supplies of money 
furnished the department were very unequal to the 
current expenses. I have all along flattered myself 
that affairs would take a new and more favorable 
turn. As Congress were deliberating upon the subject of finance, I was led to believe that the schemes 
and plans they were adopting would afford more 
ample relief; and have encouraged the agents, under 
such an expectation, to proceed in the execution of 
the business. They have been enabled to extend 
their credit thus far, so as to keep the wheels in 
motion, hoping not to fail until government could 
find ways and means for furnishing us with cash 
more adequate to the demands. 
</p><p>
But whatever grounds I supposed there were for 
authorizing such expectations, I now find they were 
vain and nugatory. The cloud thickens, and the 
prospects are daily growing darker. There is now 
no hope of cash. The agents are loaded with heavy 
debts, and perplexed with half-finished contracts, and 
the people clamorous for their pay, refusing to proceed in the public business unless their present demands are discharged. The constant run of expenses, 
incident to the department, presses hard for further 
credit., or immediate supplies of money. To extend 
one, is impossible ; to obtain the other, we have not 
the least prospect. I see nothing, therefore, but a 
general check, if not an absolute stop, to the progress of every branch of business in the whole department, I have little reason to hope that, with the 
most favorable disposition in the agents, it will be 
in our power to provide for the occasional demands 
of the army in their present cantonments; much less, 
to have in readiness the necessary apparatus, and 
supplies of different kinds, for putting the army in 
motion at the opening of the campaign. My apprehensions of a failure in these respects are so strong, 
and my anxiety for the consequences so great, that I 
feel it my duty once more to represent to your Excellency our circumstances and prospects. From such a view of our situation, you may be led not to expect more from us than we are able to perform, and 
may have time to take your measures consequent 
upon such information. 
</p><p>
I know not whether government can command such 
sums of money as are necessary for the current expenses of the nation ; but it is a folly to expect that 
this expensive department can be long supported on 
credit. A further attempt would only bring ruin and 
distress upon ourselves, without affording any substantial advantage, either to the public or the army ; 
and, therefore, I think it highly necessary, as all military movements are under your immediate direction, 
and as the affairs of this department are intimately 
connected with all the active operations, that you 
should have a right understanding with Administration, with respect to the support they can give. 
in executing the measures you may think proper to 
take. 
There is no deficiency in the resources of the 
country. On the contrary, I have authentic reasons 
to conclude the country is more plentifully stored 
with every material necessary for the provision and 
support of an army, than it has been for three years 
past. The defect lies in a want of proper means to 
draw them into public use. I cannot see how a remedy will be applied to this evil in the present management of finance. The wretched state in which 
that is involved, creates HCAV obstructions, and an ac 
cumulation of expenses in every branch of the department. 
</p><p>
Hitherto our principal difficulty has arose from a 
want of proper supplies of money, and from the inefficacy of that which we obtained ; but now there 
appears a scene opening which will introduce new 
embarrassments. The Congress have recommended to 
the different States to take upon themselves the furnishing certain species of supplies for our department. The recommendation falls far short of the 
general detail of the business, the difficulty of ad 
justing which, between the different agents as well 
as the different authorities from which they derive 
their appointments, I am very apprehensive will introduce some jarring interests, many improper disputes, 
as well as dangerous delays. Few persons, who have 
not a competent knowledge of this employment, can 
form any tolerable idea of the arrangements necessary to give despatch and success in discharging the 
duties of the office, or see the necessity for certain 
relations and dependencies. The great exertions 
which are frequently necessary to be made, require 
the whole machine to be moved by one common interest, and directed to one general end. How far the 
present measures, recommended to the different States, 
are calculated to promote these desirable purposes, I 
cannot pretend to say; but there appears to me such a maze, from the mixed modes adopted by some 
States, and about to be adopted by others, that I 
cannot see the channels, through which the business 
may be conducted, free from disorder and confusion. 
</p><p>
It would be a folly for me to attempt to change 
the general disposition of mankind, or to flatter my 
self with the hopes of a different conduct from those 
who may be employed in the various branches of the 
department, than what is known to influence and 
govern men. If experiments are necessary, I have 
not the least objections to their being made ; but I 
cannot agree to be responsible for the consequences. 
If government is distressed, and these expedients are 
requisite for her relief, my aid shall not be wanting, 
during my stay in the department, to give them a 
fair and full operation ; but I cannot say that I think 
they will either answer the expectations of the pub 
lic, or prove competent to the demands of the army. 
</p><p>
It cannot be more disagreeable to your Excellency 
to receive, than it is to me to make, so unfavorable a representation. I have left no steps unattempted, 
that appeared calculated to put affairs on a more 
prosperous footing; and I have hoped that every 
succeeding account would be more promising than the 
last. I should betray my trust, were I to amuse your Excellency with hopes and encouragements; and I 
beg that this description of my department may not 
only be considered as justly drawn, but dictated by 
motives of duty, and aiming at the advantage of the 
public. I am, with great respect, 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,

SIR, 
</p><p>
The inclosed copy of a representation from Colonel 
Barry, an Assistant Deputy-Quartermaster-General in 
this State, will show your Excellency that a new 
difficulty has arisen to delay transportation. It is 
very unfortunate that we should lose the advantage 
of this favorable term of conveyance, as the time is 
just at hand when it will be almost impossible to 
bring forward the supplies. 
</p><p>
The inhabitants are unwilling to give their aid, at 
the prices regulated by law, unless the regulation 
extends through all the States. I do not consider 
myself authorized to instruct my agents to break 
over the laws of the State; and now find a stagnation in bringing on the provisions. 
</p><p>
People will withhold their services in this State, 
as long as they receive a less compensation than 
their neighbours. They seem to claim it as a right, 
that they be allowed their usual prices until the 
other States adopt measures for enforcing a regulation. I do not hear them object to have a limitation 
of prices take place ; but they insist upon its not 
being binding on them till it is so on others. your Excellency can foresee the consequences of the present difficulty, and will direct and authorize me in 
what manner to proceed. I am your Excellency's 
Most obedient, humble servant,

SIR, 
</p><p>
Inclosed I send your Excellency a copy of my 
last letter to Congress, to which they have given no 
answer, and which necessarily involves very important consequences. 
</p><p>
The affairs of the Quarter-master's department are 
so intimately connected with the operations of the 
army, and the security, support, and movements of 
the latter so dependent on the former, that I think 
it my duty to give your Excellency the earliest in 
formation of every change and embarrassment in it, 
which may affect the service. This measure is necessary, not only for the public welfare, but for my own 
justification. 
</p><p>
Although I esteem it a peculiar misfortune to be 
reduced to the necessity of taking steps tending to 
my own justification, yet when I have not that sup 
port which was promised me by the Committee of 
Congress, when I engaged in the duties of the office, 
and which was and still is necessary to the order 
and management of the business, I have nothing left 
but to point out the causes of the failure. And I 
trust, when my conduct comes to be fully understood, 
and the business of the department stripped of vulgar prejudices and private enmity, it will be found to 
have been both prudently and honestly conducted. I 
shall not enter into a justification of all the detail of 
the business. I know it is too extensive for the wisdom of an angel to guard against every imposition. 
I am not chargeable for such evils, where the mis 
fortune originates in the plan of the war and the 
state of the finances. Though I cannot pretend to 
be responsible for the fidelity, discretion and prudence 
of every agent employed in the lesser branches of 
business, yet I presume the much greater part of 
every order are men of integrity, and some of them 
are the first characters for business upon the Continent. One thing I will venture to affirm with confidence, which is, that every exertion has been made by all the agents to promote the service in general, 
and to fulfil your Excellency's orders in particular, 
as far as the means in their hands or their personal 
credit or influence could be extended for the purpose. 
</p><p>
The crisis is now fast approaching, when there will 
be a general stagnation of business, as some of the 
deputies have already left the department, and others 
preparing to follow their example. Some have advertised to stop all purchases on the public account, for 
want of money to fulfil the contracts ; others will be 
reduced by necessity to do the like. Transportation 
cannot be kept up for want of money to pay those 
employed in that service ; and even those teams, 
which serve with the brigades, begin to refuse further service, unless they are paid for the past. 
</p><p>
Thus we seem to be threatened with distress and 
ruin on every side. I shall continue to give every 
aid to the business in my power, but it must sink 
under its own weight, unless it is better supported 
than it has been for months past. I am, with great 
respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>

SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's public and private letters, of the 
26th, were handed me day before yesterday, and I 
wish it had been in my power to have given them 
an earlier answer; but the difficulty of satisfying 
myself, in all the matters contained in your letter, 
has prevented it. 
</p><p>
Many people are apprehensive for the fall of Charles 
ton ; and I think it in jeopardy, as well as the troops 
under Lincoln's command. I am more anxious for the 
fate of the troops than the city. Should they both 
fall together, in this critical stage of our finance, it is 
difficult to determine what will be the consequences. 
Most people seem to agree, that a further detachment of troops from this army cannot add any safety 
to the city, as its fall must be decided long before 
the troops can get up. Governor Reed, Generals 
Schuyler, Scott, and Wayne, are all of this opinion, 
as well as Mr. Sherman, and the Massachusetts Delegates; and this is clearly my opinion. But Colonel 
Gray son, and, I believe, the Board of War in general, 
are of opinion that a detachment ought to be sent 
on immediately, as they are apprehensive the city will 
fall, and the enemy push on to the northward. 
Should this happen, a proper force can be detached 
seasonably hereafter, as it cannot make but a few 
days difference whether they march now, or when 
the fall of the city shall be decided. If the enemy 
are defeated, the detachment ought not to go; and 
if they are not, it is already too late to give timely 
succour to the place. 
</p><p>
The business of finance is yet a matter of mere 
speculation. Nothing can be determined upon it from 
the present appearances. Most people are silent 
upon the subject; and this I interpret into a favorable symptom. I find the measure passed in Congress 
but by a majority of one, and the members are more 
split and divided about the matter now, than any 
other order of men; indeed, some of them reprobate 
the measure. I perfectly agree with your Excellency 
in sentiment, that it is the duty of every well-wisher 
to the cause to give all the support in his power to 
the plan, now it is taken. For the measure will en 
tail just as much disgrace upon us if it does not proceed, as if if does ; and, if the plan fails, I am at a 
loss to conceive how we are to support the war. 
Public and private credit is almost at an end. 
</p><p>
Nothing is done in the Quarter-master's department. The new system I mentioned in my last, is 
yet undecided on. The more I view it, the less I 
like it, and the stronger my conviction is, that it is 
calculated not less to embarrass your Excellency than 
to disgrace and injure me. Mifflin and Pickering are 
gone to Reading; and Mifflin has got the Massachusetts Delegates into his house, in town, upon 
very moderate terms, and, it is said, with a view of 
strengthening himself in that quarter. Depend upon 
it, he has a scheme, in concert with others. 
</p><p>
Public business is in a wretched train. All things 
at a stand ; and I don t believe the great departments of the army will be organized for a month to 
come, unless the new system is adopted, which will 
starve and disband the army in half the time. 
</p><p>
Generals Schuyler and Scott think it a most pal 
try thing. What I had in contemplation as a system, I am persuaded is the only plan which will 
yield proper support to the army, and cooperate with 
your Excellency's military manoeuvres. An army is 
viewed in Congress as a city, which may be supported and provided for, without regarding the emergencies of service. That body seem to be insensible of 
the great difference there is, in their public estimation, betwixt now and four years ago, not only among 
individuals, but with the States in general; and, in 
stead of strengthening their influence by a just and 
generous conduct to individuals, they add insult to 
injury. A political body, that acts upon such barbarous maxims of policy, cannot fail to bring ruin and 
distress upon the people, as no honest man, that has a regard for his reputation, would feel himself in the 
power of such people. Conscious of my own integrity, as well as faithful attention to the business committed to my trust, I cannot help feeling an honest 
indignation at the little arts made use of to lessen 
my merit and create suspicions to my prejudice. As 
I was placed in the office I now hold by your Excellency's particular request, and as you are the only 
person who can do me ample justice, I flatter myself 
I may safely rest my reputation with you, to place 
me in that point of light which justice and equity 
demand. 
</p><p>
It is the wish of many here, that your Excellency 
should come to town; and, I am persuaded, you 
would have it in your power to settle and arrange 
many matters, which, for want of being done, every 
thing is in a train the most ruinous and distressing 
imaginable. All our public horses in this State are 
starving. Hundreds have been drove into this city 
from the country, because the people refuse to keep 
them any longer. From the distressed situation the 
Forage department is in, I am afraid the most of our horses, if not all, will be altogether unfit for opening the campaign. After this day, we shall not have 
an ounce of forage in this city. This, I must confess, would not grieve me much, were we well provided elsewhere ; but, alas ! we are in just the same 
wretched situation in every quarter. People may 
sometimes be convinced by feeling, when they cannot 
by reasoning. 
</p><p>
I am very apprehensive we shall lose a great part 
of the articles we have manufacturing, as the people 
will not deliver them without payment. What grieves 
me most, is the loss of several hundred fine new 
wagons, which were in great forwardness, and on 
which we depended for the opening campaign. 
</p><p>
There is no arrival, or foreign news. We learn 
here, by the way of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, that Clinton was to 
attack <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> on the 15th of this month. 
</p><p>
I thank your Excellency for the information respecting Mrs. Greene, and desire my compliments to 
Mrs. Washington. With great respect, I am, 
Your Excellency's obedient servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
I am sorry it has not been in my power to give 
your Excellency an earlier answer to your letter of 
the 26th ultimo. The subject is a matter of such 
moment, that, although it required despatch, yet the 
delay must be less injurious than a want of fall 
information to decide with certainty. 
</p><p>
It is not less mortifying to me, than unhappy for 
the public interest and national security, that circumstances oblige me to confess myself unable, for want 
of sufficient support, either to make the proper provision in my department, necessary for marching the 
troops to the southward, or for putting the army in 
motion in these Northern States. There would be no 
difficulty, either in the one case or the other, could 
the treasury furnish the proper supplies of cash. But 
in its present exhausted state, with the enormous demands upon the department, the agents have neither 
credit nor influence equal to the business. 
</p><p>
Orders were seasonably issued for an ample provision for the opening campaign. Many are in part 
executed, and might be easily completed, were the 
agents enabled to fulfil their contracts. But the 
manufacturers, for want of payment, will neither go 
on with the business, nor deliver what they have completed. And though the loss of these articles will 
be a capital injury to the public, as well in point of 
saving in expense as that of accommodating the 
army, yet there is not the remotest prospect of obtaining cash, seasonably, to prevent the misfortune. 
</p><p>
I have given general and particular orders to the 
agents, to collect from the manufacturers as many of 
the articles contracted for as possible, and to hold 
them in readiness for further orders. But the people 
have suffered so much by the depreciation of the money, that they will not part with their property 
without immediate payment. In this predicament are 
the stores manufacturing for public use ; what part 
we shall be able to obtain, is difficult to determine. 
</p><p>
The public horses, which are quartered about in 
different parts of the country, are suffering for want 
of forage ; and I am afraid many will perish, before 
the States, under the new requisition, will provide amply for their support. But, could the whole be 
made fit for service at the opening of the campaign, 
which will by no means be the case, the number 
would be very insufficient to answer the demands of 
the army. I am, with great respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I have had a long conversation with General 
Schuyler this morning, and have seen the powers 
and appointments upon the present business intrusted to the direction of the Committee, as well as their 
powers to act under. From all which I am fully 
of opinion, that the plan is altogether incompetent to 
the purpose and end proposed. Time will not permit 
me to enter into the detail of objections, nor perhaps 
would their force appear in the same point of light 
to another, who has had less experience in the difficulties attending the business, than I have. 
</p><p>
It is my opinion, that your Excellency ought to 
ask the decided opinion of the Committee, in writing, 
whether they think their powers are competent to 
the business expected of them. If they say not, as 
I am sure they must, then I would require of them 
the powers and the plan they conceive necessary to 
support the enterprise ; the whole of which I would 
state to Congress, supported with my own sentiments, 
as well with respect to the defects of the present 
plan, as the plan necessary for the business. Nothing, 
but some such decisive measure as this, will put the 
business on a proper footing. The measure will, at 
least, place your conduct in the fairest point of light. 
It will free the Committee from their present embarrassments, and place the labouring-oar where it ought 
to be. If you undertake the business upon the present footing, and exercise powers beyond the present 
scheme, it will be asked, why you did not ask for 
an enlargement of the Committee's powers, if you 
deemed them inadequate. And if you engage and 
fail for want of support, it will be asked, why you 
embarked in such a business, without being fully persuaded that the means were adequate to the end. In 
whatever point of view I consider the subject, I see 
the greatest propriety in your Excellency stating to 
the Committee this qusere, whether it is their opinion they can give you such support as will warrant 
your engaging in a cooperation with the French 
forces for the redemption of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
</p><p>
I have just seen <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague'>Colonel Hamilton</a>, who says your Excellency desires my opinion upon the position the 
fleet off the Hook ought to take, upon the supposition it is a French fleet, and come with a view of 
cooperating with us. It is my opinion, if your Excellency intends to support the expedition against 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> at all events, without regard to the powers or plan laid down by Congress (if that should 
fail or appear inadequate to the end), then the fleet 
and forces ought to be immediately brought into the 
Hook, and the troops landed upon Staten Island, 
where our army ought to reenforce them at the 
same instant of time. But, if your Excellency is determined to depend upon civil government for sup 
port altogether, without any exertions of your own, 
and you think the present plan and powers of the 
Committee defective, it is my advice, to let the fleet 
and forces go into Rhode Island ; unless you should 
think it advisable to put one thousand or fifteen 
hundred men on board, and push on the fleet, without 
loss of time, to the southward. 
</p><p>
To bring the fleet into the Hook, without having taken some decisive resolution upon the line of conduct you mean to pursue, may tend to embarrass you and injure our ally. We ought carefully to 
avoid bringing our friends into distress and disgrace, 
if we cannot avail ourselves of the benefit intended us. 
</p><p>
I shall be at head-quarters in a few minutes, and 
will give your Excellency my further sentiments on 
the matter. I am, with great respect. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
