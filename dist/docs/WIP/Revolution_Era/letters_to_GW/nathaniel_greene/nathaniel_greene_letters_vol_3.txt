Dear General, 
</p><p>
I informed your Excellency, this morning, that the 
enemy were on the advance, in force. I now acquaint you that they proceeded, with vigor, until 
they had gained Connecticut Farms ; they then were 
checked by Colonel Dayton's regiment. They have 
since advanced, in two formidable columns, on the 
Springfield and Vauxhall roads. After very obstinate 
resistance, they are now in possession of Springfield, 
with one column ; with the other, they are advanced 
near the bridge leading to Vauxhall where Angell's 
pickets lay. From present prospects, they are directing their force against this pass, which I am determined to dispute, so far as I am capable. They are 
pushing a column to our left, perhaps to gain the 
pass in our rear towards Chatham. If they pursue 
this object, we must abandon our present position 
The militia turn, and are few ; and that few are so 
divided as to render little or no support. 
</p><p>
They advance with seven pieces of artillery in 
front, and appear not disposed to risk much. The militia are collecting, and I hope to derive support 
from them. I am 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I make use of the first moment to acquaint your 
Excellency, that the whole force of the enemy, which 
has been in Jersey, went from <a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a> Point 
between twelve and one o'clock this morning. Whether they crossed to Staten Island, or embarked on 
board their shipping, I am not yet sufficiently informed, although it is reported they have embarked 
and proceeded up Hackensac River. To the latter I 
give but little credit. However, I shall take immediate measures to ascertain the truth, and discover 
their present position and designs, as far as is possible. 
</p><p>
I shall do myself the honor to state to your Excellency, as soon as I have leisure, the proceedings 
of yesterday; and, in the interim, I am.

Your most obedient, humble servant,

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=nag" rel="me">Nathanael Greene</a>.

P. S. I have ordered <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague met'>General Wayne</a> to join the 
army under your Excellency's immediate command, 
and beg to receive your directions respecting the remainder of the troops.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
The more I have thought upon the subject of explaining the reasons and causes of our movements to 
the army, and through them to the country, the more 
I am confirmed in my opinion of the propriety and 
necessity for it. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency "will consider this is a great movement and has been very rapid; the march of the 
army has been very fatiguing ; the teams of the 
country have been impressed, and every kind of property laid hold on, to pave the way to a certain 
plan of operations. If it is all relinquished, without 
any explanation, the natural reflections that will arise 
upon the occasion will be, why has the army been 
thus harassed without an object; why have the people 
been dragged from their homes, with their teams, and 
the public subjected to a most enormous expense ; 
and why has the property of the people been laid 
hold on by the hand of power, when there appears 
nothing to warrant these extraordinary measures ? 
</p><p>
Without some explanations we shall not do justice 
to ourselves, nor will your Excellency to your own 
military character. The enterprise was great, the object noble, and the end for which it was undertaken 
appears to have been partly answered, if not fully 
so. To explain the reasons for the movement will 
give the army a high opinion of the confidence you 
have in their spirit and enterprise, and perfectly reconcile them to all the past fatigues, and to those 
which may follow, in regaining our former position. 
It will strike the enemy with the boldness of the design; it will be pleasing to the French army, as a measure calculated to give the most speedy relief; 
it will reconcile the country to all the inconveniences 
they have felt, and prepare their minds for future 
exertions of a similar nature, in full confidence that 
the object is worthy the preparation. 
</p><p>
Though I am no advocate, in common, for giving 
reasons, either to the army or the community, for our 
movements, yet there are cases when substantial advantages can be drawn from it; and when the people's curiosity can be gratified and the public be 
benefited at the same time, I think it will be justifiable to adopt the measure. It is unnecessary to 
gasconade highly upon the occasion; but I think we 
may, with great reason, suppose the enemy's return 
to be in consequence of our movements, and that 
gives us the reputation of having saved our allies 
from an injury, and subjected the enemy to the mortification of having been obliged to relinquish their 
project. 
</p><p>
If the explanation takes place, there will be no inconvenience in our recrossing the river. Without it, 
I think there will; for, both the army and the country will think all is given up, and there will be no 
preparations proportionable to the business in contemplation. Your Excellency may remember that 
Sir Henry Clinton explained his movement up to 
Stony Point last campaign, after <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague met'>General Wayne</a> took 
that place. He had not half the reasons for that 
explanation as you have for this. 
</p><p>
I wish your Excellency to determine upon your 
further operations, as soon as possible, as boards and 
teams are impressing, collecting, and coming to camp, 
as fast as possible. If the teams are not likely to 
be wanted immediately, they had better be discharged without loss of time, as it will save a great expense, and free the people from no small inconveniences. 
</p><p>
Colonel Hay has sent down a considerable quantity of hoards to King's Ferry, and more are coming. 
Mr. Clarke, of Danhury, writes me that he has got 
an account of one hundred thousand feet, which may 
be had, but not without great inconvenience to the 
inhabitants, as they were got to rebuild the houses 
burnt by the enemy last campaign. There is a great 
number of impressed teams at King's Ferry, on the 
other side, which I wish to dismiss, if there is not 
an immediate necessity for them. I am, with great 
respect.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
The time for which I engaged to act in the Quarter-master's department, at the request of the Committee of Congress for Cooperation, is almost expired; and as I cannot exercise the office any longer, 
consistent with my own safety, I am to request 
your Excellency will take measures for relieving 
me, as soon as possible, from the disagreeable predicament I am in. In the mean time I shall be 
exceedingly obliged to your Excellency for the sense 
you entertain of my conduct and services since I 
have been in the department, as you alone are the 
best judge of the propriety of one and the merit of 
the other. The business is truly disagreeable and 
distressing, and has been so for a long time ; not withstanding, if it had been possible for me to have 
got through it this campaign, consistently with my 
own safety and the public good, upon the plan which 
Congress proposed, I would readily have done it. But, 
from the knowledge I have of the department, I 
know it is utterly impossible to follow the system, 
and answer the demands of the service; and to attempt it, at this critical season, will most assuredly 
defeat our plan of operations, and bring the army 
into the greatest distress. 
</p><p>
It would be a folly for me to attempt to combat 
the prejudices of public bodies, with hopes of success. 
Time alone can convince them that their measures 
are destructive of their true interest, as well as highly 
injurious to some of their most faithful servants. 
</p><p>
I am sensible my conduct has been viewed by 
many in a very improper light; and I am persuaded 
many think the business can be done with more 
method, and at a less expense, than it has been. I 
wish it may be the case ; but am much mistaken if 
the nature of the business is capable of more system, 
or will admit of less expense, if the plan of the war 
continues on its present scale, and the army on its 
present footing. 
</p><p>
I have endeavoured, to the utmost of my power, to 
enter into the spirit and intention of your Excellency's measures; and if my conduct has not been 
satisfactory to Government and to yourself, it has 
been owing to a want of abilities, and not inclination. 
I am, with great respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,

Sir, 
</p><p>
A new disposition of the army going to be made, 
and an officer appointed to the command of West 
Point and the district on the east side of the North 
River, I take the liberty just to intimate my inclinations for the appointment. Your Excellency will 
judge of the propriety, and determine as the honor 
of the army and the good of the service may require. 
</p><p>
I hope there is nothing indelicate or improper in 
the application. I am prompted to the measure from 
the feelings incident to the human heart, as well as 
encouraged in the hope that it would meet your approbation, from the flattering manner in which you 
have been pleased to speak of my conduct upon different occasions, I shall make use of no arguments, 
being persuaded my pretensions and inclinations will 
have their full operation, and that notliing short of 
the public good and military prosperity will contravene my wishes. 
</p><p>
My first object is the freedom and happiness of 
my country. With these, your Excellency's reputation and glory are inseparably connected ; and as it 
has been my constant wish, so it shall be my future 
endeavour, to promote the establishment of both.

I am, &c.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letter of the 14th, appointing 
me to the command of the Southern army, was delivered me last evening. 
</p><p>
I beg your Excellency to be persuaded that I am 
fully sensible of the honor you do me, and will endeavour to manifest my gratitude by a conduct that 
will not disgrace the appointment. I only lament 
that my abilities are not more competent to the 
duties that will be required of me, and that it will 
not be in my power, on that account, to be as extensively useful as my inclination leads me to wish. 
But, as far as zeal and attention can supply the defect, I flatter myself my country will have little 
cause to complain. I foresee the command will be 
accompanied with innumerable embarrassments. But 
the generous support which I expect from the partiality of the southern gentlemen, as well as the aid 
and assistance I hope to derive from your Excellency's advice and extensive influence, affords me 
some consolation in contemplating the difficulties. 
</p><p>
I will prepare myself for the command as soon as 
I can. But, as I have been five years and upwards in service, during all which time I have paid no attention to the settlement of my domestic concerns 
(and many divisions of interest, and partition of landed property, between me and my brothers, have taken 
place in the time, and now lie unfinished), if it was 
possible, I should be glad to spend a few days at 
home, before I set out to the southward, especially 
as it is altogether uncertain how long my command 
may continue, or what deaths or accidents may happen, during my absence, to defeat the business. I 
beg your Excellency's opinion upon the matter, by 
which I will regulate my conduct. However, it will 
not be possible for me to leave this place for several 
days, if I put my baggage in the least order, or my 
business in a proper train for such a long journey. 
Nor is my health in a condition to set out immediately, having had a considerable fever upon me for 
several days. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=wih' rel='colleague met'>General Heath</a> arrived last evening, and will take 
the command this morning. I shall make him fully 
acquainted with all the dispositions I have made, and 
steps taken, which concern the post and its dependencies j and will give him my opinion what further 
is necessary to be done, to carry into execution your 
Excellency's instructions for putting the garrison in 
a proper state of defence, and prepare it for the approaching winter. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel='colleague met'>General McDougall</a> is also here, and I have the 
pleasure to inform you that he and I perfectly agree 
in sentiment in what concerns the garrison and its

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
On my arrival at this place, I laid your Excellency's letter before Congress, and addressed them 
on the business of the Southern department. I am 
happy to inform you that my appointment is perfectly agreeable to their views and wishes. But I 
am sorry to acquaint you that, from the best account 
I can get of the state and condition of the troops in 
that quarter, nothing is to be expected from them, 
unless large supplies can be forwarded from the 
northward. They are altogether without clothing and 
blankets, and totally unfit for any kind of service. 
To carry them into the field, in this condition, will 
only fill the hospitals, and sacrifice the lives of a 
great many valuable men. Arms are not less wanting than clothing, and wagons as much as either. 
Men, I believe, may be had, if it was in our power 
to equip them for the field. But how we shall do 
this, is difficult for me to imagine. Congress can 
furnish no money, and the Board of War neither clothing nor other necessaries. Indeed, the prospect 
is dismal and truly distressing. 
</p><p>
I beg your Excellency to urge, unceasingly, the 
necessity of forwarding supplies for the Southern 
army, as it will he impossible to carry on a winter 
campaign without clothing. I have laid before Congress an estimate of our wants; but there is not the 
shadow of a prospect of their being furnished, unless 
constant attention is paid to the business. And I 
am apprehensive, as soon as I am gone, and no one 
left to urge our wants, they will soon be forgotten. 
</p><p>
The late success of the militia against Colonel Ferguson, I am in hopes will be attended with good 
consequences. It will give a severe check to the 
Tories, and spirit and confidence to the Whigs. A 
report prevails this day that Lord Cornwallis has retreated precipitately from Charlotte towards Camden. 
</p><p>
The detachment of the enemy, that sailed lately 
from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, are landed at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, in Virginia ; and it is said the shipping are pushing up 
the rivers. The troops have taken possession of the 
great bridge, by which, I am told, they command all 
the lower counties. 
</p><p>
How to employ our little force, if we are attacked 
both in Virginia and North Carolina at the same 
time, is difficult to determine. My first object will 
be to equip a flying army, to consist of about eight 
hundred horse, and one thousand infantry. This force, 
with the occasional aid of the militia, will serve to 
confine the enemy in their limits, and render it difficult for them to subsist in the interior country. I 
see but little prospect of getting a force to contend 
with the enemy upon equal grounds, and therefore 
must make the most of a kind of partisan war, until 
we can levy and equip a larger force. Such was the difficulty of getting provisions and providing the 
means of transportation, that <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> writes, in 
his last letter, that the army was in the utmost danger of disbanding. 
</p><p>
Congress have invested me with the same powers 
they gave to <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>, and annexed Maryland 
and Delaware to the Southern department. The arrangement of the army has taken place, and, I hope, 
upon a footing which will render it more respectable 
than it has been, provided the business of finance 
can be got into some regular order. But that is our 
weak side ; and I wish our distresses may be painted 
in their true colors to the Minister of France, as he 
intimated to <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron Steuben</a> that your Excellency did 
not appear to be apprehensive of any difficulty from 
the state of our affairs. 
</p><p>
I have made application to the merchants of this 
city for clothing for the Southern army; but they 
excused themselves, as having engaged more already 
than they can perform. I intend to try to put subscriptions on foot in Maryland and Virginia for the 
purpose of supplying clothing. Whether it will produce any good or not, time only can determine. At 
any rate I shall have the satisfaction of having done 
all in my power; and if there is not public spirit 
enough in the people to defend their liberties, they 
will deserve to be slaves. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='colleague'>General Knox</a> promised to send forward a company 
of artillery, if your Excellency approved thereof I 
wish they may come forward, without loss of time. 
This State have promised to lend me one thousand 
stand of arms, upon a promise of their being replaced, which I beg your Excellency to give an order for, as this was the only footing they could be 
obtained upon. I have the honor to be, &c.,

Sir, 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Lieutenant-Colonel John Laurens</a> is very anxious 
to join the Southern army, as soon as he gets exchanged. His knowledge of the Southern States, and 
of the customs and manners of the people, will render his services very necessary in that quarter.
</p><p>
Congress have passed a resolution authorizing me 
to make exchanges. I could wish to know your Excellency's intentions in this business, as it is my wish 
to regulate my conduct agreeably to your views. 
</p><p>
The arms we are likely to get from the Board of 
War and this State fall far short of my expectations. 
The whole will not exceed fifteen hundred. I must 
beg your Excellency, therefore, to forward us three 
or four thousand from the Eastern States, as it is 
impossible to get them here. We are not less deficient in cartouch-boxes than arms. 
</p><p>
I am apprehensive the difficulty of forming a large 
body of cavalry in Virginia, will be much greater 
than I imagined. I wish, therefore, if it was possible, the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='colleague'>Duke De Lauzun</a>'s legion might be detached 
to serve with the Southern army, provided it can be 
done consistently with the views of <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague'>Count Rochambeau</a>. 
The British might receive a deadly blow in Virginia, 
if <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague'>Count Rochambeau</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=cdt' rel='colleague'>Admiral Ternay</a> would 
suddenly embark their troops, and land in Virginia. 
The enemy's fleet there is much inferior to that of 
the French ; and the land force of the former greatly 
inferior to the latter, when joined by the troops levying in Virginia, and the militia of the country. But 
this will be thought too hazardous, perhaps.

Sir, 
</p><p>
I am happy in the opportunity of answering your 
Excellency, that I am received and treated with all 
the marks of respect and attention that I can wish. 
Your letters have been of singular service ; and I am 
exceedingly obliged to you for the warm manner in 
which you recommended me to the notice of your 
friends ; among whom, Mr. Carey has been very polite and obliging. 
</p><p>
Your weight and influence, both with Congress and 
this State, in support of the southern operations, will 
be exceedingly important and necessary to my success. 
I must request, therefore, in the most earnest manner, 
that your Excellency continue to animate both those 
bodies, with your opinion and recommendations, to 
such measures, and such exertions, as will be necessary to give due support to the Southern army, 
without which, I am very apprehensive, the languor 
that is too apt to seize all public bodies will lull 
them into a state of false security, and the affairs in 
the Southern department will and must go to ruin. 
It has been my opinion for a long time; that personal influence must supply The defects of civil constitution; 
but I have never been so fully convinced of it as on 
this journey. I believe the vievss and wishes of the 
great body of the people are entirely with us. But 
remove the personal influence of a few, and they are a 
lifeless and inanimate mass, without direction, or spirit 
to employ the means they possess, for their own security. 
</p><p>
I cannnot contemplate my own situation without 
the greatest degree of anxiety. I am far removed 
from almost all my friends and connections, and have 
to prosecute a war in a country, in the best state 
attended with almost insurmountable difficulties, but 
doubly so now, from the state of our finances and 
the loss of public credit. How I shall be able to 
support myself, under all these embarrassments, God 
only knows ! My only consolation is, that if I fail, I 
hope it will not be accompanied with an}'- peculiar 
marks of personal disgrace. Censure and reproach ever 
follow the unfortunate. This I expect, if I don't succeed ; and it is only in the degree, not in the entire 
freedom, that I console myself The ruin of my family is what hangs most heavy upon my mind. My 
fortune is small, and misfortune or disgrace to me 
must be ruin to them. 
</p><p>
I beg your Excellency will do me the honor to 
forward the inclosed letter to Mrs. Greene, by the 
first safe conveyance, who is rendered exceedingly 
unhappy at my going to the southward. 
</p><p>
Mr. Custis arrived in town yesterday, and says 
Mrs. Washington is to set out for the army this day.

P. S. Colonel Scammell, perhaps, will be promoted 
to the rank of Brigadier ; at least, it has been talked 
of. Should this take place, a new Adjutant-General will be necessary J and I beg leave to suggest the 
propriety of giving this appointment to <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Hamilton</a>. His services may not be less important to 
your Excellency in your family business, if he only 
employs a deputy extraordinary ; and I am persuaded

as I am confident it is his wish, by what he said to 
me before I left camp.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
In my last despatches, of the 7th instant, I informed your Excellency of my arrival at camp, and of 
the condition and situation of the army. I was apprehensive, on my first arrival, that the country 
around Charlotte was too much exhausted to afford 
subsistence for the army at that place for any considerable time. Upon a little further inquiry, I was 
fully convinced, and immediately despatched Colonel 
Kosciuszko, to look out a position on the Pedee, 
that would afford a healthy camp and provisions in 
plenty. His report was favorable, and I immediately 
put the army under marching orders ; but the excessive rains, which continued eleven days, prevented our 
marching till the 20th instant. We arrived here the 
26th, having performed the march with incredible 
difficulty, through a barren country, with wagons and 
horses altogether unfit for service. The probability 
that my taking this position would discourage the 
enemy from attempting to possess themselves of Cross 
Creek, which would have given them command of the 
greatest part of the provisions in the lower country, 
was another inducement to come to this place. It is 
also a camp of repose ; and no army ever wanted one 
more, the troops having totally lost their discipline. 
</p><p>
Before I left Charlotte, I detached three hundred 
of our best troops, and Lieutenant-Colonel Washington's regiment of light dragoons, under the command 
of General Morgan, with orders to take a position on 
the south side of the Catawba, near the fork of Broad 
River, where he was to be joined by three hundred 
volunteers, under General Davidson, and four or five 
hundred South Carolina and Georgia militia, under 
the command of Colonel Clark and Colonel Few. 
With this party, he is either to act upon the offensive or defensive, as occasion may warrant. This 
will straiten the enemy in their limits, and prevent 
their drawing supplies from the upper country. It 
will also give spirits to the inhabitants of that quarter, and enable them to form a number of small magazines in the rear of the troops (which General JNIorgan has particularly in charge), that we may have 
something; to subsist on should we be able to advance 
hereafter in force. 
</p><p>
Lord Cornwallis continues in the same position that 
he was when I wrote before, and General Leslie arrived off <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> Bar the 14th ; but whether he 
has landed any of his troops, I am not informed. 
The troops, mentioned to have arrived in my former 
letter, were only some recruits that came in with provision vessels, not exceeding four or five hundred men. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> left The army the 10th, and General Smallwood the 19th instant. The latter is gone to 
Maryland, with a view of forwarding the troops and 
supplies from that State, and to settle the matter 
with Congress respecting his right of promotion, beins determined not to submit to the command of the 
<a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron De Steuben</a>, who is still in Virginia, very usefully employed in forming, and forwarding the troops 
from that State. 
</p><p>
I have been obliged to send Major Nelson's corps 
of horse and Colonel Armand's legion to Virginia, 
both being unfit for duty, for want of clothing and 
other equipments ; and the difficulty of subsisting 
them is much greater here than there. Before my 
arrival. <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> made an attempt to employ 
part of Colonel Armand's legion, and fifteen of them 
deserted on the march from Hillsborough to Charlotte, which obliged him to recall them. I wish your 
Excellency's directions respecting this corps, as they 
are totally deranged, and cannot be fit for service for 
some time. 
</p><p>
Two slight skirmishes have been fought with the enemy, since my last, one by a party under <a href='/results.php?tla=frm' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Marion</a>, upon the Santee, and the other by Colonel Few, near Ninety Six. About twenty or thirty were killed and wounded on each side. 
</p><p>
I will not pain your Excellency with further accounts of the wants and sufferings of this army ; but I am not without great apprehension of its entire 
dissolution, unless the Commissary's and Quarter-master's departments can be rendered more competent to the demands of the service. Nor are the Clothing 
and Hospital departments upon a better footing. Not a shilling in the pay-chest nor a prospect of any for months to come. This is really making bricks 
without straw. I am, &c.,

P. S. This moment accounts have been received 
that General Leslie landed his troops at <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> 
on the 21st instant, and, on the 24th, was at Monk's 
Corner, on his way to Nelson's Ferry.

Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letter, of the 13th of December, 
came to hand this day. It is true I came to the 
southward in expectation of meeting with difficulties; 
but they far exceed what I had any idea of 
</p><p>
This country is so extensive, and supplies are so 
difficult to obtain, that it is impossible to carry on 
the war any length of time with the militia. The 
waste of stores, and consumption of provision and forage, must ruin any nation in the universe, whose 
revenue is not greater than ours. A good army, well 
appointed and supplied, consisting of four or five 
thousand infantry, and about eight hundred or one 
thousand horse, is what is wanted for the defence of 
this country; and without which it must be inevitably ruined and lost. With such a force, I think the 
country can be defended, with the occasional aid of 
the militia, against any force the enemy can maintain in this quarter. Neither they nor we can maintain a great force in this department, unless supplies 
can be had by a water communication. The country 
is so extensive, and there are such great barrens. 
that the natural strength and resources of these States 
are unequal to the burden of maintaining a very 
large force. 
</p><p>
The militia have ravaged this quarter in such a 
manner, that it will be with the greatest difficulty we 
shall be subsisted. The want of money is a great 
difficulty we meet with in supporting the army ; but 
the want of arrangement is no less an evil than that. 
We have but a very little force in the field, and two 
thirds of them are totally unfit for duty ; and, unless 
clothing arrives soon, I must disband them. I am 
persuaded, unless the States have it in their power 
to levy, equip, and support such an army as I have 
mentioned, these States are inevitably lost. 
</p><p>
The detachment which your Excellency mentions 
as embarking at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, are arrived at Virginia, 
as I am this day informed by <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron Steuben</a>, and 
are almost as high up James River as Petersburg. 
We have nothing to oppose them there, except the 
militia, and about four hundred eighteen-months' men, 
as ragged and naked as the Virginia blacks. The 
enemy in this quarter are making great preparations 
for an immediate movement. Our troops are in such 
a wretched condition, that we can give them little or 
no opposition. We will do all in our power; but the 
soldiers have no spirits, and it is impossible they 
should, in their present situation. I wish the enemy 
would give us a little more time to prepare ourselves. 
However, I don't intend to be drove out of North 
Carolina if I can possibly avoid it; and, if Virginia 
will furnish the provision I have requested to be deposited upon Roanoke, we will hold one corner, at all 
events. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron Steuben</a> wrote me, that he met with insuperable difficulties in his attempts to arrange the Virginia line. I have written to General Scott, at <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, to collect the wishes and intentions of the officers in captivity. If there are as many in proportion 
to their numbers, as there are here, who wish to go 
home, there will he few left, I have had the resolutions of Congress respecting specific supplies, and 
shall make my requisitions accordingly. Inclosed is 
an extract of a letter from General Morgan, confirming the account given in his former letter, an extract of which is inclosed in my letter to go by General Duportail, who has been detained a few days 
for want of horses. 
</p><p>
It is my opinion, if the French fleet and army at 
Rhode Island could be induced to push into Chesapeake Bay, they would have it in their power to 
ruin the fleet and army with General Phillips. The 
Southern States are in a critical situation, and great 
exertions and some hazard are necessary to save 
them. This is not only my opinion, but General Duportail's. I am, with great respect.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
My public letter will inform your Excellency of 
the success of the troops under the command of General Morgan. The event is glorious ; and I am exceedingly unhappy that our wretched condition will 
not permit our improving it to the best advantage. 
I shall do all I can, but our prospects are gloomy. 
Our force is small, and daily declining. We have no 
clothing or provisions but what we collect from day 
to day ; and the enemy's late excursion into Virginia 
I apprehend, will cut off our prospects from that 
quarter. I hope your Excellency will repeat your 
letters to Congress upon the necessity of filling the 
army, and forming magazines of provision and forage. 
We never can be fortunate but that it operates to 
our disadvantage ; and above half the pleasure that 
results from the victory is lost in the apprehension that it will relax the preparations for the support of the war. I wish your Excellency to place 
this event in its true point of light to Congress ; 
that if it stands alone it will be of no consequence, 
but, if properly improved upon, it may have the 
most salutary effects. 
</p><p>
What your Excellency mentioned in your last private letter to me is very just; the Commanding Officer has a collective view of all the difficulties in the 
different departments. But, when I was with the 
Northern army, I had a pretty good opportunity of 
knowing the difficulties, from being at the head of 
one of the great departments, and from the confidence which you were pleased to honor me with. 
</p><p>
In comparing the difficulties of the northern service with this of the southern, one bears but a small 
proportion to the other — whether from the make of 
the country, the divisions among the inhabitants, the 
difficulty of obtaining supplies, or the unequal force 
we have to contend with. And my spirits would 
sink under the load, was it not from a persuasion 
that, to whatever straits I may be reduced, or however unfortunate I may be, from the hazards I am 
obliged to run, your Excellency will do justice to 
my intentions. I have one consolation, which is, I 
have the confidence of the troops, and the good will 
of the officers. But the unsettled state of the different lines in point of rank, multiplies our embarrassments ; nor can I see the least prospect of bringing 
them to a speedy close. 
</p><p>
I hope <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron Steuben</a> writes your Excellency respecting the enemy's movements in Virginia, as I 
have desired him to be very particular, and keep 
you constantly informed of every material circumstance. I beg my respectful compliments to Mrs. 
Washington, and to all the gentlemen of your family. I am, with esteem and regard. 
</p><p>

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
In my despatches of the 29th ultimo, I did myself 
the honor to acquaint your Excellency with the disposition I had made to counteract the movements of 
the enemy, and to protect the country from their depredations. 
</p><p>
Lord Cornwallis continued at Weymsborough, making every preparation, and completely equipping his 
troops for the most active operations, until the 9th 
instant ; when, having been joined by the troops under General Leslie, he put his army in motion, and 
advanced as far as the Cross Roads, on the west side 
of the Catawba river, and about forty miles from Camden. The position which Brigadier- General Morgan 
occupies, was well chosen for harassing the left flank, 
and checking the progress of the enemy on the route 
they had taken for the execution of their plan of 
operations. This, I suppose, induced his Lordship, on 
the 11th, to detach Lieutenant-Colonel Tarleton to dislodge him, and disperse the few militia who were 
collecting. 
</p><p>
I have the satisfaction to transmit your Excellency 
a copy of a letter which I this moment received from 
Brigadier-General Morgan, announcing the total defeat 
of Lieutenant-Colonel Tarleton's detachment. The victory was complete, and the action glorious. The brilliancy and success with which it was fought does the 
highest honor to the American arms, and adds splendor to the character of the General and his officers. 
I must beg leave to recommend them to your Excellency's notice, and doubt not, but from your representation, Congress ill receive pleasure from testifying their approbation of their conduct. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=anp' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Pickens</a> was left on the ground, to relieve 
the wounded and to cover that part of the country. 
I am unhappy that the distressed situation of this 
army will not admit of our improving the advantage 
we have gained. But I hope it has given the enemy 
a check that will prevent their advancing for some 
days. Our supplies of provisions are growing more 
precarious ; and the other stores, which I can only 
look for from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, do not arrive in such 
quantities as to replace those which are daily destroyed in service, I have appointed Major Hyrne, 
Deputy Commissary-General of Prisoners for the 
Southern department, and ordered him to send all the 
prisoners of war to Virginia, The militia, under General Stephens, will take charge of them, as their time 
of service has already expired. 
</p><p>
I have directed Major-General the <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron De Steuben</a> to transmit to Congress and to your Excellency, 
regular reports of the operations in Virginia. I do 
myself the honor to inclose a copy of my letter to 
Congress respecting the action of the 17th instant. 
I am. with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and 
respect.

Since I wrote your Excellency by Major Giles, 
Lord Cornwallis has been constantly in pursuit of the 
light infantry and the prisoners, and is now between 
the Shallow Ford, upon the Yadkin and Salem, one 
of the Moravian towns ; and still pushing into the 
country with great rapidity. The moment I was informed of the movements of Lord Cornwallis, I put 
the army in motion on Pedee, and left it under the 
command of Brigadier-General linger, and set out to 
join the light infantry, in order to collect the militia, 
and embarrass the enemy till we could effect a junction of our forces. 
</p><p>
General Morgan, after the defeat of Tarleton, had 
very judiciously made forced marches up into the 
country, and happily crossed the Catawba the evening before a great rain, which prevented the enemy 
from following him for several days, during which 
time the prisoners were got over the Yadkin, and on 
their march for Dan River, which I hope they have 
passed, and are in Virginia. 
</p><p>
On my arrival at the light infantry camp, I found 
them at Sherald's Ford, on the Catawba. The enemy were a little lower down the river, at Mc Cowen's forces and the river still so high that they could not 
cross. We made the best disposition we could to 
stop them, when the river should fall. But the fords 
were so numerous, and our forces so small, that we 
could not effect it. General Davidson, who had great 
influence among the Muhlenberg and Roan militia, 
had made use of all the arguments in his power to 
get the militia into the field, but without effect. 
They had been so much in service, and their families 
so distressed, that they were loath to leave home, 
even on the most pressing occasion. 
</p><p>
The enemy crossed at McCowen's Ford, where General Davidson was posted with the greatest part of 
the militia, who fled at the first discharge. The enemy made good their landing, and the militia retreated. A place of rendezvous was appointed for the militia to collect at, who were posted at the different 
fords up and down the river above thirty miles. Part 
of them halted about seven miles short of the place 
of rendezvous, and were overtaken by Tarleton, and 
dispersed. I waited that night at the place appointed for the militia to collect at, until morning ; but 
not a man appeared. The light infantry continued 
their march to Salisbury, and crossed the Yadkin. 
But before we got over all the baggage and stores, 
the enemy were at our heels. A pretty smart skirmish happened between a party of our riflemen and 
the advance of the enemy near the ford. We had 
secured all the boats, and the river was so high that 
the enemy could not follow us. 
</p><p>
Heavy rains, deep creeks, bad roads, poor horses, 
and broken harness, as well as delays for want of 
provisions, prevented our forming a junction as early 
as I expected; and, fearing that the river might fall 
so as to be fordable, I ordered the army to file off to this place, where part of them arrived last evening; the rest I hope will be in this night. The enemy, finding they conld not cross the Trading Ford, 
marched up to the Shallow Ford, where they passed 
the night before last, and are within twenty-five or 
thirty miles of this place. 
</p><p>
As soon as I arrived at the light infantry camp, I 
wrote letters to all the militia officers over the mountains, and in the upper country, to embody their 
men and join the army as early as possible. But 
very few have joined us, and those principally without arms or ammunition. We have no provisions but 
what we receive from our daily collections. Under 
these circumstances, I called a Council, who unanimously advised to avoid an- action, and to retire beyond the Roanoke immediately. A copy of the proceedings I have the honor to inclose, 
</p><p>
I had previously ordered all the stores and heavy 
baggage to be removed to Prince Edward CourtHouse ; and informed Governor Nash of our situation. 
I have formed a light army, composed of the cavalry 
of the first and third regiments, and the legion, 
amounting to two hundred and forty; a detachment 
of two hundred and eighty infantry, under Lieutenant-Colonel Howard ; the infantry of Lieutenant-Colonel Lee's legion, and sixty Virginia riflemen ; making in the whole seven hundred men, who will be 
ordered, with the militia, to harass the enemy in their 
advance, check their progress, and, if possible, give 
us an opportunity to retire without a general action. 
</p><p>
The force under Lord Cornwallis, consists of between twenty-five hundred and three thousand troops, 
including near three hundred dragoons, and their 
mounted infantry. They have destroyed their wagons, 
and are completely equipped as light infantry. 
I have the honor to inclose a copy of a letter 
from Lieutenant-Colonel Lee, extracts of two letters 
from <a href='/results.php?tla=frm' rel='colleague met'>General Marion</a>, and a copy of a letter from a 
well-informed gentleman, respecting the operations at 
Wilmington. General Morgan is so unveil that he 
has left the army. The enemy, since the action of 
the 17th ultimo, have pursued him upwards of two 
hundred miles. He was obliged to leave the wounded, the arms, wagons, and carriages of the artillery, 
taken in the action; but I hope they have not fallen 
into the hands of the enemy. 
</p><p>
I have ordered <a href='/results.php?tla=frm' rel='colleague met'>General Marion</a> to cross the Santee River, and General Sumpter to collect the militia in 
the upper part of South Carolina. <a href='/results.php?tla=anp' rel='colleague met'>General Pickens</a> 
has orders to take command of the men in arms in 
the rear of the enemy. I have wrote <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='colleague'>Mr. Henry</a>, 
the late Governor of Virginia, to collect, if possible, 
fourteen or fifteen hundred volunteers, to aid us, 
should the enemy attempt to pursue us beyond the 
Dan River. I had the satisfaction to receive your 
Excellency's despatches of the 27th of December, and 
the 2d and 9th of January, a few days since. I 
have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest 
esteem and respect, yours, &c.,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I wrote your Excellency at Guilford Court-House, 
giving you an account of our situation, and of the 
measures advised by the Council of War, since which 
time we have been manoeuvring constantly in the 
face of the enemy, who pressed our rear every day. 
</p><p>
Finding our numbers and condition so unequal to 
the enemy, that it would be too hazardous to risk a 
general action, and being pressed in point of time to 
get off our stores and baggage, notwithstanding I 
had ordered it to file off for Hillsborough when the 
army began their march from Pedee, and the stores 
from Hillsborough to cross the Roanoke the moment 
I could satisfy myself that it was the intention of 
Lord Cornwallis to penetrate the upper country, — to 
gain time to effect this business, as well as give the 
militia an opportunity to collect, I found it necessary 
to form as strong a covering party as possible, which 
was commanded by Colonel Williams, who had orders to keep as near The enemy as lie could, without exposing the party too much, and retard their march 
all in his power. His conduct upon the occasion 
does him the highest honor. 
</p><p>
Lord Cornwallis has been at our heels from day to 
day ever since we left Guilford; and our movements 
from thence to this place have been of the most critical kind, having a river in our front, and the enemy 
in our rear. But, happily, we have crossed without the 
loss of either men or stores. Much credit is due to 
Lieutenant-Colonel Carrington on this occasion. The 
enemy are on the other side of the river, and, as it 
is falling, I expect it will be fordable before night; 
and the fords are so numerous, and the enemy lie in 
such an advantageous situation for crossing, that it 
would be a folly to think of defending them, as it 
would reduce our force to small parties, which might 
prove our ruin. The miserable situation of the troops, 
for want of clothing, has rendered the march the 
most painful imaginable, several hundreds of the soldiers tracking the ground with their bloody feet. 
Your feelings for the suffering soldier, had you been 
here, must have been pained upon the occasion. 
</p><p>
The enemy's movements have been so rapid, and 
the country under such terror, that few or no militia 
have joined us, and the greater part we had have 
fallen off. Inclosed I send your Excellency the 
strength of the British army, which you will see 
is much stronger than I had calculated upon in my 
last. This account I believe may be depended upon, 
though I have not a shilling of money to obtain intelligence, notwithstanding my application to Maryland for money for this particular service ; and your 
Excellency knows that good intelligence is the soul 
of an army, and ought to govern all its movements. 
</p><p>
I have done every thing to call out the militia of 
the upper country, and have kept Governors Nash 
and Jefferson as regularly advised of the state of 
matters, as time and circumstances would permit. Nothing is yet done to give me effectual support; and 
I am not a little apprehensive that it is out of the 
power of Virginia and North Carolina to afford it. 
I must repeat again what I have said in several letters, that I fear nothing can save the Southern States 
but a good regular army ; and I am more confirmed 
of the importance of the cavalry upon this occasion 
than ever I have been, though strongly impressed 
with it before. 
</p><p>
Should Lord Cornwallis cease his pursuit after this 
army, I imagine he will file off for <a href='/results.php?city=halifax' rel='city'>Halifax</a>, and endeavour to establish a post there ; to prevent which 
I have sent Colonel Kosciuszko to fortify it. That 
position would greatly awe Virginia, and almost totally subject North Carolina. If we can prevent his 
taking post there, and oblige him to fill down into 
the lower country, he will reap little advantage from 
his movements. I wish it was in my power to give 
your Excellency more flattering accounts from this 
quarter; but I fear, unless reenforcements come from 
the northward, this will prove a devoted country. 
However, my utmost exertions shall be continued to 
save these States, and I shall be happy, if my conduct meets with your approbation, as my situation 
affords me no prospect of personal glory. 
</p><p>
Lieutenant-Colonel Lee made a charge upon the 
enemy's advanced party, a few days since, and cut 
off the greater part of them. A captain and several 
privates were made prisoners. The enemy move with 
great caution, though with great rapidity, frequently 
performing marches of thirty miles a day. Myself 
and my Aids are almost -worn out with fatigue, which 
prevents my giving you more frequent and particular 
accounts of our movements. Our army are in good 
spirits, notwithstanding their sufferings and excessive 
fatigue. I have had no further accounts from Wilmino'ton or the <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron Steuben</a> since I wrote. 
I am, with great respect, yours, &c.,

Sir, 
</p><p>
I did myself the honor to write your Excellency 
on the 15th instant, when I was endeavouring to 
collect a body of militia to reenforce this army. But 
the enemy; early on the 19th, filed off to Hillsborough, where Lord Cornwallis issued a proclamation 
(a copy of which is inclosed), and made use of every 
art to induce the people to join him. To prevent his 
success in the execution of this business, which we 
had every reason to believe he would accomplish, I 
was obliged to recross the Dan River before the 
militia could be assembled. This was effected on the 
23d, and with great difficulty we have reached this place. 
</p><p>
The scarcity of provision, which is rendered more 
distressing by the loose and irregular manner in 
which the militia of this country take the field, is 
not only embarrassing, but very alarming. The want 
of penal laws to oblige the inhabitants to supply 
themselves with arms and accoutrements, renders the 
aid of the militia precarious and almost useless. I 
am anxiously waiting the arrival of Colonel William Campbell, who is expected to join us with a respectable body of mounted riflemen, which will enable 
this army to approach the enemy with greater confidence and effectually to harass their way. 
</p><p>
Lord Cornwallis evacuated Hillsborough on the 
26th, and moved on the road to Guilford Court-House, 
and crossed the Haw River, at Tralinger's Ford, twenty miles below this place, last night. His route and 
his object are uncertain; but circumstances lead to a 
belief that he will move towards Cross Creek, by 
which I fear he will collect a very large number of 
the disaffected inhabitants. I have received no accounts from General Sumpter; but wish he may be 
able, in conjunction with <a href='/results.php?tla=frm' rel='colleague met'>General Marion</a>, to destroy 
some of the enemy's small posts in South Carolina, 
and prevent the accomplishment of their designs in that country. The enemy have ordered two regiments of negroes to be immediately embodied, and 
are drafting a great proportion of the young men of 
that State, to serve during the war. 
</p><p>
We have the most unequivocal and full evidence of 
the disaffection of a great part of this State. The 
enemy have raised seven independent companies in a 
single day; and we have the mortification to find, 
that most of the prisoners we take are inhabitants 
of America. The Legislature, I am informed, have 
passed a law for drafting twenty-seven hundred men 
for twelve months, but they cannot attempt to carry 
it into effect while the enemy continue in the State. 
</p><p>
Our detachments have been successful in several 
attempts upon the enemy's pickets, having killed and 
wounded about thirty, and made twenty prisoners, 
without any loss. <a href='/results.php?tla=anp' rel='colleague met'>General Pickens</a>, with a body of 
mounted riflemen, and Lieutenant-Colonel Lee, with 
the cavalry of his legion, were detached to endeavour 
to harass the enemy ; and being informed that Lieutenant-Colonel Tarleton had passed the Haw River, 
near General Butler's plantation, they immediately 
went in pursuit of him, but, unfortunately, came up 
with a body of upwards of two hundred of Colonel 
Hambleton's corps, and the North Carolina Tories, 
three miles in his rear, who were to have joined him 
that evening. The General attempted to pass by 
them as a detachment of the British army, which the 
legion succeeded in; but when the militia came up, 
the enemy discovered their mistake, which obliged 
our troops to charge them, in doing which, some of 
the militia could not be prevented from firing, which 
alarmed Colonel Tarleton, and gave him an opportunity to escape. The whole of the enemy were routed 
in a few minutes, and the greater part of them left 
dead on the ground. Colonel Piles and several officers were among the number. 
</p><p>
The want of supplies in this country, the superiority of the enemy, and the mode in which the militia 
do duty, are alarming circumstances at this critical 
period; and, unless the most vigorous exertions are 
made in the Southern States, we cannot be relieved. 
Of the troops raised by the State of Virginia last 
summer, four hundred are now at Chesterfield CourtHouse, naked, and unable to march. But the <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron Steuben</a> has detained some clothing coming from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, which will enable him to send them forward 
immediately. They were raised for eighteen months, 
but the greater part of the time will expire before 
they join the army. I wish these States could have 
been convinced of the loss they sustain by short enlistments. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letter of the 2d instant, with 
the inclosed Act of Congress, was handed me on the 
20th. I am convinced that Colonel Armand's legion 
can render no service on its present footing. The 
officers refuse to go on duty with the men ; thirty-eight, out of a detachment of forty men, deserted 
to the enemy, and the <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron Steuben</a> was obliged 
to order a number of them to join their regiments, 
who are prisoners at <a href='/results.php?city=charlottesville' rel='city'>Charlottesville</a>. 
</p><p>
The militia of the back country have returned from 
their expedition, having destroyed most of the towns 
belonging to the Cherokee Indians. I have commissioned a number of the principal inhabitants to treat 
with the Cherokee and Chickasaw nations on terms 
of accommodation, subject to the determination of 
Congress. A copy of their instructions I shall inclose as early as possible. I have the honor to be, 
with esteem and respect, &c.,

Sir, 
</p><p>
Since I had the honor of addressing your Excellency last, there have been some changes in our circumstances. On the 2d, Lieutenant-Colonel Lee, with 
a detachment of riflemen, attacked the advance of the 
British army under Colonel Tarleton, near Alamanee, 
and killed and wounded, by report, about thirty of 
them. On the 6th, the British moved down towards 
High Rock, either with a view to intercept our 
stores, or cut off the light infantry from the main 
body of the army, then advanced near seven miles ; 
but they were handsomely opposed, and suffered considerably, without effecting any thing. 
</p><p>
This manoeuvre occasioned me to retire over the 
Haw River, and move down the north side of it, 
with a view to secure our stores coming to the army, 
and to form a junction with several considerable reenforcements of Carolina and Virginia militia, and 
one regiment of Virginia eighteen-months' men, on 
the march from Hillsborough to High Rock. I effected this business, and the enemy retired towards 
Guilford Court-House. Our militia had been upon 
such a loose and uncertain footing ever since we 
crossed the Dan, that I could attempt nothing with 
confidence, though we kept within ten or twelve 
miles of the enemy for several days. The enemy 
kept close, seemingly determined that we should 
gain no advantage of them without risking something 
of consequence. I have the honor to be, with great 
respect and esteem, &c.,

Sir, 
</p><p>
My letter to Congress, a copy of which I inclose 
to your Excellency, will inform yon of an unsuccessful action with Lord Cornwallis on the 15th. Our 
prospects were flattering ; and had the North Carolina 
militia seconded the endeavours of their officers, victory was certain. But they left the most advantageous position I ever saw, without scarcely firing a 
gun. None fired more than twice, and very few 
more than once, and near one half not at all. The 
Virginia militia behaved with great gallantry, and 
the success of the day seemed to be doubtful for a 
long time. The action was long and severe. 
</p><p>
In my former letters I inclosed to your Excellency 
the probable strength of the British army, since which 
they have been constantly declining. Our force, as 
you will see by the returns, was respectable ; and 
the probability of not being able to keep it long in 
the field, and the difficulty of subsisting men in this 
exhausted country, together with the great advantages which would result from the action, if we were 
victorious, and the little injury, if we were otherwise, 
determined me to bring on an action as soon as possible. When both parties are agreed in a matter, all 
obstacles are soon removed. I thought the determination warranted by the soundest principles of good 
policy, and I hope events will prove it so, though 
we were unfortunate. I regret nothing so much as 
the loss of my artillery, though it was of little use 
to us, nor can it be, in this great wilderness. However, as the enemy have it, we must also. 
</p><p>
Lord Cornwallis will not give up this country 
without being soundly beaten. I wish our force was 
more competent to the business. But I am in hopes, 
by little and little, to reduce him in time. His 
troops are good, well found, and fight with great obstinacy. 
</p><p>
I am very happy to hear the Marquis de Lafayette 
is coming to Virginia, though I am afraid, from a 
hint in one of <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron Steuben</a>'s letters, he will think 
himself injured in being superseded in the command. 
Could the Marquis join us at this moment, we should 
have a glorious campaign. It would put Lord Cornwallis and his whole army into our hands. I am 
also happy to hear, that the Pennsylvania line are 
coming to the southward. The mutiny in that line 
was a very extraordinary one. It is reported here 
to have proceeded from the great cruelty of the officers. A member of Congress writes this j but I believe it to be so far from the truth, that I am persuaded it originated rather through indulgence than 
from any other cause. 
</p><p>
Virginia has given me every support I could wish, 
or expect, since Lord Cornwallis has been in North 
Carolina; and nothing has contributed more to this 
than the prejudice of the people in favor of your 
Excellency, which has been extended to me from the 
friendship you have been pleased to honor me with. 
The service here is extremely severe, and the officers 
and soldiers bear it with a degree of patience that 
does them the highest honor. I have never taken 
off my clothes since I left the Pedee. I was taken 
with a fainting last night, owing, I imagine, to excessive fatigue and constant watching. I am better 
to-day, but far from being well. 
</p><p>
I have little prospect of acquiring much reputation 
while I labor under so many disadvantages. I hope 
my friends will make just allowances ; and as for vulgar opinion, I regard it not. Neither time nor health 
will permit me to write your Excellency upon many 
matters which are upon my mind. I beg my best 
respects to Mrs. Washington.

With esteem and regard I am, &c.,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
Inclosed, I send your Excellency a copy of my 
letter to Congress, for your information respecting the operations in This department. The Marquis de 
Lafayette has arrived in Virginia ; but I believe his 
troops are still in Mardand. Some days since I sent 
Colonel Morris to confer with the Marquis, and see 
if he has your Excellency's permission to go farther 
southward. I received a letter from him on the 
road, acquainting me that there was an account from 
<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, of Admiral Arbuthnot's arriving in the 
Chesapeake, with six ships of the line and upwards 
of thirty transports, with a considerable reenforcement. If this report is true, our flattering prospects 
are at an end in that quarter. Nothing more can be 
expected than confining the enemy in their fortifications. It would afford me great relief, if the detachment under the Marquis could proceed farther southward. But I fear the state of the Northern army 
will not admit of this, nor am I informed of the latitude your Excellency had given him on that subject. 
The regular troops will be late in the field, if they 
are raised at all. Virginia, from the unequal operation of the law for drafting, is not likely to get 
many soldiers. Maryland, as late as the loth of this 
month, had not got a man ; nor is there a man raised 
in North Carolina, or the least prospect of it. In 
this situation, remote from reenforcements, inferior to 
the enemy in numbers, and no prospect of support, I 
am at a loss what is best to be done. If the enemy 
falls down towards Wilmington, they will be in a 
position where it would be impossible for us to injure 
them, if we had a force. In this critical and distressing situation, I am determined to carry the war immediately into South Carolina. The enemy will be obliged to follow us, or give up their posts in that State. 
If the former takes place, it will draw the war out 
of this State, and give it an opportunity to raise its proportion of men. If they leave their posts to fall, 
they must lose more there than they can gain here. 
If we continue in this State, the enemy will hold 
their possessions in both. All things considered, I 
think the movement is warranted by the soundest 
reasons, both political and military. The manoeuvre 
will be critical and dangerous, and the troops exposed to every hardship. But, as I share it with 
them, I hope they will bear up under it with that 
magnanimity which has already supported them, and 
for which they deserve every thing of their country. 
I expect to be ready to march in about five days, 
and have written to General Sumpter to collect the 
militia to aid the operations. I am persuaded the 
movement will be unexpected to the enemy, and I 
intend it shall be as little known as possible. Our 
baggage and stores, not with the army, I shall order 
by the route of Saura Towns and Shallow Ford, to 
Charlotte. By having them in the upper country, we 
shall always have a safe retreat, and from those inhabitants we may expect the greatest support. I 
shall take every measure to avoid a misfortune. But 
necessity obliges me to commit myself to chance ; 
and, I trust, my friends will do justice to my reputation if any accident attends me. 
</p><p>
I am, with the greatest respect, &c., 
</p><p>

Sir, 
</p><p>
I wrote your Excellency on the 5th, from near 
Camden, by Captain O'Hara. On the 10th, that place 
was evacuated by the enemy. They left it with 
great precipitation, after burning the greater part of 
their baggage, and stores belonging to the inhabitants. 
They also burnt the jail, mill, and several other houses, 
and left the town little better than a heap of rubbish. They left all our men, wounded on the 25th, 
amounting to thirty-one, and fifty-eight of their own, 
and three officers, who were all too badly wounded to 
be moved. It is confidently asserted, by several people 
of the place, that the enemy suffered, in the late action, not less, in killed and wounded, than three hundred men. 
</p><p>
Upon the enemy's evacuation, we immediately took 
possession of the place, and the works are levelling, 
a plan of which is herewith inclosed. Had the Virginia militia arrived in time, the garrison would have 
fallen into our hands, as they would have enabled us 
to have invested it on all sides, and the garrison had 
neither provision nor stores to hold out a siege, the 
detachments below, operating under <a href='/results.php?tla=frm' rel='colleague met'>General Marion</a> 
and Lieutenant-Colonel Lee, having cut olT their supplies, particularly the article of salt, of which the garrison was entirely destitute. 
</p><p>
On the 9th, the army marched for this place. On 
the 11th, the post of Orangeburg, commanded by a Colonel, and consisting of upwards of eighty men and 
several officers, part British, surrendered to General Sumpter, who, by his address, so intimidated the garrison, in the disposition of his artillery and troops, as 
to produce a surrender of a very strong post, -without 
loss of time or men. Great quantities of provision, 
and some other stores, were found at this. 
</p><p>
On the 12th, Fort Mott surrendered to <a href='/results.php?tla=frm' rel='colleague met'>General Marion</a>. The garrison consisted of upwards of one 
hundred and forty men, one hundred and twenty of 
whom were British and Hessian, and seven or eight, 
officers. The place was invested on the 8th, and the 
approaches carried to the foot of the ahatis before it 
surrendered. The redoubt was exceedingly strong, and 
commanded by Lieutenant Macpherson, a very gallant 
officer. Great credit is due to <a href='/results.php?tla=frm' rel='colleague met'>General Marion</a>, and 
the few militia that continued with him in the reduction of this post. Lieutenant-Colonel Lee's legion, and 
the detachments serving with him under Major Eaton, 
Captains Finley, of the artillery, and Oldham and 
Smith, of the infantry, were indefatigable in prosecuting the siege. There were taken at the fort, one 
carronade, about one hundred and forty stand of arms, 
a quantity of salt, provisions, and other stores, returns 
of which shall be forwarded hereafter. 
</p><p>
When vQ began our march towards Camden, from 
Deep River, I wrote to <a href='/results.php?tla=anp' rel='colleague met'>General Pickens</a> to endeavour 
to collect a body of the militia to lay siege to <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a> and Ninety Six ; and both places are now invested. As soon as the Virginia militia join us, I am 
in hopes to be able to make such detachments from 
this army as will effect their reduction. The fort at 
Friday's Ferry will be invested by to-morrow morning. Lieutenant-Colonel Lee, with his legion, and 
some of the detachment serving under him, marched 
for this purpose last evening. The army marches for that place this morning. 
</p><p>
The last intelligence I had from Lord Rawdon, he 
was near Nelson's Ferry, where the enemy have a 
post, the stores at which were moving for <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, 
which indicates an evacuation. Generals Sumpter and Marion are watching their motions. If proper exertions were made to support the southern war, the 
enemy would soon he convinced that, if they divide 
their force, they will fall by detachments, and, if they operate collectively, they cannot command the country. Captain Pierce, one of my Aids, who is out 
watching the motions of Lord Cornwallis, informs me 
that he is on his march towards <a href='/results.php?city=halifax' rel='city'>Halifax</a>, from Duplin 
Court-House. Should he push his operations in that 
quarter, I shall leave the army here, under the command of General Huger, to effect the reduction of the 
remaining posts, and join the troops collecting to the 
northward. Inclosed I send your Excellency copies 
of several letters found among the papers of Lieutenant Macpherson.

Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letters of the 19th and 21st of 
April, I have had the honor to receive. Nothing 
would afford me greater pleasure than to have it in 
my power to oblige Major Macpherson, especially as 
it will afford me an opportunity of obliging your Excellency at the same time. 
</p><p>
Inclosed is a copy of my last letter to Congress. 
Copies of my former letters I desired the President 
of Congress to forward to you, which I hope you 
have received. We are anxiously waiting the arrival 
of the second division of the French fleet. Virginia 
affords the most inviting object. Lord Cornwallis's army, and the garrison and shipping at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>. 
The whole may be taken in three weeks, or less; 
while <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> will produce a long, 
tedious, and uncertain siege. I hope the Marquis 
will be successful in Virginia. What I mean by success is, to avoid a capital misfortune. Your Excellency will see, by my letters to Congress, I have left 
the command of all the force coming southward with 
the Marquis. My fears are principally from the enemy's superior cavalry. To the northward, cavalry is 
nothing, from the numerous fences; but to the southward a disorder, by a superior cavalry, may be improved into a defeat, and a defeat into a rout. Virginia and North Carolina could not be brought to 
consider the cavalry of such great importance as they 
are to the security of an army and the safety of a 
country. 
</p><p>
Before this, I hope the New England States have 
filled up their regiments. Nothing but drafting can 
lay a permanent foundation for the liberties of America; and with it we have little to fear, even from a 
failure of our finance. I am, with great respect. 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,

Sir, 
</p><p>
Since I wrote your Excellency at Little River, near 
Ninety Six, I have been favored with your despatch 
of June the 1st. It affords me great pleasure to 
hear that an attack is meditating against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
This measure no doubt will create a powerful diversion in favor of this country ; and I wish most ardently that the Northern States may enable you to complete its reduction. But I confess this is so important an object, that I can hardly flatter myself with 
so fortunate an event. 
</p><p>
The copy of my former letters to Congress will inform your Excellency of the measures I took for the 
defence of Virginia; and inclosed is a copy of my letter to Congress, giving an account of our movements in this quarter, since we raised the siege of 
Ninety Six. I hope the steps I took both with respect to Virginia and here, will meet your approbation. The Marquis has conducted the operations in 
Virginia, as far as I can learn, with great good conduct, and I hope Congress will give him a testimony 
of their good opinion of it. When I found Virginia 
was going to be attacked in so formidable a manner, 
I halted all the troops coming to the southward, and 
determined to struggle with the little force I had in 
the best manner I could, until I could learn better 
the enemy's intentions in that quarter. I thought, 
upon the whole, it was much better to keep up the 
war here, than to give up three States in an attempt 
to afford Virginia such an ineffectual reenforcement, 
as I could have carried to her aid, which must have 
been greatly reduced by a march of at least four 
hundred miles. Besides, if I had left this country, 
the enemy would have been able to detach to Virginia a far greater force than I could have carried 
there ; and the efforts of the militia in this quarter, 
for want of countenance, would have totally ceased. 
All these considerations determined me in the line 
of conduct I pursued ; and I hope time will show the 
measure to be warranted from every principle of good 
policy. 
</p><p>
The late European intelligence, I am apprehensive, 
will determine the enemy upon a new plan of conducting the war. For, instead of attempting to overrun the whole country, I expect they will make an 
effort to complete the reduction of two States, and 
secure the possession of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. Intelligence, 
therefore, from the northward will be important. 
Should your Excellency get any information by which 
their intentions may be explained, I beg you will 
forward it with all possible despatch. I am with great 
respect and regard, 
</p><p>

Sir, 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jhr' rel='met'>Governor Rutledge</a> arrived in camp a few days 
since, and informed me that a French fleet of twenty 
sail of the line, besides frigates, were to be on the 
coast by the 25th of this month, to cooperate with 
the American army for dispossessing the enemy of 
the several posts they hold in the United States; 
and that there are to come with the fleet from five 
to ten thousand troops, to facilitate operations. So 
great a naval and land force, aided by our own exertions, cannot fail, if properly directed, of totally 
ruining the enemy in this country. As late and full 
information will be necessary to enable your Excellency to judge what objects to give the preference 
to, as well as what force may be necessary for each, 
I have taken the earliest opportunity to communicate the fullest intelligence I possess from tins quarter. 
And, as you may wish to make more inquiries, I 
have sent the despatches by one of my Aids, Lieutenant-Colonel Morris, that you may not only be satisfied in all matters respecting our situation, but that 
you may have a better opportunity of conveying such 
instructions in return as may be unsafe to write. 
</p><p>
Major Burnett, one of my Aids, who is much indisposed, set out from this camp eight or ten days 
since for the northward. By him I wrote fully our 
situation, and I desired him to give your Excellency 
such information as I had omitted to mention in my 
letter. But, as this is a new matter, I thought it 
most advisable to send Colonel Morris, notwithstanding, I have received no letters from the Marquis for 
near a month, and none from your Excellency since 
the 1st of June, in which you informed me of the 
preparations making for an attempt upon <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
By this time I suppose the operations are in great 
forwardness ; and, if the force from the islands arrive 
agreeably to the Ministers' expectations, the reduction 
of the place must be speedy and certain. <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, 
as a place of arms, and from the importance of its 
situation to harass and distress our people, may be 
considered as the greatest object on the Continent; 
and, in my opinion, every effort should be made for 
its reduction in preference to all others. If that 
place w\as reduced, and the enemy could not repossess it, I think it would lay the foundation for their 
evacuating all the possessions in the United States 
south of it. There would be no harbour for their 
shipping, except in Virginia, and no convenient place 
there for an army to winter in, which would necessarily oblige them to quit their possessions in that 
quarter. 
</p><p>
The forces that the enemy have in Virginia under 
Lord Cornwallis, and at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, from the best 
information I can get, amount to little more than five 
thousand men. The Marquis's regular force is not 
more than two to three ; but there is a large body 
of militia in the field, and it may be increased to almost any number, if arms could be had. Twenty-five 
hundred regular forces, to be added to the Marquis's 
arm}, besides what may be expected from Pennsylvania and Virginia, would oblige Cornwallis to take 
a position and fortify himself; and if the supplies to 
his army could be cut off by water, which the fleet 
may easily effect, after the reduction of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, 
lie would be obliged to surrender in a fortnight or 
three weeks at most, for want of provisions; for I 
believe he has none laid in at any point, nor in 
expectation of being obliged to act on the defensive. 
At least, I am persuaded he has no apprehension of 
having his water communication interrupted. After 
the reduction of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, I should suppose the 
whole French fleet might enter the Chesapeake, and, 
all hopes of escaping by water being removed, it 
would greatly contribute to the speedy surrender of 
the enemy, from the terror and apprehensions it would 
raise among the troops. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> is the greatest object to the southward, 
as well from the strength of its garrison and dependencies, as from the advantages the enemy derive from 
the trade of the place, and the distress it brings 
upon the people for want of commerce, particularly 
in the article of salt. The place is strong, and difficult to approach. Large shipping can be of no use 
in the reduction of it. Frigates are the largest size 
that can enter the harbour. The enemy have fortified 
none of the islands, nor have they added many works about the town. However, they have erected two large new works in front of the old lines, that mount 
from twenty to thirty pieces of cannon each. These 
works have great command of the town, as well as 
the rivers. One other new work is nearly completed 
on the marsh, called Shute's Folly, on the harbour 
side of the town, and intended to defend the place 
against shipping. The enemy have, from the best information I can get, in this State about four thousand infantry and four hundred horse, of regular 
troops. Besides these, they have near one thousand 
militia and Tories, who adhere to their interest. In 
addition to this, one thousand sailors, and four or five 
hundred negroes, may be calculated upon. Their collective strength will amount, in all probability, to between six and seven thousand men of different characters ; and the militia Tories, from their being such 
exceeding good marksmen, will not be the least useful. 
</p><p>
Our force in Continental troops will amount to little more than fifteen hundred men; from four to five 
hundred State troops, belonging to South Carolina; 
and, I imagine, from fifteen hundred to two thousand 
militia may be raised in North and South Carolina, 
to join in the reduction of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>. A greater 
force than this cannot be calculated upon, nor am I 
altogether certain so large a body of militia can be 
kept up during the siege ; but it is possible a much 
greater can be got out upon so important an occasion, 
and when things wear so flattering a face. To reduce 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> with certainty and despatch, not less than 
ten thousand troops should be added to the force that 
may be expected here; but if this force cannot be 
had, I should think it should be attempted with less. 
The garrison will doubtless have provisions in plenty ; 
and I believe, if we can command the water, our army 
may be easily supplied, provided the operations are 
brought to an issue before the 1st of January, or by 
that time. I have inclosed some notes respecting the 
places the most proper for landing ; but <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a> and General Duportail can give you more particular information respecting this matter. If the 
operations cannot be carried on in Virginia and here 
at the same time, I think <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> must have the 
preference, as the greatest object. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> being taken, the enemy 
will most assuredly leave Virginia, should time fail 
us to effect the reduction of the whole, which I hope 
will not be the case. All the stores of every kind 
necessary for the siege must come with the fleet, as 
we have nothing here to prosecute one with. The 
reduction of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> will naturally produce the 
surrender of <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> and Wilmington, especially as 
there is but little force at either ; not more than four 
hundred at one, and three hundred at the other. I 
think <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> may be reduced in thirty days, after 
the troops effect a landing; and there can be no difficulty in this, as the enemy have no force at any of 
those places, nor will they venture to detach from 
town for the purpose. And it is not impossible, if the 
enemy should attempt to hold the upper country, a 
landing may be effected so speedily as to prevent 
their getting into town. This would greatly facilitate 
the reduction of the place, as well from the effect it 
would have upon the spirits of the garrison, as from 
the diminution of their force. 
</p><p>
I suppose the British fleet on this coast, on the 
arrival of the French fleet, will immediately take 
shelter in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and assist in the defence of the 
place, or run off to the West Indies. The first would be the most desirable, and is what I hope our good 
ally will oblige them to do. This would secure a 
superiority by sea during the whole campaign, which 
may be doubtful, should Admiral Rodney follow the 
French fleet from the West Indies, and effect a junction with the force on this coast. But, if the French 
effect a junction of theirs first, and block up the British in New York, so as to prevent a junction of 
their shipping, the enemy will not have it in their 
power either to raise the siege of the place or take 
off the garrison. But should the British fleet on this 
coast even run for the West Indies, there is the 
greatest probability of the two fleets missing each 
other on their passage, and still leave our allies masters of the sea, at least until <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> can be reduced. But what I most wish is, that the force our 
ally means to employ upon this coast may be superior to the enemy's collective strength, both from the 
West Indies and on this coast. This will insure us 
success at all events. 
</p><p>
As your Excellency is doubtless more fully informed respecting the force of both fleets, and of the 
intentions of our ally, than I am, and also of the 
probable aid which we may expect either from Europe 
or elsewhere, and as that will altogether govern our 
operations, I shall wait your directions respecting our 
preparations in this quarter. The enemy have no 
fortified posts in this State except <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, or in 
Georgia except <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>. But their army is upon 
the Congaree, near McCord's Ferry. The distresses 
of the country are so great, and their calamities increase so fast for want of salt and many other articles, as well as from the ravages of the enemy, that 
I wish it may be in our powder, by the generous exertions of our good ally, to effect something for their 
relief, more than the little temporary respites arising 
from partial advantages, which are all we can hope 
or expect from our little force in this country. If 
Lord Cornwallis should find that his situation in Virginia may expose him to the loss of his army, it is 
highly probable he will attempt to get back to 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> by land or water. The first I shall endeavour to guard against, and the last I hope our 
ally will be able to prevent, by sending a few frigates into the Bay, or stationing them off the Capes. 
The cavalry of Lieutenant-Colonel Washington's 
corps have taken, killed, and wounded, near forty of 
the enemy's cavalry since my last. The most considerable attack was made by Captain Watts. He charged 
a party of twenty odd of the enemy, with an inferior 
force, took six, killed three, and wounded eight or 
nine more. The enterprise of our cavalry equals any 
thing the world ever produced. With the most perfect respect and esteem, I am,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Since I wrote your Excellency, by Colonel Morris, 
nothing very material has taken place, except the 
hanging of Colonel Hayne, one of our militia Colonels, whom the enemy hung in <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, a little 
time since, as a traitor, as they call him. He was a 
man of a most amiable character, highly respected, 
and of a most extensive influence. This insult, offered 
to the good people of this country, and to the business of exchange, it being a most flagrant violation 
of the cartel, I am determined to retaliate ; and, as 
the enemy are indifferent about their militia officers, 
I mean to retaliate on the British officers, as the 
surest way of putting a stop to a practice that can 
only serve to gratify private revenge. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=frm' rel='colleague met'>General Marion</a> and Colonel Lee have taken a few 
prisoners since I wrote before, in the whole between 
twenty and thirty, three or four of whom are officers. 
The rivers have been so high, owing to the great 
rains, as has prevented parties passing them with 
sufficient ease to attempt surprises. We are endeavouring to draw a body of militia together at Friday's Ferry, and are on our march to that place to 
combine our forces, and make an attack on the enemy at McCord's Ferry, if our force will authorize the 
attempt when we are collected. 
</p><p>
I am much at a loss, what are Lord Cornwallis's 
intentions in Virginia. I have directed the Marquis 
to govern his motions by the enemy's, and to detach 
here, if they detach largely from there, and not without. I am totally ignorant of what is going on at 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, having heard nothing from your Excellency since June, which induces me to believe your 
despatches are intercepted. I pray God the expedition against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> may succeed, and prove the 
corner-stone of American independence, as it undoubtedly would. I wait with impatience for intelligence, 
by which I mean to govern my own operations. If 
things are flattering in the north, I will hazard less 
in the south ; but, if otherwise there, we must risk 
more here. With every wish for your Excellency's safety, glory, and success, I am, with great esteem 
and regard.

Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letter, of the oOth July, I have 
had the honor to receive, before the receipt of which 
I had sent off two of my Aids to give your Excellency a very particular account of the Southern department. 
</p><p>
By Colonel Morris, I wrote my opinion respecting 
the proper objects to operate against, should we be so 
happy as to be joined by our good ally. I presume 
he is with your Excellency before this, as the Marquis informs me you were to be at the Head of Elk 
the 8th of this instant, on your way to take command 
in Virginia, and that our good ally was in the Chesapeake with a large fleet and a considerable land force. 
I wish most devotedly that glory and success may 
attend you. I was in hopes that our force would 
have been equal to a serious attempt upon <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> ; 
but, from your present plan of operations, I persuade 
myself that it is not the case. But, perhaps, cutting 
off the possibility of succour to New Y'ork first, may 
be the most sure way of laying a foundation for its 
reduction. If Cornwallis falls, which I think nothing 
can prevent but his escaping through North Carolina 
to <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> itself may be easily reduced, 
if you will bend your forces this way. And it will 
afford me great pleasure to join your Excellency in 
the attempt ; for I shall be equally happy, whether as 
principal or subordinate, so that the public good is 
promoted. 
</p><p>
Since I wrote to you before, we have had a most 
bloody battle. It was by far the most obstinate fight I ever saw. Victory was ours ; and had it not been 
for one of those little incidents which frequently happen in the progress of war, we should have taken the 
whole British army. Nothing could exceed the gallantry of our officers, or the bravery of the troops. 
I do myself the honor to inclose you a copy of my 
letter to Congress, and beg leave to refer you to 
Captain Pierce, one of my Aids, who is the bearer, 
and who will give your Excellency a full history of 
all matters in this department, both as to force and 
supplies. I am trying to collect a body of militia to 
oppose Lord Cornwallis, should he attempt to escape 
through North Carolina. And you may rest assured 
nothing shall be left unattempted, in my power, to 
impede his march, so as to give your army time to 
get up with him ; but my force is very small, and I 
am exceedingly embarrassed with numerous wounded. 
I have the honor to be, with great respect. 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
My last letter was dated at Charlotte, and forwarded by Lieutenant-Colonel Lee ; since which I have 
received your Excellency's favor of the 28th of September. I am happy to find the army under your 
command ready to commence operations against Lord 
Cornwallis ; but I am sorry to hear you think the 
issue somewhat doubtful. And it gives me great pain 
to find, that, whatever may be our success in Virginia, the circumstances of our ally will not permit them to cooperate with us in an attempt upon 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>. The great importance of their present 
services demands our warmest gratitude ; but it is 
much to be regretted, that we cannot improve the 
advantage which our signal success would give us, as 
the hopes of our people, and the fears of the enemy, 
would greatly facilitate the reduction of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>. 
However, if you succeed in Virginia, it will enable 
you to support us more effectually here, if these 
States derive no other advantage from the present 
exertions of our allies. I will not suffer myself to 
doubt of your success, though I cannot help, at times, 
being greatly agitated between hope and fear, which 
alternately prevail, from the many incidents that occur in military operations, which may defeat the most 
flattering prospects ; and I find, by letters from Congress, as well as from your Excellency, that Sir Henry 
Clinton is making the most rapid preparations for 
some important blow. 
</p><p>
I mentioned, in one of my former letters, that I 
had been concerting with Governor Burke a plan for 
the reduction of Wilmington. General Rutherford is 
moving down towards that place with a considerable 
body of militia ; and I hear the enemy have left the 
place, and now occupy Brunswick, about thirty miles 
below; and, by preparations making in <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> of 
small transports, I think it highly probable the enemy intend to take off the garrison. But this is only 
conjecture. 
</p><p>
Since the battle of Eutaw, our troops have been 
exceedingly sickly, and our distress and difficulties 
have been not a little increased for want of medicines and hospital stores. The malignity of the fevers begins to cease as the weather grows cool. The 
enemy are all in the lower country ; and nothing 
material has happened since my last, except a number of prisoners who have been taken by our light 
parties sent out by <a href='/results.php?tla=frm' rel='colleague met'>General Marion</a>. 
</p><p>
Inclosed, I send your Excellency a return of our 
strength, by which you will see our weak state. We 
can attempt nothing further, except in the partisan 
way. Some riflemen have arrived in camp from the 
mountains ; more are expected, which will enable us 
to keep up pretty strong parties for a time. But I look forward with pain to December, when the whole 
Virginia line will leave us. I hope measures will be 
taken before that period to reenforce us. To arrive 
here seasonably, they must move soon. Colonel Lee 
and Captain Pierce, I hope, have given you a full 
state of matters in this quarter, to enable you to 
take your measures without loss of time. 
</p><p>
I transmitted, by Captain Pierce, copies of all the 
letters and papers that had passed respecting Colonel Hayne's execution, mentioned in some of my former 
letters ; and, as I had not paper to copy them for 
your Excellency, I desired Captain Pierce to break 
the covers on his arrival at your camp, to give you 
an opportunity to see them, and inform yourself respecting the matter, as the business, in its consequences, might involve the whole Continent, and particularly the military part ; and, therefore, would ultimately rest with you. Should he have omitted this 
matter, of which I gave him a particular charge, I 
will forward you copies by the first opportunity. I 
wrote to Lord Cornwallis on the subject, but have 
not got his answer. 
</p><p>
You have my warmest wishes for your success, and 
my hearty prayers for your safety. With sentiments 
of the greatest respect and esteem, I am 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,

Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letters of the 16th, 24th, and 
30th of October, containing an account of the operations of the combined army, afford me the highest satisfaction; and I beg leave to congratulate your Excellency again upon this important and happy event. 
I contemplate its advantages with infinite satisfaction, 
and feel a relief upon the occasion that is difficult to 
express. <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague'>Count Rochambeau</a>'s stay in Virginia, and 
the march of <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague'>General St. Clair</a>, if he arrives speedily, 
I am in hopes will place us upon an eligible footing. 
The reduction of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> is an event much to be 
wished ; but to be able to cover the country and 
confine the enemy to that place, will be a great object. However, I am not without my apprehensions 
that Sir Henry Clinton will endeavour to push some 
vigorous operations in this quarter this "winter, to 
efface, if possible, their late losses, hoth here and in 
Virginia. General Leslie is arrived to take command 
here, and it is said reenforcements are expected. I 
have sent one of my Aids to hasten the march of 
<a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague'>General St. Clair</a> ; and, as Wilmington is evacuated, 
there is nothing to prevent an immediate junction. 
After which, if the enemy's reenforcements are not 
very large, they shall purchase their advantages at 
an expensive rate. 
</p><p>
I would have made a return immediately of the 
prisoners of war in this department, but Major Hyrne, 
the Commissary of Prisoners, has lately met with an 
unhappy fall, which has disqualified him for business 
by disordering his understanding, from which I am 
not a little apprehensive he will never recover. As 
soon as it can be done by another hand, it shall be 
forwarded. But, before a general exchange is gone 
fully into, I wish something decisive may be done 
respecting Colonel Hayne. As retaliation necessarily 
involves the whole Continent, I wish your Excellency's order, and the order of Congress, thereon. The 
latter have signified their approbation of the measures 
I took. But, as retaliation did not take place immediately, nor did I think myself at liberty on a matter of such magnitude, but from the most pressing 
necessity, and as the enemy did not repeat the 
offence, I have been at a loss how to act with respect to the original, not having any officer of equal 
rank with Colonel Hayne in my possession. I am 
ready to execute whatever may be thought advisable. 
It would be happy for America if something could 
be done to put a stop to the practice of burning, 
both in the Northern States and here also ; and to prevent it liere, I wrote the enemy a letter on the 
subject, a copy of which I here inclose ; and, if they 
do not desist, I will put the war on the footing I mention. 
</p><p>
We are on our march for Four Holes. Colonel 
Mblark brought off upwards of eighty convalescent 
prisoners from one of the enemy's hospitals near Fair 
Lawn. These, and some small skirmishes of little 
consequence, and a few other prisoners, are all the 
changes which have taken place since my letters by 
Captain Pierce. I am happy that Wilmington is 
evacuated, as it leaves North Carolina perfectly at 
liberty to support this army and fill up their line. 
I am, with great respect and attachment,

Sir, 
</p><p>
Since I wrote your Excellency on the 9th of December, I have been favored with your despatches 
of the 16th of November, 15th and 19th of December. My letter to Congress, a copy of which I inclose, will inform your Excellency "of the arrival of 
<a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague'>General St. Clair</a>, with the Pennsylvania and Mar}land troops. The Virginia officers protested against 
marching until they got their pay, and are still in 
Virginia. Your Excellency's apprehensions were very 
right respecting the diminution of <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague'>General St. Clair</a>'s 
command. The Virginia line left us at The same time 
the other came up, which leaves us little stronger 
than we were before. Some reenforcements have arrived lately from York ; it is said, near four hundred 
men. 
</p><p>
Through a good channel of intelligence I got information of troops expected, both from Cork and 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. I was so alarmed at it, that I sent off 
Captain Ragsdale to Virginia, and Lieutenant-Colonel 
Stewart to North Carolina, to try to hasten on support, and wrote to <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague'>Count Rochambeau</a> for a thousand 
men of his command. But, if more convenient, and 
consistent with the plan you and he had concerted, 
it would be still more agreeable for him to move 
with his whole force this way. Since I sent off those 
despatches, the Cork fleet arrived, without troops, except about sixty artillerymen. I am still under great 
apprehension of troops coming from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, notwithstanding the flattering accounts your Excellency 
gave me. We are in a poor situation to contend with 
a very superior force. Our men are almost naked for 
want of overalls and shirts, and the greater part of 
the army barefoot. We have no rum, or prospect of 
any; none within four hundred miles of us, and little 
or none providing in Virginia ; and if there were 
ever so much there, the difficulty of transportation 
would prevent our getting it, as we were four weeks 
without ammunition since we have been in the lower 
country, and a plenty of this article waiting at Charlotte for the means of transportation. Had the enemy got knowledge, and availed themselves of our 
situation, they might have ruined us. 
</p><p>
I shall, agreeably to your Excellency's direction, 
transmit to the respective States an exact return of 
their troops; and I wish your representation may 
have the desired effect. But the States here have 
been so tardy as to regard representations little more 
than an idle dream or Eastern tale. Nor have I the 
least hopes of our difficulties lessening upon this 
head, until the powers of Congress are more extensive, and the subordination of the States better acknowledged. When any State can be made to feel 
an inconvenience from disobeying a requisition of 
Congress, then, and not till then, can we hope our 
measures will have vigor, and a combination of our 
force take place. We may write till we are blind, 
and the local policy of the States in perfect security, will counteract our wishes. From this very same 
source, I apprehend it impossible to establish matters 
of finance upon such a footing as to answer the public demands. If such of the States as refused or 
neglected to comply with the Congressional requisitions, were deprived of the liberty of trade, either 
foreign or domestic, out of their own State, it might 
serve to fix a little obligation to effect a compliance. 
</p><p>
I perfectly agree "with your Excellency, that we 
should improve every moment this winter, to be in 
readiness to open the campaign to advantage. To be 
well prepared for war, is certainly the most likely 
way of procuring peace. I have recommended to 
this State to raise some black regiments. To fill up 
their regiments with whites is impracticable, and to 
get reenforcements from the northward, precarious, 
and at least difficult, from the prejudices respecting 
the climate. Some are for it, but the far greater 
part of the people are opposed to it. The Assembly 
are now sitting at Jacksonborough, four miles from 
our camp, on the other side of the Edisto. I am, 
with great respect,

Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letter of the 29th of December, 
came to hand yesterday. The reenforcement you 
mention has not arrived, and I hope they are gone 
to another quarter. I got intelligence of the preparation making in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and of the opinion of their 
being destined to <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>. But whether they went 
to some other quarter, or the small reenforcement 
mentioned in my last was what gave rise to the report, I am unable to say. 
</p><p>
In your Excellency's instructions to correspond with 
<a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague'>Count Rochambeau</a>, you did not tell me whether 
I was to request aid of him in cases of emergency. 
However, my apprehensions were so great, and the 
consequences appeared to me so fatal to this country, 
I made application, without hesitation ; and I should 
be glad to know your mind on the subject, by which 
I shall govern my conduct in future. I see little prospect of getting any reenforcements from Virginia, as 
will appear by the Governor's letter. The State conceive themselves ill-treated, and, however groundless 
it may be, it will operate greatly to our prejudice 
for a time. Colonel Carrington is gone to Congress, 
to represent several matters, which claim immediate 
attention. I wish no disagreeable disputes may happen from the present uneasiness and discontent prevailing in Virginia, from a persuasion that the Northern States are treated with more delicacy than she 
is. I fear the Financier-General will have a hard 
task to steer clear of suspicions of partiality. Colonel Carrington will represent to your Excellency our 
apprehensions of fixing the laboratory at <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, 
and our wishes for having it at New London. 
</p><p>
Inclosed are the returns of the Pennsylvania line, 
agreeably to your Excellency's direction. Those of 
Maryland and Delaware are transmitted to the Governors of those States. That of Virginia shall be also 
sent, as soon as it can be had. The absence of Colonel White's regiment of dragoons in Georgia is the 
reason of its delay; however, the infantry of that 
State with this army amount to not more than sixty 
men. In a very few days I will have the honor of 
transmitting to you exact returns of the operating 
force serving under my command in the Southern department. I am, with the greatest regard,

Sir, 
</p><p>
I wrote your Excellency the 8th of February, since 
which I am without your favors. In my last, I informed you that I had written to <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague'>Count Rochambeau</a> 
for reenforcements. Inclosed is his answer. I am 
persuaded he must have mistaken your intentions. I 
find nothing is to be expected from that quarter. I 
am sorry the legion was put in motion, as it may 
raise the enemy's apprehensions, and bring upon us 
reenforcements, which might not have been otherwise 
sent, at least so soon. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will see by the King's speech, and 
other measures taking in Great Britain, the enemy 
are determined to prosecute the war and from the 
Dean of Gloucester's plan of pacification, and other 
Parliamentary debates, there can hardly be a doubt 
of the operations being principally to the southward. 
You will also see, by the returns inclosed, how incompetent our force is to any great operation. The 
country is naturally weak, and greatly reduced by the 
ravages of intestine disputes between the Whigs and 
Tories. We are remote from support and supplies of 
every kind; no large bodies of militia can be hastily 
called together here, nor can supplies of any kind be 
had but with the greatest difficulty. We have three 
hundred men now without arms, and twice that number so naked as to be unfit for any duty, but in 
cases of desperation. Not a rag of clothing has arrived to us this winter. Indeed, our prospects are 
really deplorable. It is true we get meat and rice, 
but no rum or spirits. Men and officers without pay, 
in this situation, cannot be kept in temper long. I 
will not trouble you with a detail of all our difficulties. They would be too troublesome to enumerate; 
but I cannot but apprehend for a country so badly 
supported, and naturally so weak and helpless. I 
persuaded the Legislature to raise black regiments, 
but could not prevail; not because they objected to 
the expense (for they give a most enormous bounty 
for white men, and pay in slaves), but from an apprehension of the consequences. 
</p><p>
It has always been my opinion that, if we could 
support the extremes of the Confederation, the middle 
States would always support themselves. Upon this 
principle, I have ever been anxious to get a force to 
the southward, so formidable as to discourage the enemy from attempting their reduction. There is no 
way to effect this, but to render their subjection so 
difficult and expensive as to make the value less 
than the trouble and expense. All the Southern 
States look to you for support. I will do all I can, 
and you know me too well to suppose I shall shrink 
at small difficulties. But how feeble are the best 
intentions, and how vain an obstinate perseverance 
against a very unequal force ! 
</p><p>
The enemy have been out lately, in considerable 
force, in St. Thomas's. They routed <a href='/results.php?tla=frm' rel='colleague met'>General Marion</a>'s 
command, and killed, took, and wounded, upwards of 
twenty men. They have not ventured out on our 
side, although the Assembly have been sitting within 
thirty miles of town, and the enemy a much greater 
force than we have, which induces me to believe they 
have orders not to risk a general action. <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague met'>General Wayne</a> has burnt all the enemy's forage, close under 
their noses at <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>. I am improving every moment in disciplining and managing the troops, that 
they may be in the best condition for whatever may 
happen. But, alas ! we no sooner get our men tolerably well acquainted with their duty, than their 
term of service expires, and they leave us, and often 
without others to supply their places. I am, with 
great respect.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Fortune seems to smile upon the perseverance of 
Great Britain. Count do Grasse's defeat, mentioned 
in my official letter, appears to be much more important than I expected. Since I wrote, I have seen 
Admiral Rodney's letter. Count de Grasse is a prisoner, and has lost six ships of the line; and I fear 
the rest of the fleet are so shattered as to be incapable of attempting any thing for a long time. This 
misfortune will put it out of the power of our ally 
to cooperate with us in these States or to the northward. I expect the enemy, from finding it impracticable for the French to cooperate with us, and from 
having again the command of the sea, will detach 
from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to this quarter to prosecute farther 
operations. However, this will depend upon the force 
they have at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. All that "will he necessary 
there, will he a good garrison. They cannot have 
offensive operations in view there. Their force is 
unequal to it; but, by detaching a part to this quarter, they can improve it to advantage, and leave New 
York in perfect security. 
</p><p>
I have always been of opinion that farther attempts would be made for the subjugation of this 
country, should fortune favor them in the West Indies. I can see no other reason for having held 
footing in it so long. Should <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague'>Count Rochambeau</a> be 
ordered to this quarter for offensive operations, I 
hope your Excellency will also come yourself; for it 
will not be for the honor of America that a foreigner 
command an American department. If this cannot 
take place, I could wish the American force could 
act independent of his command, and only act by 
conjunction. I believe my rank will give several 
French officers a right to command me ; but, if the 
honor of the nation was not connected with it, I 
should have no objection. However, I shall be perfectly satisfied with whatever you may think necessary for the good of the service. My desire to be 
useful is so much greater than my wish for command, that there are no conditions to which I will 
not cheerfully submit, that are not personally disgraceful, to promote the interest of this country. 
</p><p>
I fear Virginia will do little, while the French 
army is in that State, either for herself or the Union. 
As far as I can learn, little or nothing has been done 
for seven months past; nor can I learn that any decisive measures are pursuing for the purpose. Whatever may be your Excellency's intentions with regard to the French army, it would not be amiss to 
inform the Governor that they may expect that army to leave them shortly, and that great exertions are 
necessary for their own security. It may serve as a spur, and the genius of America often requires spurring. 
</p><p>
I wish to know your Excellency's intentions in this 
quarter, as early as possible. Many measures will be 
requisite to accommodate matters to your views, if 
you have any thing offensive in view. Could the 
French army have arrived in this country by the 
middle of this month, I am confident we could have 
obliged the enemy to have evacuated it. Reports say 
here your Excellency had a narrow escape through 
the Clove. Mrs. Greene joins me in respectful compliments to yourself and Mrs. Washington. 
</p><p>
With esteem and affection, I am, &c.,

Sir, 
</p><p>
Since I wrote to your Excellency, a day or two ago, Lieutenant-<a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Colonel Laurens</a> has been killed in an 
action on the Combahee River, about fifty miles south 
of our camp. The enemy made a detachment into that 
quarter, with a number of armed vessels, empty sloops 
and schooners, with about five hundred infantry, to 
collect rice. General Gist, with the light troops, in 
Avhich Lieutenant-<a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Colonel Laurens</a> held a command, 
was detached to oppose them. Inclosed is a copy of 
General Gist's letter containing an account of the 
different operations. <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Colonel Laurens</a>'s fall is glorious ; but liis fate is much to be lamented. Your Excellency has lost a valuable Aid-de-camp, the army a 
brave officer, and the public a worthy and patriotic citizen. 
</p><p>
The enemy made a descent upon Santee, some 
little time since, to collect rice, in which they were 
but too successful. The situation in which it lay, 
prevented <a href='/results.php?tla=frm' rel='colleague met'>General Marion</a> from giving them any considerable interruption. The rivers of this country are 
very flivorable for this kind of enterprises ; but I am 
in hopes the enemy will get but little by their present expedition. 
</p><p>
It is said that Admiral Pigot is on this coast with 
near thirty sail of the line, to take off the garrison 
of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. A part of the fleet is to take post 
at Beaufort, to take off the garrison of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>. It 
is said the enemy, within a few days past, have been 
meditating an attack upon us. I have the honor to 
be, with great respect.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I am much obliged by your Excellency's long and 
communicative letters of the 9th of July and 6th of 
August. Since my letter of the 26th of August, the 
evacuation of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> is reduced to a certainty. 
The following disposition, it is said, is to be made 
of the troops in garrison. 
</p><p>
Lord Rawdon's corps, which is put upon the British 
establishment as the one hundred and fifth regiment, 
is going directly to Ireland. Governor Martin's corps 
is drafted into the North Carolina volunteers, which, 
with the South Carolina royalists, and the King's 
Carolina rangers, and the refugees, are going to St. 
Augustine, to relieve the British troops at that place. 
The Georgia loyalists are incorporated with the King's 
Carolina rangers. It is said these troops are to sail 
on Sunday. After these troops are gone, there will 
remain in <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>; the residue of the guards the 
seventeenth, twenty-third, thirty-third, and seventy-first 
regiments; five companies of the eighty-second; the 
flank companies of The eiglitj-fourth ; a detachment of 
British artillery, the third, sixty-third, and sixty-fourth 
regiments ; the Hessian corps of A Dittforth, and Bening; a detachment of Hessian artillery and 
Yagers ; with the American corps, the <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> volunteers, the King's American regiment, the Prince of Wales's regiment, the first and second battalions of 
Delancey's, and the second battalion of New Jersey volunteers. These are to join the troops at New 
York; but whether at that place, or on their passage 
to some other port, is uncertain, as it seems to be 
a matter fully established here that New Y'ork is to 
be evacuated. 
</p><p>
What is the object of the British Ministry, or the 
British Commander, in drawing off the troops from 
this country, is difficult to tell. I confess it looks 
like an approaching peace ; and yet I cannot but 
have my doubts. Reports say that Sir Guy Carleton 
is to go to Canada, and that Lord Cornwallis is to 
command in the West Indies. This disposition is 
equivocal, as it points both to war or peace, only upon 
a different plan. Could Great Britain humble the 
pride of France by some lucky stroke, I should not 
be surprised to find them forming new attacks upon 
us. But if they cannot reduce the navy of France, 
they may embrace a peace, as least ruinous to their 
affairs, however mortifying to their pride. 
</p><p>
I wrote your Excellency on the 12th of August a 
pretty full state of all matters in this quarter, and 
wish your final determination with respect to the disposition of the troops to the southward. I find, by a 
resolution of Congress, no State is to be credited for 
troops not enlisted agreeably to the resolutions of 
Congress on that subject. Whether those men, drafted in North Carolina for eighteen months, will be 
brought into service under these circumstances, I cannot determine. They ought to have been in camp 
long since, if they had marched agreeably to my orders ; but I have not heard of one man being on 
the march. On the contrary, reports say the State 
will not permit them to come. Should these troops 
not come forward, and the others march northwardly, 
it will leave the Southern States exceedingly defenceless, and much exposed even to the inroads of the 
troops in East Florida and the attacks from the Indians. 
</p><p>
On our possessing <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, the fortifications will 
come under consideration. My object would be to 
render it sufficiently strong to protect its trade 
against sudden descents of three or four thousand ; 
but, when a force invades it that is superior to the 
natural strength of the country, it must fall ; and to 
incur a large expense in the fortification, and sacrifice the garrison only to protract its fall for a few 
days, will be neither wise nor prudent. I should recommend, therefore, whenever there appears a force 
sufficient to possess the town by regular approaches, 
to abandon it, and to have the principal magazine of 
the country at Camden. 
</p><p>
To leave the town without any fortifications, will 
render trade so unsafe as to be highly injurious to 
the public finances ; besides, the perpetual alarms to 
which the inhabitants will be constantly exposed, will 
render their situation exceedingly disagreeable. All 
the Southern States are in a deplorable situation, and 
will require a great deal of nursing and care to establish good government and give a proper spur to 
agriculture and commerce. At present there are no 
Courts of Justice in any of the States, and it is dangerous travelling in almost every part of the country. 
from the great number of robbers and private plunderers that infest the roads. From these circumstances your Excellency can judge how feeble must be 
the efforts of a people in this situation, reduced to 
poverty by continual depredations. 
</p><p>
I have received orders from the Secretary of War 
to collect the minds of the officers for the reform of 
the army, agreeably to the resolution of Congress of 
the 7th of August. I have taken the sentiments of 
the officers here, and forwarded them to the respective States, to have the business completed. That part 
of the plan which proposes filling the Staff from the 
retiring officers, I fear will not be found eligible. 
The consideration proposed is by no means a sufficient 
encouragement to induce suitable characters to engage ; 
and if the appointments are confined to the retiring 
officers alone, it may be difficult to find suitable characters. Good Staff-Officers facilitate the operations 
and business of an army greatly, and the want of 
such embarrasses it exceedingly. I am not certain 
that I comprehend the intentions of Congress fully, 
and therefore can say little on the subject. 
</p><p>
This army has been exceedingly sickly in the 
months of August and September, and remains so 
still, as your Excellency will see by the returns. 
The enemy have been equally so. After I wrote to 
you of the enemy's operations to the southward, 
General Gist took one of their galleys. Major Frazer attempted a surprise upon <a href='/results.php?tla=frm' rel='colleague met'>General Marion</a>, but 
was repulsed, with the loss of one officer killed, two 
wounded, and ten or twelve dragoons killed and 
wounded. These are all the military occurrences 
which have happened since that period. I have the 
honor to be, with great respect, your Excellency's 
Most obedient and most humble servant,

Sir, 
</p><p>
I arrived at this place on the 2d of this instant ; 
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> having marched from this some days 
before me, with a part of the troops under his command, the rest being on their march to Hillsborough. 
General Smallwood was below this, about fifteen miles, 
towards the Waxhaws, where he had been for a considerable time, before <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> marched from 
Hillsborough. On my arrival, I sent for him, but he 
was gone towards Camden, in pursuit of a party of 
Tories, and did not arrive in camp till the night before last. Immediately I called a Council, respecting 
the practicability of holding a Council of Inquiry 
upon <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>'s conduct, during his command 
in this department. The questions stated to the 
Council, and the answers of the members, are inclosed 
in the papers from number One to Five. 
</p><p>
I wrote your Excellency, at <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, that I should 
leave the <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron De Steuben</a> to take command in 
Virginia, which I accordingly did, and to endeavour, 
if possible, to make an arrangement of that line. 
Since which I have not heard from him, nor whether 
the enemy have left Chesapeake Ba}'-, or not. As I 
passed through Petersburg, an express arrived from 
below, with intelligence that the enemy had returned; 
but, having heard nothing further of the matter, conclude the report must have been premature. 
</p><p>
To give your Excellency an idea of the state and 
condition of this army, if it deserves the name of 
one, I inclose you an extract of a letter, wrote by 
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> to the Board of War, number Six. 
Nothing can be more wretched and distressing than 
the condition of the troops, starving with cold and 
hunger, without tents and camp equipage. Those of 
the Virginia line are, literally, naked; and a great 
part totally unfit for any kind of duty, and must remain so until clothing can be had from the northward. I have written to <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel=''>Governor Jefferson</a> not to 
send forward any more until they are well clothed, 
and properly equipped. 
</p><p>
As I expected, so I find, the great bodies of militia that have been in the field, and the manner in 
which they came out, being all on horseback, have 
laid waste all the country, in such a manner that I 
am really afraid it will be impossible to subsist the 
few troops we have ; and, if we can be subsisted at 
all, it must be by moving to the provisions, for they 
have no way of bringing it to the army. I have desired the Board of War of this State not to call out 
any more militia, until we can be better satisfied 
about the means of subsistence for the regular troops 
and the militia from Virginia. 
</p><p>
Lord Cornwallis lies, with his principal force, at a place called Weymsborough, about half way between Camden and Ninety Six ; at both of which places the 
enemy have a post, and are strongly fortified. At Camden, they have seven redoubts ; at Ninety Six, 
not more than three, but they are very strong. Part, 
if not the whole, of the embarkation mentioned in 
your Excellency's letter of the 8th ultimo, as taking 
place at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, have arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, and, 
it is said, Lord Cornwallis is preparing for some movement. 
</p><p>
I have parties exploring the Dan, Yadkin, and Catawba Rivers, and am not without hopes we shall be 
able to assist the army by water transportation. It 
is next to impossible to get a sufficiency of wagons 
to draw provisions and forage the very great distance we are obliged to fetch it to feed the army. 
The inhabitants of this country live too remote from 
one another to be animated into great exertions ; and 
the people appear, notwithstanding their danger, very 
intent upon their own private affairs. 
</p><p>
Inclosed, numbers Seven and Eight, are the reports 
of General Sumpter's last' action, and Lieutenant-Colonel Washington's stratagem, by which he took Colonel Rugley and his party. 
</p><p>
I find, when the <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron Steuben</a> comes forward, 
there will be a difficulty between him and General Smallwood. The latter declares he never will submit 
to the commands of the former, and insists upon 
having his commission dated back to as early a period as he had a right to promotion. When that was, 
I know not, as I know of no principles of promotion, 
from Brigadier to Major-General, except their seniority or special merit. What is best to be done in the 
affair? Before I order the Baron to come forward, I 
wish your Excellency's advice in the matter. I fear 
our army is always to be convulsed by extraordinary 
claims, and special appointments. They are exceeding good men. It is a pity a dispute should arise 
between them, so injurious to the service as it must 
be. 
</p><p>
My ideas respecting the power given by Congress, 
for exchanging prisoners of war in this department, 
perfectly correspond with your Excellency's. I had 
no idea that it extended to the Convention troops, 
and, by my inquiry, only meant to learn your ad\iee, so that my conduct might correspond with your 
views. 
</p><p>
All the prisoners, taken by Colonel Campbell and 
others, have been dismissed, paroled, and enlisted in 
the militia service for three months, except about one 
hundred and thirty. Thus we have lost, by the folly, 
not to say any thing worse, of those who had them 
in charge, upwards of six hundred men. I am told 
Lord Cornwallis has lately made a proposition to 
General Smallwood for exchanging all the prisoners 
in North and South Carolina. If it is upon terms 
that are just and equal, I shall avail myself of it. 
For a great number of prisoners is a heavy weight 
upon our hands. I am too little informed of the resources still left in this country, and of the enemy's 
designs, to tell what disposition to make, or how to 
dispose of the little force we have in the field. I 
shall do the best I can, and keep your Excellency 
constantly advised of my situation. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> sets out to-morrow for the northward. Many officers think very favorably of his 
conduct, and that, whenever an inquiry takes place, 
he will honorably acquit myself 
</p><p>
I am, &c.,

Sir, 
</p><p>
I doubt not your Excellency expected to hear of 
the evacuation of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> long before this. The 
enemy are not yet gone, although now just upon the 
eve of their departure. In two days more, the town 
will be free. 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 23d of September I just acknowledged in November, with a promise to give it 
a more full answer at a future day. The Minister at 
War sent me an order for incorporating and arranging the troops of the several States, agreeably to the 
resolution of Congress of the 7th of August. I have 
formed one complete regiment out of the Pennsylvania troops, and one out of the Maryland troops, and 
sent the remainder belonging to both States home. 
Few of those of the Pennsylvania line have longer to 
serve than January next ; the Maryland troops have 
most of them a longer time to serve. I have sent 
home also the Delaware troops, and shall send the 
detachment of the fourth regiment of cavalry, under 
Captain Gill, to Virginia, to join the rest of the regiment in that State. I believe, as soon as the enemyare gone, I shall send the legion to Virginia. The 
first and third regiments being incorporated, will afford sufficient protection to this country from present 
appearances. I have not fully determined how to 
dispose of the legion, nor can I, until I am better 
satisfied with respect to the force at St. Augustine, 
to which place all the Provincial corps contained in 
the inclosed list are gone. The British troops that 
were there have joined those at <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>. 
</p><p>
By one observation in your Excellency's letter, respecting offensive operations, it appears a doubt with 
you whether you have authority to order an enterprise against St. Augustine. As there is a doubt 
on the matter, I shall remain quiet until I am more 
fully instructed. But if we had orders to undertake 
it, the thing would be impracticable without a convoy to convey the provisions and stores by water, if 
not the troops also. But more of this, hereafter. As 
to an Indian expedition, I perfectly agree with your 
Excellency that there is nothing to apprehend from 
them after British influence once fails ; and by all 
I can learn, the savages are generally inclined to 
peace, except a few of the more restless and enterprising young men, who are ambitious of military 
honors. 
</p><p>
By intelligence from <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, the British troops 
are going to the West Indies. The Hessians, and such 
of the Provincial corps as remain, are going to New 
York, which is not to be evacuated till spring; nor 
do I believe it will then, if the war continues. I am afraid the Southern States can produce but few 
men in the field, by any possible exertion in their 
power. South Carolina and Georgia I am sure cannot. The force that North Carolina will have in the 
field, after a few days, will not exceed seven hundred men. There is a detachment of Virginians here, 
which had better be completed from the troops levying in Virginia to a regiment, or march from here, Srud join those in the State. I shall wait your orders on the subject. 
</p><p>
Whatever disposition you intend to make with the 
troops in this department, I could wish to be made 
acquainted with it as early as possible, to be in readiness to carry your orders into execution as early 
and as fully as possible. South Carolina and Georgia 
have not more than one small battalion of troops, and 
those not of the best kind. The enemy's force at 
St. Augustine is not contemptible, which, aided by 
the savages, and the militia, now numerous from its 
being a place of resort for the Tories, may make a 
serious impression upon Georgia. The State, without 
a considerable force to protect it for some time, cannot recover from the ravages it has felt, or even 
prosecute any trade or agriculture. <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> will 
be stripped, and left defenceless, until new fortifications can be raised, and cannon provided. In this 
situation, and being altogether uncertain of the enemy's future plan of operations, I hope it will not be 
thought that I have detained too many troops for the 
present. I am, with great respect and perfect esteem,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My public letters to Congress will inform your 
Excellency of our situation in this quarter. We fight, get beath and fight again. We have so much 
to do and so little to do it with, that I am much afraid these States must fall, never to rise aa'ain : 
and, what is more, I am persuaded they will lay a train to sap the foundation of all the rest. 
</p><p>
I am greatly obliged to your Excellency for ordering the Marquis to the southward. I propose to halt 
him in Virginia, until the enemy's plan of operations 
is better known. <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron Steuben</a> will join this army. 
He, having offended the Legislature of Virginia, cannot be as useful there as he has been. The Marquis 
is desired to keep your Excellency advised of all 
matters in that quarter, as it is too far first to come 
to this army and then be sent back again. 
</p><p>
When I was appointed to the command of this army, I solicited Congress to give Dr. McHenry a majority, that he might serve nie in the character of 
Aid. This they refused. I was persuaded, when I 
made the application, of the necessity, and since have 
felt it most sensibly. Your Excellency can scarcely 
tell how happy you are in your family, and therefore 
can hardly judge of my situation. I cannot make a 
second application to Congress on the subject, nor 
should I have hopes of succeeding, if I did ; but I 
shall esteem it a peculiar mark of your Excellency's 
friendship and esteem, if you will interest yourself 
in the matter, and get him a majority. Your Excellency will judge of the propriety of my request; and 
if my wishes have prompted me to ask any thing 
that does not accord "with your opinion or your feelings, I must beg you to decline the measure, and 
excuse me. 
</p><p>
It is a long time since I received a line from Mrs. 
Greene. I am afraid they have miscarried, before 
they got to head-quarters. I am sorry that you had 
not leisure to call on her on your return from Newport. She would have thought herself greatly honored, and been peculiarly happy on the occasion. 
</p><p>
With the greatest respect and esteem, I am, &c., 
</p><p>

Sir, 
</p><p>
My letter of the 7th ultimo, covering the returns 
of the army, I hope has been safely delivered. Since 
which I have been duly honored with your Excellency's favors of the 23d of April and 22d of May. 
The troops have been so badly clothed, and the season is so very hot, that many of the soldiery have 
been seized with fevers, which renders them unfit for 
service, although it has by no means proved mortal. 
I have procured, with the aid of the Executive of 
this State, materials for a check shirt, a pair of overalls, and a coatee, for each of them, which will alleviate their distress until the supplies from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> arrive. 
</p><p>
On the 7th instant, I changed the position of the 
army, in hopes of finding one more healthy. I have 
taken post on the south side of Ashley River, seven miles below Bacon's Bridge, and fifteen from <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>. The ground is high and dry ; the water is good ; 
and it has the appearance of the most healthy place 
this country affords. We have been daily in expectation of hearing of the evacuation of <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>. It is 
an event which I believe has been determined on for 
some time past. The people of this country have 
their expectations raised, and are sanguine in their 
hopes that <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> will be speedily abandoned. 
There are some preparations on which their opinions are founded ; but I must confess, they seem to be 
rather contracting; their works than abandoning; the place. The situation of their troops at the Quarterhouse, they find so very unhealthy, that they will be 
under the necessity of leaving it. They have advanced their works one mile on the neck, to which 
they will retire. 
</p><p>
The enemy are so well informed of the want of 
energy and exertion in the States, that I am apprehensive they will withdraw part of their troops, leaving a small garrison to be held in constant readiness 
to evacuate, whenever they find a combined attack 
meditated against them. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Greene joins me in returning the most sincere 
thanks for your and Mrs. Washington's attention, and 
we beg you will accept our best wishes for your happiness. I have the honor to be, with the most perfect 
esteem and respect your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and very humble servant,

P. S. The copy of a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague met'>General Wayne</a>, 
and the returns of the army, will accompany this 
letter.

Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's favor of the 18th came to hand 
this afternoon. I had given over the thoughts of going home, even if I obtained your permission, before 
I received your pleasure upon the subject. My affairs require it ; but I am fully convinced that the 
time it will take, and the state of the Southern department, will not admit of the indulgence. When I 
marched from Toppan, I wrote to Mrs. Greene to 
come to camp, and expect her here every hour. 
Should I set out before her arrival, the disappointment of not seeing me, added to the shock of my 
going to the southward, I am very apprehensive will 
have some disagreeable effect upon her health, especially as her apprehensions have been all alive respecting my going to the southward, before there was 
the least probability of it. 
</p><p>
My baggage sets out in the morning, if Colonel Hughes does not disappoint me about the horses; and my stay shall not be more than a day longer, 
whether INIrs. Greene arrives or not. Your Excellency cannot be more anxious to have me come on, than 
I am to comply with your orders, especially since 
the two last articles of intelligence, the sailing of the 
troops at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and the advance of Lord Cornwallis into the State of North Carolina. 
</p><p>
I am, &c., 
</p><p>
