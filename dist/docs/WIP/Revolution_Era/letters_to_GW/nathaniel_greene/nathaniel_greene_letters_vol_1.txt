DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Inclosed you have a copy of the letter, in answer 
to mine to Congress, relative to cartridges. As soon 
as the cartridges come up, they shall be forwarded. 
Colonel Biddle has wrote to Amboy for ninety thousand that are at that post. 
</p><p>
We have collected all the wagons in our power, 
and sent over. Our people have had extreme hard 
duty ; the common guards, common fatigue, and the 
extraordinary guards and extraordinary fatigue, for 
the removal of the stores, and forwarding the provisions, have kept every man on duty. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a> requested a party of men to re-enforce them at Mount Washington. I sent between 
two and three hundred of Colonel Durkee's regiment. 
Please to inform me whether your Excellency approves thereof. 
</p><p>
We shall get a sufficient quantity of provisions 
over to-day for the garrison at Fort Washington. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='colleague'>General Mifflin</a> thinks it not advisable to pull the 
barracks down yet. lie has hopes of our army returning to that ground for winter-quarters. I think 
this would be running too great a risk to leave them 
standing in expectation of such an event. There being  several strong fortifications in and about King's 
Bridge, if the enemy should throw in a thousand or 
fifteen hundred men,, they could cut off our communication effectually; and, as the state of the barracks 
is, they would find exceeding good cover for the 
men. But if we were to take the barracks down, if 
the boards were not removed, it would, in a great 
measure, deprive them of that advantage. However, 
I have not had it in my power to do either as yet. 
</p><p>
I have directed all the wagons that are on the 
other side to be employed in picking up the scattered boards about the encampments. I believe, from 
what I saw yesterday in riding over the grounds, 
they will amount to several thousands. As soon as 
we have got these together, I purpose to begin upon 
the barracks. In the mean time, I should be glad 
to know if your Excellency has any other orders to 
give respecting the business. 
</p><p>
I have directed the Commissary and Quartermaster-General of this department to lay in provisions and 
provender, upon the back road to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, for 
twenty thousand men for three months. The principal magazine will be at Aquackanock. I shall fortify 
it as soon as possible, and secure that post and the 
pass at the bridge, which is now repaired and fit for 
an army to pass over, with the baggage and artillery. 
I rejoice to hear of the defeat of that vile traitor, 
Major Rogers, and his party of Tories, though I am 
exceeding sorry to hear it cost us so brave an officer 
as Major Greene. I am, with great respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's obedient servant,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
The enemy have possession of Fort Independence, 
on the heights above King's Bridge. They made their 
appearance the night before last. We had got every 
thing of value away. The bridges are cut down, and 
I gave Colonel Magaw orders to stop the road between the mountains. 
</p><p>
I should be glad to know your Excellency's mind 
about holding all the ground from King's Bridge to 
the lower lines. If we attempt to hold the ground, 
the garrison must still be reenforced; but if the garrison is to draw into Mount Washington, and only 
keep that, the number of troops on the Island is too 
large. 
</p><p>
We are not able to determine, with any certainty, 
whether those troops, that have taken post above 
King's Bridge, are the same troops or not that were 
in or about Haerlem. Several days past they clisap-peared from below, all at once, and some little time 
after about fifty boats, full of men, were seen going 
up towards Hunt's Point, and that evening the enemy 
were discovered at Fort Independence. We suspect 
them to be the same troops that were engaged in 
the Sunday skirmish. 
</p><p>
Six officers, belonging to privateers that were taken 
by the enemy, made their escape last night. They 
inform me they were taken by the last fleet that 
came in. They had about six thousand foreign troops 
on board, one quarter of which had the black scurvy, 
and died very fast. 
</p><p>
Seventy sail of transports and ships fell down to 
Red Hook. They were bound for Rhode Island, and 
had on board about three thousand troops. They also 
inform, that after the Sunday action an officer of Distinction was brought into the city, badly wounded. 
</p><p>
The ships have come up the river to their station 
again, a little below their lines. Several deserters 
from Paulus Hook have come over. They all report 
that General Howe is wounded, as did those from 
the fleet. It appears to be a prevailing opinion in 
the land and sea service. 
</p><p>
I forwarded your Excellency a return of troops at this post, and a copy of a plan for establishing magazines. I could wish to know your pleasure as to the magazines, as soon as possible. 
</p><p>
I shall reenforce Colonel Magaw with Colonel Rawlings's regiment, until I hear from your Excellency respecting the matter. 
</p><p>
The motions of the Grand Army will best deter 
mine the propriety of endeavouring to hold all the 
ground from King's Bridge to the lower lines. I shall 
be as much on the Island of York as possible, so as 
not to neglect the duties of my own department. 
</p><p>
I can learn no satisfactory account of the action 
the other day. I am, with great respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's obedient servant, 
</p><p>

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
By an express from Major Clark, stationed at 
Dobbs's Ferry, I find the enemy are encamped right 
opposite, to the number of between three and four 
thousand ; and the Major adds, from their disposition 
and search after boats, they design to cross the river. 
A frigate and two transports or provision-ships passed the chevaux-de-frise night before last. They were 
prodigiously shattered, from the fire of our cannon. 
The same evening, Colonel Tupper attempted passing  the ships with the petiaugres, loaded with flour. 
The enemy manned several barges, two tenders, and 
a row-galley, and attacked them. Our people ran 
the petiaugres ashore, and landed and defended them. 
The enemy attempted to land several times, but 
were repulsed. The fire lasted about an hour and a 
half, and the enemy moved off. Colonel Tupper still 
thinks he can transport the provision in flat-bottomed 
boats. A second attempt shall be speedily made. 
We lost one man, mortally wounded. 
</p><p>
General Mercer writes me the Virginia troops are coming on. They are now at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>. He proposes an attack on Staten Island; but the motions of the enemy are such I think it necessary for them to  come forward as fast as possible. On York Island, 
the enemy have taken possession of the hill, next to Spiten Devil. I think they will not be able to 
penetrate any farther. There appears to be about fifteen hundred of them. From the enemy's motions, 
I should be apt to suspect they were retreating from your army, or at least altering their operations. Mr. Lovell, who is at last enlarged from his confinement, 
reports that Colonel Allen, his fellow prisoner, was informed that transports were getting in readiness to sail, at a moment's warning, sufficient to transport fifteen thousand men. 
</p><p>
The officers of Colonel Hand's regiment are here, with enlisting orders. The officers of the Pennsylvania regiments think it a grievance (such of them 
as are commissioned for the new establishment), that officers of other regiments should have the privilege of enlisting their men before they get orders. I 
have stopped it until I learn your Excellency's pleasure. Governor Ewing is very much opposed to it. 
You will please to favor me with a line on the subject, I am, with the greatest respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's obedient servant,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letter of the 8th, this moment came to hand. I shall forward the letter to General Stevens by express. The stores at Dobbs's Ferry I 
had just given orders to the Quartermaster to prepare wagons to remove. I think the enemy will 
meet with some difficulty in crossing the river at Dobbs's Ferry. However, it is not best to trust too much to the expected difficulties they may meet there. 
</p><p>
By the letter that will accompany this, and was to 
have gone last night by <a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='colleague'>Major Mifflin</a>, your Excellency will see what measures I took before your favor 
came to hand. The passing of the ships up the river 
is, to be sure, a full proof of the insufficiency of the 
obstructions in the river to stop the ships from going  up ; but that garrison employs double the number of men to invest it that we have to occupy it. 
They must keep troops at King's Bridge, to prevent 
a communication with the country; and they dare 
not leave a very small number, for fear our people 
should attack them. 
</p><p>
Upon the whole, I cannot help thinking the garrison is of advantage; and I cannot conceive the garrison to be in any great danger. The men can be 
brought off at any time, but the stores may not be 
so easily removed; yet I think they can be got off, 
in spite of them, if matters grow desperate. This 
post is of no importance only in conjunction with 
Mount Washington. I was over there last evening. 
The enemy seem to be disposing matters to besiege 
the place ; but Colonel Morgan thinks it will take 
them till December expires before they can carry it. 
If the enemy do not find it an object of importance, 
they will not trouble themselves about it; if they 
do, it is open proof they feel an injury from our 
possessing it. Our giving it up will open a free 
communication with the country, by the way of 
King's Bridge, that must be a great advantage to 
them and injury to us. 
If the enemy cross the river, I shall follow your 
Excellency's advice respecting the cattle and -forage. 
Those measures, however cruel in appearance, were 
ever my maxims of war, in the defence of a country ; in attacking, they would be very improper. 
</p><p>
By this express, several packets from Congress are 
forwarded to you. 
</p><p>
I shall collect our whole strength, and watch the 
motions of the enemy; and pursue such measures, 
for the future, as circumstances render necessary. 
</p><p>
As I have your Excellency's permission, I shall 
order General Stephen on as far as Aquackanock, at 
least. That is an important pass. I am fortifying it 
as fast as possible. 
</p><p>
I am, dear Sir, your most obedient, 
</p><p>
And very humble servant,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
From the last accounts from Great Britain, it appears absolutely necessary that there should be an 
augmentation of the American forces, in consequence 
of which I suppose there will be several promotions. 
As I have no desire of quitting the service, I hope 
the Congress will take no measure that will lay me 
under the disagreeable necessity of doing it. I have 
ever found myself exceeding happy under your Excellency's command. I wish my ability to deserve 
was equal to my inclination to merit. How far I 
have succeeded in my endeavours, I submit to your 
Excellency's better judgment. I hope I shall never 
be more fond of promotion than studious to merit it. 
Modesty will ever forbid me to apply to that House 
for any favors. I consider myself immediately under your Excellency's protection, and look up to you for 
justice. Every man feels himself wounded, where he 
finds himself neglected, and that in proportion as he 
is conscious of endeavouring to merit attention. I 
shall be satisfied with any measure that the Congress 
shall take, that has not a direct tendency to degrade 
me in the public estimation. A measure of that 
sort would sink me in my own esteem, and render 
me spiritless and uneasy in my situation, and consequently unfit for the service. 
</p><p>
I wish for nothing more than justice, either upon 
principle of merit or rank, and will at all times rest 
satisfied when your Excellency tells me I ought to 
be. I feel myself strongly attached to the cause, to 
the Continental Congress, and to your Excellency's 
person and I should consider it a great misfortune 
to be deprived of an opportunity of taking an active 
part in the support of the one, and the promotion of 
the other. 
</p><p>
But should any thing take place contrary to my 
wishes, which might furnish me with sufficient reason 
of quitting the service, yet I will not do it, until the 
danger and difficulties appear less than at present. 
Believe me to be, with the highest respect, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and humble servant,

SIR, 
</p><p>
I have just completed a brigade return for the vacancies in the different regiments. My brigade is so dispersed that it is difficult getting returns seasonably. I should have made this return yesterday, but could not get Colonel Hand's until last evening. 
</p><p>
The outguards report nothing worthy your Excellency's notice this morning. 
</p><p>
I am so confined, writing passes, &c., that it is impossible for me to attend to the duties of the day, which, in many instances, prejudices the service. Such 
a confined situation leaves one no opportunity of viewing things for themselves. It is recommended, by one of the greatest Generals of the age, not only 
to issue orders, but to see to the execution ; for the army being composed of men of indolence, if the commander is not attentive to every individual in the 
different departments, the machine becomes dislocated, and the progress of business retarded. 
</p><p>
The science or art of war requires a freedom of 
thought, and leisure to reflect upon the various incidents that daily occur, which cannot be had where 
the whole of one's time is engrossed in clerical employments. The time devoted to this employment is 
not the only injury I feel ; but it confines my thoughts as well as engrosses my time. It is like a merchandise of small wares. 
</p><p>
I must beg leave to recommend to your Excellency's consideration the appointing an officer to write and sign the necessary passes. The person I should 
wish to be appointed is Lieutenant Bio d get. If it was put in general orders, that passes signed by him should be deemed authentic, as if signed by me, it 
would leave me at liberty to pursue the more important employments of my station. 
</p><p>
I hope your Excellency will not think this application results from a lazy habit, or a desire to free myself from business. Far from it. I am never more 
happy than when I am honorably or usefully employed. If your Excellency thinks I can promote the service as much in this employment as in any other, 
</p><p>
I shall cheerfully execute the business, without the least murmur. 
</p><p>
I am, with all due respect, your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
