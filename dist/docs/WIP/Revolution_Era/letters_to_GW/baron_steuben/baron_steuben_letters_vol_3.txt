</p><p>
To His Excellency <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a>. 
</p><p>
It is with the greatest satisfaction I acquaint you 
that the plan of arrangement for the army, which 
your Excellency sent to Congress, has been agreed 
upon yesterday, without any alteration. The granting the half-pay for life, to the reduced officers, has 
met with some opposition; but the proposition has 
not only passed, but it was moved and resolved, immediately after, to extend these advantages to all the 
officers in the service. 
</p><p>
In the minutes which <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel=''>Colonel Hamilton</a> has delivered me, by your Excellency's order, I find that 
the four regiments of cavalry, or rather legions, were 
thus fixed ; â€” 
</p><p>
Four troops of mounted dragoons, sixty men each, 240 
</p><p>
Four companies dismounted, or chasseurs, sixty men each, 240 
</p><p>
Total, 480 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague met'>General Sullivan</a> and Colonel Bland have told me that this is altered in your Excellency's letter; and that there are to be 
Four troops of mounted dragoons, sixty men each, ....... 240 
</p><p>
Two companies of chasseurs, sixty men each, 120 
</p><p>
Total, 360 
</p><p>
Your Excellency "will allow me to make here a 
short observation on the subdivision of this cavalry, 
without altering the totality of the foot or horsemen. 
Cavalry, especially when two deep, is not very terrible in their attacks in front, and least so when 
against infantry. The attacks of the cavalry, when 
they intend to overthrow or break a line, are generally made by troops or squadrons, or in column, or 
in echiqidcr (checkerwise). The deeper they are, the 
surer they are to break through. If, then, instead of 
four, a regiment was divided into six troops, the object would be better answered. 
</p><p>
There is another reason, which has determined the 
King of Prussia to divide his light-horse, or hussars, 
into six companies, forming three squadrons. The 
cavalry, after an attack, is generally in disorder ; they 
must then be rallied by the sound of the trumpet. 
When they are divided into three squadrons, the 
right, left, and centre only indicate how the men are 
to rally, which is not so easy when they are divided 
into four troops. When three squadrons are in order 
of battle, the signals, whether the right, left, or centre squadron is to charge, still meet with difficulty 
when the cavalry is divided into four squadrons or 
troops ; and this is the reason why, in several European services, an odd number has been adopted for 
the manoeuvres of the light-horse. 
</p><p>
Besides, our regiments of cavalry will have, I believe, as those of infantry, three Field-Officers. Each 
of them will then command a squadron, which will 
consist of two companies. Wherefore I propose that 
each regiment of cavahy may be divided into three 
squadrons, each squadron into two companies, each of 
which shall consist of forty men, which will make 
eighty men for a squadron. The companies of chasseurs ouo-ht to be likewise three in number, each 
company to consist of fifty men, rank and file, attached, on all occasions, to the first, second, and third 
squadron of the regiment. And, as it often happens 
that the squadrons are separated from one another, 
each company of chasseurs ought to be always 
attached to its squadron, as well to support it in its 
manoeuvres as to guard it in its quarters. As, by this 
subdivision, the totality will not suffer a great alteration, I believe it will not alter the general plan. I 
will, therefore, mention it to no one besides your Excellency; and I think it is in your power to order 
this subdivision, if you think proper. 
</p><p>
I am not very happy in the arrangement of my 
department. The plan relative thereto, which your 
Excellency has delivered to the Committee which was 
at camp, after having been a little altered by that 
Committee, was sent to Congress. Congress referred 
it to the Board of War, who, after having altered it, 
sent it back to Congress, who thought proper to refer 
it to a Committee of three, who made new alterations. 
Now it has been so much altered, that it does not at 
all resemble itself No intimation was officially given 
me of it, and I read it in a printed copy, which fell 
accidentally into my hands. I have the honor to 
transmit one to your Excellency. 
</p><p>
The monthly addition of from five to eight dollars 
to the pay of officers of such merit as those whom 
your Excellency has chosen for the Inspectorship, appears to me so very mean, that I will not take upon myself to make them such a proposition. When the 
ancient Majors of brigade, who, in the first institution, 
were taken from the line of Lieutenants or Ensigns, 
had an addition to their pay of twenty-four dollars per 
month, how can nine dollars now be proposed to a 
Colonel for discharging so important and so painful a 
function? I am now endeavouring to find how much 
the Muster-master's department has cost the States. 
I am sure that the addition I ask for the Officers of 
Inspectorship will not amount to an eighth part of it. 
Several resolutions, in this arrangement, are contradictory to one another, and others are not sufficiently 
clear. I am therefore determined to present a Memorial to Congress, in order to have the Inspectors' department established on the footing proposed by your 
Excellency, without any alteration. If Congress desire that I should continue in this office, I flatter 
myself they will have a regard to my representation. 
</p><p>
I am, &c..

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor to address your Excellency the 
8th instant, giving you a detail of what has passed 
down to that date. The enemy, lying still at Westover on the 9th, and some vessels which had lain at 
the mouth of the Appamatox, dropping down that 
day to their fleet, I thought it evident they had no 
design against Petersburg, and therefore ordered the 
few militia who were assembled there to march to 
Prince George Court-House, and went there myself, 
that I might be more at hand, to prepare against 
any movement of the enemy. The 10th, in the 
morning, I was informed they were embarking their 
troops; and, on reconnoitring them myself, from Coggin's Point, I found their embarkation completed, and 
the vessels preparing to sail. 
It had been found impracticable to remount the 
cannon at Hood's or to prepare any obstruction to 
their passing that place. Of this, however, the enemy 
were ignorant ; and, thinking it very probable they 
would land a party to examine those works before 
they attempted to pass, I ordered three hundred infantry and about thirty horse, under Colonel Clark, 
to lie in ambush to receive them. About 12 o'clock 
the fleet got under way, and at 4 o'clock I saw 
them, from Hood's, come to, within cannon-shot. At 
dark they landed troops from eighteen boats, deserters (say five hundred), who immediately attacked a 
small picket we had, and pursued them to within 
forty paces of the ambuscade, when our troops gave 
them a fire ; but, on their returning it, and charging 
bayonets, the militia immediately fled. After throwing the cannon into the river, the enemy returned to 
their ships, which, at daylight, were five miles below. 
I ordered three hundred infantry and two troops of 
horse down to Cabin Point, and encamped with the 
remainder, about five hundred men, at this place. As 
an attempt might be made at <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>, and as 
General Nelson had only four hundred men, I ordered 
five hundred and sixty militia, who were then on 
their way to join me, to cross the river and reenforce 
him. The next great object for the enemy being 
Hunter's Works, and the stores at <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a>, I 
wrote the Governor to countermand the militia from 
that quarter. General Weedon had already advanced 
with about three hundred and fifty, as far as Hanover Court-House, before he received the Governor's 
letter. It is left with him to return or not, according as he, from his knowledge of the force that can 
be collected, may think necessary. 
</p><p>
I cannot yet form any judgment of the future operations of the enemy. Should the}'- mean to pillage 
<a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>, Nelson's corps may harass, but cannot 
prevent them. If they take possession of Norfolk, I shall collect what force is necessary, and endeavour to 
keep them engaged. Or, if they should go into Potomac, I shall immediately march to form a junction 
with the militia under General Weedon, and cover <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a>. 
</p><p>
The militia are coming in from all quarters, but 
without arms, for which they apply to me. I have 
delivered about five hundred we had, belonging to 
the Continent. Those of the State were so scattered, 
in removing them on the alarm, that their officers 
cannot collect them again. The troops have neither 
tents nor camp-kettles. It is impossible to describe 
the situation I am in, in want of every thing ; and 
nothing can be got from the State, rather for want 
of arrangement than any thing else. I am, with the 
greatest respect, Sir, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and most humble servant,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
The expedition against <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a> having failed, 
my first care was to save those articles which had, 
at so much trouble and expense, been collected for 
that purpose. And here I must do justice to this 
State for their efforts on this occasion. I can, with 
truth, say that every possible preparation was made. 
</p><p>
The expectations of the people were accordingly very 
great, but not so much so as the consternation they 
were thrown into by the arrival of the British fleet 
with a reenforcement. 
</p><p>
The Marquis has doubtless communicated to your 
Excellency the project I had formed before his departure. Lord Cornwallis being then in the environs 
of Hillsborough, I proposed to Government to march 
with the whole of the militia, and by forced marches 
cross the Roanoke, and, in conjunction with <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>, fall on his Lordship before the enemy here 
could have time to form any plan. This manoeuvre, 
I flattered myself, would at least drive Cornwallis 
from North Carolina, and probably, by obliging General Phillips to follow us with all his force, have removed the seat of war from this State. 
</p><p>
I submitted this plan to the Marquis, to General Weedon, and to Colonel Gouvion, who approved it. 
On my way to <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> I met Lieutenant-Colonel 
Morris, who came directly from <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>. lie 
informed me that his Lordship had already begun 
to retire towards Cross Creek, and that <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> wanted a reenforcement to enable him to 
pursue with vigor. This served to strengthen my 
opinion; and, as I had then upwards of four thousand 
militia together, I confined my requisition to two 
thousand men, whom I only required for thirty or 
forty days. The answer of Government to this proposition I have the honor to inclose. The perplexity 
the arrival of the reenforcement had thrown them 
into, together with the Marquis's retiring at this 
juncture to the northward, made them reject every 
idea not tending to the immediate defence of the 
State. My situation here is not the most agreeable, 
obliged to undertake the defence against three thou 
sand regular troops, with notliing to oppose to them 
hut militia, whose numbers decrease every day. Those 
who have served since the Ibeginning of the invasion 
have discharged themselves, and are not yet replaced 
by others ; in consequence of which General Muhlenberg is left on the south side of the river with only 
seven hundred men, and General Weedon on the 
north side with about six hundred men. If the enemy have any intention to penetrate the country, the 
opposition we can make will avail little. 
</p><p>
A very great evil resulting from this invasion is, 
that it stops the recruiting for the army. So long 
as a county has any militia in the field, so long that 
county is prevented from drafting; and as most of the 
counties have had part of their militia either here or 
with <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>, little or nothing has yet been 
done in the business. Only fifty-two have yet come 
in ; and of these some have already deserted. Some 
who came as substitutes have received twenty-five 
and thirty thousand pounds' for eighteen months. 
</p><p>
I am much at a loss w-hat to do for arms, when 
the recruits do come in. I had reckoned on those 
by M. de Tilly; and I must entreat your Excellency 
to order them on by land, as we have not the least 
prospect of a single musket any other way. We 
shall also be much distressed for ammunition. <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> presses me for a supply, whilst I can 
scarce find enough to supply the militia. The Marquis has sent one hundred thousand cartridges to 
<a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a> ; these I will take care to forward to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>. Your Excellency has, I presume, 
been informed that the lead mines have given out. 
This article is not now to be had here. If the Eastern States do not send us a supply, we shall be 
sadly at a loss. Powder is also scarce. A powdermill, near this, was blown up some time since, supposed by an emissary of the enemy. I imagine 
Maryland would furnish some, on application of the 
Board of War. 
</p><p>
Another important and very difficult object is, remounting the cavalry. The Assembly have passed a 
law limiting the price of horses for the cavalry at 
five thousand pounds, a price inadequate to the purchase of the meanest horse. Very indifferent horses, 
which have been impressed, have been valued from 
twenty to thirty thousand pounds and upwards. Nothing, therefore, can possibly be done till the meeting of the Assembly. The Southern army will require, at least, three hundred cavalry horses for next 
campaign. I suppose thirty guineas to have been 
the old price of such horses. Allowing now forty 
guineas, the whole will amount to twelve thousand 
guineas. The price must be limited, or the Continent 
will not be able to pay the expense of remounting 
two regiments of cavalry. I beg your Excellency's 
directions for my guide in making a proper representation to the Assembly, which meets the 10th of 
next month. Swords will also be much wanted for 
the cavalry. I have ordered six hundred to be made 
at Mr. Hunter's works, but dare not reckon on them 
in time. Cartridge-boxes are an article the State 
cannot furnish. If possible, two thousand should be 
sent immediately from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
</p><p>
The little success I have had in creating the line 
of this State, and in furnishing the necessary supplies 
for the Southern army, induced me to request <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> to call me to the army. He has, however, 
refused me, and in such a manner as to engage me, if possible, to redouble my zeal in assisting him from 
this quarter. I lament only that the invasion not 
only takes up a part of my attention, but prevents 
those succours which might otherwise be expected. 
The number of troops of this State diminishes greatly. When I first arrived here, Colonel Buford had 
five hundred men with him. Since then, I have 
sent from hence eight hundred rank and file, exclusive of sergeants, music, waiters, and wagoners ; and, 
by Colonel Morris's account, they have not now 
more than seven hundred men in the field. Some 
speedy and effectual measures must be taken to stop 
such desertion, or it will be in vain to raise men at 
such an expense. 
</p><p>
I shall be much obliged to your Excellency to order the Commissary of Prisoners to send me, as soon 
as possible, a list of the southern officers exchanged, 
that I may order them to join. Many refuse to act, 
from not having received official accounts of their 
being exchanged. I inclose to your Excellency a representation of the officers of the Virginia line against 
General Weedon. the propriety of which Congress and 
your Excellency will judge. A copy has been sent 
to the Board of War. The enemy, in <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, 
are busied in strengthening their works, and in building boats. They have, also, some parties in Princess 
Ann, and about five hundred men in Norfolk. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c.,
