</p><p>
My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
Although the exalted station, which your love of 
us and our love of you has placed you in, calls for 
change in mode of address, yet I cannot so quickly 
relinquish the old manner. Your military rank holds 
its place in my mind, notwithstanding your civic glory ; and, whenever I do abandon the title which used 
to distinguish you, I shall do it with awkwardness. 
</p><p>
The affectionate and decided regard, demonstrated 
to your person and character, on your tour to New 
York, has diffused pure and sincere joy among every 
class of people in the circle of my intelligence. Nor 
has any individual more heartily enjoyed the testimonials exhibited by my fellow-citizens than myself; because it manifests honor, truth, and gratitude in the 
body politic, and because such spontaneous and disinterested effusions of respect and attachment must 
convey a reward the most grateful of all others to your 
feelings. Having gone through your inauguration, 
and consequently in some degree shielded by the duties of office from the display of affection and respect, 
which your arrival in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> must have produced, 
I venture to yield to the entreaties of my heart, often before resisted, to offer my congratulations on your 
auspicious acceptance of the administration of the National Government. My reluctance to trespass a moment on your time would have operated to a farther 
procrastination of my wishes, had not I been roused 
above every feeling of ceremony by the heart-rending 
intelligence, received yesterday, that your life was despaired of Had I had wings in the moment, I should 
have wafted myself to your bedside, only again to 
see the first of men ; but alas ! despairing as I was, from the account received, after tlae aMction of one 
day and night, was I made most happy by receiving 
a letter, now before me from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, announcing 
the restoration of your health. May Heaven preserve it! 
</p><p>
Next to the felicity of the nation, I confess I have 
no object more interesting to me than your health 
and happiness. I pray, as I ever have done, that 
your return to public life may be commensurate to 
your intentions and to our expectations. Greater 
good to the people of the United States cannot be 
asked for. To give complete success to your administration appears to me impracticable, unless national 
harmony is soon restored. The political schism, which 
divides our countrymen, is, I fear, deep planted in 
the minds of many leading characters ; and, however 
respect to a majority and affection to the President 
may quiet them now, yet, on the first inviting occasion, the spirit of opposition will show itself strongly. 
To deprive it of the means of operating with effect 
should be, I conceive, the leading object of the friends 
to government. It is practicable to prevent your enemy from injuring you, although it may be impossible to render him your friend. Therefore, instead of 
striving to court the good will of opposition, by improper concessions, I would disarm them, by complying with the rational views of the advocates for 
amendments spontaneously. The House of Representatives, to whom these remarks apply, if they follow 
the plan which seems to be contemplated by some of 
their members, will, I think, accomplish this great 
good. If it is not done under your auspices, it will 
never be effected ; and, if never effected, we shall be 
a divided, distressed people. 
</p><p>
Among the difficulties which encompass you, I presume those which flow from the nomination to office. 
will be the most irksome. The public good being 
your guide, all that you can want will be just information. Herein consists the danf>;er of committins; 
error, because you must unavoidably depend on the 
knowledge of others too often. When the commercial arrangements shall be settled, and it may become 
necessary to make the appointments, I beg leave to 
mention to you a young man of excellent private 
character, and brought up in the naval office, Mr. Richard Marshall Scott, of <a href='/results.php?city=alexandria' rel='city'>Alexandria</a>, who wishes to 
continue in public employ. He is descended from 
poor though honest parents, and has no chance for success in his application but from his own merit. His 
character will bear the strictest scrutiny, and his conduct for seven vears in the office of South Potomac, 
as Deputy Naval Officer at the port of <a href='/results.php?city=alexandria' rel='city'>Alexandria</a>, 
meets with unanimous applause from the merchants 
as well as from his superiors. 
</p><p>
Having touched on this delicate subject, I cannot 
help naming to you another gentleman, to whose 
character, in war and in peace, you are no stranger, 
and whose situation and manner of life seem to fit 
him for public employment. I mean Colonel Carrington. He dislikes to solicit for office, but I am persuaded would be happy in being honored with an 
appointment, whenever you should consider it proper 
to call him into service. I am sure you will consider 
these communications merely as information, and therefore they cannot be unacceptable to you. Will you 
be pleased to present Mrs. Lee and me in the most 
respectful manner to your lady, and to accept, Sir, a 
repetition of the unceasing respect and regard of 
your faithful and affectionate Friend and humble servant.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
Although I have had near two days to reflect on 
the purport of the letter received from the Secretary 
of the Treasury, on the 1st instant, I confess I am 
not yet relieved from the agitation of mind produced 
by that communication. 
</p><p>
My grief for the necessity of pointing the bayonet 
against the breasts of our countrymen, is equalled only 
by my conviction of the wisdom of jouv decision to 
compel immediate submission to the authority of the 
laws, and by my own apprehensions of my inadequacy to the trust you have been pleased to honor 
me with. I never expected to see so strange a crisis; 
much less to be called to the command of an army, 
on the judicious direction of which may perhaps depend our national existence. But being ready to 
give my aid on the awful occasion, I was willing to 
take any part in the measures you might think proper to order for cj[uelling the insurrection, without regard to rank or station. 
</p><p>
The honor yon have fixed to my name, Iby the late 
signal testimony of your approbation and confidence, 
impresses me with every feeling which the most affectionate gratitude can inspire. I will bestow, invariably, the whole power of my mind and body, to give 
the most propitious effect to your wishes. If success 
attends my endeavours, I shall be happy indeed. If 
the reverse happens, I shall be truly miserable to the 
last hour of my life ; because I shall attribute the 
public misfortunes which must ensue to my own incapacity, however strenuous and faithful may have 
been my efforts. 
</p><p>
With these feelings, you will readily anticipate the 
keen solicitude I must momently experience to prepare myself for the fulfilment of the duties expected 
from me. I cannot so certainly or so easily do this, 
as with you. If, then, the appeal expected be inevitable (which I pray Heaven may still avert), let me 
entreat you to call me to you at once. A thousand 
things will occur relative to the army and its objects, 
which I ought to understand in time ; and I ought 
also to make myself acquainted with the temper of 
the insurgents, the characters and views of their 
leaders, and with the country in which the troops 
are to act. With most affectionate attachment and 
entire respect, I have the honor to be, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>

My dear General, 
</p><p>
111 the full confidence you receive my letters as 
testimonials of my unceasing respect, and from a solicitude to acquaint you -with all material contingencies in the administration of our national affairs, that 
you may he able to form your judgment on authentic documents, and, consequently, that your opinions, 
being bottomed on truth, may not fail to produce the 
most beneficial effects to our country, I again address 
you, and mean to confine myself to one subject, which 
will, I apprehend, soon become the topic of public 
debate. Among the defects which degrade the Constitution of the Federal Government, is the physical 
impossibility of secrecy in the sovereignty. Therefore, 
it is often necessary to make confidential communications, when they serve to correct the circulation of 
erroneous informations on subjects of national concern, which, in their nature, are secret, but, from the 
cause just mentioned, become public. Considering 
myself, therefore, at full liberty to give you a history of this business, I will do it with brevity. 
</p><p>
We are told here that the decided difference which 
prevailed in Congress on the proposed treaty with 
Spain, is generally understood in every part of the 
Union ; and it is suggested, that the project of the 
treaty will become the subject of deliberation in the 
Assembly of Virginia. 
</p><p>
True it is, that this affair unfortunately produced 
an intemperance common in democratic bodies, and 
always injurious to the interest of the public; for, to 
judge wisely on systems and measures, the mind ought to be free from prejudice and warmth^ and influenced 
by a full, deliberate view of the general effects of such system and measures. 
</p><p>
The Eastern States consider a commercial connection with Spain as the only remedy for the distresses 
which oppress their citizens ; most of which, they say, 
flow from the decay of their commerce. Their Delegates have, consequently, zealously pressed the formation of this connection, as the only effectual mode to 
revive the trade of their country. In this opinion, 
they have been joined by two of the Middle States. 
On the other hand, Virginia has, with equal zeal, opposed the connection, because the project involves, expressly, the disuse of the navigation of the Mississippi 
for a given time, and eventually, they think, will 
sacrifice our right to it. The Delegation is under injunctions from the State on this subject. They have 
acted in obedience to their instructions, and, myself 
excepted, in conformity to their private sentiments. 
I confess that I am by no means convinced of the 
justness or policy of our instructions, and very much 
apprehend, unless they are repealed by the present 
Assembly, the fatal effects of discord in counsel wall 
be experienced by the United States in a very high 
degree. 
</p><p>
The project submitted by the Secretary for Foreign 
Affairs w\as founded, as well as I can recollect, on 
the following principles. First; the commerce between 
the United States and the King of Spain, to be 
founded on the principles of perfect reciprocity, which 
reciprocity to be diffused in all the sub-regulations. 
Secondly; the trade to be confined to his Catholic 
Majesty's European dominions. Thirdly ; the bond fide 
manufactures and produce of the respective countries, 
imported into either, to be subject to the same duties 
as are paid by the citizens and subjects of the two 
nations. Fourthly ; a tariff to be established by Convention, within one year after the ratification of the 
treaty, ascertaining the necessary duties to be imposed. Fifthly; masts and timber, annually requisite 
for the navy of Spain, to be bought from the merchants 
of the United States in preference, provided they are 
equal in price and quality. 
</p><p>
There are some other matters, which I forget. In 
consideration of the advantages of this treaty, the 
United States stipulate to forbear, for the term of the 
treaty, the use of the River Mississippi. The boundaries will be (in case of treaty) established, as fixed 
in the definitive treaty of peace between the United 
States and Great Britain. The article of tobacco is 
excepted in the project, being the produce of Spanish 
colonies, and is to continue on the present footing, 
which is favorable. 
</p><p>
Thus have I delineated to you the outlines of the 
proposed plan. Among the many arguments used by 
the advocates for the treaty, I will mention only one, 
which I think ought to be know^n. They say that 
the right of the navigation of the Mississippi is disputed; that the use of that right is now suspended, 
and cannot be possessed but by force or by treaty, 
and that a forbearance of the use, on our part, is a 
confirmation of our right ; the use of which right will 
be in due time possessed, in consequence of the present project, without putting our claim to the issue 
of war, which is always precarious, and for which we 
are totally unprepared. 
</p><p>
Should this matter come before our Assembly, much 
will depend on <a href='/results.php?tla=gem' rel='colleague'>Mr. Mason</a>'s sentiments. So many 
reasons, founded on true policy, will arise in a full 
investigation of this subject, that I cannot but hope that the State of Virginia will consider a treaty with 
Spain, on the principles of the project, essentially 
necessary to her political happiness, and to her commercial aggrandizement. 
</p><p>
The sedition in Massachusetts is, in some degree, 
subsided, but is not, I fear, extinguished. 
</p><p>
Colonel Monroe, who was an Aid in Lord Stirling's 
family, a Delegate from Virginia in Congress, will, in 
a few days, return home with his lady. He means 
to do himself the honor to pay his respects to Mount 
Vernon in his way. My best respects to Mrs. Washington, with, &c., &c.,

</p><p>
You desired to hear from me, now and then, when I left Virginia. I obey your wishes with pleasure, and must assure you that I continue to feel the same 
unabating zeal to administer to your happiness which my public duty formerly commanded from me. I wish that my communications may be always agreeable. I apprehend your solicitude for the honor and 
prosperity of a nation formed under your auspices, 
will illy relish intelligence ominous of its destruction. 
But, so circumstanced is the Federal Government, that 
its death cannot be very far distant, unless immediate and adequate exertions are made by the several 
States. 
</p><p>
The period is hurrying on, when no longer delay 
can be permitted. The late returns from the Continental Receivers, in the different States, prove unanimity in one point among the members of the Union, 
— no money. Congress, impressed with the lamentable effects which await the United States, from their 
adherence to temporary and disunited exertions, again 
have addressed the States. I inclose it. If success 
attends, we may divert the evils which menace our 
existence, and may still enjoy that happiness which 
we so arduously contended for. But, should the same 
supineness continue in our counsels, and jealousy, instead of patriotism, direct the measures of our Governments, consequences most distressing must certainly ensue. Part of the principal of our foreign 
loans is due next year, and no certain means yet devised to pay even the interest. 
</p><p>
Our agents have arrived in Morocco and Algiers, 
and we have some hopes that their negotiations may 
be successful. 
</p><p>
It is very doubtful, how our Commissioners may 
succeed with the Indians. We have too much reason 
to fear a war, which, among other evils, will increase 
our finance embarrassments. People here are very 
inquisitive about the progress of the Potomac navigation. The moment that business wears the prospect 
of certainty, rich emigrants from all the Eastern 
States will flock, to our towns. The Assembly of this 
State are in session, and will emit two hundred thousand pounds in paper. They are violent enemies to 
the impost; and, I fear, even the impending and approaching dangers to the existence of the Union will 
not move them. Please to present my respects to 
Mrs. Washington, and accept the best wishes of

My dear General, 
</p><p>
I had the pleasure of hearing from you last week, 
and have complied with your wishes respecting the 
china. No conveyance at present offers for <a href='/results.php?city=alexandria' rel='city'>Alexandria</a> ; but every day presents one to Norfolk, from 
which place the correspondence up your river is frequent. I intend, unless I should meet with a vessel 
for Potomac, to send the box to Colonel Parker, naval 
officer at Norfolk, and ask his special attention to 
forwarding it to <a href='/results.php?city=alexandria' rel='city'>Alexandria</a> or <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>. At the 
same time, I will send a small box put into my care 
by Mr. Gardoqui. I have had it some time, and 
wanted to know your intention as to the china, that 
the same conveyance might take both. If you have 
an opportunity to convey my Young (as the books 
are useless to you) to Mr. R. H. Lee, you will oblige 
me by doing it. 
</p><p>
The Mississippi business is very important, and 
full of difficulty. In the debilitated condition of the 
Federal Government, it is unwise to wish the offence 
of any part of the empire, unless to attain great 
good. My mind has no doubt of the extensive good 
consequences that would result to the Union from a 
commercial connection with Spain ; and I am also 
clear that, in agreeing to the occlusion of the navigation of the Mississippi, we give in fact nothing; for, 
the moment our western country becomes populous 
and capable, they will seize by force what may have 
been yielded by treaty. Till that period, the river 
cannot be used but by permission of Spain, whose 
exclusive system of policy never will grant such permission. Then, to be sure, we only give what we 
cannot use. But the source of all the evils which 
press these States, is the inefficiency of the Federal 
Government. This cannot he altered and remedied, 
but by consent of the States. Already, in every 
State, the amplification of the powers of the Union 
has too many enemies. Should, therefore, a treaty 
take place between Congress and Spain, occluding 
for a term the navigation of the Mississippi, in return 
for advantages very great, but not so great to the 
whole as to a part, I apprehend it would give such 
a text for popular declaimers, that the great object, 
namely, bracing the Federal Government, may be 
thwarted, and thus, in pursuing a lesser, we lose a 
greater good. 
</p><p>
I forwarded, by the last post, for public information, 
some intelligence lately received from <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel=''>Mr. Jefferson</a> ; 
and I have also sent an extract of a letter from Mr. Kendall, from Algiers. These two papers comprehend 
all the news here. I transmit the Gazette of the day. 
Bills on London, at sixty days' sight, fluctuate in their 
value from six to seven per cent, premium. The cost 
of the china is one hundred and fifty dollars, besides 
the incidental charge of freight to Norfolk, which cannot be much. My best wishes for the health and 
happiness of <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>, in which Mrs. Lee unites.

Most respectfully yours,
