Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the pleasure to write to you a short letter on the od of last month. Monsieur de Lafayette is 
since returned from his political campaign in Auvers-ne, crowned with success. He had to contend with prejudices, and the interests of his order, and 
with the influence of the Queen and Princes (except the Duke of Orleans) ; but he was too able for his 
opponents. He played the orator with as much eclat as ever he acted the soldier, and is at this moment 
as much envied and hated as his heart could wish. He is also much beloved by the nation ; for he stands forward as one of the principal champions for her 
rights. 
</p><p>
The elections are finished throughout this kingdom, 
except in the capital ; and it appears, from the instructions given to the Representatives (called here les CaJiiers) that certain points are universally demanded, 
which, when granted and secured, will render France perfectly free, as to the principles of the Constitution. 
I say the principles, for one generation at least, will he required to render the practice familiar. We have, 
I think, every reason to wish that the patriots may 
be successfuL The generous wish that a free people 
must have to disseminate freedom, the grateful emotion which rejoices in the happiness of a benefactor, 
and a strong personal interest as well in the liberty 
as in the power of this country, all conspire to make 
us far from indifferent spectators. 
</p><p>
I say that we have an interest in the liberty of 
France. The leaders here are our friends. Many of 
them have imbibed their principles in America, and 
all have been fired by our example. Their opponents 
are by no means rejoiced at the success of our revolution, and many of them are disposed to form connections of the strictest kind with Great Britain. 
The commercial treaty emanated from such dispositions; and, according to the usual course of those 
events which are shaped by human wisdom, it will 
probably produce the exact reverse of what was intended by the projectors. The spirit of this nation 
is at present high, and M. Necker is very popular ; 
but if he continues long in the administration, it will 
be somewhat wonderful. His enemies are numerous, 
able, and inveterate. His supporters are indifferent 
as to his fate, and will protect him no longer than 
while he can aid in establishing a Constitution. But, 
when once that great business is accomplished, he will be left to stand on his own ground. The Court 
wish to get rid of him, and unless he shows himself very strong in the States-General, they will gratify their wishes. His ability as a Minister will be much 
contested in that Assembly; but with what success, time only can determine. 
</p><p>
The materials for a revolution in this country are 
very indifferent. Everybody agrees that there is an 
utter prostration of morals ; but this general position 
can never convey to an American mind the degree 
of depravity. It is not by any figure of rhetoric, or 
force of language, that the idea can be communicated. 
A hundred anecdotes, and a hundred thousand examples, are required to show the extreme rottenness 
of every member. There are men and women who are 
greatly and eminently virtuous. I have the pleasure 
to number many in my own acquaintance. But they 
stand forward from a background deeply and darkly 
shaded. It is, however, from such crumbling matter 
that the great edifice of freedom is to be erected 
here. Perhaps, like the stratum of rock, which is 
spread under the whole surface of their country, it 
may harden when exposed to the air; but it seems 
quite as likely that it will fall and crush the builders. 
I own to you that I am not without such apprehensions, for there is one fatal principle which pervades all ranks. It is, a perfect indifference to the 
violation of engagements. Inconstancy is so mingled 
in the blood, marrow, and very essence of this people, that when a man of high rank and importance 
laughs to-day at what he seriously asserted yesterday, 
it is considered as in the natural order of things. 
Consistency is a phenomenon. Judge, then, what 
would be the value of an association, should such a 
thing be proposed, and even adopted. The great 
mass of the common people have no religion but their 
priests, no law but their superiors, no morals but 
their interest. These are the creatures who, led by drunken curates, are now in the high road a la aberte, 
and the first use they make of it is to form insurrections everywhere for the want of bread. We have 
had a little riot here yesterday and the day before, 
and I am told that some men have been killed; but 
the affair was so distant from the quarter in which I 
reside, that I know nothing of the particulars. 
</p><p>
I am almost at the bottom of my paper, without mentioning what I at first intended. Six days ago I got from the maker your watch, with two copper 
keys, and one golden one, and a box containing a spare spring and glasses, all which I have delivered 
to <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='met colleague co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, who takes charge of them for you.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor to write to you on the twenty-ninth of April last. I shall not trouble you with a 
recital of events, which <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='met colleague co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a> has, I know, 
communicated to the office of Foreign Affairs. But 
being now here on my way to London, and finding 
a vessel bound directly to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, I take the opportunity to send some tables, which contain the political, military, pecuniary, and commercial state of 
this country. I believe them to be tolerably authentic as far as they go. 
</p><p>
I will also communicate a matter, which <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='met colleague co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a> was not yet informed of, and which I could not tell him, because I was forbidden to mention it 
to any person here. You know, I dare say, that the Count de Moustier has his con^e. His successor will 
be Colonel Ternant, — at first, in the character of Charge des Affaires, and when M. de Moustier is otherwise placed, it is highly probable that Ternant may 
be made Minister ; but that will depend on the situation of the Court at the time, so that there I only 
state probability. As to the other, you may rely on it, because my intelligence I know to be good. The important trait in this appointment is, that he is named as a person who will be agreeable to us. 
</p><p>
You may rely, also, on what I am about to mention, but which I pray you not to disclose. It is 
known to very few in this country, and may, perhaps, as it ought, he huried in oblivion. The King 
has actually formed the design of going off to Spain. 
Whether the measure set on foot to dissuade him 
will have, as I hope, the desired effect, time only can 
discover. His fears govern him absolutely, and they 
have of late been most strongly excited. He is a 
well-meaning man, but extremely weak ; and probably 
these circumstances will in every event secure him 
from personal injury. An able man would not have 
fallen into his situation ; but I think that no ability 
can now extricate him. He must float along the current of events, being absolutely and entirely a cipher. If, however, he should fly, it would not be 
easy to predict the consequences; for this country is 
at present as near to anarchy as society can approach 
without dissolution. There are some able men in the 
National Assembly; yet the best heads among them 
would not be injured by experience, and unfortunately 
there are great numbers who, with much imagination, have little knowledge, judgment, or reflection. 
You may consider the revolution as complete ; that is 
to say, the authority of the King and of the nobility 
is completely subdued. Yet I tremble for the Constitution. They have all that romantic spirit, and all 
those romantic ideas of government, which, happily 
for America, we were cured of before it was too late. 
They are advancing rapidly. But I must check myself, or my reflections will occupy too much space 
both for you and for me. 
</p><p>
One of the last persons I saw in Paris was M. de Lafayette. He had promised to trust me with a letter for you; but he must be excused, for he is as 
busy as a man can be. Not long since, speaking to 
him on his own subject, I told him some hints I had 
given, tending to make him Governor of the Isle of 
France, which, you know, includes Paris. He declared 
that the command of the military in that city only, 
was the utmost of his wishes ; that he was satiated 
with power ; he had his sovereign, during the late 
procession to Paris, completely within his authority ; 
he had marched him where he pleased ; measured out 
the degree of applause he should receive as he pleased ; and, if he pleased, could have detained him prisoner. All this is strictly true. He commanded on 
that day at least eighty thousand men, who, during 
the King's progress through them to the Hotel de Ville, shouted Vive la Nation, and only on his return cried Vive le Roi. 
</p><p>
I do not know whether vou will he informed of 
the critical situation in which things were placed, 
just before the last Ministry were turned out and 
the old one restored. My authority is very good, 
but yet I will not vouch for the truth. It was resolved to reduce Paris by flimine, to take two hundred of the States-General prisoners, to dissolve that 
Assembly, and to govern in the old-fashioned way. 
All this, you will say, was madness, and therefore improbable. But was it not equally mad to drive away 
Necker, and change the Ministry at the time and in 
the manner, which were chosen for that purpose ? 
The men, weak enough for the one, were certainly 
mad enough for the other. Two German regiments, 
which were to be employed, were regaled by the 
Queen in the Orangerie at Versailles. They received 
promises and largesses, and were prevailed on to 
shout Vive la Reiue, Vive le Comte iV Artois, Vive la 
Diichcsse de Polignac. Afterwards, their music played 
for hours under her Majesty's window. The Mareschal de Broglio endeavoured, at the same time, to 
conciliate the artillery. But it was at length discovered, that, though the troops would shout and sing, 
yet they would not fight against their countrymen. 
All which might have been known long ago. At the 
moment when their intrigue was carrying on by the 
Court, the Gardes dii Corps and Gardes Frangaises 
combined to defend the members of the National Assembly. I pass over those facts, which you cannot 
but know, to mention, in one word, that the whole 
army of France have declared for liberty; and that 
one reason why his Majesty has not taken the steps 
above mentioned, is, that he does not know a single 
regiment that would obey him. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear Sir. I write this letter in much 
hurry, and after much fatigue. Excuse in it everything inaccurate or inelegant, and pardon it, on the 
score of that sincere and affectionate respect, with 
which I am, &c.,

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Yesterday I went to dine with the Count de Montmorin,'-' and expressed to him my wish that France 
might seize the present moment to establish a liberal 
system of commercial policy for her Colonies. I observed, that her interest was deeply at stake, because 
America could always dispose of the Islands, and 
would naturally wish to see them in possession of 
that power, under whose government they would be 
most advantageous to her; that nothing could tend so 
much to make the United States desirous of an alliance with Britain, as to exclude them from a free 
trade AYith the French Colonies ; that, if the metropolis wishes to preserve the affection of her distant 
subjects, and to derive from them the greatest commercial benefit, she ought to suffer them to draw 
their subsistence from that quarter where thej can 
obtain it most cheaply. He assured me, that he was 
fully of my opinion ; said that our position rendered 
it proper to make in our favor an exception from 
their general system respecting other nations, and 
that he hoped, within a fortnight, something might 
be done. But he lamented, as he had done before, 
that they have no Chief Minister, and consequently 
no fixed plan nor principles. I shall see him again 
before I depart, and also Monsieur de la Luzerne, 
within whose department this matter regularly lies. He is an adherent to the exclusive system, which is unfortunate. 
</p><p>
In the National Assembly, also, there is a considerable difficulty. Among the most violent of the 
violent party, are some Representatives of cities on 
the western coasts of this kingdom, where the chief 
commerce is with the Islands; and those who wish 
for the closest union with America, do not wish to 
offend these gentlemen, and therefore are desirous of 
waving the matter at present. For my own [part], I 
am very desirous that the business should be put in 
train, at least. If successful, so much the better; but 
at any rate, it will give an alarm on the other side 
of the Channel. If either of these rival nations sets 
the example, the other will soon follow ; and although 
it is not very clear, that the actings and doings of the 
AssemlUe Nationale in general will long endure, yet 
whatever they grant to us in this particular business, 
those who come after them will be fearful of retracting. Under these impressions, for a long time past, 
I have been endeavouring to smooth the way towards 
our object ; and I believe in the success. I am, &c.,

</p><p>
Dear Sir. 
</p><p>
In another letter of this date, I have mentioned a 
part of yesterday's conversation with the Count de 
Montmorin. That part of it, which I am now to communicate, is for yourself alone. As Monsieur de Lafayette had asked me some days ago, who should be 
sent to replace the Comte de Moustier, and upon 
my answering with great indifference, that it might 
be whom he pleased, had asked my opinion of Colonel Ternant, I told the Count de Montmorin this circumstance ; to which he replied, that he had communicated his intention to Monsieur de Lafayette some 
time since, in consequence of the intimacy which has 
long subsisted between them. I asked him, if he 
would permit me to mention it to you. The idea 
gave him pleasure, and he told me that he should 
consider it as a very great kindness, and particularly 
if through the same channel he could learn whether 
that appointment would be agreeable to you. This 
is, you know, a compliment which the most respectable 
Courts on this side of the Atlantic usually pay to 
each other. It is not without use, and on the present 
occasion is not a mere compliment, because Monsieur de Montmorin is sincerely desirous of cultivating a 
good understanding with the United States. 
</p><p>
It is not impossible that he may retreat from his 
present office ; but he will, I think, in that case be 
appointed Governor to the children of France, and 
his opinions, while about the Court, will have weight, 
for many reasons ; amongst others, because they deserve it. In talking over the deplorable situation to 
which this kingdom is reduced, I told him that I 
saw no means of establishing peace at home, but by 
making war abroad. He replied that he thought with 
me, in part; namely, that an offensive war might be 
useful. But that he thought a defensive war must 
prove ruinous ; that this last seemed the more likely 
to happen; and that in either case the state of the 
finances was alarming. I observed, that ability in that 
department might restore it, even during a war ; that 
nothins: could revive credit without the reestablishment of executive authority; and that nothing could 
effect that reestablishment but a general sense of the 
necessity. Upon this, he lamented the want of a 
Chief Minister, who might embrace the great whole 
of public business. He owns himself unequal to the 
task, and too indolent into the bargain. 
</p><p>
Our friend Lafayette burns with desire to be at the 
head of an army in Flanders, and drive the Stadtholder into a ditch. He acts now a splendid, but 
dangerous part. Unluckily, he has given in to measures, as to the Constitution, which he does not heartily approve, and he heartily approves many things 
which experience will demonstrate to be injurious. 
While all is in confusion here, the revolt of Austrian 
Flanders, and the troubles excited in Poland by the 
agency of Prussia, give every reason to suppose that 
the King of Sweden will be vigorously supported ; 
so that provided the Turk has but a sufficient share 
of obstinacy to bear a little more beating, the scale, 
according to human probabilities, must turn against 
Austria and Prussia, who are the allies of France. 
Great Britain is, as j^et, no otherwise engaged than 
as an eventual party ; and, according to the best 
opinion which my judgment can form, upon the information I have been able to obtain, the Premier of 
that country can, to use the words of Mr. Addison, 
"ride in the whirlwind and direct the storm." A person, however, on whose knowledge I have some reliance, assures me that Mr. Pitt, engrossed by borough 
politics and ignorant of Continental affairs, takes no 
part in them, but wdiat he is absolutely forced into; 
and I am inclined to believe that there is some truth 
in that assertion. Accept I pray the assurances of 
that sincere esteem, with which I am yours, &c.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I arrived in this city on Saturday evening, the 27th of March, and called the next morning on the 
Duke of Leeds, Minister of Foreign Affairs. He was not at home. I therefore wrote to him a note, a copy whereof is inclosed, as also liis answer, received 
that evening. On Monday, the 29th, I waited upon 
him at Whitehall, and, after the usual compliments, 
presented your letter, telling him that it would explain the nature of my business. Having read it, he 
said, with much warmth and gladness in his appearance, " I am very happy, <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague friend met'>Mr. Morris</a>, to see this letter, and under the President's own hand. I assure 
you it is very much my wish to cultivate a friendly 
and commercial intercourse between the two countries; 
and more, I can answer for that of his Majesty's 
servants, that they are of the same opinion." " I am 
happy, my Lord, to find that such sentiments prevail ; 
for we are too near neighbours not to be either 
good friends or dangerous enemies." " You are perfectly right. Sir ; and certainly it is to be desired, as 
well for our mutual interests as for the peace and 
happiness of mankind, that we should be upon the 
best footing." 
</p><p>
I assured him of our sincere disposition to be upon 
good terms, and then proceeded to mention those 
points in the treaty of peace which remained to be 
performed. And first, I observed that, by the Constitution of the United States, which he had certainly 
read, all obstacles to the recovery of British debts 
are removed ; and that if any doubts could have remained, they are now done away by the organization 
of a Federal Court, which has cognizance of causes 
arising under the treaty. He said, he was happy to 
receive this information; that he had been of opinion, 
and had written to <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague'>Mr. Adams</a>, that the articles ought 
to be performed in the order in which they stood in 
the treaty. Not choosing to enter into any discussion of his conduct in relation to <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague'>Mr. Adams</a>, I told 
his Grace that I had one rule or principle for public 
and private life, in conformity to which I had always 
entertained the idea that it would consist most with 
the dignity of the United States, first, to perform all 
their stipulations, and then to require such performance from others ; and that, in effect, if each party 
were on mutual covenants to suspend its compliance, 
expecting that of the other, all treaties would be illusory. He agreed in this sentiment. Upon which I 
added, that the United States had now placed themselves in the situation just mentioned. 
</p><p>
And here I took occasion to observe, that the 
Southern States, which had been much blamed in 
this country for obstructing the recovery of British 
debts, were not liable to all the severity of censure 
which had been thrown upon them ; that, their negroes having been taken or seduced away, and the 
payment for those negroes having been stumlated by 
treaty, they had formed a reliance on such payment 
for the discharge of debts contracted with British 
merchants, both previously and subsequently to the 
war ; that the suspension of this resource had occasioned a deficiency of means, so that their conduct 
had been dictated by an overruling necessity. 
</p><p>
Returning then to the main business, I observed, that as we had now fully performed our part, it was proper to mention that two articles remained to be fulfilled by them, namely, that which related to the 
posts, and that regarding a compensation for the negroes ; unless, indeed, they had sent out orders respecting the former, subsequent to the writing of 
your letter ; and I took the liberty to consider that 
as a very probable circumstance. He now became a little embarrassed, and told me that he could not exactly say how that matter stood. That as to the 
affair of the negroes, he had long wished to have it brought up, and to have something done, but something or other had always interfered. He then changed the conversation ; but I brought it back, and he 
changed it again. Hence it was apparent that he could go no farther than general professions and assurances. 
</p><p>
I then told him that there w^as a little circumstance, which had operated very disagreeably upon 
the feelings of America. Here he interrupted me. 
" I know what you are going to say ; our not sending a Minister. I wished to send you one ; but then 
I wished to have a man every way equal to the task, 
a man of abilities, and one agreeable to the people 
of America. But it w^as difficult. It is a great way 
off, and many object on that score." I expressed my 
persuasion, that this country could not want men well 
qualified for every office ; and he again changed the 
conversation. Wherefore, as it was not worth while 
to discuss the winds and the weather, I observed that 
he might probably choose to consider the matter a 
little, and to read again the treaty, and compare it 
with the American Constitution. He said that he 
should, and wished me to leave your letter, which he 
would have copied, and return it to me. I did so, 
telling him that I should be very glad to have a 
speedy answer; and he promised that I should. 
</p><p>
Thus, Sir, this matter was begun. But nine days 
have since elapsed, and I have heard nothing farther 
from the Duke of Leeds. It is true that Easter holidays have intervened, and that public business is, in 
general, suspended during that period. I shall give 
them sufficient time to show whether they are as well disposed as he has declared, and then give him 
a hint. Before I saw him, I communicated to the French Ambassador, in confidence, that you had directed ihg to call for a performance of the treaty. He 
told me at once that they would not give up the posts. Perhaps he may he right. I thought it host 
to make such communication; because the thing itself cannot remain a secret j an^ by mentioning it to him, we are enabled to say with truth, that, in every 
step relating to the treaty of peace, we have acted confidentially in regard to our ally.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
Herewith I have the honor to transmit a duplicate 
of my last letter, of the 13th of April Not having 
heard from the Duke of Leeds, I wrote him a note 
on the 19th. To this I received no reply; wherefore, 
on the 29th, I addressed him again by a letter, of 
which a copy is inclosed. This was delivered at his 
office, Whitehall, between eleven and twelve in the 
morning of the 29th ; and at half past ten in the 
evening the letters were sent to me. You will observe that his letter is dated the 28th, and of course 
takes no notice of that to which it is in fact the answer; but the style and general complexion, as 
well as the circumstances attending the delivery of it, clearly show that it was not written until the evening of the 29th. 
</p><p>
I might, in reply, have made some strictures upon 
the information that I was in Holland, &c., &c. I 
might also have contrasted the expressions of good 
faith with the conduct of the Administration, and have 
observed upon the idea that the United States were 
bound in the most solemn manner, while, from the 
subsequent parts of his letter, it would seem that 
Great Britain is not bound at all, or at most but 
loosely. There is also a confusion of language, which 
resembles the stammering of one who endeavours to 
excuse a misdeed, which he resolves to commit. Thus, 
on the supposition that completion of the treaty by 
us is impossible, he insists that we shall complete it, 
or make compensation. The expressions in the last 
clause are, if possible, more vague than all the rest. 
and the reply might have been proportionately more 
pointed. 
</p><p>
My letter of yesterday contains nothing of what is 
just stated, although perhaps it ought to have noticed 
some parts. I must rely on your kindness, Sir, both 
to interpret favorably what I have done, and to excuse my omissions. I thought it best to heap coals 
of fire on their heads, and thereby either bring them 
into our views, or put them most eminently in the 
wrong. It was, moreover, my wish to draw forth 
specific propositions, because these will admit of discussion, or else, if manifestly unjust, they may not 
only be repelled, but they will serve to show a predetermined breach of faith by them, which will justify whatever conduct we may afterwards find it proper to adopt. If, as is not improbable, they should 
give us no answer, or one so vague as to mean nothing, I shall pursue, according to circumstances, my 
object of compelling them to speak plainly, or refuse 
absolutely. 
</p><p>
It seems pretty clear, that they wish to evade a 
commercial treaty, but not peremptorily to reject it; 
and, therefore, I have construed into rejection his 
Grace's abstruse language, leaving him the option to 
give it a different interpretation. I do not expect 
that he will, though he may perhaps write an explanatory comment, more unintelligible than the text. 
</p><p>
I have some reason to believe, that the present 
Administration intend to keep the posts and withhold 
payment for the negroes. If so, they will color their 
breach of faith by the best pretexts in their power. 
I incline to think, also, that they consider a treaty 
of commerce with America as being absolutely unnecessary, and that they are persuaded they shall 
derive all the benefit from our trade, without treaty. 
It is true that we might lay them under restrictions 
in our ports; hut they believe that an attempt of 
that sort would be considered by one part of America 
as calculated by the other for private emolument, 
and not for the general good. The merchants here 
look on it as almost impossible for us to do without 
them; and it must be acknowledged that past experience, and the present situation of neighbouring countries, go far to justify that opinion. Whether the 
Ministers shall act according to their own ideas, or 
consult mercantile people, they will equally, I think, 
repel advances from us ; and, therefore, it seems more 
prudent to lay the foundations of future advantage, 
than attempt to grasp at present benefit. I will not 
pretend to suggest any measures for the adoption of 
Congress, whose wisdom and whose sense of national 
honor will certainly lead them to act properly, when 
the proper moment shall present itself It will naturally strike every mind, that while the Legislature of 
this country continues to invest the Executive authority with great power respecting the American commerce, the Administration here will have advantages 
in treaty, which can only be balanced by similar confidence, on the part of Congress, in the Executive of 
America. 
</p><p>
But very much will, I think, depend upon the situation of France. If appearances there should change, 
and so much vigor be infused into the Government 
as would enable it to call forth the national efforts 
in support of their interest and honor, a great revolution would be produced in the opinions here. From 
the conduct of the aristocratic hierarchy in the Low 
Countries, who are instigated and supported by Prussia, I have long been thoroughly convinced that the 
alternative of war, or the most ignominious terms of 
peace, would be proposed to the Imperial Courts. 
Counting upon the absolute nullity of France, and 
supposing that this country can at any moment intimidate that into abject submission, Prussia and Poland will, I think, join themselves to Turkey and 
Sweden against Russia and Austria, which are both 
exhausted, and one of them dismembered. Probably 
the war will be commenced before this letter reaches 
your hands ; and then Britain and Holland are to be 
the umpires, or rather dictators, of peace. 
</p><p>
I have taken the liberty to touch thus far upon 
the general system of European politics, as it may 
tend to show that, for the present. Great Britain will 
rather keep things in suspense with us, being herself 
in a state of suspense as to others. I will not go 
into conjectures about the events which will take 
place upon the Continent. They will, I believe, as 
is usual, disappoint the projectors ; but, be that as it 
may, our affairs can derive no advantages now from 
what shall happen hereafter. I presume that a dissolution of Parliament will take place shortly, although many of the best informed people think, or 
at least say they think, otherwise. But it is clear 
to my mind, that the Administration will wish to 
have before them a prospect of seven years' stability 
to their system, be that what it may; and they will 
not, at the moment of a general election, expose 
themselves to criticism by any act of doubtful construction. This forms with them an additional reason 
for being evasive in regard to us. Perhaps there 
never was a moment in which this country felt herself greater, and consequently it is the most unfavorable moment to obtain advantageous terms from her 
in any bargain. But this appearance is extremely fallacious. Their revenue is not yet equal to their expenditure. Money is indeed poured in upon them from 
all quarters, because of the distracted situation of affairs among their neighbours ; and hence their stocks 
have risen greatly since the peace, so that they can 
borrow at an interest of four per cent. But, supposing they should not be obliged to engage in the war, 
still there are two events, either of which would 
overturn the fabric of their prosperity. If France 
establishes a solid system of finance, then capitalists 
will prefer five per cent, with her to four per cent, 
from Britain ; for, all other things being equal, there 
is no shadow of comparison between the resources of 
the two countries. If France commits a bankruptcy, 
the disorders consequent thereon will doubtless be 
violent; but, the storm once passed, she would be 
able to make greater exertions, by her annual resources, than Britain could compass by every possible anticipation of credit. There is a middle situation, between sinking and swimming, in which the 
French finances may flounder on for some time to 
come, but even this state of wretchedness will produce rather evil than good to Great Britain ; for she 
has already reaped all the harvest which could be 
gathered from the distress of her neighbours, and 
must necessarily lose the benefits of the famous commercial treaty, in proportion as the resources of her customer are cut off. 
</p><p>
Under the various contingencies which present 
themselves to my contemplation, and there are many 
which I will not trouble you with the perusal of, it 
appears clearly, that the favorable moment for us to 
treat is not yet come. It is indeed the moment for 
this country, and they seem determined to let it pass 
away. I must again entreat your indulgence. Sir, for 
this long and desultory letter. Accept, I pray you, the assurances of that respect with which I have the

My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Yours of the 21st of June, is at length safely arrived. Poor Lafayette ! Your letter for him must remain with me some time. His enemies here are as 
virulent as ever, and I can give you no better proof than this. Among the King's papers was found nothing of what his enemies wished and expected, except his correspondence with M. de Lafayette, which 
breathes, from beginning to end, the purest sentiments of freedom. It is therefore kept secret, while he 
stands accused of designs, in conjunction with the dethroned monarch, to enslave his country. 
</p><p>
The foot, respecting this correspondence, is communicated to me by a person to whom it w^as related 
confidentially by one of the parties who examined it. 
You will have seen, in my letters to <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='met colleague co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, a 
proposition made by Mr. Short respecting M. de Lafayette, with my reply. I had very good reason to 
apprehend that our interference, at that time, would have been injurious to him; hut I hope that a moment will soon offer, in which something may be 
done for his relief. In reading my correspondence 
with Mr. Short, you must consider that I wrote to 
the French and Austrian Government, as each would 
take the liberty to read my letters. 
</p><p>
You will have seen, also, that, in my letters to <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='met colleague co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, I hint at the dangers attending a residence 
in this city. Some of the sanguinary events which 
have taken place, and which were partial executions 
of great plans, will point to a natural interpretation 
thereof; but these were not what I contemplated. 
Should we ever meet, I will entertain you with the 
recital of many things which it would be improper 
to commit to paper, at least for the present. You 
will have seen that the King is accused of high 
crimes and misdemeanours ; but I verily believe that 
he wished sincerely for this nation the enjoyment of 
the utmost degree of liberty which their situation 
and circumstances will permit. He wished for a good 
Constitution ; but, unfortunately, he had not the means 
to obtain it, or, if he had, he was thwarted by those 
about him. What may be his Me, God only knows; 
but history informs us, that the passage of dethroned 
monarchs is short from the prison to the grave. 
</p><p>
I have mentioned to <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='met colleague co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, repeatedly, my 
wish to have positive instructions and orders for my 
government. I need not tell you. Sir, how agreeable 
this would be to me, and what a load it would take 
from my mind. At the same time, I am fully sensible 
that it may be inconvenient to give me such orders. 
The United States may wish to temporize, and see 
how things are likely to end ; and in such case, leaving me at large, with the right reserved to avow or 
disavow me according to circumstances and events, is 
for the Government an eligible position. My part in 
the play, is not quite so eligible ; but, although I wish 
the Senate to be sensible of this, I am far from wishing that any precipitate step be taken to relieve me 
from it, for I know how contemptible is every private consideration, when compared with the public 
interests. One step, however, seems natural; namely, 
to say that, before any new letters of credence are 
given, it will be proper to know to whom they are 
to be directed, because the Convention, a mere temporary body, is to be succeeded by some fixed form, 
and it may be a long time before any such form 
will be adopted. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='met colleague co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, from the materials in his possession, 
will be able to give you an accurate account of the 
military events. I discover three capital errors in 
the conduct of the Duke of Brunswick. First, his 
proclamation arrogated rights, which, on no construction, could belong to him or his employers, and contained threats which no circumstances could warrant, 
and which, in no supposable success, could be executed. They tended, however, to unite the nation in 
opposing him, seeing that no hope remained for those 
who had taken any part in the revolution ; and the 
conduct observed towards Monsieur de Lafayette and 
his companions, was a severe comment on the cruelty 
of the rest. Thus, in the same moment, he wounded 
the pride, insulted the feelings, and alarmed the fears 
of all France. And, by his thundering menaces to 
protect the royal family, he plunged them into the 
situation from which he meant to extricate them. 
</p><p>
The second error was, not to dash at Paris the instant he received the news of the affair of the tenth. 
He should then have advanced at all hazards, and if, 
in so doing, he had declared to the several Generals 
and armies, that he expected their assistance to restore their dethroned Prince and violated Constitution, I am persuaded that he would have met with as 
much support as opposition. I learn, within these two 
days, that the Delegates of Lorraine and Alsace had 
so little hope, or rather were so thoroughly persuaded 
that those Provinces would join the enemy, that they 
made unusual haste to come forward, lest they should 
be apprehended. Great activity, in that moment, 
would have done wonders ; but then he was not 
ready. 
</p><p>
The third great error was, that, after waiting so 
long, he came forward at all, this season. By menacing the frontiers with great and increasing force, vast 
numbers of the militia would have been drawn to the 
utmost verge of the French territory. The difficulty 
of subsisting them there would have been extreme. 
By taking strong and good positions, his troops would 
have been preserved in full vigor, and the French, 
wasted by disease, tired of inaction, and stimulated 
by their natural impatience and impetuosity of temper, would have forced their Generals to attack, even 
if they had the prudence to be quiet. The consequence of such attack, excepting always the will of 
God, must have been a complete victory on his part, 
and then it would have been next to impossible for 
them to escape. Then the towns would have surrendered, believing the business to be over, and he might 
have come as far forward this autumn as the needful 
transportation of stores would permit. Next spring 
France would have found it almost impossible to subsist the armies needful for the defence in that part 
of the country which is most defensible, and, of consequence, her enemy would have reached the point 
from which lie lately retreated, without the smallest difficulty. 
</p><p>
The appearances are so vague and contradictory, 
that I cannot pretend to tell you whether the alliance will or will not be preserved for the next campaign. If I were to hazard conjectures on the present state of things, it might cast suspicions where I 
have not sufficient ground, and therefore I will bury 
them in my own bosom, lest accident should put this 
letter into improper hands. France has a strong ally 
in the feelings of those nations who are subject to 
despotism ; but, for that very reason, she has a mortal 
enemy in every Prince. If, as is very possible, the 
league should hold firm till next spring, it will then 
have gained considerable auxiliaries, and I am very 
much mistaken if this nation will make as great efforts as those she is now making. The character of 
nations must be taken into consideration in all political questions, and that of France has ever been an 
enthusiastic inconstancy. They soon get tired of a 
thing. They adopt without examination, and reject 
without sufficient cause. They are now agog with 
their republic, and may perhaps adopt some form of 
Government with a huzza ; but that they will adopt 
a good form, or, having adopted, adhere to it, is what 
I do not believe. There is a great body of Royalists 
in the country, who do not now declare themselves, 
because it would be certain death ; but a favorable 
occasion would bring them out of their holes. 
</p><p>
The Mictions here are violent, and among those who 
administer the Government there is not, I am told, 
that degree of character which lays hold of the esteem and respect of mankind, but rather the contrary. 
In their opponents, there is a nervous temper, which 
sticks at nothing; and, if I see rightly, there is in 
the current of their affairs, a strong eddy or counter 
tide, which may change materially both men and tidings. Yet let what will happen, I think it hardly 
possible that they should blunder as much as the 
emigrants ; and I am prone to believe that, in war 
and politics, the folly of our adversaries constitutes 
our greatest force. The future prospect, therefore, is 
involved in mist and darkness. 
</p><p>
There is but one sovereign in Europe, the Empress 
of Russia, who is not, in the scale of talents, considerably below par. The Emperor, who, it is said, is consumptive and cannot live long, is now much influenced 
by Manfredi, a statesman of the Italian school, who 
takes insincerity for wisdom. The Prussian Cabinet 
is far from strong. Leuchesini, an able man, is said 
to be rising in influence there ; but there is such a 
mixture of lust and folly in the Chief, that no one 
man can keep things steady. The alliance with Vienna is disagreeable to the Prussians, and particularly 
to the inhabitants of Berlin, which may have some 
influence in destroying it ; and his Majesty has given 
three strong proofs, since his accession, that he is by 
no means nice on the subject of public faith. The 
invasion of Brabant will, I am persuaded, alarm both 
Britain and Holland; but whether they wUl confine 
themselves to court intrigue, or come into the field, 
is doubtful. 
</p><p>
Thus you will perceive, Sir, that nothing can be 
predicted, with tolerable certainty, respecting the affairs of this country, either internal or external, at 
the present moment. I am, &c.,

My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received yours of the 20th of October, 
which was very long on its way. You will find that events have blackened more and more in this country. The present prospects are dreadful. It is not 
so much, perhaps, the external force, great as that may be ; for there are always means of defence in so vast a nation. The exhausted state of resources might 
also be borne with, if not remedied. But the disorganized state of the Government appears to be irremediable. The venality is such, that if there be no 
traitors, it is because the enemy have not common 
sense. Without the aid of venality, there are not 
a few who, from mistaken zeal, and from ignorance, 
contribute to the success of those powers who are 
leagued against France. Many, also, under the garb 
of patriotism, conceal their attachment to the former 
Government. In short, the fabric of the present system is erected on a quagmire. The new Constitution 
has not yet made its appearance, but it is easy to 
conjecture what it will not be. In the mean time I 
learn, that the Ministers of War and Marine declare 
it impossible for them to go on. How all this will 
end, God only knows ; but I fear it will end badly. 
</p><p>
I will not speak of my own situation; you will 
judge that it is far from pleasant. I could be popular, but that would be wrong. The different parties 
pass away like the shadows in a magic lantern, and 
to be well with any one of them, would, in a short 
period, become the cause of unquenchable hatred with 
the others. 
Happy, happy America ; governed by reason, by 
law, by the man whom she loves, whom she almost 
adores ! It is the pride of my life to consider that 
man as my friend, and I hope long to be honored 
with that title. God bless you, my dear Sir, and 
keep and preserve you ! Your cool and steady temper 
is now of infinite consequence to our country. As 
soon as I can see the way open to any thing decisive, 
I shall inform you of it. At present I weary myself 
with unavailing reflection, meditation, and conjecture. 
A partition seems the most probable event at present. 
Adieu.

My DEAR Sir, 
</p><p>
I have just received yours of the 25th of March. Not having had time to read the gazettes, which are 
but just (and hut in part) arrived, I cannot from them derive the information you allude to; but my 
first glance at them shows what I am sorry to see ; and from thence I am induced to quote a sound maxim from an excellent book; — "A house divided against itself cannot stand." 
</p><p>
As to your re-acceptance, Sir, you know my sentiments, which, on that, as on some other subjects, are, 
I think, unchangeable. It will be time enough for you to have a successor, when it shall please God to 
call you from this world's theatre. If such successor is then able to fill the President's chair, it will be 
matter of surprise to those who can form a competent idea of the office ; but, during your life, I consider the thing as utterly impossible. And do not 
imagine, my dear Sir, that you can retire, though you may resign. You will, in such case, become the 
man of the opposition. However your good sense may differ from their madness, and your virtue from their 
villany, depend on it, they will cite you as being of their sentiment. If you are silent, you assent ; and 
if you speak, you are committed. In the mean time, your poor successor is obliged to struggle under all 
the weight of your reputation, as well as that of the office. And he must be a strong man, who can carry 
either; of course, a very rash man, who would attempt to take up both. 
</p><p>
I am very happy to find, that the determination 
to maintain a strict neutrality is so common in America. I shall not dwell on that topic, because my 
several letters to <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='met colleague co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a> contain enough of it 
to weary your patience. By the by, I am mortified 
more than I can tell you, at the delay my letters 
experience in their passage. I task my mind, to its 
utmost bent, to discover those events which are most 
likely to happen, in order that (so far at least as my 
judgment can be relied on) you may be duly prepared ; and, after all, you hear of the event before 
my almanac comes out. This is provoking, and would 
be much more so, did I not find, from experience, 
that the things I wish are done as well, and perhaps 
better, than if my conjectures had reached you. 
</p><p>
I trust that, long ere this, you will have received 
what I had the honor to write on the 28th of December, 5th and 10th of January, and 14th of February. 
You will have seen that, in the end of last month and 
beginning of this, the long-expected insurrection took 
place, by which a new set of men are brought into 
power. Should the present society be able to establish themselves, I think M. Genet will have a successor ; and if, the revolution completed, things return 
to the point from whence they started, I am sure M. 
Genet will have a successor. As to those who rule, or rather the few by whom they are directed, you may depend that they have just ideas of the value 
of popular opinion. They are not, however, in a condition to act according to knowledge; and, should 
they be able to reach a harbour, there will be quite 
as much of good luck as of good management in it. 
At any rate, a part of the crew will be thrown overboard. It is my opinion that the members of the 
Convention lately arrested will do nothing, for the 
greater part of them have only parole energy; and 
if I were called on by any cogent motive to act, it 
should be in conformity to that idea. In my letter 
to <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='met colleague co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, of this day, I tell him that I shall implicitly obey his orders ; but this is in reply to the broad hint, that my embarrassments may have 
arisen from inattention to the principles of free government. You may rely, Sir, that I shall be cautious to commit the United States as little as possible to future contingencies. In my last letter I 
gave you my idea of pojoulariti/. 
</p><p>
I have never thought that three parties could conveniently exist in any one country; and therefore it 
seems to me that one of those, into which they who 
call themselves democrats are divided, must join the 
royalists. I do not inquire what negotiations are 
carried on to that effect ; for I have no desire to 
meddle with such affairs, directly or indirectly, and 
should be very sorry to have the appearance of siding with any one party or faction whatever, being 
convinced that I can best do the business of the 
United States by keeping aloof from them all. 
</p><p>
Those who command the royal or Christian army, 
as they call themselves, on the Loire, are good officers. Their enemies have, in my mind, passed the 
highest eulogium on them, in saying that the soldiers 
are brought to such a pitch of folly and madness, as 
to rush on, armed only with clubs, and possess themselves of the artillery, to whose fire they were exposed. As far as I have been able to learn, they profess themselves the friends of order and justice, and 
act conformably to such professions, protecting both 
persons and property wherever they arrive, and paying for whatever they take. Hence it happens, that 
their dominion is constantly extending itself; and if 
they should get possession of Nantes, which seems to 
be their present object, they will be truly formidable, 
because then, by means of the Loire, a passage will 
be opened into the heart of the kingdom for as 
many troops as foreign powers may choose to send 
thither ; or, if they should prefer fighting the battle 
with Frenchmen, they need only furnish money and 
warlike stores, and they would have as many men 
as they please, and the most fertile part of France 
to subsist in. 
</p><p>
Farewell, my dear Sir. May God bless and keep 
you, not merely for your sake, and still less for that 
of your friends, but for the general good of our 
country !

My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had hopes, until last evening, that the persons, 
who are to go out as Commissioners from hence, 
would have embarked with Captain Culver; but circumstances have delayed the appointment. The plan 
which was in agitation, and which will probably be 
carried into effect, is to send over three or four Commissioners, one of whom will be charged with Letters 
of Credence, but instructed to conform to the directions of the Board. It is probable that the new Minister, immediately on being presented, will ask you 
to aid in securing the person and papers of the old 
one. My public despatch of this day contains a remote hint to lead the investigation of the Secretary 
of State. I did not choose to be more particular, because you can both give and take the informations 
you think proper. 
</p><p>
I have favored, or rather excited the idea of this 
procedure, for the following reasons. First, such a 
public act will place in a contemptible light the faction connected with M. Genet. Secondly, the seizure 
of his papers, by exposing his connections with prime 
movers, will give a lesson to others. And thirdly, the 
Commissioners who exercise this high-handed authority will, on reflection, feel the necessity of respecting 
your Government, lest they should meet a similar 
fate. Having alarmed their apprehensions, as to the 
effect which M. Genet's imprudence might produce, 
and knowing the public and private views of the parties, I have insinuated the advantage which might result from an early declaration on the part of the new 
Minister, that, as France has announced her determination not to meddle with the interior affairs of other 
nations, so he can know only the Government of America. In unison with this idea, I told the Minister 
that I had observed an overruling influence in their 
affairs, which seemed to come from the other side of 
the Channel, and at the same time had traced the 
intention to excite a seditious spirit in America ; 
that it was impossible to be on a friendly footing 
with such persons ; but that at present a different 
spirit seemed to prevail. This declaration produced 
the effect I intended. The Minister has himself the 
wish to go out to America as Plenipotentiary, and 
M. Otto, his principal Secretary, having the same 
wish, they will, I believe, endeavour, while they stay, 
to put things in good train here. 
</p><p>
It may be an important judicial question, how far 
the Minister is protected by the law of nations, after 
the arrival of his successor. In my opinion, the same 
principles, which exempt him from the municipal law, 
subject him to the will of his sovereign, and, of 
course, the aid given to the new Minister is not an 
act of the judiciary but of the Executive^ performed as 
an ally and friend, and is merely discretionary. I find 
that this Commission will endeavour to get hold of 
the debt from America to France by anticipation. If 
no other reasons militated against the advance, the 
advantage of a pledge to satisfy damages which our 
citizens may sustain during the present violence, is 
considerable, and will not, I presume, be overlooked. 
</p><p>
I am, &c.,
