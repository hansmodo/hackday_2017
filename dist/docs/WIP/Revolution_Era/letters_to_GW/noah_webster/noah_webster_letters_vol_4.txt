Sir, 
</p><p>
If the request I am now to make should need any apology hut such as will naturally be suggested by its own importance, I am sure it will find it in your candor. 
</p><p>
The favorable reception of my grammatical publication in the Northern States, has induced me to offer them for sale in the Southern ; and I am happy to 
find they meet the approbation of those literary gentlemen with whom I have conversed on my tour to 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>. The performance may possibly appear, 
at first thought, trifling ; and yet, as containing the 
rudiments of our native language, the foundation of our other scientific improvements, it doubtless ought 
to be considered as extremely important. If you. Sir, view it in the latter point of light, and have 
taken the trouble to examine the general plan and execution, your name, as a patron of the Institute, 
would be very influential in introducing it to notice in these States. 
</p><p>
I should be very unhappy to make any request, a compliance with which would require the least sacrifice from so distinguished a character ; but if it can 
be done, consistently with the sentiments of your heart and the delicacy of your feelings, the addition 
of your name, Sir, to the catalogue of patrons, will, I vainly hope, be a continuation of your public utility, and will certainly be esteemed a singular favor 
conferred on one who is anxious to improve the literature and advance the prosperity of this country. 
I have the honor to be, &c., &c., 
</p><p>
