Dear General, 
</p><p>
I take the liberty to inclose the copy of a letter 
I have received from Colonel Bowman, and copies of 
three several letters from the Reverend Mr. Zeisberger. The accounts contained in them are somewhat 
alarming ; but I hope that my messages to the different Indian nations will prevent the British from 
carrying their expedition into execution. 
</p><p>
Captain-Lieutenant Brady is just returned from 
Sandusky. He took two squaws prisoners, within a 
mile of their principal town. One of them made her 
escape after six days march ; the other he brought to 
Cuscusky, where he met seven warriors, who had 
taken a woman and child from Chartier's Creek. He 
fired upon the Captain of the party and killed him, 
and has brought in the white woman and the Indian's scalp; but the squaw made her escape at the 
same time. When Captain Brady fired upon the Indian party, he had but three white men, and only 
two rounds of powder left. He was without provisions for six days, but has brought his whole party 
safe to this place. His perseverance, zeal, and good 
conduct, certainly entitle him to promotion; and I 
beg leave to recommend him to your Excellency's 
notice. 
</p><p>
I have provisions, at the dependent posts, for four 
weeks to come ; and, by collecting all the cattle in 
the possession of the Commissaries, this garrison may 
be subsisted for the same term. But what I shall 
do for further supplies, I cannot devise, unless I send 
out foraging parties, and impress cattle; for the public has neither money nor credit here. 
</p><p>
The artillery is arrived, and the military stores are 
safely lodged. The company consists of three officers, 
and twenty-five non-commissioned officers and privates. I have not had the honor of a line from your 
Excellency since that of the 14th of March; but I 
hope one may be on the road for me, before this 
reaches head-quarters. Captain McIntyre will set out, 
a few days hence, towards the Indian country, with 
a small party of men, to take some prisoners or 
scalps. With the most sincere respect and esteem, I 
have the honor to he, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most ohedient, and most humble servant,

Dear General, 
</p><p>
The Lieutenant of Monongalia county informs me, 
that ten men were killed on Friday last, above the 
forks of Cheat. They were quite off their guard 
when the Indians attacked them, and made no resistance. The troops are suffering for want of bread, 
the waters being too low to grind the grain; and I 
am informed that the pack-horse men have left the 
service for want of pay, &c. 
</p><p>
I take the liberty to inclose the proceedings of the 
General Court-Martial on the trials of Captain Thomas Beall, Peter Davis, and David Gamble, and shall 
be happy to receive your directions respecting them. 
The General Court-Martial has addressed a letter to 
your Excellency, which is inclosed with the proceedings. I have lately received two letters from the 
Delaware towns, copies of which I likewise take the 
liberty to inclose. It appears by the contents, that 
the Delawares and the Wyandots, and their numerous allies, might be speedily involved in a war 
against each other, provided we were possessed of 
the means to reward the Delawares for bringing in 
Wyandot scalps and prisoners. 
</p><p>
The forts, in the new countiy, were taken by about 
two hundred white men and seven hundred Indians. 
Encouraged by their success, it is highly probable 
they will attempt carrying these garrisons, which, in 
their present circumstances, to superior numbers must 
inevitably fall a prey, unless timely supplies can be 
obtained. But the best exertions in my power shall 
not be wanting to prevent so fatal an event. I have 
the honor to be, with the utmost respect and esteem. 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,

Dear General, 
</p><p>
By Captain Duplantier, who is just arrived from 
the Delaware toAvns, I am informed that the British 
at Detroit treat the French inhabitants with great 
severity, and that they wish for nothing more than 
the approach of a body of troops from this place. 
The Captain adds, that Colonel Clark, with a body of 
about one thousand men, has actually destroyed the 
Shawanese town at Chellacoffy, and was in pursuit 
of the Indians when the runner, who brought the 
account, came from thence. 
</p><p>
I have just received a letter from the Reverend 
Mr. Heckewelder, and another from Captain John Killbuck, copies of which I take the liberty to inclose. Had I provisions, I should be happy to march 
against some of the hostile Indian towns. But, unfortunately, I have not more than a day's allowance 
of bread, and a very little beef, and I cannot yet see 
a fair prospect of obtaining adequate supplies until money can be furnished to pay for them. With the 
most exalted respect and esteem, &c. &c.,

Dear General, 
</p><p>
Yesterday, the Indians killed two men, of the frontier inhabitants, on Robeson's Run, in this county 
(Yougliiogania), and fired at two soldiers who were 
taking some stores in a canoe from hence to Fort 
Henry. One of them is wounded, but neither of 
them fell into the hands of the enemy. I would have 
sent a party to pursue the Indians, but I have no 
provisions left, nor do I see any prospect of an adequate supply, as the drought still continues, and we 
have neither money nor credit to make purchases. 
</p><p>
Colonel Clark has lately destroyed two of the Shawanese towns, and Idlled six men and one woman, 
and is returned to the Falls. If a sufficient quantity 
of provisions can be obtained, I will yet visit the 
Wyandots by the 1st of November; and I believe 
the country will be unanimous in joining me upon 
an expedition. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c. &c., 
</p><p>

</p><p>
Dear General, 
</p><p>
I am honored with your favor of the 4th of July, 
and cannot avoid feeling most sensibly the neglect 
or want of resources, to enable your Excellency, and 
those who have the honor of commanding under you, 
to act offensively against the enemy. I am happy, 
however, to find that our good allies afford us aid, 
and have a happy presage that, with the smiles of 
divine <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, your Excellency will be enabled 
to drive the enemy out of our country. 
</p><p>
The French inhabitants at Detroit are much in our 
interest, and wish most heartily to see an American 
force approaching. I really believe that twelve hundred well-appointed men would carry that place without great difficulty, and I wish for nothing more, 
when circumstances will admit, than the honor of 
making the attempt. The whole garrison, with sergeants to lead them, came to my quarters, a few 
days ago, to represent that they had not received 
any bread for five days together. Their conduct was 
civil and respectful, and, upon being told that every 
possible exertion was making to prevent their further 
suffering, they retired in good order to their quarters. 
</p><p>
I make use of every fair method, and sometimes a little compulsion, to obtain a temporary supply. But, 
with my best endeavours, I am very apprehensive Tve shall be great sufferers before your requisitions 
are complied with. Both Gamble and Davis, who 
were under sentence of death, and who well deserved 
their fate, have been suffered to make their escape 
out of the guard-house, although they were ironed 
on hands and feet. I ordered the officers, who commanded the guards, under arrest for neglect of duty. 
One of them is tried and acquitted; the other remains to be tried. Colonel Gibson was appointed 
President of the General Court-Martial, ordered by 
your Excellency, and the same court remains until 
it is your pleasure to dissolve it. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=dab" rel="me">Daniel Brodhead</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. I have taken the liberty to inclose an extract from a letter I lately received from the Reverend Mr. Ileckewelder. Two Indians, who were sent 
from the Moravian towns, with messages to Sandusky, 
report that almost all the Wyandot party, consisting 
of thirty old warriors, were killed and wounded by 
the party sent to attack them.

</p><p>
Dear General, 
</p><p>
I have this moment received intelligence, that the 
enemy from Detroit intend paying a visit to this frontier. Major Lanctot has wrote me in French, and 
I take the liberty to inclose a copy of the translation. The Delaware runners add, that a party of 
twenty Indian warriors have been discovered, about 
six days ago, marching towards these settlements, 
and that a large party of Senecas may soon be expected down the Alleghany River. 
</p><p>
Last week seven persons were killed and taken by 
the savages, in an interior settlement on Ten Mile 
Creek. As no supply of goods has yet been sent 
for the Delaware Indians, agreeably to treaty, I conceive they will be compelled to make terms with the 
British, or perish; and next spring we shall have a 
general Indian war. 
</p><p>
If I had a sufficient number of men, and a supply 
of provisions, I should be happy to meet the enemy, 
before they reach the posts or settlements ; but I see 
no method, but force, to obtain it, and the mills cannot grind for want of water. 
</p><p>
Should this intelligence prove true (and I have no 
reason to doubt it), I will do all I can to oppose the 
designs of the enemy; but my regular force is very 
small, and the inhabitants will be in the greatest 
dread imaginable. Indeed, I expect they think more 
of flight than resistance. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=dab" rel="me">Daniel Brodhead</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. The Delaware messengers say, that Captain 
McIntyre's party killed eighteen or nineteen of the 
Wyandots that were crossing the Ohio, as mentioned 
in a former letter.

</p><p>
Dear General, 
</p><p>
I am honored with your favor of the loth of October, and should have appointed the time and place 
for the immediate execution of Gamble, but both he 
and Davis had effected their escape, as I informed 
your Excellency in a former letter. The officers, who 
commanded the guards at the times they respectively 
escaped, were arrested, tried, and acquitted ; and, 
therefore, I thought it unnecessary to trouble you 
with the proceedings respecting them. 
</p><p>
I was applied to, to endeavour to intercede with 
your Excellency, to remit the sentence of Captain Beal ; but I thought it too just, to say any thing about it. The proceedings respecting Gosset were 
packed up, in a mistake. The Court-Martial sententenced him to be whipped; and, as your Excellency had authorized me to determine upon all proceedings which did not affect life, or the dismission 
of an officer, I did not intend to have troubled you 
with the proceedings respecting him. 
</p><p>
I have, for a long time past, had two parties in 
the country, commanded by Field-Officers, to impress cattle, and yet the troops are frequently without meat for several days together. Indeed, I am so 
well convinced that there is not half meat enough 
on this side the mountain for the supply of the 
troops, that I have thought it advisable to risk the 
sending a party of hunters to kill buffalo, at Little Kanhawa, and laying the meat, until we shall be able 
to send for it, which, I expect, will be in the spring. 
</p><p>
The Delaware Chiefs have declared war against the 
Senecas; and Captain John Montour was immediately 
sent, with two Delawares and one white man, to 
bring a prisoner from their towns. At French Creek 
(Venango) he fell in with a party of eight Senecas, 
who, a few days before, had taken a woman and two 
children from Westmoreland county. He shot one of 
the Indians upon a raft in the creek, and the rest 
ran away; but, after a few minutes, one of them returned, under cover of some timber, and asked Montour who he was. He told them that he and his men 
were Delawares ; that they were sent by their Chiefs ; 
and that they might thank God the water prevented 
getting at them ; when the Seneca expressed some 
mark of contempt, and followed his own party. This 
relation may be depended on. Captain Montour, with 
a party of Delawares, is now in pursuit of another 
party of Indians, supposed to be Delawares, or Muncies, who were discovered by a Delaware runner, on 
their way towards these settlements. 
</p><p>
I do all in my power to encourage partisan strokes. 
But, was I at liberty to give rewards, I have neither 
money nor goods to do it with. I can venture to 
say that I could, at any time, for a small quantity 
of goods, engage a very considerable number of Delaware Indians to go with me upon an expedition ; 
and I believe that a considerable quantity would 
enable me to set the Indians at war against one 
another, so as to divert them from our frontiers. 
</p><p>
Many of the inhabitants are uneasy to see any notice taken of the Delaware Indians, and once attempted to destroy a great number of them, who were 
under our protection, but were prevented by a guard 
of regular troops. I have hitherto made use of every 
address in my power to keep as many of them from 
joining the enemy as it was possible for me to do, 
in obedience to your Excellency's instructions ; and I 
shall be very thankful for your further commands 
respecting them. 
</p><p>
I am sensible that there are a great number of 
disaffected inhabitants on this side the mountain, that 
wish for nothing more than a fair opportunity to 
submit to the British Government, and, therefore, 
would be glad to have the regular troops withdrawn. 
</p><p>
I have received the General Orders respecting the new arrangement of the army, and shall remit the 
arrangement of my regiment to <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague'>General Wayne</a> by 
this conveyance. I am a stranger to the intention of most of my brother officers; but, for my part, I am 
inclined to assist, to the end, in a work so nobly begun. I beg leave to return your Excellency my warmest thanks for your continual care of the troops which I have the honor to command. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=dab" rel="me">Daniel Brodhead</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. A half Indian, of the name of Bawhee, 
brought me a draft of the works at Detroit, which 
I take the liberty to inclose. He dropped some 
hints of his being in British pay, and I confined him 
in irons, but know not how to punish him without 
bringing more trouble upon the inhabitants.

Dear General, 
</p><p>
I am honored with your letters of the 29th December and 10th of January last. That of the 10th 
came to hand on the 20th instant, and the other on 
the day following. As it is my duty, so it is my 
highest pleasure, to execute every instruction I receive from your Excellency, to the utmost of my 
capacity. Captain Heth having retired to his farm, 
I cannot at this time send his rank, but have inclosed the rank of the Maryland officers ; and will forward that of the other officers by the next conveyance. 
</p><p>
The Indians have lately killed one man upon Ten Mile Creek, and the inhabitants are in great consternation. The frontier settlements will doubtless be 
deserted, as I have not troops to protect them. I 
shall be happy if the proposed expedition, under Colonel Clark, answers your Excellency's expectations. 
Nothing in my power shall be wanting to forward his 
operations. In my last, I begged leave of absence 
until I could do myself the honor to wait upon your 
Excellency. And as my force will now be much reduced, I take the liberty to renew my application. 
With the most perfect respect, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=dab" rel="me">Daniel Brodhead</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. I shall be glad to know if it be your Excellency's pleasure to have a garrison continued at 
Fort Mcintosh.

Dear General, 
</p><p>
I am honored with your favor of the 28th ultimo, 
and am thankful for the contents. I have acknowledged the receipt of your letter of the 29th of December, and shall give every encouragement to General Clark's intended enterprise. I wish he may be 
in readiness before the waters fail, and the Kentucky 
settlements are destroyed by the enemy. But I am 
informed that little or nothing hath as yet been done 
at his boat-yards, and that the militia he expected 
from this side of the mountain are availing themselves of the unsettled jurisdiction. 
</p><p>
Since my last, a small paper was brought to me 
by some faithful Indians, who found it rolled up very 
neatly in a powder-horn, which a disaffected person 
had lost near the waters of the Sandusky. I take 
the liberty to inclose a copy of it. I have discovered the writer, and put him in irons; but as, too probably, some of the garrison are concerned, he may 
escape before he meets the reward of his demerit. 
Indeed, this place is infested with such a set of disaffected inhabitants, that I have been under the necessity of ordering some away, and others must soon 
follow, to prevent greater injury to the service. 
</p><p>
A number of Delaware Indians, from Coochocking, 
have been here since my last, and appear to be as 
friendly as ever. I am persuaded that a few are 
well affected ; but they are now put to the trial, by 
being ordered to remove hither without loss of time, 
and remain under our protection, where their daily 
transactions will be seen and known. 
</p><p>
I have called upon the county Lieutenants for a 
few of the militia ; and if I am not disappointed as 
usual, I intend to surprise the Indian towns about 
Coochocking. Two Delaware Indians, who, in their 
cups, spoke contemptuously of our service, I have 
confined in irons ; but I am at a loss what farther to 
do with them, until I see what number joins us, and 
hear what their general conduct has been. Immediately after the termination of the intended excursion, 
I will avail myself of your indulgence to represent 
the state of things in this district. I have the honor 
to be, with the most perfect respect and esteem, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=dab" rel="me">Daniel Brodhead</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. By the arrangement, it appears that Captain Brady is arranged in the third Pennsylvania regiment ; but, as he cannot be more useful than he is 
in this part of the country, I hope he will be permitted to remain until the campaign is closed.

Dear General, 
</p><p>
Since my last, one man was killed by the Indians 
near the mouth of Cross Creek. I suppose this hath 
been done by some of the enemy's spies. The country has taken the alarm, and several hundred men 
are now in arms upon the frontier. I hope to be 
able to repel the enemy. The Maryland corps was 
stationed at a post on the frontier of Westmoreland 
county, and have in a body deserted and crossed the 
mountains. Indeed, I am apprehensive the other 
corps will soon follow their example, if their sufferings are not speedily attended to. 
</p><p>
I have sent spies up the Alleghany, with orders to 
proceed to Presque Isle, and further, if it is practicable, to discover the enemy, should they actually 
be on that route, and, if possible, to bring me a 
prisoner. Things here are in the utmost confusion ; 
some officers confessing me to be the Commanding 
Officer, and others. Colonel Gibson ; nor is it likely 
they will alter until your Excellency's pleasure is 
expressed, I have the honor to be, with the most 
sincere attachment and respect.

Dear General, 
</p><p>
A few days ago I received intelligence, that a party, consisting of thirty odd Wyandot Indians, had 
crossed the Ohio River, five miles below Fort Mcintosh, and had hid thirteen small bark canoes upon 
our shore. I immediately ordered out two parties of 
militia, to go in search of them, and cover the harvesters. At the same time I detached Captain McIntyre, to form an ambuscade opposite to the enemy's 
craft. Five men, who were reaping in a field, discovered the Indians, and, presuming their party was 
small, went out to attack them; but four of them 
were immediately killed, and the other taken, before 
the militia could be collected. But Captain McIntyre 
attacked them in their craft, and many of them 
were doubtless killed and wounded. Two canoes 
were sunk, and the prisoner retaken; but the water 
was too deep for our party to ascertain the number of killed. The Indians left all their craft, and in 
them two guns, six blankets, eleven tomahawks, 
eleven paint-bags, eight ear-wheels, a large brass kettle, and many other articles. The Indians informed 
the prisoner that fifteen Wyandots had marched towards Hannah's Town. 
</p><p>
Upon receiving this information, I immediately detached another party up the Alleghany River, with 
two Delaware Indians, to take their tracks, and make 
pursuit ; but, as this party is not yet returned, I cannot inform you of its success. It is with great concern I inform your Excellency, that there does not 
remain, in our magazines, provision to subsist the 
troops more than eight days, at full rations ; nor can 
I conceive how supplies can be procured in time to 
prevent their experiencing great want. I have proposed a fair plan to encourage the inhabitants to sell 
us provision, upon the credit of the United States, 
but have no great certainty of success. I have submitted the plan to the Honorable Board of War, and 
hope it will meet with approbation. 
</p><p>
Should I be fortunate enough to obtain supplies in 
time, I intend to penetrate the Wyandot country, 
this fall, and distress them and their allies by every 
possible exertion; and I expect Colonel Clark, as he 
is reenforced, will pay the Shawanese a visit about 
the same time. I should be exceeding happy to wait 
upon your Excellency, at the close of the campaign, 
but I am grown so poor that I cannot bear the expense of so long a journey, at the present extravagant rates. I have the honor to be, with the most 
exalted respect and esteem, your Excellency's 
Most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=dab" rel="me">Daniel Brodhead</a>.
</p><p>
July Tld. The party of fifteen Indians, mentioned 
above, crossed the Ohio River at Crow's Island, four 
miles above Fort Mcintosh, killed and scalped one 
man, and returned. A party from hence, and another 
from Fort Mcintosh, are in pursuit of them. A party 
of men, just arrived from Wheeling, found two of the 
Wyandot Indians, who were killed by Captain McIntyre's party, floating upon the water, and have brought 
in their scalps.

Your favor of the 14th of August I had the honor 
to receive on the 7th instant, and am very thankful 
for the contents. You must, ere now, be convinced 
that Colonel Bowman's apprehensions were founded on 
certain intelligence, of an expedition intended against 
the forts on Kentucky. I have sent out parties to 
take cattle and grain from the inhabitants, and expect 
to obtain a considerable supply of flour, as the mills 
begin to have water sufficient to manufacture it; but 
the inhabitants disappoint us of getting beef, by driving their cattle into the mountains. And we have, at 
present, neither bread nor meat, but expect a small 
supply immediately. Captain Brady is on command. 
and Captain McIntyre has leave of absence to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> ; as soon as they return, I will express your 
Excellency's thanks for their conduct. 
</p><p>
In full confidence that a sufficient supply of provision would, sooner or later, be furnished for the 
troops in this district, as well as for such number of 
militia as policy or the exigencies of aftairs might 
render it necessary to call into action, T, with a view 
to cut off the Wyandots and other Indian towns that 
were very troublesome to our settlements, called fur 
a draft from the militia, at three different times, and 
was as often disappointed in obtaining provisions ; 
which, with the unsettled state of the boundary line 
between Pennsylvania and Virginia, has greatly discouraged the inhabitants, and, I apprehend, given a 
handle to the disaffected. I take the libert} to inclose 
copies of letters, lately received from Colonels Butler 
and McCleary, purporting some of the above facts.

The Delaware Chiefs, with upwards of thirty warriors, are come to aid me upon an expedition ; but, 
as I have neither bread nor meat to give them, they 
will soon discover that it is not in my power to act 
offensively. They appear much dejected on account 
of the total want of goods, which they were promised 
in exchange for their peltry. 
</p><p>
Unless supplies of beef, &c. are procuring below 
the mountains, which I know nothing of, the troops 
here will experience great hardship before spring, 
and desertions will be very frequent. I have frequently represented to the Honorable Board of War 
the hardships of the troops, and am now informed by 
their Secretary that compulsion is tolerated by the 
Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania for a 
temporary supply. I continue my inquiries respecting the strength of Detroit, and my intelligence is of a 
piece with that formerly communicated. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be. &c., &c.,
