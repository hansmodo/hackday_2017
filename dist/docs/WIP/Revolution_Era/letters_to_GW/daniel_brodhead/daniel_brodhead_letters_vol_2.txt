</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I am honored with your favor of the 18th ultimo. 
The honorable notice you have been pleased to take 
of my little expedition, fills my mind with the warmest gratitude, and I hope to merit your future esteem. 
</p><p>
It is some time since I inclosed to the honorable 
Board of War a return of the troops under my command, and of the articles of clothing necessary for the 
respective corps, to render them tolerably comfortable 
during the ensuing winter. The troops have received a small supply of money, and I expect they will 
be contented, until more can be procured from the 
treasury. 
</p><p>
An expedition against Detroit, in the winter season, 
will doubtless put us in possession of the enemy's 
shipping, and, of course, give us the command of 
Lake Erie. Winter expeditions are generally attended 
with great loss of horses and cattle, except where 
large magazines of forage are laid in, and can be 
transported. But the British garrison and shipping 
will be a full compensation for every loss of that 
kind, and, indeed, every difficulty we can meet in the 
obtaining it, as it will likewise secure the future 
tranquillity of this frontier. 
</p><p>
I will endeavour to, have every thing in perfect readiness, and procure the best intelligence that circumstances will admit. I believe a considerable number 
of Indians will join me ; but I have little expectation 
of supplies, except from the French settlement in the 
vicinity of that post ; and, as the British yearly cause 
the inhabitants to thresh out the grain, and sell to 
them for the purpose of filling their magazines, little 
dependence can be placed on receiving supplies from 
them ; and the Indians, on the Biver St. Lawrence, 
subsist chiefly on animal food. I have frequently 
applied to the Board of War for supplies and trinkets 
for the Indians, but fear it is not in their power to 
procure them. I will, however, renew my application. 
It is with great pleasure I hear of the destination 
of his Excellency <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague'>Count D Estaing</a>, and I have a happy 
presage that he will have the most ample success. 
</p><p>
I herewith remit a return of the cannon and military stores belonging to these garrisons, and an estimate of the cannon and military stores necessary for 
the intended expedition, to the best of my judgment. 
My best intelligence, at present, is, that the enemy 
have erected a very strong work, near to the old fort, 
and on the only commanding eminence, behind the 
soldiers gardens ; that the garrison consists of three hundred regulars (some say more), and about the 
same number of militia ; some of the latter description, 
it is said, will join our troops on their arrival in that 
neighbourhood. The Wyandots, Tawas, Chippewas, and 
Pottawattomies, live in the vicinity of Detroit, and 
many of them are, without doubt, under British influence. 
</p><p>
If the expedition cannot be prosecuted before the month of February, it will then be too late, on ac 
count of the high floods to which the intermediate 
country is subjected. Should it prove impracticable 
to carry on the expedition against Detroit, the troops 
under my command, with some volunteers, in my 
opinion, might be advantageously employed on an expedition against the Shawanese, on the Miami River, 
and from thence against the enemy's post at Natchez, 
with very little or no additional expense, and return 
early in the spring to march against Detroit. For I 
apprehend no danger to this frontier during the winter season, and the troops will be healthier, if continued in action, than in these garrisons. 
</p><p>
A couple of French gentlemen, of good address, 
would be very serviceable in this district, and especially on an expedition. I shall be happy to hear from you, and receive further instructions. I have 
the honor to be, with the highest sentiments of respect and esteem, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=dab" rel="me">DANIEL BRODHEAD</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I am this moment informed that two thou 
sand Indians, who were driven from their towns, are 
in great distress, and live on the pittance afforded 
them by the enemy at Niagara. This intelligence 
is from Sandusky, and may be relied on. They in 
form the other Indians that they are afraid to hunt, 
on account of the Americans.

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I wrote you on the 10th and 22d of November, 
and on the 13th of December last, and not having 
been honored with a line in answer to either of those 
letters, I begin to fear you have not duly received 
them, wherefore I take the liberty to inclose duplicates. I likewise inclose the proceedings of a General 
Court-Martial on the trial of Lieutenant Arthur Gor 
don, Adjutant of the ninth Virginia regiment, and a 
return of the provisions in store. 
</p><p>
I have not seen Colonel George Morgan since I 
came to this department; neither have I seen the 
Deputy Quartermaster-General since last March. I 
have not a tent for my men, and, by the inclosed 
return, you will see that the provisions are scanty ; 
but I hope to be better supplied in the spring. 
</p><p>
I have frequently given the most pointed orders 
respecting the public craft, notwithstanding which, 
the greatest part is, or will be, carried away with 
the ice. What I could retain at this place I did, 
and secured it by hauling it upon land. If the officers commanding at the different posts had taken the 
same care, little or none would have been driven off. 
Such a deep snow and such ice have not been known 
at this place in the memory of the oldest natives. 
Deer and turkeys die by hundreds for want of food. 
The snow on the Alleghany and Laurel Hills is four feet deep. 
</p><p>
By one of our prisoners, who lately made his 
escape from the Wyandots, and who has frequently 
been at Detroit, I am informed that the new fort 
erected there has two bomb-proofs of wood ; that the 
walls are very high, fifteen feet thick, and made offascines and clay ; that the barracks are sunk some 
distance into the ground, and that their roofs cannot 
be seen from without; that it stands on a fine commanding piece of ground, with a gentle descent each 
way ; likewise that it is surrounded by a ditch twenty feet wide. The garrison consists of four hundred 
and fifty regulars, and the enemy have eighteen hundred men at Niagara, besides a great number of Indians. If this intelligence is true, unless some di 
version is occasioned by troops marching up the Susquehanna River, it is not improbable that the enemy 
may pay us a visit down the Alleghany Paver next 
spring, and I have neither men nor cannon sufficient 
for this fort, unless a reenforcement can be spared 
from the main army. I shall, however, make the 
best disposition that circumstances will admit, and, if 
possible, gain further intelligence from the Delawares, 
who continue their declarations of friendship for us. 
</p><p>
I beg your Excellency will indulge me with twenty 
boat-builders, and some armourers, early in the spring. 
If I receive no orders to the contrary, and can be 
supplied with craft, I am determined to drive the Shawanese over the Lakes, which I can do before provi 
sions can be furnished for a capital expedition. 
</p><p>
I shall now transmit an estimate of cannon and 
military stores to the Board of War, in hopes that, 
by the time they arrive at this place, I shall be 
enabled to do something worthy the confidence you 
have placed in me. With the most exalted regard 
and esteem, I have the honor to be, your Excellency's 
Most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
DANIEL BHODHEAD.

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The savages have already begun their hostilities. 
Last Sunday, they killed five men at a sugar camp 
upon Raccoon Creek, in Youghiogany county, and 
took prisoners three girls and three lads. It is generally conjectured that the Delawares perpetrated this 
murder ; but it is possible it may have been done by 
other Indians. If the Delaware nation should declare 
against us, this frontier will be greatly distressed ; 
as many other nations, who have hitherto been neutral, will join them, and my force is by no means 
sufficient to protect the settlements. I have inclosed 
to the Adjutant-General a return of the troops for 
the month of February, since which near to fifty men 
have been discharged from the ninth Virginia regiment, and many more will expect their discharges 
very soon. 
</p><p>
I have lately been favored with a letter from Colonel Clark, declaring his readiness to cooperate with 
me in any measure I shall undertake, either for the 
reduction of one of the enemy's posts, or against the 
Indian towns. He is now at the Illinois, and will be 
considerably reenforced in the course of this spring. 
He proposes throwing up some works at the mouth 
of the Ohio River. If your Excellency can possibly 
spare a small reenforcement of well-appointed regular troops for this district, I will pledge my honor to be 
as active as circumstances and situation will admit. 
</p><p>
I am exceedingly anxious to receive a line from 
you; and have the honor to be, with the most perfect regard and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I am honored with your favor of the 4th of January, and the 14th of March. That of the 4th of 
January I did not receive until the 18th instant. 
Returns of the troops under my command have been 
duly forwarded to the orderly office, agreeably to 
general orders, except one or two months in the winter, when the mountain was impassable. As no reenforcement can be had from your Excellency, the 
intended expedition against Detroit must be laid 
aside until a favorable turn of affairs takes place, unless you would recommend a junction of Colonel Clark's troops with mine. 
</p><p>
I have called upon the different counties, on this 
side the mountain, for eight hundred and twenty-five 
rank and file, to be drafted from the militia, and in 
tend to visit the Shawanese, provided the men are 
furnished. But the unhappy dispute of jurisdiction 
will, I fear, prevent my getting them ; and, as many 
renegadoes from the different Indian nations are collected at the Shawanese towns, I do not incline to 
make an attempt with an inconsiderable number of 
men, because a defeat would be attended with fatal 
consequences to the settlement. 
</p><p>
I am honored with a line from the Honorable 
Board of War, informing me that an officer of Colonel Proctor's regiment; with some stores and cannon, was 
in readiness to be sent up as soon as the roads 
would permit^ and the means of transportation can be 
procured. 
</p><p>
Mr. Arthur Gordon has deserted from his arrest,, 
and will probably avoid a new trial. 
</p><p>
With a view of saving land-carriage expenses, when 
water-carriage was practicable, I suffered only a few 
of the boats to be used ; and greater care could 
scarcely have been taken, than what I took, to prevent their being lost or spoiled; but it was out of 
my power to watch every person. 1 have, however, 
the pleasure to assure you, that not more than seven 
are past Fort Henry, which, as I have given orders 
to some of Colonel Clark's officers, will, I trust, be 
saved and sent back to this post. 
</p><p>
I was much inclined, last fall, to do myself the 
honor of waiting upon your Excellency, with a view 
of proposing some things which, at that time, I expected would have promoted the service in this district in the course of this campaign; but I do not 
recollect that I expressed my desire to visit my 
family. I am much obliged to your Excellency for 
the indulgence; but, as Colonel Gibson is absent on a 
visit to his family, at <a href='/results.php?city=carlisle' rel='city'>Carlisle</a>, and the Indians are 
remarkably hostile, I must remain, until I see whether it will be in my power to prosecute an expedition against the hostile Indians, or not, and until I 
have the honor of hearing from you again. 
</p><p>
The Lieutenants of Monongalia county, and Ohio, 
write, that they arc happy to hear of the intended 
expedition against some of the hostile Indians, and 
that they will exert themselves to furnish the men 
required; but they conceive that it will be difficult to 
effect it, on account of the disputed territory. 
I take the liberty to inclose the copy of a letter, 
lately received from the Delaware Council at Coochocking, number One ; likewise a copy of the Reve 
rend Mr. Heckewelder's letter, number Two ; and an 
extract from the Reverend Mr. Heckewelder's letter, 
number Three and I will likewise inclose the return 
of the troops, as nearly as possible, to your wish ; 
but as Colonel Gibson's regiment, my own, and the 
independent corps, were chiefly raised within the disputed territory, it will be impossible to determine in 
which State they were raised, until the line is run. 
</p><p>
Fearing a scarcity of salt provisions for the out 
posts, and the better to enable me to subsist a number of the militia upon the proposed expedition, I 
have been obliged to reduce the ration of meat one quarter, but I have allowed some Indian meal in lieu thereof. Since the 1st of March, the Indians have 
killed and taken forty-three men, women, and children, in the counties of Youghiogany, Monongalia, and 
Ohio, including those killed and taken upon the river ; 
and they have destroyed a number of horses and 
cattle in Tiger Valley. 
</p><p>
The Honorable Board of War mention the expense 
of expresses in such a manner, as must prevent my 
employing any ; but I will do myself the honor to 
communicate to you every material occurrence, by such 
private conveyance as may from time to time offer. 
I have the honor to be, with the most sincere respect 
and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL,
</p><p>
I have put off the assembling of the militia until 
the 4th of next month, to endeavour to procure a 
sufficient quantity of provision for them. But I fear it will not be in my power, as <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>, who 
presides at the Board of Inspection, has ordered the 
Commissaries to stop purchasing ; and the Mingoes, in 
sundry parties, have been discovered on their march 
toward the inhabitants. Several persons have lately 
been killed and wounded in Westmoreland county, 
which will probably prevent my receiving any aid 
from the militia of that county. They have hired 
sixty men, who are now stationed upon their frontier. 
A Delaware Indian informed me this day, that two 
parties of warriors had just crossed the Ohio River, 
near Logstown and Chartier's Creek, which will, probably, by alarming and driving the inhabitants, prevent my getting the men from the other counties as 
I expected. The remaining Continentals are the cullings of our troops, and I cannot promise any thing 
clever from them. 
</p><p>
I have wrote to the artillery officer to hurry up 
the artillery and stores ; but I hear he is badly furnished with carriages and forage, which must prevent 
his marching with expedition. 
</p><p>
I think it is probable that the enemy are meditating an attack upon some of our posts, which, for 
want of sufficient garrisons and supplies, cannot make 
much resistance. I am preparing to receive them 
here, but the detachments to Fort Mclntosh, Holliday's Cave, Fort Henry, and Fort Armstrong, leave 
but a small garrison to defend this post. The Dela 
ware Indians continue their professions of friendship, 
and some of their warriors are now out with my 
scouts. But, as I have little or nothing to give them 
but good words and fair promises, I apprehend they 
will soon decline the service. I have the honor to be, with the highest sentiments of respect and esteem. 
</p><p>

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Since my last, ten persons have been killed and 
wounded, taken by the Indians in Westmoreland county. Parties of regulars and militia have endeavoured 
to overtake them, but without success. 
</p><p>
The accounts I have received, relative to the British garrison at Detroit, differ widely, some making it 
to consist of only two hundred men, some three hundred, and others, upwards of four hundred. This has 
determined me to send Captain Brady, with five white 
men and two Delaware Indians, to Sandusky, to endeavour to take a British prisoner, which I hope he 
will effect. I have likewise offered other Delaware 
warriors fifty hard dollars worth of goods, for one British soldier, and they have promised to bring him immediately. Should an intelligent one be brought 
in, I intend to offer him some indulgence upon his 
giving me the most perfect intelligence in his power. 
</p><p>
I had lately called out eight hundred and twenty five rank and file, and a proportionate number of officers, from the militia, to aid me upon an enterprise 
against the Shawanese towns ; but, upon finding the 
true state of what provisions could be drawn from 
the Commissaries, and that they were prohibited from 
making any further purchases, I was compelled to 
postpone the attempt until a sufficient quantity of 
provisions can be procured. The militia appear to be 
very anxious to aid me, and I sincerely wish it was 
in my power to indulge them. I expect a small sup 
ply from below the mountains, which, if it proves to 
be of good quality, will enable me to subsist the dependent posts until the 1st of September. 
</p><p>
The soldiers frequently desert^ and are often apprehended ; and I expect sundry charges will soon be 
exhibited against some of the civil Staff Officers in 
this district. I shall, therefore, be much obliged fora few more blank orders, to enable me to assemble 
General Courts-Martial for their respective trials. 
</p><p>
I cannot learn that the ordnance and stores, ordered from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, have yet left <a href='/results.php?city=carlisle' rel='city'>Carlisle</a>, nor do I 
know of what kind they are, nor what their number 
or quality. I have the honor to be, with the most 
sincere respect and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient Servant,
