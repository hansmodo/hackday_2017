COLONEL ARNOLD TO GENERAL WOOSTER. 
</p><p>
General Hospital, 2 January, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I wrote you, three days since, of our defeat, and the death of 
General Montgomery and others, with all the information I then 
had of the matter. We have been in suspense, with regard to 
my detachment, until this afternoon, when Major Mcigs was sent 
out, with a flag, for the officers baggage, who, he says, are all 
taken prisoners, except Captain Hendricks, Lieutenant Humphreys, of the riflemen, and Lieutenant Cooper, who were killed 
in the action. General Caiieton says our loss, in killed and 
wounded, is a hundred. Major Meigs thinks it does not exceed 
sixty, and about three hundred taken prisoners, who are treated 
very humanely. These brave men sustained the force of the 
whole garrison for three hours, but were finally obliged to yield 
to numbers, and the advantageous situation the garrison had over 
them. Several other officers, I am told, are slightly wounded. 
</p><p>
We had the misfortune of losing one brass six-pounder in the 
engagement, and all our mortars were taken from St. Roc the 
evening after the engagement. This was the fault of some of 
the officers who commanded, as they might very easily have been 
brought away, agreeably to my positive orders for that purpose. 
Our force, at this time, does not exceed eight hundred men, including Colonel Livingston's regiment of two hundred Canadians, 
and some scattered Canadian forces, amounting to two hundred 
more. Many of the troops are dejected and anxious to get home, 
and some have actually set off. I shall endeavour to continue 
the blockade, while there are any hopes of success. For God's 
sake, order as many men down as you can possibly spare, consistent with the safety of Montreal, and all the mortars, howitzers, and shells, that you can possibly bring. I hope you will 
stop every rascal who has deserted from us, and bring him back 
again. 
</p><p>
Every possible mark of distinction was shown to the corpse of 
General Montgomery, who was to be interred in Quebec this 
day. Had he been properly supported by his troops, I make no 
doubt of our success. We are short of cash. Not more than 
four or five hundred pounds, and only twenty barrels of salt 
pork. If any can be spared from Montreal, I think best to 
bring it down, and all the butter. 
</p><p>
I beg you will transmit a copy of this letter to the Honorable 
Continental Congress, and another to his Excellency, General 
<a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>. I think it will be highly necessary, with the reen-forcement which, I make no doubt, Congress will send, that 
they should order all the large mortars and howitzers at Crown 
Point, <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, and Fort George, on to this place. Monsieur Pallasier, who has a furnace at Three Rivers, assures me 
that he can cast any size and number of shells between this and 
the beginning of April. I hope the Honorable Continental congress will not think of sending less than eight or ten thousand 
men to secure and form a lasting connection with this country. 
</p><p>
I am in such excessive pain from my wound (as the bones of 
my leg are affected), I can only add, that I am, with the greatest esteem, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>. 
</p><p>
N. B. Many officers here appear dispirited. Your presence 
will be absolutely necessary. I do not expect to be in a capacity to act this two months. 
</p>
