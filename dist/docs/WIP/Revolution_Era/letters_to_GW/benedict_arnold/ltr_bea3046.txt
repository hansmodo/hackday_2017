DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's favor of the 21st, respecting the 
militia, I received at three o'clock this evening, and 
immediately had as many inhabitants collected at the 
Coffee-House as I could notify. Fifty volunteers have 
engaged to go with General Cadwalader, who this 
minute informs me he expects to collect a consider 
able number more in the morning, in the city. I 
cannot flatter myself with procuring many in the 
vicinity. These are unarmed. Search is making for 
all the arms in the city. I have ventured to order 
Colonel Jackson to march at three o'clock to-morrow 
morning, with the troops under his command. These, 
with the volunteers, and four hundred men now in 
the enemy's rear, will make a formidable body. Their 
places are supplied by Colonel Proctor's regiment, who 
will do garrison duty until a sufficient number of days, on account of the zeal of some members for sealing the letters 
up, and sending them back, without reading, in consequence of some 
harsh expressions against the King of France. However, it was over 
ruled, as you will see, and a more proper method, in my opinion, taken. 
What will be their next steps, time only will discover. In the packet 
to Congress were inclosed a great number of letters to the separate 
members. Some from Governor Johnstone to such of the members as 
he was acquainted with, and others from other persons in England, who 
had any acquaintance with them." 
convalescents can arrive from <a href='/results.php?city=valley forge' rel='city'>Valley Forge</a> ; for which 
purpose I intend giving an order, which, I trust, will 
meet your Excellency's approbation. 
</p><p>
One hundred and odd deserters from the enemy 
have arrived in town this day. The whole number 
is little short of three hundred, and great numbers, I 
am informed, are scattered through the Jerseys. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's favor of yesterday, by the Indians, was delivered to me this evening. Particular attention shall be paid to the contents. I am, with 
the greatest respect and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
BENEDICT ARNOLD.
