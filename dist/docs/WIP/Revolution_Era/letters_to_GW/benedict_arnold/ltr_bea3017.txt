COLONEL ARNOLD TO GENERAL WOOSTER. 
</p><p>
General Hospital, 31 December, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775">1775</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I make no doubt but General Montgomery acquainted you 
with his intentions of storming Quebec as soon as a good opportunity offered. As we had several men deserted from us a few 
days past, the General was induced to alter his plan, which was 
to have attacked the Upper and Lower Town at the same time. 
He thought it most prudent to make two different attacks upon 
the Lower Town ; the one at Cape Diamond, the other through 
St. Koc. For the last attack, I was ordered, with my own detachment and Captain Lamb's company of artillery. At five 
o clock, the hour appointed for the attack, a false attack was ordered to be made upon the Upper Town. 
</p><p>
We accordingly began our march. I passed through St. Roc. 
and approached near a two-gun battery, picketed in, without being  discovered, which we attacked. It was bravely defended for 
about an hour; but, with the loss of a number of men, we carried it. In the attack, I was shot through the leg, and was 
obliged to be carried to the hospital, where I soon heard the disagreeable news that the General was defeated at Cape Diamond ; 
himself, Captain Macpherson, his Aid-de-camp, and Captain Cheese-man, killed on the spot, with a number of others not known. 
After gaining the battery, my detachment pushed on to a second 
barrier, which they took possession of. At the same time, the 
enemy sallied out from Palace Gate, and attacked them in the 
rear. A field-piece, which the roughness of the road would not 
permit our carrying on, fell into the enemy's hands, with a number of prisoners. The last accounts from my detachment, about 
ten minutes since, they were pushing for the Lower Town. Their 
communication with me was cut off. I am exceedingly apprehensive what the event will be ; they will either carry the Lower 
Town, be made prisoners, or cut to pieces. 
</p><p>
I thought proper to send an express to let you know the critical situation we are in, and make no doubt you will give us all 
the assistance in your power. As I am not able to act, I shall 
give up the command to Colonel Campbell. I beg you will immediately send an express to the Honorable Continental Congress, 
and his Excellency General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>. The loss of my detachment, before I left it, was about twenty men, killed and 
wounded ; among the latter is Major Ogden, who, with Captain 
Oswald, Captain Burr, and the other volunteers, behaved extremely well. I have only time to add that I am, with the 
greatest esteem, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. It is- impossible to say what our future operations will 
be, until we know the fate of my detachment.
