GENERAL ARNOLD TO GENERAL SCHUYLER.

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I received your letter of the 28th ultimo to the Honorable 
Commissioners, respecting the Oneidas, the 6th instant. There 
was a meeting of those Indians and several other tribes at 
Caghnawaga, some of whom agreed to deliver up the hatchet 
received from Governor Carleton last year, and remain neuter 
in the present dispute. On the 7th they came to Montreal, 
when, after the usual speeches and ceremonies, the St. Francis, Caghnawagas, and Conosadagas gave up the hatchet. The 
Oswagatchas pretended they had no authority for doing it; to 
whom I observed we were ready to receive them as friends, 
but if they preferred war to peace, we were ready to meet 
them as enemies ; that we had it in our power to destroy them 
whenever we pleased, which they would soon be convinced of, 
if they did not lay down the hatchet. The Oneidas received 
the presents you desired, except the blankets and clouts, which 
could not be procured in town, having all been sent to Chamblee. I gave them an order on the Quarter-master there, but 
find, since, that they went directly to St. John s, and did not 
receive them. 
</p><p>
General Thompson left the Sorel three days since, with two 
thousand men, for Three Rivers, where are about three or four 
hundred of the enemy intrenching. One frigate, a brig, and 
eight sloops and schooners are above Richelieu. I expect every 
moment to hear of an action between General Thompson and 
the enemy. A number of Indians and some regular troops are 
about this place, waiting, as is said, for a reinforcement from 
above, and for Governor Carleton to advance, when I expect 
we shall have an opportunity of seeing them here. 
</p><p>
I have received your instructions respecting the Tories and 
their effects. Most of the former had absconded. Great part 
of the latter is secured. I have sent to St. John's a quantity 
of goods for the use of the army, some bought and some seized. 
I am in hopes of fixing on some method, in a day or two. 
of having them made up, as they are much wanted. I am, 
very respectfully, dear General, 
</p><p>
Your obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
