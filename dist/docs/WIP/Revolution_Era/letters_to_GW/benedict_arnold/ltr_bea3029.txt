GENERAL ARNOLD TO GENERAL SULLIVAN. 
</p><p>
Montreal, 5 June, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have complied with your orders, as for as in my power, 
respecting the destination of the troops. I intended setting off 
this day for Sorel, but have been much hindered by taking the 
goods in town. Every possible obstacle has been thrown in 
my way. However, I shall secure many articles much wanted 
by the army. Yesterday, Colonel Dehaas, with his detachment, 
set off for Sorel. Last night and this morning I have received 
intelligence of four or five hundred savages and Canadians being  on the Island, with the intention of attacking our post at 
La Chine ; and, as the garrison is so weak we can spare few 
men from it, I have thought proper to order Colonel Dehaas 
to return. I think it absolutely necessary some effectual methods should be taken with the savages immediately, or we 
shall be obliged to keep up a large force here. I shall be continually harassed with them. This affair will prevent my joining  you at Sorel as soon as I could wish. It will not be in my power to take an account of the goods, and send them off, these three days. 
</p><p>
I believe the enemy below will not advance very suddenly. 
I make no doubt you will have time to prepare for them, and 
that we shall be reenforced in time to secure this part of the 
country. I have ordered Colonel Bedel, his Major, and Captain Young, to Sorel for their trial. 
</p><p>
An express arrived here from Three Rivers yesterday. I 
must refer you to General Thompson for the advice he brought. 
We have only two pieces of cannon here, and no matrosses. 
</p><p>
With great esteem and affection, I am, dear General, 
Your obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
