Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On my arrival at this post, I found every thing 
thrown into great confusion, by the troops removing 
from hence, and the militia coming in. Colonel Malcom had ordered returns to be made of the militia, 
provisions, and stores of every kind, which I expect 
this morning, and will transmit a copy to your Excellency. I believe a sufficient number of militia 
have arrived to replace those of this State, who will 
leave this to-morrow or next day. I am sorry to 
observe, that there is not one tent for the militia 
(which are absolutely necessary at the redoubts), and 
the barracks will not contain more than seven hundred, unless they are crowded, so as to injure their 
health ; and many of them are daily falling sick. 
This will be delivered your Excellency by Doctor Ledyard, who waits on you to obtain a supply of 
medicines and stores for the sick, who are numerous, 
and without fresh provisions or any necessaries ; and 
I am assured by him and Doctor Burnet, that there 
are not hospital stores in the department sufficient 
to last the sick one fortnight, nor is there any prospect of obtaining a supply, unless by an application 
to Congress or <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a>. 
</p><p>
The quantity of salted meat at this post, I am informed, is small. It appears to me that the whole 
ought to be reserved, and the troops fed on fresh 
provisions. I know not from what quarter we are to expect a supply. I have wrote Colonel Blain on 
the subject, but believe an order from your Excellency to him will be necessary. 
</p><p>
I shall pay the strictest attention to my orders, 
but cannot flatter myself with effecting as much with 
raw militia as would be done with an equal number 
of disciplined troops ; and I am very apprehensive 
that the troops, by being exposed, will become sickly, 
and desertions follow in consequence. I have the 
honor to be, with great respect and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's obedient, humble servant,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Colonel Stewart Commissary-General of Issues, has 
made a demand on the Commissary at this post for 
thirty hogsheads of rum. As there are only fifty odd 
in the magazine, I have desired him to send only 
fifteen, which will be a present supply for the army; 
the remainder will he necessary for the use of the 
garrison. The Commissary informs me that he expects no more ; and as large supplies are coming on 
from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, I think the army cannot want. 
</p><p>
I wish your Excellency would be kind enough to 
order Mr. Erskine to send me a map of the country 
from this place to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, particularly on the east 
side of the river, which would be very useful to me. 
The ofiicers in general, from the State of Massachusett's Bay, have never been in the service before, and 
are extremely ignorant of their duty, which throws 
every thing into confusion ; and, in case of an attack 
on the post, from their inexperience I believe little 
dependence can be placed on them. The troops are 
good, and well armed. Would it not be better. Sir, 
to continue a part or the whole of the <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
brigade at this post, whose ofiicers (particularly Colonel Malcom) are well acquainted with the duty, and 
can be depended on, and the troops have, in general, 
bad arms and few bayonets ? 
</p><p>
I am convinced, that the Massachusetts or Hampshire troops will be better in the field, from this circumstance in their arms. 
</p><p>
Major Villefranche has surveyed the works at West 
Point, and informs me that there is a vast deal to do to complete them ; that large quantities of materials, 
such as timber, plank, boards, stone, &c., -will be wanted. Part of the materials are at different places near 
this post ; but I do not find that there are any teams 
or forage in the department, and, at present there is 
no prospect of any being furnished. 
</p><p>
I am sorry to trouble your Excellency with so 
long a list of grievances; and am, very respectfully, 
your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and obliged humble servant,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Yesterday, I had the honor to receive your Excellency's letter of the 7th, and am very happy to hear 
such favorable accounts from the southward. I hope our affairs in that quarter will soon wear a more 
pleasing aspect than ever. 
</p><p>
Colonel Sheldon complains to me that his horses 
are much worn down ; and the inhabitants of Westchester complain, that the country is not sufficiently 
guarded against the enemy. I have, therefore, sent 
Colonel Hay fifty men from <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, as more eligible than taking them from the lines. Mr. Stephens 
informs me that there are one hundred hogsheads of 
rum at Springfield, but that teams cannot be procured to bring it on. 
</p><p>
I came here this morning, in order to establish 
signals, to be observed in case the enemy came up 
the river ; to give some directions respecting the 
guard-boats ; and to have a beacon fixed upon the 
mountain, about five miles south of King's Ferry, 
which will be necessary to alarm the country. The 
one fixed there formerly has been destroyed. 
</p><p>
There are some cannon at <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, which are 
of little service, except for signal-guns. " I propose 
sending two of them to Colonel Gouvion, for that 
purpose, if agreeable to your Excellency. A supply 
of cattle, for some, days, had arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a> 
before I left it. I am informed that considerable 
numbers have been crossed at King's Ferry. I am 
in hopes the army will be better supplied in future. 
I have the honor to be, &c.,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Last night, I had the honor to receive your Excellency's favor of yesterday, inclosing a copy of a 
Council of War, held the 6th. I will endeavour, 
agreeably to your Excellency's request, to transmit 
my opinion on the matters submitted, by the time 
required. I sincerely wish the situation of our affairs 
would admit ni}'- giving it with more decision than I 
am able to do at present. 
</p><p>
The order, contained in the postscript of your Excellency's letter of the 7th, to send the eight bargemen 
of Colonel Putnam's regiment to join their regiment, 
I conceive to be on a supposition of their being idle 
at <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>. I beg leave to observe, that they are 
now employed as my bargemen ; that all the militia 
oarsmen had, previous to the receipt of the order, 
been drafted, and sent to different commands, at 
King's Ferry and elsewhere, so that it is out of my 
power to procure a proper crew for my barge ; for 
which reasons I have thought proper to detain them 
until I receive your Excellency's further orders on 
the subject. 
</p><p>
I take the liberty of inclosing extracts of a letter from Colonel Hay, of the 9th, respecting flour, &c. 
I sincerely wish he may succeed in his endeavours to procure flour (of which I am very doubtful) in the 
quantities he has requested, as I believe the requisition larger than (when all others are answered) the 
State can comply with. 
</p><p>
About thirty bateau-men, mentioned in Colonel 
Hay's letter, were sent down with Captain Denny to 
King's Ferry. As, in case of an evacuation of these 
posts. Colonel Livingston's garrison, with the troops 
sent down, will be sufficient to man the bateaux, I 
think it will be best to order the bateau-men to be 
sent to <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a>. Your Excellency's general orders of 
the 28th and 30th ultimo, from the Adjutant-General, 
were received last evening, and published in my orders of this day.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
In answer to your Excellency's questions, proposed 
to the Council of General Officers on the 6th instant, 
I beg leave to observe that, from the uncertainty of the arrival of the second division of the French fleet, 
as well as of their force, and from the fluctuating 
situation of our affairs, which may be totally changed 
in a short time, by a variety of circumstances which 
may happen, it appears to me extremely difficult to 
determine, with any degree of precision, the line of 
conduct proper to be observed. 
</p><p>
If the second division of the French fleet may be 
soon expected, and their force, of which I am ignorant, will give us a decided superiority over the enemy as well by land as sea, I am of opinion every 
necessary preparation and disposition should be made 
to attack <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, provided we have a sufficiency 
of ammunition and military stores, and there is a 
prospect of the army (when collected) being supplied 
with provision (the former I much doubt). But if 
there is not good reason to suppose the second division of the French fleet, with a force superior to that 
of the enemy, will arrive in the course of a month, 
I am of opinion no offensive operations can, with 
prudence, be undertaken this fall against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> j 
in which case, it is possible the enemy will detail a 
part of their force in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to join those in 
South Carolina, or to cooperate with those in Virginia or Maryland. 
</p><p>
I am, therefore, of opinion, that the Pennsylvania 
line, which I suppose to amount to twenty-five hundred or three thousand men, should hold themselves 
in readiness to march; and if the same division of 
the French fleet does not arrive by the 1st of October, that then the Pennsylvania line should march to 
the relief of the Southern States, who, with the aid 
of so formidable a regular force here, if they do their 
duty, will be able to repel the enemy in that quarter; and, if the French fleet should arrive too late to 
operate against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, South Carolina may be an 
object worthy their attention. 
</p><p>
Without a decided superiority by sea, I am of opinion no offensive operations against the enemy can, 
with prudence, be undertaken this fall; and, it is to 
be hoped, that the States, by this time, are convinced of the necessity of immediately raising an army 
during the war, and that they will, without loss of 
time, take future measures for that purpose. I should 
suppose the Pennsylvania line might be replaced by 
some of the troops at Rhode Island, before the time 
is expired for which the militia are called out. 
I have the honor to be, &c.,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Last evening, I was honored with your Excellency's favor of the 14th. I have given orders for the guard requested, as also to the Quarter-master to 
furnish forage at Mr. Birdsall's for the number of horses mentioned in your Excellency's letter. 
</p><p>
My answers to the questions proposed by your 
Excellency to the Council of War I will do myself 
the honor to deliver in person.
