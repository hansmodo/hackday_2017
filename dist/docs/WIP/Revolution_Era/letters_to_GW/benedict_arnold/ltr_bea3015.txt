COLONEL ARNOLD TO GENERAL MONTGOMERY. 
</p><p>
Point-aux-Trcmbles, 20 November, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775">1775</a>.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I wrote you the 14th and 16th instant from before Quebec, 
which I make no doubt you have received. I have this minute the pleasure of yours of the 17th instant. I heartily congratulate you on your success, and hope, as fortune has so far 
been favorable, and is generally so to the brave, it may in 
future be equal to your warmest wishes. 
</p><p>
It was not in my power, before the 18th, to make an exact 
scrutiny into the arms and ammunition of my detachment, when, 
upon examination, great part of our cartridges proved unfit for 
service, and, to my great surprise, we had no more than five 
rounds for each man, and near one hundred muskets unfit for 
service. Add to this, many of the men invalids, almost naked, 
and wanting every necessary to make them comfortable. The 
same day I received advice from my friends in town, that Colonel McLean was making preparation, and had determined in a 
day or two to come out and attack us ; and, as his numbers 
were greatly superior to ours, with a number of field-pieces, 
and the limits of Quebec are so extensive, I found it impossible entirely to cut off their communication with the country, 
without dividing the small number of men I have (about five 
hundred and fifty effective), so as to render them an easy sacrifice to the besieged. I therefore concluded it most prudent to 
retire to this place, and ordered the main body to march at 
three o clock yesterday morning, and waited, with a small detachment, to watch the motions of the enemy until the main 
body were out of danger. They all arrived here last night. I have procured leather sufficient to shoe them all in a day or 
two, the only article of clothing to be had in this part of the 
country. Inclosed is a memorandum of clothing absolutely necessary for a winter's campaign, which I beg the favor of your 
forwarding to me as soon as possible. Should it be troublesome, 
I have desired the bearer, Captain Ogden, a young gentleman 
and volunteer from the Jerseys, to procure them, and some 
other articles the officers are in want of, and beg the favor of 
your order to forward them on. 
</p><p>
Captain Napier, in the snow, and a small schooner, passed us 
yesterday, and is now at Quebec. The two frigates were laid 
up the 18th; their guns and men all taken on shore. They are 
getting all the provisions they possibly can out of the country, 
and are doubtless determined to make the best defence. From 
the best accounts I can get, their force is about nineteen hundred men, namely ; landed from the frigate and two transports 
from St. John s, one hundred and fifty recruits; Colonel McLean's 
regiment, one hundred and seventy irregulars ; from the Lizard, 
two hundred seamen and marines ; from the Hunter sloop, one 
hundred ; on board Captain Napier, one hundred and fifty, which 
make seven hundred and seventy; inhabitants, French and English, on their side, one hundred and thirty; ditto, obliged to bear 
arms against their inclination, and who would join us if an 
opportunity presented, six hundred; neutrals, four hundred; total, 
eighteen hundred and seventy. You will, from the above account, be better able to judge of the force necessary to carry 
the town. If my opinion is of any service, I should think two 
thousand necessary, as they must be divided at the distance of 
three or four miles, to secure the passes effectually ; and as 
there is no probability of cannon making a breach in the walls, 
I should think mortars of the most service ; the situation for 
heaving shells being extremely good, and I think, of course, 
would soon bring them to compliance ; if not, time and perseverance must effect it before they can possibly be relieved. 
</p><p>
Colonel Allen and his party have been some time since sent 
to England in irons. Mr. Walker I have not heard of. I 
have ordered Captain Ogden to send down all the powder and 
ball on the road. If he should not be able to procure sufficient, I make no doubt of your forwarding it as soon as possible. The inhabitants are very friendly, and give all the assistance they dare to do at present. Had we a sufficient force 
to blockade the garrison, I make no doubt of their coming to our assistance in great numbers. As it will doubtless take some 
time in bringing down your artillery, would it not be better, if 
you can spare them, to send down five or six hundred men, 
who, joined to my little corps, will be able to cut off their 
communication with the country? 
</p><p>
I am, dear General, &c.

P. S. My hard cash is nearly exhausted. It will not be 
sufficient for more than ten days or a fortnight, and, as the 
French have been such sufferers by paper money, I do not think 
it prudent to offer it to them at present. B. A.
