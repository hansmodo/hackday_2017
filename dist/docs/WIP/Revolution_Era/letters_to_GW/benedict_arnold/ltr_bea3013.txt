COLONEL ARNOLD TO LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR CRAMAIIE. 
</p><p>
15 November, 177J. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I yesterday sent the inclosed with a ilag and officer, who, approaching near the walls of the town, was, contrary to humanity 
and the laws of nations, fired on, and narrowly escaped being 
killed. This I imputed to the ignorance of your guards, and 
ordered him to return this morning, and, to my great surprise, lie 
was received in the same manner as yesterday. This is an insult 
I could not have expected from a private soldier, much less from 
an officer of your rank ; and, through me offered to the United 
Colonies, will be deeply resented; but at any rate, cannot redound 
to your honor or valor. 
</p><p>
I am informed you have put a prisoner, taken from me, into 
irons. I desire to know the truth of this, and the manner in 
which he is treated. As I have several prisoners taken from 
you, who now feed at my own table, you may expect that they 
will be treated in the same manner in future as you treat mine. 
I am, Sir, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
