DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 20th instant I received last night. I am 
sorry to hear your treaty with the Indians is so long retarded. 
You must have an infinite deal of trouble with them, which I am 
fearful will prejudice your health ; and your presence is much 
wanted both at Skenesborough and this place. I wrote you from 
the former place on the 25th instant, at which time only two 
companies of carpenters were arrived, one from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and 
the other from Connecticut ; since which the whole have arrived, 
(o the number of two hundred. I left them such directions as I 
thought necessary, and orders to begin four row-galleys, nearly of 
the construction of those built in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, to carry four 
pieces heavy and two pieces light cannon each. The two largest 
schooners are at Crown Point, the sloop goes this morning, and 
four gondolas will follow in two or three days. I intend to visit 
Skenesborough on Monday next. I shall be happy to accelerate the business all in my power, and to take as much trouble from 
off your hands as possible, as I am sensible you have more than your share of it. 
</p><p>
A Frenchman, arrived here in fifteen days from St. Francois, 
confirms the intelligence respecting the Indians, and adds that all 
the tribes in Canada were determined on a neutrality; that the 
troops were busy in building bateaux and several large vessels 
at St. John s. General Carleton has given the French inhabitants 
notice of his intention of crossing Lake Champlain the last of 
August, or beginning of September, and that he should depend 
on their joining him. If we are supplied with the articles I 
wrote for, we shall soon be in a condition to give him a proper 
reception. 
</p><p>
Inclosed is a return of the ordnance stores, shot, &c., &c., 
by which you will observe there are many articles wanting to 
complete the same, as also there is a great deficiency of shot 
in particular, grape, double-headed, chain, and round, which will 
be very serviceable among vessels and bateaux. More heavy 
cannon will be wanted for the row-galleys. The four now building  will carry eight twenty-fours, and eight eighteens. Four 
others will be set up soon, and will require an equal number 
of guns. To supply the row-galleys and lines, we have only 
eleven pieces, and ten twelve-pounders, which may answer, 
though not so well as heavier guns. If they are substituted, 
eleven pieces will still be wanting, with shot, &c., which I wish 
may be sent up, if they can possibly be procured. With the 
approbation of General Gates I sent to Connecticut for three 
hundred seamen. The express had orders to call on you (if 
returned), and take your instructions in the matter. As it was 
uncertain, if you were returned, I wrote to Captain Varick desiring him to give the express a warrant on the Paymaster-General for one thousand pounds, to pay the bounty of the 
seamen, as the treasury was empty. lie has proceeded on to 
General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>. We are informed, that of the four regiments coming from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, there is a very considerable number of seamen, who are daily expected. I am, &c.
