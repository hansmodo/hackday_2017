GENERAL ARNOLD TO THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS.
</p><p>
Camp, before Quebec, 11 January, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>. 
</p><p>
GENTLEMEN, 
</p><p>
I take the liberty most heartily to condole with you on the 
loss of the great, amiable, and brave General Montgomery, and 
those brave men who fell with him. By his death the command of the army devolves on me ; of course, I have care 
fully examined his instructions from the Honorable Continental 
Congress, and their resolutions respecting this country. I find 
it strongly recommended to him to conciliate the affections of 
the Canadians, and cherish every dawning of liberty which appears among them, and to assure them of the protection and 
friendship of the Congress, and to endeavour to form, on a lasting  basis, a firm union between them and the Colonies, by 
forming a Provincial Congress, and from that body giving them 
a full representation in the grand Continental Congress. This, I am confident, the General labored with the greatest assiduity, 
and with as great a degree of success as could be expected under the present state of affairs. 
</p><p>
The disposition of the Canadians is very favorable to your 
wishes ; the only bar of consequence is Quebec. As this is 
the key, so, in a great measure, it governs the whole country, who having been so long habituated to slavery, and having, 
as yet, but a faint sense of the value of liberty, are naturally timorous and diffident, and want every possible encouragement to take an active part. This bar removed, I humbly conceive every other obstacle to a firm and lasting union with 
Canada will of course be removed. So long as Quebec remains 
in the hands of the enemy, it will not be in our power to 
assist and protect them ; of course, we cannot expect their hearty 
exertions in our favor. Quebec appears to me an object of 
the highest importance to the Colonies, and, if proper methods 
are adopted, must inevitably fall into their hands before the 
garrison can be relieved. 
</p><p>
The whole garrison of Quebec, including men, women, and children, is supposed, by a gentleman who left town the beginning of December, to be four thousand; a gentleman of veracity 
assures me, that Mr. Alsop, the King's Commissary, told him, in confidence, that there were not one thousand barrels of flour in the town ; and it was notorious among the merchants, that there were not eight thousand bushels of wheat, and no conveniency for flouring it. Provisions of meat were known to be 
much less than those of bread, though they had some quantity of fish. It is generally agreed they had short of four months 
provision on the 1st December. This cannot be exactly ascertained, as the Governor denied the inhabitants liberty of viewing 
the stores, or giving them any satisfaction in regard to the quantity. 
</p><p>
It appears a blockade must answer our purpose ; it is possible 
it may not. Will it be prudent to trust an object of such vast 
importance to the event? With submission, I think it will not. 
What is to be done? A sufficient force employed to reduce it 
by a regular siege, or assault ? If the first is attempted, an addition of three thousand men. to our present force will, I make no 
doubt, be thought necessary; if the latter, at least five thousand. 
The former, with a vast expense and great waste of ammunition, 
may prove unsuccessful; the latter, from the extensiveness of 
their works, I think cannot; and five thousand men will hardly 
be a sufficient garrison, if the place is taken. 
</p><p>
I beg leave to recommend the sending a body of at least live 
thousand men, with an experienced General, into Canada as early 
as possible ; and, in the mean time, that every possible preparation 
of mortars, howitzers, and some heavy cannon should be made, 
as the season will permit our raising batteries by the middle of 
March, which may very possibly be attended with success, as we 
can place our mortars under cover within two hundred yards of 
the walls, and within one thousand of the centre of the town : 
and, if supplied with shells, carcasses, &c., can set fire to it, 
whenever we please, which I make no doubt would reduce the 
garrison to terms. I am well assured more than one half of the 
inhabitants of Quebec would gladly open the gates to us, but arc 
prevented by the strict discipline and watch kept over them ; the 
command of the guards being constantly given to officers of the 
Crown, known to be firm in their interest. 
</p><p>
The garrison consists of about fifteen hundred men, great part 
of whom Governor Carleton can place no confidence in, or he 
would not suffer a blockade, and every distress of a siege, by 
seven hundred men, our force consisting of no more at present, 
including Colonel Livingston's regiment of two hundred Canadians. I have arranged my men in such order as effectually to 
blockade the city, and to assist each other as early as possible, 
if attacked. The men are obliged to lie on their arms constantly, 
arid to mount guard every other night. Their duty is exceeding ly hard. However, the men appear alert and cheerful, though 
wanting many necessaries, which cannot be procured here. I Expect General Wooster from Montreal with a reenforcement every 
minute. I have withdrawn our cannon from the battery, and 
placed them round the magazine, which contains a considerable 
quantity of powder and ordnance stores, which I am fearful of 
removing, lest it should make unfavorable impressions on the 
Canadians, and induce them to withdraw their assistance, and 
Governor Carleton, presuming on our panic, to sally out. I 
thought it most prudent to put the best face on matters, and be 
tray no marks of fear. 
</p><p>
We are in great want of cash. Our finances have never afforded any of consequence to the troops, who make heavy complaints, not without reason. We have often been reduced to a 
few Johannes, and never able to procure more than ten days 
sustenance beforehand. Our whole dependence has been on Mr. 
Price, who has done every tiling in his power, and is the only 
resource we have at present. I have received two petards from 
Mons. Pallasier at Three Rivers, who assures me he can supply us with shells by the 1st of April. Inclosed is a list of officers, 
killed and wounded in the unfortunate attack on Quebec. The 
prisoners and missing amount to about four hundred. Governor 
Carleton has permitted the baggage of both officers and men to 
be sent in, and (strange to tell) treats them with humanity. I 
think myself in justice bound to acknowledge the good conduct 
and intrepidity of both officers and men of my detachment, who 
undauntedly marched up in the face of the enemy's cannon ; in 
particular the volunteers, and Captain Oswald, who signalized 
himself in the attack on their battery, and is now a prisoner. 
</p><p>
I hope, gentlemen, my being confined to my bed with my 
wound, and a severe fit of the gout, will apologize for the incoherency and incorrectness of my scrawl ; and that you will believe 
me, with the greatest respect and esteem, Gentlemen, yours, &c., 
</p><p>
