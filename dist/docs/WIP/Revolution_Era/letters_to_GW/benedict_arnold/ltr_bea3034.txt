GENERAL ARNOLD TO GENERAL SCHUYLER. 
</p><p>
Chamblce, 13 June, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>, 10 o clock, P. M. 
</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Since writing the foregoing, I arrived here, and met Dr. Center, who left Sorel at 12 o clock this day. He informs me that 
General Thompson, Colonel Irvine, Drs. McKenny and Me Cawley, Lieutenants Bird and Curry are prisoners, and about forty 
men missing. General Thompson has wrote for his baggage, 
which has been sent to him. Burgoyne is with the enemy. Seventy transports, and, by the best accounts, ten thousand troops, 
are arrived in Quebec. The whole force we can muster does not 
exceed four thousand effectives, when they are all collected. I 
have wrote General Sullivan my opinion very freely, which is, 
to collect our whole force at St. John's immediately, and secure 
our retreat. I am told his intention is to remain at Sorel, until 
attacked by the enemy. I believe there will be little danger of 
it. I make no doubt the enemy will pass Sorel, and, as soon as 
in possession of Montreal, march immediately for St. John s, and 
endeavour to cut off our retreat. In which case, if we save our 
army, the cannon and heavy baggage must fall into the hands 
of the enemy. 
</p><p>
All the craft on your side the Lake, in my opinion, ought immediately to be sent to St. John s, and a number of gondolas 
built as soon as possible to guard the Lake. You may expect 
soon to hear of our evacuating Canada, or being prisoners. I go 
to Montreal in the morning, where I shall remain until I have 
orders to quit it, or am attacked, when it will be too late. I 
am, respectfully, dear General, 
</p><p>
Yours, &c., 
</p><p>
