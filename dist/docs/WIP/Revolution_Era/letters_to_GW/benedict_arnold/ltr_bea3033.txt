GENERAL ARNOLD TO GENERAL SCHUYLER.

St. John s, 13 June, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I wrote you a few days since, from Montreal, that I had seized 
a parcel of goods for the use of the army, by particular orders 
from the Commissioners of Congress. Our hurry and confusion 
was so great when the goods were received, it was impossible 
to take a particular account of them. Every man's name was 
marked on his particular packages, with intention of taking a 
particular account of them at Chamblee, or St. John s, where the 
goods were ordered to be stored. Major Scott was sent with them, 
with orders to have them stored under the care of Colonel Ilazen, 
who commanded at Chamblee. On his arrival there, he received 
orders from General Sullivan to repair to Sorel. Colonel Ilazen refused taking the goods into store, or taking any charge of them. 
They were heaped in piles on the bank of the river. Colonel 
Hazen finally received them, and placed sentinels over them. 
They were, however, neglected in such a manner, that great 
part were stolen or plundered. On receiving this intelligence, I 
repaired to Chamblee ; the goods were sent to St. John's by 
Colonel Hazen, in different parcels, all under the care of a French 
Corporal, and through them, I found the goods broken open, 
plundered, and all mixed together in the greatest confusion, and 
great part missing. Mr. McCarty has General Sullivan's orders, 
and is now receiving the goods. I have sent over to Ticonde-roga a quantity of nails and goods, the property of Thomas 
Walker, Esq., and ordered them to be stored there, and delivered 
to his order. 
</p><p>
We have a report here, that on Sunday last our army, of 
about two thousand men, under the command of General Thompson, attacked the enemy near Three Ivivers, and were repulsed, 
with the loss of twenty men and some bateaux. We have received no particular accounts of this matter, though several days 
have elapsed since the affair happened. 
</p><p>
Near one half of our army are sick, mostly with the smallpox. 
If the enemy have a force of six or eight, and some say ten 
thousand men, we shall not be able to oppose them, sick, divided, ragged, undisciplined, and unofficered, as we are. If we 
are not soon reenforced, I tremble for the event. A loss of our 
heavy cannon, which is all ordered to Sorel, must ensue, if not 
of our army, as our retreat is far from being secured. Not one 
stroke has been struck to secure our encampment here. I have 
ordered men out to-morrow morning to inclose our encampment 
and the two old forts with an abatis and breastwork. 
</p><p>
Dr. Stringer is in a disagreeable situation. Three thousand 
men are sick here and at Chamblee, and no room or conveniency 
for them. I should advise his going to the Isle-aux-Noix, was 
there any conveniency for the sick, or boards to make any. I 
have wrote General Sullivan on the occasion. I have ordered the 
frames of the vessels here taken in pieces, and sent to Crown 
Point. The timbers are all numbered, and easily put together 
again. 
</p><p>
If any more men are ordered for this country, let me entreat 
you to hurry them on, and all the water-craft. I am, dear 
General, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate, obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
