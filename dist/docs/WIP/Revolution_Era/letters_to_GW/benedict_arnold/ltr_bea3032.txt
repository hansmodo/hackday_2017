GENERAL ARNOLD TO GENERAL SULLIVAN.

Chamblcc, 10 [11?] June, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I went to St. John's yesterday, where I found every thing in 
the greatest confusion ; not one stroke done to fortify the camp ; 
the engineer a perfect sot ; at that place and this-, near three 
thousand sick. I have given orders that the sick draw only half 
rations in future. I have ordered Colonel Antill to St. John s, 
and an abatis and lines to be immediately begun, to inclose the 
two old forts, and an encampment sufficient to hold six thousand 
men. 
</p><p>
I am fully of opinion not one minute ought to be lost in securing  our retreat, and saving our heavy cannon, baggage, and provisions. The enemy will never attack you at Sorel. Their force 
is doubtless much superior to ours, and we have no advice of 
any reinforcements. Shall we sacrifice the few men we have, 
by endeavouring to keep possession of a small part of the country, 
which can be of little or no service to us ? The junction of the 
Canadians with the Colonies, an object which brought us into 
this country, is now at an end. Let us quit them, and secure 
our own country, before it is too late. There will be more honor 
in making a safe retreat, than hazarding a battle against such 
superiority, which will doubtless be attended with the loss of men, 
artillery, &c., and the only pass to our country. These arguments are not urged by fear for my personal safety. I am content to be the last man who quits this country, and fall, so that 
my country rise. But let us not fall all together. 
</p><p>
The goods I seized at Montreal and sent to Chamblee, under 
the care of Major Scott, have been broken open, plundered, and 
huddled together in the greatest confusion. They were taken in 
such a hurry it was impossible to take a particular account of 
them. Each man's name was marked on his packages. When 
Major Scott arrived at Chamblee, he received your positive orders 
to repair to Sorel. The guard was ordered to return, and the 
goods to be delivered to Colonel Hazen, to be stored. He refused 
receiving or taking any care of them, by which means, and Major 
Scott's being ordered away, the goods have been opened and 
plundered, I believe, to a large amount. It is impossible for 
me to distinguish each man's goods, or ever settle with the 
proprietors. The goods are delivered to Mr. McCarty. This is 
not the first or last order Colonel Hazen has disobeyed. I think 
him a man of too much consequence for the post he is in. I 
am giving him orders to send directly to St. John's all the heavy 
cannon, shot, powder, bateaux, valuable stores, and the sick. I 
go to Montreal immediately, and beg to have your orders as soon 
as possible for my future conduct. I am, with respect and esteem, dear General, 
</p><p>
Your obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. If you should think proper to retire to St. John s, will 
it not be best to order a number of carts to be ready here from 
the neighbouring parishes, and enforce your order by sending a 
number of armed men to secure them ?
