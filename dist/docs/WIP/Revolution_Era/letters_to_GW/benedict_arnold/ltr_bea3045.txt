FROM MAJOR-GENERAL ARNOLD. 
</p><p>
Cornell's Ferry, 16 June, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1777">1777</a>; 8 o clock, P. M. 
</p><p>
MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I wrote your Excellency yesterday, that the boats, 
scows, &c. ? were sent up the river, eleven miles, to a place called Tohegan, except such as were necessary 
here, which would be secured from the enemy in case 
of their approach. Since which I have had no direct, 
and but very imperfect intelligence from your Excellency. I am at a loss if any part of your army has 
removed from <a href='/results.php?city=middlebrook' rel='city'>Middlebrook</a>, and more so of your Excellency's intentions. The enemy, I am informed, are 
at Somerset Heights, intrenching. General Sullivan 
is at Flemington, with sixteen hundred Continental 
troops, the Jersey militia, and one thousand men I 
have sent him from this place, half Continental, the 
others militia, I expect Colonel Bull here to-morrow, 
with five hundred State troops, part of two battalions 
engaged for the war. 
</p><p>
General Mifflin wrote me yesterday, that the City 
militia will move this morning; I am informed there 
are about two thousand of them ; they bring ten 
pieces cannon, and one royal howitzer, two hundred 
tents, one thousand felling axes, one thousand spades 
and shovels. One quarter part of the militia of this 
State are ordered out immediately, except two of the 
western counties. The whole, including the City 
militia, I am informed, will make ten thousand men. 
Three thousand of the Southern Continental troops 
are on their march, and will be in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> in 
the course of a week ; six heavy pieces cannon, 
four galleys, and ten armed boats, are arrived at Bristol and <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a> ferries. The enemy must be desperate indeed, if they attempt to push for <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
</p><p>
As the militia can be but illy spared at this busy 
season, I wish to know, as early as possible, your Excellency's orders respecting them ; if you wish to have 
them in the Jerseys or on this side the Delaware. 
If the latter, for the defence of the passes on the river, one half will effectually answer the purpose. I 
have examined; and inclosed your Excellency a sketch 
of the passes between this and <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a> Ferry. Four 
or five thousand men, with a few pieces of cannon, 
will effectually guard the whole, and as for down as 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, with the assistance of the galleys and 
armed boats, against twenty thousand men. Above 
Coryell's Ferry, I am convinced the enemy will never 
attempt to pass. I hope the troops will be ordered 
for a different purpose, that of securing the enemy 
where they are, in the Jerseys. If they are detained 
here, I shall employ them in fortifying the banks of 
the river against the passes. 
</p><p>
I have sent off, this evening, via Flemington, four 
wagons, and musket cartridges sixty-six thousand, 
under an escort of seventy-five men. I have only 
to add, with great respect and esteem, I am 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
