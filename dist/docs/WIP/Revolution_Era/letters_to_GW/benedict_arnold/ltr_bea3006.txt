DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I am now to acknowledge your Excellency's favors 
of the 6th and 20th ultimo, and 3d instant. On receipt of the former, I was ordered to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, with the 
view of collecting four or five Continental battalions 
for our intended attack. On my return, General Spencer thought it necessary for me to go to Point Judith, 
from whence I returned last night, and was then presented with your Excellency's favors of the last date, prior to the receipt of which we had laid aside all 
thoughts of making a general attack on Rhode Island. The new levies of the Massachusetts Bay being all ordered to <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, and those of Connecticut inoculated for the smallpox, deprives us of the aid of 
Continental troops, on whom we had placed our chief dependence. 
</p><p>
When the attack was first proposed, we had reason 
to think your Excellency had a force superior to the 
enemy in the Jerseys. I am sorry to say, we now 
have reason to think the case is altered. After duly 
weighing the matter, and considering the difficulties 
and risk of attacking and making good a retreat, and 
the fatal consequences attending the failure of success, I was dubious of the propriety of the attack, as 
the enemy now rest secure and easy in their quarters. 
I am fully of opinion it will be imprudent to force 
them to action, until our new levies are in a manner 
complete. From our strength and numbers, which do 
not exceed four thousand raw militia, we have no reasonable prospect of succeeding against four thousand 
well-disciplined troops. Notwithstanding, the Assembly 
of this State have lately requested General Spencer to 
make an attack on the enemy on Rhode Island, which 
he seems inclined to do, and the militia are collecting 
for the purpose. It is proposed to attack the west 
end of the Island, with three thousand men. I am 
much averse to this plan, as I am fearful it will bring 
on a general action, and end in our disgrace, or cause 
the troops in Newport to embark, both of which I 
wish to avoid at this critical juncture. From some 
of our own people, and several deserters from the 
enemy, we are informed they are near four thousand strong. It is said two thousand have lately arrived 
at Newport from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. I am rather inclined to 
think they are a body of men lately sent to Martha's 
Vineyard, for ten transports passed Point Judith 
this day week to the westward, and appeared full of 
troops. Twenty odd sail are gone to England, and 
fifty sail remain at Newport. 
</p><p>
I am greatly obliged to your Excellency for interesting yourself so much in my behalf in respect to 
nay appointment, which I have had no advice of, and 
know not by what means it was announced in the 
papers. I believe none but the printer has a mistake to rectify. Congress have doubtless a right of 
promoting those, whom, from their abilities, their long 
and arduous services, they esteem most deserving. 
Their promoting junior officers to the rank Major-General, I view 7 as a very civil way of requesting 
my resignation, as unqualified for the office I hold. 
My commission was conferred unsolicited, received 
with pleasure only as a means of serving my country. With equal pleasure I resign it, when I can no 
longer serve my country with honor. The person 
who, void of the nice feelings of honor, will tamely 
condescend to give up his rights, and hold a commission at the expense of his reputation, I hold as a 
disgrace to the army, and unworthy of the glorious 
cause in which we are engaged. 
</p><p>
When I entered the service of my country, my 
character was unimpeached. I have sacrificed my interest, ease, and happiness in her cause. It is rather 
a misfortune than a fault, that my exertions have not 
been crowned with success. I am conscious of the 
rectitude of my intentions. In justice, therefore, to 
my own character, and for the satisfaction of my 
friends, I must request a court of inquiry into my con-duct; and, though I sensibly feel the ingratitude of 
my countrymen, every personal injury shall he buried 
in my zeal for the safety and happiness of my country, in whose cause I have repeatedly fought and 
bled, and am ready at all times to resign my life. I 
shall cautiously avoid any hasty step, in consequence 
of the appointments that have taken place, that may 
tend to injure my country." 
</p><p>
Particular attention shall be paid to your Excellency's commands respecting the prisoners. I have 
the honor to be, with very great respect and esteem, 
your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
