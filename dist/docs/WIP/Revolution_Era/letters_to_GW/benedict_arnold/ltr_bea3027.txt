GENERAL ARNOLD TO THE COMMISSIONERS. 
</p><p>
La Chine, 25 May, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>. 
</p><p>
GENTLEMEN, 
</p><p>
One of our men this moment came in, who was taken at the Cedars. He made his escape this morning, and says we have 
lost only ten privates killed; the rest are prisoners at St. Ann's 
and the Cedars. The enemy lost double that number. They 
were last night within three miles of us, with three hundred 
savages, fifty regulars, and two hundred and fifty Canadians, with 
our two pieces of cannon ; but, on hearing we had a large body 
of men here, they made a precipitate retreat. He left them 
above Point Clare. They have only twenty-one canoes, which 
will carry eight or nine men on an average. 
</p><p>
I intend to send off four hundred men in bateaux immediately, 
to proceed to the Isle Perot, and endeavour to cut off the enemy's retreat. I expect they will make some stay at Fort St. 
Ann s, by which it may possibly be effected. Pray, hurry on 
the men as fast as possible. I shall push them on from this immediately. We have so much water-craft, that we can always 
keep up a communication between those on land and those on 
water, and be able to act in concert. I am, Gentlemen, &c., 
</p><p>
