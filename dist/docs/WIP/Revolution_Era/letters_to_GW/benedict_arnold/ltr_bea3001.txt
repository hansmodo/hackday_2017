MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 
</p><p>
My last, of the 20th ultimo, from Point-aux-Trem-blcs, advising of my retiring from before Quebec, I 
make no doubt your Excellency has received. I continued at Point-aux-Trembles until the 3d instant, 
when, to my great joy, General Montgomery joined us, 
with artillery, and about three hundred men. Yester 
day we arrived here, and are making all possible preparation to attack the city, which has a wretched 
motley garrison of disaffected seamen, marines, and 
inhabitants ; the walls in a ruinous situation, and can 
not hold out long.

Inclosed is a return of my detachment, amounting 
to six hundred and seventy-five men, for whom I have 
received clothing of General Montgomery. I hope 
there will soon be provision made for paying the 
soldiers arrearages, as many of them have families 
who are in want. A continual hurry has prevented 
my sending a continuation of my journal. I am, with 
very great respect, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient humble servant,
