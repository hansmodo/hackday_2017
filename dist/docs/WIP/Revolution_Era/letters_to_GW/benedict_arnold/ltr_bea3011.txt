DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I wrote you yesterday from Point Levy, by an express sent from Sorel, by Colonel Easton, of my intention of crossing the St. 
Lawrence, which I happily effected between nine and four in the 
morning, without being discovered, until my party of five hundred 
men were nearly all over, when a frigate's barge, coming up, 
discovered our landing and prevented our surprising the town. 
We lired into her, and killed three men. 
</p><p>
I am this minute informed, by a gentleman from town, that 
Colonel McLean had determined to pay us a visit this morning, 
with six hundred men and some field-pieces. We are prepared, 
and anxious to see him. Others from town inform me, that the 
inhabitants in general had laid down their arms. By the best 
information, they are in the greatest confusion, very short of wood 
and provisions, much divided, and refused provisions from the 
inhabitants ; and if blocked up by a superior force, must, as soon 
as the frost sets in, surrender. 
</p><p>
I have thought proper to despatch the bearer to inform you of 
my situation, as also with a request I have to make. I must 
refer you to him for particulars ; as I have been so unfortunate in 
my former letters, I do not choose to commit every intelligence 
to writing. It is the current report here, that you have invested 
Montreal and cut off their retreat. This I hope is true, and 
that I shall soon have the pleasure of seeing you here. I am, 
dear Sir, with great respect, 
</p><p>
Your obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. Since writing the foregoing, the enemy found means to 
make prisoner of one of our out-sentinels. I immediately invested 
the town, as near as possible, with my troops, which has occasioned them to set fire to the suburbs of St. John's ; and several 
of the houses without the wall are now in flames. B. A.
