DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Your kind favor of the 17th I received four days since. I am 
greatly obliged to you for the friendship you express on my 
safety and having escaped the enemy. 
</p><p>
I am extremely glad to hear the militia are coming to our 
assistance. I believe the enemy, from the best accounts we can 
collect, are endeavouring to fortify Crown Point. I am afraid 
we shall not be able to detain a sufficient garrison for this place 
from the troops now here. 
</p><p>
A boom will be laid across the Lake this day, and a bridge 
to-morrow from <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> to Mount Independence. We cannot 
ascertain the strength of the enemy. In a few days we shall be 
ready to make a trial of their force, if they think proper to 
attack us. I have only time to add my most respectful compliments. and that I am, with every friendly wish, dear General, 
Your affectionate and obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>.
