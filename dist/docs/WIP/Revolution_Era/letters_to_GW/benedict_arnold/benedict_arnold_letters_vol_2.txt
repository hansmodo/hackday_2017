DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have been honored with your Excellency's two 
letters of the 26th and 28th April, and am extremely sorry to find it should be thought there was anesty of postponing my trial to so late a period 
as June or July, from no other reason than the President and Council of this State representing that 
the period appointed for the purpose, and the previous notice given, were too short to admit of the 
necessary evidence being produced in time. 
</p><p>
Their pretence of the witnesses being in Virginia 
and Carolina, and the time being too short to produce them, I can view in no other light than a base, 
pitiful evasion; evidently calculated to put off the 
trial, that my character, unjustly aspersed, may still 
suffer, while the villains who have injured me cowardly cloak themselves under office. They have had 
three months to look for evidence, and cannot produce one against me v I suppose the gentlemen they mention being in Carolina are my two Aids, gone there, as volunteers, to spend the summer. They left 
this city long since the Court-Martial was ordered, 
and might easily have been detained, had the Council thought proper to do it. 
</p><p>
Believe me, my dear General, the whole is nothing 
more than pretence and artifice to delay the matter, 
the final determination of which must make the President and Council appear to the world in their true 
colors, as a set of unprincipled, malicious scoundrels; 
who have prostituted their honor and truth, for the 
purpose of gratifying their private resentment against 
an innocent person. 
From a candid view of the charges and whole proceedings against me, contained in the papers transmitted to your Excellency, you must be fully persuaded I have been unjustly accused, and that I have 
been refused justice from Congress on the report of 
their Committee. 
</p><p>
From a knowledge of my public conduct, since I 
have been in the army, no man is a better judge if 
I have merited the treatment I have received. If 
your Excellency thinks me criminal, for Heaven's sake 
let me be immediately tried, and, if found guilty, 
executed. I want no favor ; I ask only for justice. 
If it is denied me from your Excellency, I have 
nowhere to seek it but of the candid public, before 
whom I shall be under the necessity of laying the 
whole matter. Let me beg of you, Sir, to consider 
that a set of artful, unprincipled men, in office, may 
misinterpret the most innocent actions; and, by raising the public clamor against your Excellency, place 
you in the same disagreeable situation I am in. 
</p><p>
Having made every sacrifice of fortune and blood, 
and become a cripple in the service of my country, 
I little expected to meet the ungrateful returns I 
have received of my countrymen; but, as Congress 
have stamped ingratitude as a current coin, I must 
take it. I wish your Excellency, for your long and 
eminent services, may not be paid in the same coin. 
</p><p>
I have nothing left but the little reputation I have gained in the army. Delay, in the present case, is 
worse than death ; and, when it is considered that 
the President and Council have had three months to 
produce" their evidence, I cannot suppose the ordering a Court-Martial to determine the matter immediately, 
in the least precipitating the matter, which, in justice, 
the President and Council wish to put off until the 
campaign opens \ concluding, undoubtedly, that the 
service will then prevent the Court from sitting, the 
trial postponed until the end of the campaign, and 
their cruel and villanous purposes answered. I must,therefore, entreat your Excellency that a Court-Martial 
may be ordered to sit as soon as possible ; and, if 
the Court find sufficient reasons, they will of course 
adjourn to a longer time. Not doubting my request 
will be granted, I have the honor to be, with the 
highest respect and esteem, your Excellency's 
Most obedient, humble servant,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I am requested, by the Board of Admiralty, to in 
form your Excellency that they have in contemplation an expedition with several of their frigates, which 
will require three or four hundred land forces to act 
in conjunction, and who may act as marines when on 
board, which will obviate the great difficulty of pro 
curing men for the ships. They wish to be informed 
if the men can be spared from the army. They will 
be wanted to embark (probably at New London) by 
the middle of April, for an expedition of about two months. If seamen can be drafted, they will be much 
preferable to other troops. 
</p><p>
From the injury I have received in my leg, and 
the great stiffness in my ankle, my surgeons are of 
opinion it will not be prudent for me to take a command in the army for some time to come. As I 
wish to render my country every service in my 
power, I have offered the Board to take the command 
of the expedition, provided it is agreeable to your Excellency, and the men can be spared from the army; in which case, I shall soon have the honor of 
laying the plan before your Excellency, and believe 
you will think it an object of importance. 
</p><p>
I have just received a letter from Major Clarkson, dated <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, January 30th, who writes me, 
that " the fleet which sailed from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> in December, are certainly arrived and arriving at <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> ; their force uncertain, but very large." Two 
of our frigates have captured a brigantine, with clothing, and two sloops, with dragoons of Lord Cathcart's 
legion, who have saved only two horses of forty-five. 
The fleet were dispersed in a few days after they 
sailed, and greatly injured by several storms. 
</p><p>
I suppose your Excellency will receive particular information from Congress. I have the honor to be, 
with great respect and esteem, your Excellency's 
Affectionate and obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>

<a rel="month origin" value="3">March</a> <a rel="day origin" value="20">20th</a>. Dear Sir, The foregoing is a copy 
of a letter I did myself the honor of writing your Excellency, which went by express the day it was 
wrote, from Colonel Mitchei's office. As a fortnight 
has elapsed, and I have not been favored with an 
answer, I conclude the letter has miscarried ; I there 
fore take the liberty of sending a copy. If the 
service will not admit of a draft of men from the 
army, the expedition must, of course, be declined, as there is not the least probability of manning the 
ships without; in which case, I must request of your Excellency a leave of absence for the ensuing sum 
mer, or until my wounds are so well as to admit 
my riding and walking with some degree of ease, 
and, of course, being able to take the command of a 
division in the army. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will believe I should not ask this 
indulgence, could I, with justice to myself or country, take a command in the condition I am at present. My surgeons flatter me that a voyage to sea, 
and bathing frequently in salt water, will be of great 
service in strengthening my leg, and relaxing the 
muscles, which are greatly contracted, and thereby 
rendering it more useful. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Arnold yesterday presented me with a son. 
She joins me in best respects to Mrs. <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>. I 
have the honor to be, very sincerely and affectionately, your Excellency's

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 19th instant was delivered to me last evening, and I am happy to hear that you are well and have joined 
the army. I beg leave to congratulate you on our late success 
over the enemy by the troops commanded by General Stark. I 
make no doubt it will have a happy effect. 
</p><p>
I leave this place this morning with twelve hundred Continental troops, officers included, and a handful of militia, for Fort 
Schuyler, which is still besieged by a number equal to ours. 
Nothing shall be omitted that can be done to raise the siege. 
You will hear of my being victorious, or no more ; and, as soon 
as the safety of this part of the country will permit, I will fly to 
your assistance. 
</p><p>
General Herkimer died yesterday. I will make your compliments and return your thanks to the other gentlemen when I 
have the pleasure of seeing them. 
I am credibly informed that General St. Leger has sent to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a> for a reinforcement. I believe it will not be 
in his power to spare them, except they have marched before the 
late action, which may be worth inquiring into. 
</p><p>
I am, &c.,

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I wrote to you the 2 1st instant from German Flats, that, from 
the best intelligence I could procure of the enemy's strength, it 
was much superior to ours. At the same time I inclosed you a 
copy of the resolutions of a Council of War, and requested you 
to send me a reinforcement of one thousand light troops. As 
the enemy had made their approaches within two hundred yards 
of the Fort, I was determined, at all events, to hard a battle 
rather than to suffer the garrison to fall a sacrifice. This morning I marched from the German Flats for this place. The excessively bad roads, and necessary precautions in marching through a thick wood, retarded us so much, that we have but this moment 
reached this place, where I have met with an express, with the 
inclosed letter from Colonel Gansevoort, acquainting me that the 
enemy had yesterday retired from Fort Schuyler with great precipitation. I am at a loss to judge of their real intentions, whether they have returned home, or retired with a view of engaging 
us on the road. I am inclined to the former, from the accounts 
of the deserters, and from their leaving their tents and a considerable baggage, which our people have secured. 
</p><p>
I shall immediately detach about nine hundred men, and make a forced march to the Fort, in hopes of coming up with their 
rear, and securing their cannon and heavy baggage. My artillery, tents, &c., &c., I shall leave here. The bateaux, with the 
provisions, follow me. As soon as the security of the post will 
permit, I will return with as many men as can be spared. As I 
came down in bateaux, I shall be able to make despatch. I have 
sent an order for the light troops, if you have sent any, to return 
immediately, and the militia to go home. 
</p><p>
I am, &c.,

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The 24th instant, in the evening, I reached Fort Schuyler, but 
too late, after so fatiguing a march, to pursue the enemy that 
evening. Early the next morning, a detachment of five hundred 
men followed them. Soon after, a heavy rain came on, which 
obliged them to return, excepting a small party, who went to 
the Oneida Lake, where they arrived just in time to see the 
last boats of the enemy going off. The 26th proved a rainy day, 
so that it was impossible for the troops to move until the evening, when I sent off Colonel Livingston's and Colonel Jackson's 
regiments. Yesterday, Bailey's and Wesson's left Fort Schuyler, 
and arrived here last evening. The greatest despatch is made in 
getting their boats over the Falls. 
</p><p>
You may depend on my joining you as soon as possible with 
my detachment, about twelve hundred men. Few Indians will 
be with me. The Oneidas and Tuscaroras, of all the Six Nations, are our only friends. The Commissioners have frequently 
told them that they wished them to observe a strict neutrality, 
and that they would never ask them to take up arms. I found 
their head men determined to follow the advice of the Commissioners ; and therefore I did not urge the young men to join me, 
though I am told by Mr. Deane that most of them may be induced to do it. I have despatched a messenger to them, acquainting them that you wish to see them immediately ; and that, as 
you are a warrior, they might naturally judge of the subject on 
which you would speak to them. 
</p><p>
I have left Gansevoort's and Van Schaick's regiments, consisting of seven hundred men, at Fort Schuyler. One company of the 
latter garrisons Fort Dayton ; and a second, Fort Johnson. They 
are supplied with two months provisions, and a good store of 
ammunition. 
</p><p>
I believe there is nothing to be feared from the enemy in this 
quarter at present. I have made your compliments and done your message to Colonels Gansevoort and Willett. 
</p><p>
I am, &c., 
</p><p>
