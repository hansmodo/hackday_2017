MAY IT PEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 
</p><p>
My last, of the 14th instant, was from Point Levy. The same 
evening I passed the St. Lawrence without obstruction, except 
from a barge, into which we fired, and killed three men ; but, 
as the enemy were apprised of our coming, and the garrison 
augmented to near seven hundred men, besides the inhabitants, 
it was not thought proper to storm the place, but cut off their 
communication with the country, until the arrival of General 
Montgomery. We accordingly invested the town with about five 
hundred and fifty effective men, took possession of the Nunnery, 
and Colonel C.'s house, about half a league from town. We 
marched up several times near the walls, in hopes of drawing 
them out, but to no effect, though they kept a constant cannon 
ading, and killed us one man.

On the 18th, having intelligence that Captain Napier, in an 
armed snow, with near two hundred men, having made his 
escape from Montreal, was very near, and that the garrison, furnished with a number of good field-pieces, intended attacking us 
the next day, I ordered a strict examination to be made into 
the state of our arms and ammunition, when, to my great surprise, 
I found many of our cartridges unfit for use, which, to appearance, 
were very good, and that we had no more than five rounds to 
each man. It was judged prudent, in our situation, not to hazard 
a battle, but retire to this place, eight leagues from Quebec, which we did yesterday, and are waiting here with impatience 
the arrival of General Montgomery, which we expect in a few days. 
</p><p>
I have been obliged to send to Montreal for clothing for my 
people, about six hundred and fifty in the whole, who are almost 
naked, and in want of every necessary. I have been as careful 
of cash as possible, but shall soon have occasion for hard money. 
As the French have been such sufferers from paper heretofore, 
and mine so large, I thought it not prudent to offer it them at 
present. I have written to General Montgomery my situation 
and wants, which I expect will be supplied by him. Had I 
been ten days sooner, Quebec must inevitably have fallen into 
our hands, as there was not a man then to oppose us. However, 
I make no doubt General Montgomery \vill reduce it this winter, 
if properly supported with men, which, in my opinion, cannot 
in the whole be less than two thousand five hundred, though it 
may possibly be effected with a less number. The fatigue will 
be severe at this season and in this inclement climate. I have 
the honor to be, with the greatest respect, your Excellency's 
most obedient and very humble servant,
