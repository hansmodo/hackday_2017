DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 3d of April I received a few 
days since, and I should have answered by the last 
post, but was obliged to go to Chamblee to give 
directions about some gondolas building there. I 
heartily congratulate you on the success of your arms 
against <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and am sorry it is not in my power 
to give you a more pleasing account of our affairs in 
this country, which wear no very favorable aspect at 
present. General Thomas arrived here about ten 
days since, and has joined the army before Quebec. 
General Wooster is disgusted, and expected here 
daily. Our army consists of few more than two 
thousand effective men, and twelve hundred sick and 
unfit for duty, chiefly with smallpox, which is universal in the country. We have very little provisions, 
no cash, and less credit; and, until the arrival of the 
heavy cannon and two mortars from <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>, our 
artillery has been trifling. The mortars I expect will 
reach the camp to-morrow, and shells can be supplied from Three Rivers. I hope they will have the desired effect ; the want of cash has greatly retarded 
our operations in this country. We are fortifying 
two very important posts, which command the river 
at Richelieu, fifteen leagues above, and at Jacques 
Cartier, which commands a pass between two mountains, eleven leagues above Quebec. If succours 
should arrive before we can possess ourselves of Quebec, I hope we shall be able to maintain these two posts until a reenforcement arrives to our assistance, 
which we are told are on their way here. These are the only posts that secure the river, until you approach near Montreal ; and of so much consequence, 
that nothing but superior numbers will oblige us to abandon them. 
</p><p>
I have mounted three twenty-four-pounders on a 
gondola, and armed several bateaux, which go down 
the river to-morrow ; these, with a schooner mounting 
ten guns, and a gondola mounting one twelve-pounder, are all the force we have in the river. Four 
other gondolas are building at Chamblee, calculated 
to mount three heavy pieces of cannon, but will not 
be completed these two weeks. To-morrow I set off 
to the army with no very agreeable prospect before 
me. Should the enemy receive any considerable re-enforcement soon, I make no doubt we shall have 
our hands full. At any rate, we will do all that can 
be expected from raw troops, badly clothed and fed, 
and worse paid, and without discipline. I trust the 
event to <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>. 
</p><p>
We have received advice that the eighth regiment, 
of about four hundred men, with a number of savages, are coming down from the upper countries. I 
have posted five hundred men at the Cedars, a narrow pass fifteen leagues above this place. They have 
two pieces of cannon, and well intrenched, by which 
they must pass. 
</p><p>
I have only time to beg you will accept my best 
wishes and respectful compliments, and make the 
same to the gentlemen of your family. I am, most 
respectfully, dear General, 
</p><p>
Your obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>.
