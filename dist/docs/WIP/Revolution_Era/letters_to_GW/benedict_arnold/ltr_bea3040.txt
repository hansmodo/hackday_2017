GENERAL ARNOLD TO GENERAL GATES. 
</p><p>
Schuyler's Island, 12 October, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Yesterday morning, at eight o clock, the enemy's fleet, consisting of one ship, mounting sixteen guns, one snow, mounting 
the same number, one schooner, of fourteen guns, two of twelve, 
two sloops, a bomb-ketch, and a large vessel (that did not come 
up), with fifteen or twenty flat-bottomed boats, or gondolas, carrying one twelve or eighteen-pounder in their bows, appeared 
off Cumberland Head. We immediately prepared to receive them. 
The galleys and Royal Savage were ordered under way. The 
rest of our fleet lay at an anchor. 
</p><p>
At eleven o clock they ran under the lee of Valcour Island, 
and began the attack. The schooner, by some bad management, 
fell to leeward, and was first attacked. One of her masts was 
wounded, and her rigging shot away. The Captain thought prudent to run her on the point of Valcour, where all the men 
were saved. They boarded her, and at night set fire to her. 
</p><p>
At half past twelve the engagement became general, and very 
warm. Some of the enemy's ships, and all their gondolas, beat 
and rowed up within musket shot of us. They continued a very 
hot fire, with round and grape-shot, until five o clock, when they 
thought proper to retire to about six or seven hundred yards 
distance, and continued the fire until dark. 
</p><p>
The Congress and <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> have suffered greatly. The latter lost her First Lieutenant, killed, Captain and Master wound 
ed. The <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> lost all her officers, except her Captain. 
The <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> was hulled in so many places that she sunk 
about one hour after the engagement was over. The whole 
killed and wounded amounted to about sixty. The enemy landed 
a large number of Indians on the Island, and each shore, who 
kept an incessant fire on us, but did little damage. The enemy 
had, to appearance, upwards of one thousand men in bateaux, 
prepared for boarding. We suffered much for want of seamen 
and gunners. I was obliged myself to point most of the guns 
on board the Congress, which I believe did good execution. The 
Congress received seven shot between wind and water, was hulled 
a dozen times, had her mainmast wounded in two places, and 
her yard in one. The <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> was hulled a number of 
times, her mainmast shot through, and must have a new one. 
Both vessels are very leaky, and want repairing. 
</p><p>
On consulting with General Waterbury and Colonel Wiggles-worth, it was thought prudent to return to Crown Point, every 
vessel's ammunition being nearly three fourths spent, and the 
enemy greatly superior to us in ships and men. At seven 
o clock Colonel Wigglesworth, in the Trumbull, got under way. 
The gondolas and small vessels followed, and the Congress and 
<a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> brought up the rear. The enemy did not attempt 
to molest us. Most of the fleet is this minute come to an 
anchor. The wind is small to the southward. The enemy's 
fleet is under way to leeward, and beating up. As soon as our 
leaks are stopped, the whole fleet will make the utmost despatch to Crown Point, where I beg you will send ammunition, 
and your further orders for us. On the whole, I think we have 
had a very fortunate escape, and have great reason to return 
our humble and hearty thanks to Almighty God, for preserving  and delivering so many of us from our more than savage 
enemies. I am, dear General, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I had not moved on board the Congress when the 
enemy appeared, and lost all my papers and most of my clothes 
on board the schooner. I wish a dozen bateaux, well manned, 
could be sent immediately, to tow up the vessels in case of 
a southerly wind. 
</p><p>
I cannot, in justice to the officers in the fleet, omit mentioning  their spirited conduct during the action.
