DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I was made very unhappy, a few days since, by 
hearing your Excellency was exceedingly ill with a 
fever. I soon after had the pleasure of hearing, 
by Mr. Learned, you were so far recovered as to be 
able to ride out. My fears have not entirely subsided. I am still anxious for your safety, and apprehensive your zeal for the public service will induce 
you to exert yourself before you are perfectly recovered. 
</p><p>
I wrote your Excellency the 11th instant, since 
which our intended expedition against Rhode Island 
is laid aside. We now confine ourselves to a defensive opposition only. Desertions from the Island are 
frequent. The most intelligent persons agree that 
the enemy have six battalions of Hessians, and four 
of British troops ; the whole about four thousand men. 
Several inhabitants, who came from Newport the evenings of the 23d and 25th instant, say that all 
the enemy's transport-ships are hauled off from the 
wharves, their water in, and sails bent, and ready for 
sailing. Sir Peter Parker has sent his baggage on 
board, and was to embark soon. It is said, by their 
seamen, that they are bound for <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. From 
appearances, they will doubtless soon leave Newport, 
and probably join General Howe. 
</p><p>
In my last, I intimated to your Excellency the 
impossibility of my remaining in a disgraceful situation in the army. My being superseded must be 
viewed as an implicit impeachment of my character. 
I therefore requested a court of inquiry into my conduct. I believe the time is near at hand, when I 
can leave this department without any damage to the 
public interest. When that is the case, I will wait 
on your Excellency, not doubting my request will be 
granted, and that I shall be able to acquit myself of 
every charge malice or envy can bring against me. 
</p><p>
General Spencer writes your Excellency very particularly by this opportunity. I have only to add 
my sincere wishes for your restoration to perfect 
health, and preservation in any danger, and am, very 
respectfully, dear General, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate and most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
