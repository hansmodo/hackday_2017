On the Kennebec River, opposite the present town of <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city origin'>Augusta</a>. 
</p><p>
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 
</p><p>
My last, of the 19th instant, from <a href='/results.php?city=newburyport' rel='city'>Newburyport</a>, 
advising of the embarkation of the troops, I make 
no doubt your Excellency received. 
</p><p>
The same day we left Newbury, and arrived safe 
in the river next morning, except a small vessel 
which ran on the rocks, but is since off without damage, and arrived safe. I found the bateaux completed, but many of them smaller than the directions 
given, and very badly built ; of course I have been obliged to order twenty more, to bring on the remainder of the provisions, which will be finished in 
three days. Many of the vessels were detained in 
the river by running aground and head winds, which 
delayed us a day or two. The 23d instant I despatched Lieutenant Steel, of Captain Smith's company, with six men, in two birch canoes, to Chaudiere 
Pond, to reconnoitre, and get all the intelligence he 
possibly could from the Indians, who I find are hunting  there. The same day I despatched Lieutenant 
Church and seven men with a surveyor and pilot, to 
take the exact courses and distances to the Dead 
River, so called, a branch of the Kennebec ; and 
yesterday, the three companies of riflemen, under the 
command of Captain Morgan, embarked with forty-five days provisions, as an advanced party to clear 
the roads over the carrying-places. <a href='/results.php?tla=chg' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Greene</a> 
and Major Bigelow march to-day with the second 
division of three companies. Major Meigs goes off 
to-morrow with the third division, and Colonel Enos 
the next day with the remainder. As soon as the 
whole are embarked, I propose taking a birch canoe 
and joining the advanced party. I have found it 
necessary to divide the detachment for the conveniency of passing the carrying-places, at the first of 
which there are some carriages to be procured. I 
design Chaudiere Pond as a general rendezvous, and 
from thence to march in a body. 
</p><p>
Inclosed is a letter to Mr. Coburn, from the party 
I sent to Quebec, by which your Excellency will see 
all the intelligence I have received. I have conversed with the party, who saw only one Indian, one 
Natanis, a native of Norridgewock, a noted villain; 
and very little credit, I am told, is to be given to 
his information. 
The Indians with Higgins set out by land, and 
are not yet arrived. I have engaged a number of 
good pilots, and believe, by the best information I can 
procure, we shall be able to perform the march in 
twenty days \ the distance about one hundred and 
eighty miles. 
</p><p>
I intended <a href='/results.php?tla=chg' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Greene</a> should have gone on 
with the first division of one company of riflemen,, 
and two companies of musketeers. This was objected to by the Captains of the rifle companies, who 
insist on being commanded by no other persons than 
Captain Morgan and myself. This, Captain Morgan 
tells me, was your Excellency's intention but, as I 
was not acquainted with it before I came away, 
I should be very glad of particular instructions on 
that head, that I may give satisfaction to the field-officers with me. There is at present the greatest 
harmony among the officers, and no accident has 
happened except the loss of one man, supposed to 
be wilfully shot by a private, who is now taking his 
trial by a court-martial. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='colleague met'>Major Mifflin</a> could not send money for the bateaux. The Commissary has been obliged to pay for 
them, with one hundred pounds I have lent him, out 
of the pay received for the month of September, 
and has been obliged to draw an order in favor of 
the bearer, Mr. John Wood, who has engaged to deliver this to your Excellency. I have promised him 
his time and expenses paid. I should be glad the 
manifestoes might be forwarded on by him, if not 
sent with the last intelligence from <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a>, 
to whom I intend sending one of the Indians as 
soon as they arrive. I have the honor to be, very 
respectfully, your Excellency's most obedient 
</p><p>
Humble servant, 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. Since writing the foregoing, I have received 
a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=jor' rel='colleague'>Colonel Reed</a>, with the manifestoes; 
and the court-martial have condemned the man who 
shot the other, to be hanged, which sentence I have 
approved, but have respited him until your Excellency's pleasure in the matter is known, and design 
sending him back in one of the transports. Inclosed 
are all the papers relative to the matter, with his 
confession at the gallows before respited. 
</p><p>
The three first divisions of my detachment are gone forward ; the last goes to-morrow, when I shall join Captain Morgan as soon as possible.

My last, of the 20th ultimo, from Point-aux-Trem-bles, advising of my retiring from before Quebec, I 
make no doubt your Excellency has received. I continued at <a href='/results.php?city=point-aux-trembles' rel='city'>Point-aux-Trembles</a> until the 3d instant, 
when, to my great joy, <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a> joined us, 
with artillery, and about three hundred men. Yesterday we arrived here, and are making all possible preparation to attack the city, which has a wretched 
motley garrison of disaffected seamen, marines, and 
inhabitants ; the walls in a ruinous situation, and can 
not hold out long. 
</p><p>
Inclosed is a return of my detachment, amounting 
to six hundred and seventy-five men, for whom I have 
received clothing of <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a>. I hope 
there will soon be provision made for paying the 
soldiers arrearages, as many of them have families

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I wrote you the 14th ultimo, of our situation and 
prospects, since which nothing of consequence has occurred here. The enemy, to the number of about 
five hundred, have twice sallied out at Palace Gate, 
with design of seizing our field-pieces (near the 
Nunnery) ; but, on our troops advancing to attack 
them, they made a precipitate retreat under cover of 
their guns. Desertions from the garrison are frequent, by which we learn they are much distressed 
for fuel, and must soon burn their houses and ships. 
Two officers, taken at St. John s, were lately sent 
with a flag to the walls, with a view of getting their 
families at liberty, but were refused admittance, 
which, I am told by several deserters, incensed the 
inhabitants very much, and caused a great uneasiness 
in the garrison, who, I believe begin to grow heartily 
tired of salt provisions and confinement. We have 
received a reinforcement of four hundred men; many 
are daily coming in. I hope, in the course of this 
month, we shall have four or five thousand men. I am fearful we shall not be supplied with shot, shells, 
mortars, &c. I am therefore preparing ladders for an 
assault, if necessary. The extensiveness of the works 
I think will render their defence impracticable. 
</p><p>
I have this minute the pleasure of your favor of 
the 27th ultimo. I am greatly obliged to you for 
your good wishes, and the concern you express for 
me. Sensible of the vast importance of this country, 
you may be assured my utmost exertions will not be 
wanting to effect your wishes in adding it to the 
United Colonies. I am fully of your opinion, that 
the balance will turn in whose favor it belongs. The 
repeated successes of our raw, undisciplined troops 
over the flower of the British army, the many unexpected and remarkable occurrences in our favor, are 
plain proofs of the overruling hand of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, 
and justly demand our warmest gratitude to Heaven, 
which I make no doubt will crown our virtuous 
efforts with success. No doubt Administration will 
exert themselves in sending a large force this way 
in the spring ; but if we are fortunate enough to 
reduce the city before they arrive, I make no doubt 
of keeping it, as we shall have the interest of the 
country in general, to which the raising two regiments of Canadians (which Congress have ordered) 
will not a little conduce. 
</p><p>
I am sorry to inform you, notwithstanding every 
precaution that could be used, the smallpox has 
crept in among the troops. We have near one hundred men in the hospital. In general it is favorable; 
very few have died. I have moved the inhabitants 
of the vicinity of Quebec into the country, and hope 
to prevent its spreading any further. 
</p><p>
The severity of the climate, the troops very illy 
clad, and worse paid, the trouble of reconciling matters among the inhabitants, and lately an uneasiness 
amonc; the <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and some other officers, who think themselves neglected in the new arrangement, while those who deserted the cause and went home 
last fall have been promoted ; in short, the choice of difficulties I have had to encounter, has rendered it so very perplexing, that I have often been at a loss 
how to conduct matters. 
</p><p>
As <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a>'s ill state of health will not permit his coming this way, I was in hopes General Lee, or some experienced officer, would have been 
sent to take the command here. The service requires a person of greater abilities and experience than I can pretend to. <a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'>General Wooster</a> writes me his intention of coming down here. I am afraid he will not be able to leave <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>. 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to inform you my wound is 
entirely healed, and I am able to hobble about my 
room. Though my leg is a little contracted and weak, 
I hope soon to be fit for action. We are waiting 
impatiently, expecting to hear of some capital blow 
being struck with you. I beg my compliments to 
the gentlemen of your family; and am, with great 
respect and esteem, dear General, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 3d of April I received a few 
days since, and I should have answered by the last 
post, but was obliged to go to <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a> to give 
directions about some gondolas building there. I 
heartily congratulate you on the success of your arms 
against <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and am sorry it is not in my power 
to give you a more pleasing account of our affairs in 
this country, which wear no very favorable aspect at 
present. General Thomas arrived here about ten 
days since, and has joined the army before Quebec. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'>General Wooster</a> is disgusted, and expected here 
daily. Our army consists of few more than two 
thousand effective men, and twelve hundred sick and 
unfit for duty, chiefly with smallpox, which is universal in the country. We have very little provisions, 
no cash, and less credit; and, until the arrival of the 
heavy cannon and two mortars from <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>, our 
artillery has been trifling. The mortars I expect will 
reach the camp to-morrow, and shells can be supplied from Three Rivers. I hope they will have the desired effect ; the want of cash has greatly retarded 
our operations in this country. We are fortifying 
two very important posts, which command the river 
at Richelieu, fifteen leagues above, and at Jacques 
Cartier, which commands a pass between two mountains, eleven leagues above Quebec. If succours 
should arrive before we can possess ourselves of Quebec, I hope we shall be able to maintain these two posts until a reenforcement arrives to our assistance, 
which we are told are on their way here. These are the only posts that secure the river, until you approach near <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a> ; and of so much consequence, 
that nothing but superior numbers will oblige us to abandon them. 
</p><p>
I have mounted three twenty-four-pounders on a 
gondola, and armed several bateaux, which go down 
the river to-morrow ; these, with a schooner mounting 
ten guns, and a gondola mounting one twelve-pounder, are all the force we have in the river. Four 
other gondolas are building at <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>, calculated 
to mount three heavy pieces of cannon, but will not 
be completed these two weeks. To-morrow I set off 
to the army with no very agreeable prospect before 
me. Should the enemy receive any considerable re-enforcement soon, I make no doubt we shall have 
our hands full. At any rate, we will do all that can 
be expected from raw troops, badly clothed and fed, 
and worse paid, and without discipline. I trust the 
event to <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>. 
</p><p>
We have received advice that the eighth regiment, 
of about four hundred men, with a number of savages, are coming down from the upper countries. I 
have posted five hundred men at the Cedars, a narrow pass fifteen leagues above this place. They have 
two pieces of cannon, and well intrenched, by which 
they must pass. 
</p><p>
I have only time to beg you will accept my best 
wishes and respectful compliments, and make the 
same to the gentlemen of your family. I am, most 
respectfully, dear General, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Yesterday I arrived here, having previously done 
all in my power to forward on the militia from the 
Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut, upwards of six 
thousand of which I hope are in the Jerseys before 
this time. 
</p><p>
There are, at this place and in the vicinity, about two 
thousand men, part of six thousand ordered from the 
New England States. The others are on their march, 
and expected in, in a few days. The enemy's force on 
Rhode Island, by the best intelligence, is five or six 
thousand; one half foreigners, and some few invalids. 
We are informed, by several persons who left New 
port within a few days, that <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>General Clinton</a> is going 
home in the Asia, and has sent his baggage on board, 
and that the troops have orders to hold themselves 
in readiness to embark at a minute's notice, perhaps for <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. I believe they have no intention of 
penetrating the country at present. I beg leave, 
though late, to congratulate your Excellency on your success at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>. It was a most happy stroke, and has greatly raised the sinking spirits of the country. 
</p><p>
We this minute have advice, by a letter from Governor Turnbull, of your further success near Prince 
ton; and report says, Generals Putnam and Mifflin 
have killed and taken two regiments near Bristol. 
We believe this true, as the intelligence comes from 
Newport. People in general are in high spirits. 
This seems a most favorable crisis to dislodge the 
enemy from the country. Heaven grant your Excellency may be able to effect it, and may peace and 
laurels crown your successes ! 
</p><p>
About twelve or fifteen hundred of the enemy are 
dispersed in all the farm-houses on Rhode Island. As 
soon as the militia arrives, I hope we shall be able 
to give a good account of some of them. 
</p><p>
I beg leave to recommend to your Excellency, Captain Samuel Mansfield, to command a company of 
artillery. He was a Lieutenant of artillery last sum 
mer in the Northern Department, and afterwards Captain of a galley in two actions, and behaved with 
great prudence and bravery. Being anxious to continue in the service, and much wanted here, I have 
desired him to engage a number of men. If your 
Excellency should think proper to appoint him, his 
company will be soon filled up, and I dare be responsible for his conduct. 
</p><p>
A Quartermaster is much wanted here. One is appointed by the State for their own troops, but they 
are not able to furnish him with cash. I am, clear General, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
By the best intelligence we have been able to procure of the enemy's force on Rhode Island, it consisted of about six thousand men; eleven regiments 
of British, and four of Hessians. Two thousand embarked the 21st instant, in twenty-four transports, and 
sailed from Newport three days since, supposed for 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, as they were seen off New London, Part of the remainder, believed about fifteen hundred, are 
disposed over the Island in seeming great security. 
They have a small fort opposite Bristol Ferry, and 
are raising a work opposite Fogland Ferry. One of 
their frigates was lately drove from thence, and was 
yesterday replaced by a fifty-gun ship and two tenders, which we are preparing to attack, by guns on 
shore, and our galleys, which are ordered down. 
</p><p>
At a Council of General Officers, held a few days 
since, it was advised to land a body of eight thou 
sand men (if they can be procured) on Rhode Island, 
and attack the enemy in the following manner, namely; Five thousand men, with proper artillery, to embark at Rowland's Ferry and land nearly opposite 
Fogland Ferry, and to take post on a high ground, 
under cover of a thick wood, on the middle of the 
Island, six miles this side of Newport. Three thou 
sand men to embark at Bristol and Rowland's Ferry, 
and attack the enemy in the different posts, a diversion to be made by a party from Seconnet, who are 
to land three miles from Newport. At the same 
time, two fire-ships are to be sent into Newport 
among the transports; two frigates and two galleys 
are to be placed between Bristol and Rowland's Ferry, which, with the batteries, will effectually secure 
our retreat. We are making every necessary preparation of boats, artillery, &c., which will be complete 
in two or three weeks. Nothing will be wanting but 
men. We have, at present, only four thousand. Not 
more than one thousand more (of the six ordered) 
can be expected. With this number, as they are 
chiefly raw militia, I believe your Excellency will not 
think it prudent for us to make a general attack. 
The deficiency I know of no way of making up but 
by calling in four or five Continental regiments from 
the States of Massachusetts Bay and New Hampshire. 
If this number can be procured, we have a good prospect of dislodging the enemy from Newport; if not, 
we must be content to harass them with small parties. I suppose Major-General Spencer has wrote 
your Excellency very particularly on the subject, and 
will wait for your directions in the matter. 
</p><p>
This will be delivered to your Excellency by Captain Mansfield, whom, I recommended, in my last as 
a proper person to command a company of artillery. If your Excellency should think proper to appoint 
him, I beg the favor that he may be allowed to return here immediately. I am, with sentiments of great respect and esteem, Dear General, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate and most obedient, 
</p><p>
Humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I have inclosed a plan of Rhode Island and 
the adjacent country, by which you will observe the 
great difficulty of coining at the enemy, and the necessity of having a superior force, if we land on the 
Island. B. A.

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I am now to acknowledge your Excellency's favors 
of the 6th and 20th ultimo, and 3d instant. On receipt of the former, I was ordered to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, with the 
view of collecting four or five Continental battalions 
for our intended attack. On my return, General Spencer thought it necessary for me to go to Point Judith, 
from whence I returned last night, and was then presented with your Excellency's favors of the last date, prior to the receipt of which we had laid aside all 
thoughts of making a general attack on Rhode Island. The new levies of the Massachusetts Bay being all ordered to <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, and those of Connecticut inoculated for the smallpox, deprives us of the aid of 
Continental troops, on whom we had placed our chief dependence. 
</p><p>
When the attack was first proposed, we had reason 
to think your Excellency had a force superior to the 
enemy in the Jerseys. I am sorry to say, we now 
have reason to think the case is altered. After duly 
weighing the matter, and considering the difficulties 
and risk of attacking and making good a retreat, and 
the fatal consequences attending the failure of success, I was dubious of the propriety of the attack, as 
the enemy now rest secure and easy in their quarters. 
I am fully of opinion it will be imprudent to force 
them to action, until our new levies are in a manner 
complete. From our strength and numbers, which do 
not exceed four thousand raw militia, we have no reasonable prospect of succeeding against four thousand 
well-disciplined troops. Notwithstanding, the Assembly 
of this State have lately requested General Spencer to 
make an attack on the enemy on Rhode Island, which 
he seems inclined to do, and the militia are collecting 
for the purpose. It is proposed to attack the west 
end of the Island, with three thousand men. I am 
much averse to this plan, as I am fearful it will bring 
on a general action, and end in our disgrace, or cause 
the troops in Newport to embark, both of which I 
wish to avoid at this critical juncture. From some 
of our own people, and several deserters from the 
enemy, we are informed they are near four thousand strong. It is said two thousand have lately arrived 
at Newport from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. I am rather inclined to 
think they are a body of men lately sent to Martha's 
Vineyard, for ten transports passed Point Judith 
this day week to the westward, and appeared full of 
troops. Twenty odd sail are gone to England, and 
fifty sail remain at Newport. 
</p><p>
I am greatly obliged to your Excellency for interesting yourself so much in my behalf in respect to 
nay appointment, which I have had no advice of, and 
know not by what means it was announced in the 
papers. I believe none but the printer has a mistake to rectify. Congress have doubtless a right of 
promoting those, whom, from their abilities, their long 
and arduous services, they esteem most deserving. 
Their promoting junior officers to the rank Major-General, I view 7 as a very civil way of requesting 
my resignation, as unqualified for the office I hold. 
My commission was conferred unsolicited, received 
with pleasure only as a means of serving my country. With equal pleasure I resign it, when I can no 
longer serve my country with honor. The person 
who, void of the nice feelings of honor, will tamely 
condescend to give up his rights, and hold a commission at the expense of his reputation, I hold as a 
disgrace to the army, and unworthy of the glorious 
cause in which we are engaged. 
</p><p>
When I entered the service of my country, my 
character was unimpeached. I have sacrificed my interest, ease, and happiness in her cause. It is rather 
a misfortune than a fault, that my exertions have not 
been crowned with success. I am conscious of the 
rectitude of my intentions. In justice, therefore, to 
my own character, and for the satisfaction of my 
friends, I must request a court of inquiry into my con-duct; and, though I sensibly feel the ingratitude of 
my countrymen, every personal injury shall he buried 
in my zeal for the safety and happiness of my country, in whose cause I have repeatedly fought and 
bled, and am ready at all times to resign my life. I 
shall cautiously avoid any hasty step, in consequence 
of the appointments that have taken place, that may 
tend to injure my country." 
</p><p>
Particular attention shall be paid to your Excellency's commands respecting the prisoners. I have 
the honor to be, with very great respect and esteem, 
your Excellency's

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I was made very unhappy, a few days since, by 
hearing your Excellency was exceedingly ill with a 
fever. I soon after had the pleasure of hearing, 
by Mr. Learned, you were so far recovered as to be 
able to ride out. My fears have not entirely subsided. I am still anxious for your safety, and apprehensive your zeal for the public service will induce 
you to exert yourself before you are perfectly recovered. 
</p><p>
I wrote your Excellency the 11th instant, since 
which our intended expedition against Rhode Island 
is laid aside. We now confine ourselves to a defensive opposition only. Desertions from the Island are 
frequent. The most intelligent persons agree that 
the enemy have six battalions of Hessians, and four 
of British troops ; the whole about four thousand men. 
Several inhabitants, who came from Newport the evenings of the 23d and 25th instant, say that all 
the enemy's transport-ships are hauled off from the 
wharves, their water in, and sails bent, and ready for 
sailing. Sir Peter Parker has sent his baggage on 
board, and was to embark soon. It is said, by their 
seamen, that they are bound for <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. From 
appearances, they will doubtless soon leave Newport, 
and probably join General Howe. 
</p><p>
In my last, I intimated to your Excellency the 
impossibility of my remaining in a disgraceful situation in the army. My being superseded must be 
viewed as an implicit impeachment of my character. 
I therefore requested a court of inquiry into my conduct. I believe the time is near at hand, when I 
can leave this department without any damage to the 
public interest. When that is the case, I will wait 
on your Excellency, not doubting my request will be 
granted, and that I shall be able to acquit myself of 
every charge malice or envy can bring against me. 
</p><p>
General Spencer writes your Excellency very particularly by this opportunity. I have only to add 
my sincere wishes for your restoration to perfect 
health, and preservation in any danger, and am, very 
respectfully, dear General, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate and most obedient servant,

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I make no doubt you will soon hear of our misfortune on the 31st ultimo, and be very anxious to know our present situation. Our loss and repulse 
struck an amazing panic into both officers and men, and, had the enemy improved their advantage, our affairs here must have been entirely ruined. It was 
not in my power to prevail on the officers to attempt saving our mortars, which had been placed in St. lioque s. Of course they fell into the hands of the 
enemy. Upwards of one hundred officers and soldiers instantly set off for <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, and it was with the greatest difficulty I could persuade the rest to make a stand. 
</p><p>
The panic soon subsided. I arranged the men in 
such order, as effectually to blockade the city, and 
enable them to assist each other if attacked. It was 
urged, by the officers, to move our ammunition and 
artillery stores, of which we had a large quantity ; 
and, though the risk was great, I could not approve 
the measure, as it would undoubtedly have made unfavorable impressions on the minds of the Canadians, 
and induced them to withdraw their assistance, which 
must have ended in our utter ruin. I therefore put 
the best face on matters, and betrayed no marks of 
fear. I have withdrawn the cannon from our battery, 
and placed them round the magazine. 
</p><p>
Our present force is only seven hundred. I am in 
daily expectation of a reenforcement from <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a> 
of two or three hundred men. I expected <a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'>General Wooster</a>, but find he cannot leave <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>. Colonel Clinton is just arrived. I have put on foot the raising  a regiment of two or three hundred Canadians, 
which I make no doubt of effecting. Our finances 
are very low. However, I hope we shall be able to 
rub along. Mr. Price is our only resource, and has 
exerted himself. I wait with great anxiety the arrival of a reenforcement from below. I have wrote the 
Honorable Congress my opinion, that five thousand 
men will be necessary to insure us Quebec, though 
it may possibly be reduced with a less number; it 
appears a blockade may answer the purpose. I think 
Quebec an object of too much consequence to trust it 
to the event. If reduced, five thousand men will be 
necessary for a garrison. 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 5th ultimo is just come to hand. 
It gives me a most sensible pleasure, to have your 
approbation of my conduct. I beg you would accept 
my thanks for the notice you have been pleased to 
take of me and my officers in your new establishment. Most of them are provided for in an unexpected manner, not very pleasing to me. Inclosed is 
a list of the killed and wounded. Both officers and 
men behaved with the greatest intrepidity, and had 
not the General been basely deserted by his troops, 
we should doubtless have carried the town. My detachment had carried the first battery. My being 
wounded, and the loss of their guides, retarded them 
much. After the death of the General, they sustained 
the force of the whole garrison for a considerable 
time, who fired from under cover, and had every 
advantage of situation. Their retreat was cut off by 
the enemy's gaining a narrow defile, through which 
they were obliged to pass. They were overpowered 
by numbers and obliged to resign, though deserving 
a better fate. Governor Carleton treats them with 
humanity, and has given leave fur their baggage to 
be sent in to them. 
</p><p>
I heartily congratulate you on the success of your 
privateers. I think the balance of the last year's 
account is still in our favor, though we have met a 
severe check here. I hope soon to have the pleasure 
of seeing General Lee, or some experienced officer, 
here. I heartily wish you the protection and blessing 
of the Almighty ; and am, with very great respect and 
esteem, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your obedient, humble servant,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 29th ultimo, I received at ten o clock this 
morning, which gave me much pleasure. I heartily congratulate 
you on your success thus far. I think you have had great reason 
to be apprehensive for me, the time I mentioned to General Washing ton being so long since elapsed. I was not then apprised, or 
indeed apprehensive, of one half the difficulties we had to encounter, of which I cannot at present give you a particular detail. I 
can only say we have hauled our bateaux up over falls, up rapid 
streams, over carrying-places, and marched through morasses, thick woods, and over mountains, about three hundred and twenty 
miles, many of which we had to pass several times to bring over 
our baggage. These difficulties the soldiers have, with the greatest fortitude, surmounted ; and about two thirds of the detachment 
are happily arrived here, and -within two days inarch, most of 
them in good health and high spirits. The other part, with Colonel Enos, returned from Dead River, contrary to my expectation, he having orders to send back only the sick, and those that could not be furnished with provisions. 
</p><p>
I wrote to <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a> the loth of October (by an In 
dian I thought trusty), inclosed to my friend in Quebec ; and, as 
I have had no answer from either, and he pretends to have been 
taken sick at Quebec, I make no doubt he has betrayed his trust ; 
which I am confirmed in, as I find they have been some time 
apprised of our coming in Quebec, and have destroyed all the 
canoes at Point Levy, to prevent our passing. This difficulty 
will be obviated by birch canoes, as we have about twenty of 
them, with forty savages, who have joined us, and profess great 
friendship, as well as the Canadians, by whom we have been 
very friendly received, and who will be able to furnish us with 
a number of canoes. 
</p><p>
I am informed, by the French, there are two frigates and several small armed vessels lying before Quebec, and a large ship or 
two, lately arrived from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. However, I propose crossing 
the St. Lawrence as soon as possible, and, if any opportunity 
offers of attacking Quebec with success, I shall embrace it ; other 
wise, I shall endeavour to join your army at <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>. I shall, 
as often as in my power, advise you of my proceedings, and beg 
the favor of hearing from you by every opportunity. 
</p><p>
The inclosed letter to his Excellency General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>, I 
beg the favor of your forwarding by express. 
</p><p>
I am, very respectfully, dear Sir, your most obedient, humble 
servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. Since writing the above, I have seen a friend from 
Quebec, who informs me a frigate of twenty-six guns, and two 
transports, with one hundred and fifty recruits, arrived from St. 
John s, Newfoundland, last Sunday, which, with the inhabitants 
who have been compelled to take up arms, amount to about three 
hundred men ; that the French and English inhabitants in General are on our side, and that the city is short of provisions. I 
shall endeavour to cut off their communication with the country, and make no doubt, if no more recruits arrive, to bring 
them to terms soon, or at least keep them in close quarters 
until your arrival here, which I await with impatience ; but, if 
St. John's should not have surrendered, and you can possibly 
spare a regiment this way, I think the city must of course fall into our hands.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
The foregoing is a copy of my last by the two Indians you 
sent by express the 29th ultimo, who, I hear this moment, are 
taken five leagues above this ; since which, I have waited two 
or three days for the rear to come up, and in preparing ladders, 
&c. The winds have been so high, these three nights, that I 
have not been able to cross the river. I have near forty canoes 
ready ; and, as the wind has moderated, I design crossing this 
evening. The Hunter sloop, and Lizard frigate, lie opposite to 
prevent us ; but I make no doubt I shall be able to avoid 
them. I this moment received the agreeable intelligence, via 
Sorel, that you are in possession of St. John s, and have invested 
<a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>. I can give no intelligence, save that the merchant 
ships are busy, day and night, in loading, and four have already 
sailed. I am yours, &c.,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I wrote you yesterday from Point Levy, by an express sent from Sorel, by Colonel Easton, of my intention of crossing the St. 
Lawrence, which I happily effected between nine and four in the 
morning, without being discovered, until my party of five hundred 
men were nearly all over, when a frigate's barge, coming up, 
discovered our landing and prevented our surprising the town. 
We lired into her, and killed three men. 
</p><p>
I am this minute informed, by a gentleman from town, that 
Colonel McLean had determined to pay us a visit this morning, 
with six hundred men and some field-pieces. We are prepared, 
and anxious to see him. Others from town inform me, that the 
inhabitants in general had laid down their arms. By the best 
information, they are in the greatest confusion, very short of wood 
and provisions, much divided, and refused provisions from the 
inhabitants ; and if blocked up by a superior force, must, as soon 
as the frost sets in, surrender. 
</p><p>
I have thought proper to despatch the bearer to inform you of 
my situation, as also with a request I have to make. I must 
refer you to him for particulars ; as I have been so unfortunate in 
my former letters, I do not choose to commit every intelligence 
to writing. It is the current report here, that you have invested 
<a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a> and cut off their retreat. This I hope is true, and 
that I shall soon have the pleasure of seeing you here. I am, 
dear Sir, with great respect,

Your obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. Since writing the foregoing, the enemy found means to 
make prisoner of one of our out-sentinels. I immediately invested 
the town, as near as possible, with my troops, which has occasioned them to set fire to the suburbs of St. John's ; and several 
of the houses without the wall are now in flames. B. A.

SIR, 
</p><p>
The unjust, cruel, and tyrannical acts of a venal British Parliament, tending to enslave the American Colonies, have obliged 
them to appeal to God and the sword for redress. That Being, 
in whose hands are all human events, has hitherto smiled on their virtuous efforts. And, as every artifice has been used to 
make the innocent Canadians instruments of their cruelty, by instigating them against the Colonies, and oppressing them on their 
refusing to enforce every oppressive mandate, the American congress, induced by motives of humanity, have, at their request, 
sent <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a> into Canada for their relief. To cooperate with him, I am ordered by his Excellency, General Washing ton, to take possession of the town of Quebec. 
</p><p>
I do, therefore, in the name of the United Colonies, demand 
immediate surrender of the town, fortifications, &c., of Quebec, 
to the forces of the United Colonies under my command ; forbid 
ding you to injure any of the inhabitants of the town in their 
persons or property, as you will answer the same at your peril. 
On surrendering the town, the property of every individual shall 
be secured to him ; but if I am obliged to carry the town by 
storm, you may expect every severity practised on such occasions ; 
and the merchants, who may now save their property, will probably be involved in the general ruin. 
</p><p>
I am, Sir, your most obedient, humble servant,

SIR, 
</p><p>
I yesterday sent the inclosed with a ilag and officer, who, approaching near the walls of the town, was, contrary to humanity 
and the laws of nations, fired on, and narrowly escaped being 
killed. This I imputed to the ignorance of your guards, and 
ordered him to return this morning, and, to my great surprise, lie 
was received in the same manner as yesterday. This is an insult 
I could not have expected from a private soldier, much less from 
an officer of your rank ; and, through me offered to the United 
Colonies, will be deeply resented; but at any rate, cannot redound 
to your honor or valor. 
</p><p>
I am informed you have put a prisoner, taken from me, into 
irons. I desire to know the truth of this, and the manner in 
which he is treated. As I have several prisoners taken from 
you, who now feed at my own table, you may expect that they 
will be treated in the same manner in future as you treat mine. 
I am, Sir, your obedient servant,

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I wrote you the 14th and 16th instant from before Quebec, 
which I make no doubt you have received. I have this minute the pleasure of yours of the 17th instant. I heartily congratulate you on your success, and hope, as fortune has so far 
been favorable, and is generally so to the brave, it may in 
future be equal to your warmest wishes. 
</p><p>
It was not in my power, before the 18th, to make an exact 
scrutiny into the arms and ammunition of my detachment, when, 
upon examination, great part of our cartridges proved unfit for 
service, and, to my great surprise, we had no more than five 
rounds for each man, and near one hundred muskets unfit for 
service. Add to this, many of the men invalids, almost naked, 
and wanting every necessary to make them comfortable. The 
same day I received advice from my friends in town, that Colonel McLean was making preparation, and had determined in a 
day or two to come out and attack us ; and, as his numbers 
were greatly superior to ours, with a number of field-pieces, 
and the limits of Quebec are so extensive, I found it impossible entirely to cut off their communication with the country, 
without dividing the small number of men I have (about five 
hundred and fifty effective), so as to render them an easy sacrifice to the besieged. I therefore concluded it most prudent to 
retire to this place, and ordered the main body to march at 
three o clock yesterday morning, and waited, with a small detachment, to watch the motions of the enemy until the main 
body were out of danger. They all arrived here last night. I have procured leather sufficient to shoe them all in a day or 
two, the only article of clothing to be had in this part of the 
country. Inclosed is a memorandum of clothing absolutely necessary for a winter's campaign, which I beg the favor of your 
forwarding to me as soon as possible. Should it be troublesome, 
I have desired the bearer, Captain Ogden, a young gentleman 
and volunteer from the Jerseys, to procure them, and some 
other articles the officers are in want of, and beg the favor of 
your order to forward them on. 
</p><p>
Captain Napier, in the snow, and a small schooner, passed us 
yesterday, and is now at Quebec. The two frigates were laid 
up the 18th; their guns and men all taken on shore. They are 
getting all the provisions they possibly can out of the country, 
and are doubtless determined to make the best defence. From 
the best accounts I can get, their force is about nineteen hundred men, namely ; landed from the frigate and two transports 
from St. John s, one hundred and fifty recruits; Colonel McLean's 
regiment, one hundred and seventy irregulars ; from the Lizard, 
two hundred seamen and marines ; from the Hunter sloop, one 
hundred ; on board Captain Napier, one hundred and fifty, which 
make seven hundred and seventy; inhabitants, French and English, on their side, one hundred and thirty; ditto, obliged to bear 
arms against their inclination, and who would join us if an 
opportunity presented, six hundred; neutrals, four hundred; total, 
eighteen hundred and seventy. You will, from the above account, be better able to judge of the force necessary to carry 
the town. If my opinion is of any service, I should think two 
thousand necessary, as they must be divided at the distance of 
three or four miles, to secure the passes effectually ; and as 
there is no probability of cannon making a breach in the walls, 
I should think mortars of the most service ; the situation for 
heaving shells being extremely good, and I think, of course, 
would soon bring them to compliance ; if not, time and perseverance must effect it before they can possibly be relieved. 
</p><p>
Colonel Allen and his party have been some time since sent 
to England in irons. Mr. Walker I have not heard of. I 
have ordered Captain Ogden to send down all the powder and 
ball on the road. If he should not be able to procure sufficient, I make no doubt of your forwarding it as soon as possible. The inhabitants are very friendly, and give all the assistance they dare to do at present. Had we a sufficient force 
to blockade the garrison, I make no doubt of their coming to our assistance in great numbers. As it will doubtless take some 
time in bringing down your artillery, would it not be better, if 
you can spare them, to send down five or six hundred men, 
who, joined to my little corps, will be able to cut off their 
communication with the country? 
</p><p>
I am, dear General, &c. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. My hard cash is nearly exhausted. It will not be 
sufficient for more than ten days or a fortnight, and, as the 
French have been such sufferers by paper money, I do not think 
it prudent to offer it to them at present. B. A.

MAY IT PEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 
</p><p>
My last, of the 14th instant, was from Point Levy. The same 
evening I passed the St. Lawrence without obstruction, except 
from a barge, into which we fired, and killed three men ; but, 
as the enemy were apprised of our coming, and the garrison 
augmented to near seven hundred men, besides the inhabitants, 
it was not thought proper to storm the place, but cut off their 
communication with the country, until the arrival of General 
Montgomery. We accordingly invested the town with about five 
hundred and fifty effective men, took possession of the Nunnery, 
and Colonel C.'s house, about half a league from town. We 
marched up several times near the walls, in hopes of drawing 
them out, but to no effect, though they kept a constant cannon 
ading, and killed us one man. 
</p><p>
On the 18th, having intelligence that Captain Napier, in an 
armed snow, with near two hundred men, having made his 
escape from <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, was very near, and that the garrison, furnished with a number of good field-pieces, intended attacking us 
the next day, I ordered a strict examination to be made into 
the state of our arms and ammunition, when, to my great surprise, 
I found many of our cartridges unfit for use, which, to appearance, 
were very good, and that we had no more than five rounds to 
each man. It was judged prudent, in our situation, not to hazard 
a battle, but retire to this place, eight leagues from Quebec, which we did yesterday, and are waiting here with impatience 
the arrival of <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a>, which we expect in a few days. 
</p><p>
I have been obliged to send to <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a> for clothing for my 
people, about six hundred and fifty in the whole, who are almost 
naked, and in want of every necessary. I have been as careful 
of cash as possible, but shall soon have occasion for hard money. 
As the French have been such sufferers from paper heretofore, 
and mine so large, I thought it not prudent to offer it them at 
present. I have written to <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a> my situation 
and wants, which I expect will be supplied by him. Had I 
been ten days sooner, Quebec must inevitably have fallen into 
our hands, as there was not a man then to oppose us. However, 
I make no doubt <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a> \vill reduce it this winter, 
if properly supported with men, which, in my opinion, cannot 
in the whole be less than two thousand five hundred, though it 
may possibly be effected with a less number. The fatigue will 
be severe at this season and in this inclement climate. I have 
the honor to be, with the greatest respect, your Excellency's 
most obedient and very humble servant,

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I make no doubt but <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a> acquainted you 
with his intentions of storming Quebec as soon as a good opportunity offered. As we had several men deserted from us a few 
days past, the General was induced to alter his plan, which was 
to have attacked the Upper and Lower Town at the same time. 
He thought it most prudent to make two different attacks upon 
the Lower Town ; the one at Cape Diamond, the other through 
St. Koc. For the last attack, I was ordered, with my own detachment and Captain Lamb's company of artillery. At five 
o clock, the hour appointed for the attack, a false attack was ordered to be made upon the Upper Town. 
</p><p>
We accordingly began our march. I passed through St. Roc. 
and approached near a two-gun battery, picketed in, without being  discovered, which we attacked. It was bravely defended for 
about an hour; but, with the loss of a number of men, we carried it. In the attack, I was shot through the leg, and was 
obliged to be carried to the hospital, where I soon heard the disagreeable news that the General was defeated at Cape Diamond ; 
himself, Captain Macpherson, his Aid-de-camp, and Captain Cheese-man, killed on the spot, with a number of others not known. 
After gaining the battery, my detachment pushed on to a second 
barrier, which they took possession of. At the same time, the 
enemy sallied out from Palace Gate, and attacked them in the 
rear. A field-piece, which the roughness of the road would not 
permit our carrying on, fell into the enemy's hands, with a number of prisoners. The last accounts from my detachment, about 
ten minutes since, they were pushing for the Lower Town. Their 
communication with me was cut off. I am exceedingly apprehensive what the event will be ; they will either carry the Lower 
Town, be made prisoners, or cut to pieces. 
</p><p>
I thought proper to send an express to let you know the critical situation we are in, and make no doubt you will give us all 
the assistance in your power. As I am not able to act, I shall 
give up the command to Colonel Campbell. I beg you will immediately send an express to the Honorable Continental Congress, 
and his Excellency General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>. The loss of my detachment, before I left it, was about twenty men, killed and 
wounded ; among the latter is Major Ogden, who, with Captain 
Oswald, Captain Burr, and the other volunteers, behaved extremely well. I have only time to add that I am, with the 
greatest esteem, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. It is- impossible to say what our future operations will 
be, until we know the fate of my detachment.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I wrote you, three days since, of our defeat, and the death of 
<a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a> and others, with all the information I then 
had of the matter. We have been in suspense, with regard to 
my detachment, until this afternoon, when Major Mcigs was sent 
out, with a flag, for the officers baggage, who, he says, are all 
taken prisoners, except Captain Hendricks, Lieutenant Humphreys, of the riflemen, and Lieutenant Cooper, who were killed 
in the action. General Caiieton says our loss, in killed and 
wounded, is a hundred. Major Meigs thinks it does not exceed 
sixty, and about three hundred taken prisoners, who are treated 
very humanely. These brave men sustained the force of the 
whole garrison for three hours, but were finally obliged to yield 
to numbers, and the advantageous situation the garrison had over 
them. Several other officers, I am told, are slightly wounded. 
</p><p>
We had the misfortune of losing one brass six-pounder in the 
engagement, and all our mortars were taken from St. Roc the 
evening after the engagement. This was the fault of some of 
the officers who commanded, as they might very easily have been 
brought away, agreeably to my positive orders for that purpose. 
Our force, at this time, does not exceed eight hundred men, including Colonel Livingston's regiment of two hundred Canadians, 
and some scattered Canadian forces, amounting to two hundred 
more. Many of the troops are dejected and anxious to get home, 
and some have actually set off. I shall endeavour to continue 
the blockade, while there are any hopes of success. For God's 
sake, order as many men down as you can possibly spare, consistent with the safety of <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, and all the mortars, howitzers, and shells, that you can possibly bring. I hope you will 
stop every rascal who has deserted from us, and bring him back 
again. 
</p><p>
Every possible mark of distinction was shown to the corpse of 
<a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a>, who was to be interred in Quebec this 
day. Had he been properly supported by his troops, I make no 
doubt of our success. We are short of cash. Not more than 
four or five hundred pounds, and only twenty barrels of salt 
pork. If any can be spared from <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, I think best to 
bring it down, and all the butter. 
</p><p>
I beg you will transmit a copy of this letter to the Honorable 
Continental Congress, and another to his Excellency, General 
<a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>. I think it will be highly necessary, with the reen-forcement which, I make no doubt, Congress will send, that 
they should order all the large mortars and howitzers at Crown 
Point, <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, and Fort George, on to this place. Monsieur Pallasier, who has a furnace at Three Rivers, assures me 
that he can cast any size and number of shells between this and 
the beginning of April. I hope the Honorable Continental congress will not think of sending less than eight or ten thousand 
men to secure and form a lasting connection with this country. 
</p><p>
I am in such excessive pain from my wound (as the bones of 
my leg are affected), I can only add, that I am, with the greatest esteem, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>. 
</p><p>
N. B. Many officers here appear dispirited. Your presence 
will be absolutely necessary. I do not expect to be in a capacity to act this two months.

</p><p>
GENTLEMEN, 
</p><p>
I take the liberty most heartily to condole with you on the 
loss of the great, amiable, and brave <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a>, and 
those brave men who fell with him. By his death the command of the army devolves on me ; of course, I have care 
fully examined his instructions from the Honorable Continental 
Congress, and their resolutions respecting this country. I find 
it strongly recommended to him to conciliate the affections of 
the Canadians, and cherish every dawning of liberty which appears among them, and to assure them of the protection and 
friendship of the Congress, and to endeavour to form, on a lasting  basis, a firm union between them and the Colonies, by 
forming a Provincial Congress, and from that body giving them 
a full representation in the grand Continental Congress. This, I am confident, the General labored with the greatest assiduity, 
and with as great a degree of success as could be expected under the present state of affairs. 
</p><p>
The disposition of the Canadians is very favorable to your 
wishes ; the only bar of consequence is Quebec. As this is 
the key, so, in a great measure, it governs the whole country, who having been so long habituated to slavery, and having, 
as yet, but a faint sense of the value of liberty, are naturally timorous and diffident, and want every possible encouragement to take an active part. This bar removed, I humbly conceive every other obstacle to a firm and lasting union with 
Canada will of course be removed. So long as Quebec remains 
in the hands of the enemy, it will not be in our power to 
assist and protect them ; of course, we cannot expect their hearty 
exertions in our favor. Quebec appears to me an object of 
the highest importance to the Colonies, and, if proper methods 
are adopted, must inevitably fall into their hands before the 
garrison can be relieved. 
</p><p>
The whole garrison of Quebec, including men, women, and children, is supposed, by a gentleman who left town the beginning of December, to be four thousand; a gentleman of veracity 
assures me, that Mr. Alsop, the King's Commissary, told him, in confidence, that there were not one thousand barrels of flour in the town ; and it was notorious among the merchants, that there were not eight thousand bushels of wheat, and no conveniency for flouring it. Provisions of meat were known to be 
much less than those of bread, though they had some quantity of fish. It is generally agreed they had short of four months 
provision on the 1st December. This cannot be exactly ascertained, as the Governor denied the inhabitants liberty of viewing 
the stores, or giving them any satisfaction in regard to the quantity. 
</p><p>
It appears a blockade must answer our purpose ; it is possible 
it may not. Will it be prudent to trust an object of such vast 
importance to the event? With submission, I think it will not. 
What is to be done? A sufficient force employed to reduce it 
by a regular siege, or assault ? If the first is attempted, an addition of three thousand men. to our present force will, I make no 
doubt, be thought necessary; if the latter, at least five thousand. 
The former, with a vast expense and great waste of ammunition, 
may prove unsuccessful; the latter, from the extensiveness of 
their works, I think cannot; and five thousand men will hardly 
be a sufficient garrison, if the place is taken. 
</p><p>
I beg leave to recommend the sending a body of at least live 
thousand men, with an experienced General, into Canada as early 
as possible ; and, in the mean time, that every possible preparation 
of mortars, howitzers, and some heavy cannon should be made, 
as the season will permit our raising batteries by the middle of 
March, which may very possibly be attended with success, as we 
can place our mortars under cover within two hundred yards of 
the walls, and within one thousand of the centre of the town : 
and, if supplied with shells, carcasses, &c., can set fire to it, 
whenever we please, which I make no doubt would reduce the 
garrison to terms. I am well assured more than one half of the 
inhabitants of Quebec would gladly open the gates to us, but arc 
prevented by the strict discipline and watch kept over them ; the 
command of the guards being constantly given to officers of the 
Crown, known to be firm in their interest. 
</p><p>
The garrison consists of about fifteen hundred men, great part 
of whom Governor Carleton can place no confidence in, or he 
would not suffer a blockade, and every distress of a siege, by 
seven hundred men, our force consisting of no more at present, 
including Colonel Livingston's regiment of two hundred Canadians. I have arranged my men in such order as effectually to 
blockade the city, and to assist each other as early as possible, 
if attacked. The men are obliged to lie on their arms constantly, 
arid to mount guard every other night. Their duty is exceeding ly hard. However, the men appear alert and cheerful, though 
wanting many necessaries, which cannot be procured here. I Expect <a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'>General Wooster</a> from <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a> with a reenforcement every 
minute. I have withdrawn our cannon from the battery, and 
placed them round the magazine, which contains a considerable 
quantity of powder and ordnance stores, which I am fearful of 
removing, lest it should make unfavorable impressions on the 
Canadians, and induce them to withdraw their assistance, and 
Governor Carleton, presuming on our panic, to sally out. I 
thought it most prudent to put the best face on matters, and be 
tray no marks of fear. 
</p><p>
We are in great want of cash. Our finances have never afforded any of consequence to the troops, who make heavy complaints, not without reason. We have often been reduced to a 
few Johannes, and never able to procure more than ten days 
sustenance beforehand. Our whole dependence has been on Mr. 
Price, who has done every tiling in his power, and is the only 
resource we have at present. I have received two petards from 
Mons. Pallasier at Three Rivers, who assures me he can supply us with shells by the 1st of April. Inclosed is a list of officers, 
killed and wounded in the unfortunate attack on Quebec. The 
prisoners and missing amount to about four hundred. Governor 
Carleton has permitted the baggage of both officers and men to 
be sent in, and (strange to tell) treats them with humanity. I 
think myself in justice bound to acknowledge the good conduct 
and intrepidity of both officers and men of my detachment, who 
undauntedly marched up in the face of the enemy's cannon ; in 
particular the volunteers, and Captain Oswald, who signalized 
himself in the attack on their battery, and is now a prisoner. 
</p><p>
I hope, gentlemen, my being confined to my bed with my 
wound, and a severe fit of the gout, will apologize for the incoherency and incorrectness of my scrawl ; and that you will believe 
me, with the greatest respect and esteem, Gentlemen, yours, &c.,

GENTLEMEN,

Since writing the inclosed, <a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'>General Wooster</a> has acquainted me 
he cannot leave <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, but has sent down Colonel Clinton, to 
whom I shall resign the command, until my wound will permit my 
doing duty, which my surgeon thinks will be four or six weeks. 
Colonel Clinton acquaints me we cannot expect more than two 
hundred men from <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>. I have put on foot the raising a 
regiment of three or four hundred Canadians, which I make no 
doubt of effecting. They are to have the same pay and to be 
under the same regulations as the Continental forces. I make 
no doubt the exigency of our affairs will justify the step I have 
taken (though without authority for so doing), and that it will 
be approved of by the Honorable Continental Congress. I am,

</p><p>
GENTLEMEN, 
</p><p>
I wrote, on the 11th instant, advising you of our present situation and that of the enemy, and took the liberty of presenting  you my sentiments on a future plan of operation, for which 
my zeal for the public service, I hope, will apologize ; since 
which I have made an estimate (which I now inclose) of such 
artillery stores, ammunition, &c., which I imagine will be necessary. If it is thought proper to carry on a siege in form, of 
this I can be no judge, as I know not if powder can be spared 
from below, or shot, shells, &c., sent up in season. The artillery, except a thirteen-inch mortar (at Crown Point), is all in 
this country. I have also inclosed a list of such ammunition, 
stores, &c., as we have on hand. A list of such articles as can 
be procured at <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, St. John s, and <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>, will be taken 
and sent you by <a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'>General Wooster</a>. 
</p><p>
I had encouragement from Monsieur Pallasier, at Three Rivers, 
of being furnished with shot, shells, &c., in all the month of 
March. I have this minute received advice from him, that the 
want of coal will prevent his supplying those articles before May. 
As coal is his only objection, I have wrote him to procure it, at 
all events, if it can be done, to supply shells, &c., by the 1st 
of April; of which the bearer, Major Ogden, will inform. This 
measure, I hope, will meet your approbation, as the expense of 
bringing shells from below will be great, and, if not wanted here, 
the cost will be trifling. 
</p><p>
It is very probable the city would surrender before half, or 
perhaps one quarter, of the shot, shells, &c. in my memorandum 
were expended; but, if they should make an obstinate resistance, 
perhaps the whole will be necessary. A gentleman now present 
assures me, that the King's magazines, containing upwards of 
three thousand barrels of powder, were all full, and that three 
hundred barrels, his private property, taken from him by Government, was obliged to be stored in a private vault. Add to this 
ten thousand stand of arms, seven thousand of which are new, 
and arrived last summer; also seven thousand complete suits of 
new clothing, with a large quantity of artillery stores, two frigates with a number of other vessels in the harbour, &c., &lt;fcc. 
The above-mentioned articles, exclusive of securing an extensive 
country in our interest, and liberating three or four hundred of 
our brave men, appear an object of the greatest importance to 
us under our present circumstances. I make no doubt every 
necessary measure will be adopted for reducing the city. 
</p><p>
Yesterday arrived here a reenforcement of one hundred men 
from <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a> ; sixty men are soon expected. We are still very 
weak-handed ; of course the duty severe ; however, the enemy 
have not dared to come out, though they are double our numbers. Desertions from the garrison are frequent. They are in 
want of fuel, and have attempted to supply themselves by cut 
ting down the houses in St. Roc's suburbs (under their guns,) 
to prevent which I have burnt most of them, with several vessels they had broke up. Every artifice is used by Governor 
Carleton to procure provisions, and induce the Canadians to take 
arms against us, to no effect, though seconded by the clergy, our 
bitter enemies. I make no doubt of continuing the blockade until a proper reinforcement arrives to make use of more coercive measures. 
</p><p>
Major Ogden, the bearer of this to <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, who came out 
with me a volunteer, proposes going down to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. I 
beg leave to recommend him as a gentleman who has acted 
with great spirit and activity through our fatiguing march, and 
at the attack on Quebec, in which he was wounded. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a>, on his arrival in this country, was pleased to appoint Mr. John Halsted Commissary. He is a gentle 
man who has been very active and zealous in our cause, is a 
merchant, and capable in his department, in which I beg leave 
to recommend his being continued. 
</p><p>
Our finances are low ; we have been obliged to beg, borrow, 
and squeeze to get money for our subsistence; and, but for Mr. 
Price, who has been our greatest resource, we must have suffered. 
</p><p>
I have the agreeable intelligence from <a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'>General Wooster</a>, that the Paymaster is at hand. I am, with great esteem, very respectfully, Gentlemen, &c.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure of acquainting you, that we still hold our 
ground before Quebec, and keep the enemy closely blockaded, 
though we have received but a small reenforcement of one hundred and fifty men from <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>. The enemy have, within 
these ten days, sallied out twice at Palace Gate, with about four 
or five hundred men, with a view of seizing two field-pieces we have on that side. Our men advanced briskly to attack them, 
when they made a precipitate retreat, under cover of their guns. 
I make no doubt of holding our ground, as we expect a reinforcement daily, which W T C are anxiously waiting for, as the duty is very severe. 
</p><p>
I have taken the liberty, in former letters to the Honorable 
Continental Congress, to give my opinion in regard to men and 
measures necessary for the reduction of Quebec. The necessary ways and means for supporting those men, I have omitted, 
as <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a>, in his lifetime, transmitted you his sentiments on the matter, as well as on the necessary measures for 
forming a lasting union between this country and the Colonies. 
I have only to observe, if the Capital is taken, I believe paper 
money will soon have a currency. 
</p><p>
Major John Brown, who came down with <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a>, 
with about one hundred and sixty men, collected from different 
regiments, now assumes and insists on the title of Colonel, which 
he says the General promised him at <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>. That the General promised him promotion, he told me some time before his 
death. When Major Brown wrote to remind him of his promise, 
the General handed me his letter, and told me, at the same time, 
as Colonel Easton and Major Brown were publicly impeached with 
plundering the officers baggage, taken at Sorel, contrary to articles of capitulation, and to the great scandal of the American 
army, he could not, in conscience or honor, promote him (Major 
Brown), until those matters were cleared up. He then sent for 
Major Brown, and told him his sentiments on the matter very 
freely; after which I heard of no further application for promotion. This transaction, Colonel Campbell, Major Dubois, and 
several gentlemen were knowing to. As Colonel Easton and 
Major Brown have, doubtless, a sufficient share of modest merit 
to apply to the Honorable Continental Congress for promotion, I 
think it my duty to say, the charge before mentioned is the pub 
lic topic of conversation at <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, and among the officers of 
the army in general ; and, as such conduct is unbecoming the 
character of gentlemen or soldiers, I believe it would give great 
disgust to the army in general, if those gentlemen were promoted 
before those matters were cleared up. 
</p><p>
This will be delivered you by Mr. David Hopkins, a gentleman 
who came out a volunteer with me. His spirited conduct, botlion our march, and since our arrival in this country, merits my 
recommendation to your notice, of which I think him" worthy. 
I am, &c., <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. The contents of the inclosed letter I do not wish to be 
kept from the gentlemen mentioned therein. The public interest 
is my chief motive for writing. I should despise myself were I 
capable of asserting a thing in prejudice of any gentleman, with 
out a sufficient reason to make it public.

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I hope you will pardon my neglect in not writing to you for 
so long a time, when I acquaint you that I have, from time to 
time, communicated every material intelligence .to <a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'>General Wooster</a>, who, I make no doubt, has transmitted the same to you. 
The 1st instant, he arrived at the camp before Quebec; on the 
2d, I had, on an alarm, occasion to mount my horse, who unluckily fell on me, and violently bruised my lame leg and ankle, 
which confined me until the 12th, at which time I left the camp, 
and arrived here yesterday. Had I been able to take an active 
part, I should by no means have left the camp ; but as General 
"Wooster did not think proper to consult me in any of his matters, 
J was convinced I should be of more service here than in the 
camp, and he very readily granted me leave of absence, until 
recovered of my lameness. 
</p><p>
Inclosed is a list of our force before Quebec, which, I am 
I sorry to say, is so very inconsiderable, and illy supplied with 
every requisite to carry on a siege, that I am very dubious of 
their success. The 2d instant, we opened a battery of three guns 
and one howitzer, on Point Levy. Another battery of six guns, 
two howitzers, and two small mortars, on the Heights of Abraham, and one of two guns, at the Traverse, were nearly completed when I came away. To supply the whole, there are only 
three or four tons of powder, and ten or twelve of shot; an engineer and a few artillery men. Two fire-ships, one at Orleans, 
and one at <a href='/results.php?city=point-aux-trembles' rel='city'>Point-aux-Trembles</a>, were nearly completed, to attempt 
burning their ships, as soon as the ice will admit of it. We have 
few seamen, and not one commander, to man those vessels, or 
I should conceive great hopes of their success. 
</p><p>
Our army are supplied with provisions to the 10th of May, 
after which time their only resource for meat is from below. This country, which is not plentiful at best, is nearly exhausted of 
beef. We can procure a supply of flour, if furnished with cash. 
I am now stretching our credit for that purpose, which is at alow ebb. I cannot help lamenting, that more effectual measures 
have not been adopted to secure this country in our interest, an 
object which appears to me of the highest importance to the Colonies. Colonel Hazen, who is a sensible, judicious officer, and 
well acquainted with this country, has shown me his letter to 
you, of the 1st instant. I am sorry to say, I think most of his 
remarks too true ; and if we are not immediately supported with 
eight or ten thousand men, a good train of artillery well served, 
and a military chest well furnished, the ministerial troops, if they 
attempt it, will regain this country, and we shall be obliged to 
quit it, the fatal consequences of which are too obvious. 
</p><p>
On my way up, I carefully examined the rapids of Richelieu, 
fifteen leagues above Quebec, which appear to me a very important post. The channel runs near the shore, and few ships can 
go up without anchoring near the shore, at the foot of the Rapids, where a battery of ten or twelve guns, and three or four 
gondolas above, will, in my opinion, effectually secure the pass, 
as no ships larger than a frigate can go up. I have despatched 
Lieutenant Johnson, of the train, to Crown Point, for four eighteen 
and eleven twelve-pounders, with what shot are at that place, 
for the above purpose, as we have very little time to fortify. I 
have directed him to bring down a gondola, which, I am told, 
is at Crown Point. We ought to have six or eight of them immediately, to secure the river, and prevent our communication 
being cut off with the army before Quebec. The row-galley that 
was at St. John's has been drove over the Falls, stove to pieces, 
and the gondola cut to pieces ; so that we have only one gondola, 
mounting a twelve-pounder, and in a shattered condition. 
</p><p>
Timber and plank for those ordered to be built here have 
been procured, and nothing will be done until they arrive from 
below. Intrenching tools are much wanted. We have very few. 
I have found it necessary to order Colonel Bedel, with two hundred men, to the Cedars, a very important post, fifteen leagues 
above this, to prevent any goods being sent to the upper country, 
and to guard against a surprise from the enemy or their Indians. 
I have also sent a Captain and sixty men to Carringon. We 
have left at this garrison about five hundred men, about half 
of whom are waiting an opportunity to return home. We are 
waiting with the greatest anxiety to receive supplies of men and ammunition from below. Every thing is at a stand for want of 
those resources, and, if not obtained soon, our affairs in this country 
will be entirely ruined. I am, with great respect and esteem, dear General,

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to acquaint you of the safe arrival of the 
gentlemen from Congress, in good health and spirits. 
</p><p>
At a Council of War, held this morning, it was agreed to fortify, at Richelieu and Jacques Cartier, two important posts, the 
last eleven, and the former fifteen leagues above Quebec ; also 
to set on foot and build immediately four row-galleys or gondolas, 
at <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>, under my direction; and that Colonel Hazen have 
the overseeing of the workmen, procuring materials, &c., of which 
I make no doubt the Committee of Congress will advise you, as 
also our prospects and resources in this country, which are very 
slender. I hope no time will be lost in hurrying on provisions, &c. 
</p><p>
On my arrival here I sent Colonel Hazen to command at St. 
John s, <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>, &c. I have this minute received a letter from 
Lieutenant-Colonel Buell, acquainting me of his being appointed 
to command at those places, and having orders to build a store 
house, for which there are no materials to be procured at present. 
I fancy you have not been apprised of the store-rooms at St. 
John's and <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>, which are capable of holding two thousand 
barrels of provisions, and want little repairing. 
</p><p>
We have engaged a number of French carpenters and bateau-men to be employed at <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a> under the direction of Colonel Hazen, who is so well acquainted both with the Falls and inhabitants of the country, that a more useful man could not be employed at those posts. Perhaps you will think best that Colonel Buell should remain at this place, or go down to Richelieu, where 
I apprehend he will be of the greatest service ; his want of the 
French tongue is a great hinderance to business here. 
</p><p>
I should be glad that the small hawsers and anchors at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> might be sent to St. John's for the gondolas; and if fifty 
or a hundred good seamen could be engaged out of the troops 
coming up, to man them, with proper officers to command them, 
it will forward the matter much. 
</p><p>
We have received no material advice from Quebec lately. Our 
last was the 24th ultimo, when our batteries were playing on 
the town. Expect soon to hear their effect. I am, very respect 
fully, dear General, 
</p><p>

GENTLEMEN, 
</p><p>
I Wrote you the 12th instant, by express, since which I have purchased twenty-seven hundred bushels of wheat of Captain Cuthbert, at four shillings and sixpence, lawful money, payable in our paper bills of exchange, or an order on Congress, which shall be most agreeable to you. It is now sending to the mills. 
I have also received two hundred barges of flour from below, and expect a quantity more every moment; also three tons flour, 
which I had engaged before I left <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>. I make no doubt in a few days of collecting a magazine of flour sufficient for ten 
thousand men three months. A Commissary I sent out to purchase provisions, returned yesterday with twenty oxen. I have 
put the people to half an allowance of meat, and added to their bread. I make no doubt of supporting the army until provisions can come over the Lakes. 
</p><p>
Mr. Bonfield, a gentleman of character, arrived here yesterday ; 
he left Sully on Thursday last, Dechambeau on Saturday morning , where General Thomas was, with only nine hundred men ; 
Colonel Maxwell was at Jacques Cartier, but the number of men 
with him Mr. Bonfield could not tell. Mr. Bonfield saw a number of the regular officers and inhabitants of Quebec before he 
left Sully, who acquainted him that on Monday, the 6th instant, 
arrived at Quebec one sloop of war with fourteen guns, one 
twenty and one fifty-gun ship, from England, with two companies 
of the twenty-seventh regiment, and one company of marines, 
which were immediately landed, who, with the garrison that came 
out the same afternoon, made a body of one thousand men, commanded by General Carleton, from whom our people made a 
most precipitate retreat, without ever firing a gun. On the 8th, 
arrived a frigate of thirty guns, and a large India man, with five 
hundred men from Halifax, part of General Howe's army, the 
whole of which were on their passage for Quebec; and six thou 
sand Hessians, it is said, are on their way from England. If the 
latter is true, we shall doubtless have our hands full. Colonel 
A 1T en is come out in the ships from England, in irons (it is 
given out), to receive his trial for rebellion, and to be executed 
here.
</p><p>
I am sorry to inform you that all the carriages, except five, 
which came with the heavy cannon, were sent down, as they 
came over the Lakes, and fell into the enemy's hands. I have 
wrote to Colonel Hazen to put others in hand immediately, to 
replace them. We are making every possible disposition of defence in our power, and I make no doubt of securing this post 
in a few days. None of the enemy's ships have been able to 
ascend the Richelieu as yet. I make no doubt Mr. Price will 
take effectual measures to supply with provisions the garrison of <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>, St. John s, and the Cedars. Inclosed 
you have a letter to Mr. Evans, which fell into my hands, which contains a piece of intelligence worth noticing. 
</p><p>
I should be glad to know your sentiments in regard to inoculation, as early as possible. Will it not be best, considering the 
impossibility of preventing the spreading of the smallpox, to inoculate live hundred or a thousand men immediately, and send 
them to <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, and as many more every five days, until the whole receive it, which will prevent our army being distressed 
hereafter; and I make no doubt we shall have more effective men, in four weeks, than by endeavouring to prevent the disorder 
spreading ; a period so near, that the enemy will not, with any considerable force, be able to reach this place by that time. 
</p><p>
A Quartermaster-General and Commissary are much wanted here. I have so much on hand, that I can hardly get one minute to write. You will be kind enough to excuse haste and incoherency, and believe me, with the greatest respect and esteem, Gentlemen, 
</p><p>

GENTLEMEN, 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure of your letter by General Thompson and 
Colonel St. Glair, who arrived safe here last evening. Herewith 
you have a letter from General Thomas, who is hourly expected 
here. It came by an express, who told me he had orders to deliver the letter to me, and wait my answer. I apprehended there 
might be some mistake in the superscription, and took the liberty 
of opening it, which you will excuse. 
</p><p>
I am. very happy to find you are in sentiments with me in 
respect to the smallpox. General Thompson and all the officers 
agree with us, and think it advisable to inoculate Colonel Patterson's regiment at <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, Colonel Bedel's at the Cedars, and 
the troops posted at Laprairie and Longueil at those places. It 
is thought most advisable to send all the troops at <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a> 
here who have had the smallpox, and to send five or six hundred men from this to <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, who will be at no expense of 
getting up, as they can row themselves. It will be very difficult 
to provide them quarters on the Sorel, except at such a distance 
as will render it extremely difficult to visit and supply them 
with provisions and other necessaries. This difficulty will be obviated at <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, as they will be near together, and may be 
quartered on the inhabitants (if the barracks are not sufficient) ; 
and, among the whole, a sufficient number of men will be found 
well to keep the garrison. The distance of time you mention 
between inoculating them will doubtless be most prudent. As 
soon as General Thomas arrives, I expect a Council of War will 
be immediately held. I shall be for keeping Dechambeau by 
all means, if it can be done without too great a hazard of our 
army. Our own strength (which at present is uncertain), and 
the advice which we may receive of the numbers and designs of 
the enemy, must govern our movements. I believe the difficulty 
of provisions may be got over; but the smallpox, and gondolas 
to secure our navigation and retreat, are very great obstacles in 
our way. 
</p><p>
We have here about three tons of powder. There is a quantity at <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a> ; how much, I am uncertain. The distribution 
of the bateaux is already made, and twenty are sent from this 
to St. John s. Immediately on my arrival here, I sent to Maska. 
I have received from thence one hundred and seventy-six bags 
of flour, I believe the same you refer to. As soon as Mr. 
Bonfield arrives, I shall employ him to collect all the flour in 
this neighbourhood, who will, at the same time, call on Mr. Belfeuil, and receive such goods as may answer our purpose. I 
have in contemplation the sinking a chevaux-de-frise at the is 
lands five miles below this, where the channel is very narrow ; but 
the water is so high we cannot fortify at present. Two other 
vessels will be ordered to <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a> the first fair wind. I beg 
my respectful compliments to the ladies, who, I hear, are returned with you ; and am, with great affection and esteem, Gentle 
men, &c.,

GENTLEMEN, 
</p><p>
One of our men this moment came in, who was taken at the Cedars. He made his escape this morning, and says we have 
lost only ten privates killed; the rest are prisoners at St. Ann's 
and the Cedars. The enemy lost double that number. They 
were last night within three miles of us, with three hundred 
savages, fifty regulars, and two hundred and fifty Canadians, with 
our two pieces of cannon ; but, on hearing we had a large body 
of men here, they made a precipitate retreat. He left them 
above Point Clare. They have only twenty-one canoes, which 
will carry eight or nine men on an average. 
</p><p>
I intend to send off four hundred men in bateaux immediately, 
to proceed to the Isle Perot, and endeavour to cut off the enemy's retreat. I expect they will make some stay at Fort St. 
Ann s, by which it may possibly be effected. Pray, hurry on 
the men as fast as possible. I shall push them on from this immediately. We have so much water-craft, that we can always 
keep up a communication between those on land and those on 
water, and be able to act in concert. I am, Gentlemen, &c.,

</p><p>
GENTLEMEN, 
</p><p>
I wrote you from <a href='/results.php?city=lachine' rel='city'>La Chine</a>, yesterday morning, that the army 
marched at six o clock for this place. We arrived here with the 
main body at six o clock in the afternoon, when we discovered 
several of the enemy s, bateaux taking our unhappy prisoners off 
an island at one league distance from us. Words cannot express 
our anxiety, as it was not in our power to relieve them. Our 
bateaux were a league behind, coming up the rapids very slowly. 
I sent several expresses to hurry them. However, it was sunset 
before they arrived and I could embark all my people ; previous 
to which arrived some Caghnawaga Indians whom. I had sent 
early in the morning to the savages, demanding a surrender of 
our prisoners, and, in case of refusal, and that any of them were 
murdered, I would sacrifice every Indian who fell into my hands, 
and would follow them to their towns and destroy them by fire 
and sword. The answer I received was, that they had five hundred of our prisoners collected together, and that if we offered to 
land and attack them at Quinze Chiens, where they were posted, they would immediately kill every prisoner, and give no quarter to any who should fall into their hands hereafter. 
</p><p>
Words cannot express my feelings at the delivery of this message. Torn by the conflicting passions of revenge and humanity, 
a sufficient force to take ample revenge, raging for action, urged 
me on one hand ; and humanity for five hundred unhappy wretches, 
who were on the point of being sacrificed if our vengeance was not 
delayed, plead equally strong on the other. In this situation, I 
ordered the boats to row immediately for the island, where our 
prisoners had been confined. We there found five unhappy 
wretches, naked, and almost starved; the rest, they informed me, 
were all taken off by the savages just before, except one or two, 
who, being unwell, were inhumanly butchered. I immediately 
ordered the boats to row for Quinze Chiens, about four miles 
from the island on the main land. There the enemy had two 
brass six-pounders, were intrenched round the church, and well 
fortified. They began firing upon us, when we approached within 
three quarters of a mile of the shore, with their cannon and 
small arms. We rowed near in shore without returning a shot. 
By this time it was so dark we could not distinguish a man on 
shore, and, as Ave were unacquainted with the ground, and our 
people much fatigued, I judged it most prudent to return to St. 
Ann s. 
</p><p>
On our arrival, I called a Council of War, who were unanimous 
for attacking the enemy early in the morning ; and, at two 
o clock in the morning, Lieutenant Parke was sent to me with a 
flag and articles for exchange of prisoners, entered into by Major Sherburne and Captain Forster. One article was, that there 
should be an exchange of prisoners of equal rank, and that our 
troops should be under an obligation not to take up arms again; 
but the King's troops were to be at full liberty. This article I 
rejected, and despatched Lieutenant Parke to acquaint Captain Forster that I would enter into articles for exchange of prisoners 
on equal terms, which, if he refused, my determination was to 
attack him immediately ; and, if our prisoners were murdered, to 
sacrifice every soul who .fell into our hands. Captain Forster 
agreed to these terms, and sent them back signed. As they 
were not so explicit as I judged necessary, with some alterations 
and explanations I returned them. Inclosed you receive a copy, 
as finally agreed to. This matter was finished at six o clock this evening, and to-morrow morning part of the prisoners are to be sent to Caghnawaga. 
</p><p>
You may be surprised that six days were allowed for the deli 
very of the prisoners, and that hostilities should in the mean 
time cease. This does not include the savages. Captain Forster 
pretended it was not in his power to fix on any particular time 
for that purpose, but would engage, on his honor, to deliver them 
as soon as possible ; and proposed, if it could be done in less 
time, hostilities should then commence, of which Captain Forster 
is to determine and acquaint me this evening. The base, hypo 
critical conduct of the King's officers, their employing savages to 
screen them in their butcheries, their suffering their prisoners to 
be killed in cool blood, I will leave with you to comment on. I 
observed to Captain Forster, that it appeared very extraordinary 
to me, that he could influence the savages to deliver up the prisoners, and could not keep them from being murdered in cool 
blood, or prevent their being stripped naked, contrary to the 
agreement made with the garrison at the Cedars. 
</p><p>
I intend being with you this evening, to consult on some effectual measures to take with these savages, and still more savage 
British troops, who are still at Quinze Chiens. As soon as our 
prisoners are released, I hope it will be in our power to take 
ample vengeance, or we nobly fall in the attempt. I am, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. A party of fourteen or fifteen Canadians, taken at the 
Cedars, are excluded from the above treaty; Captain Forster 
alleging that he had positive orders from government for that 
purpose. 
</p><p>
ARTICLES FOR EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS. 
</p><p>
After the maturest deliberation on the customs and manners 
of the savages in war, which I find so opposite and contrary 
to the humane disposition of the British Government, and to 
all civilized nations, and to avoid the inevitable consequences of 
the savage customs in former wars (which by their threats and menaces I find is not changed), that of their putting their prisoners to death, to disencumber themselves in case of their being attacked by their enemy ; I have, therefore, in compliance with 
the above disposition in Government, and the dictates of humanity, thought fit to enter into the following articles of agreement 
with <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel=''>General Arnold</a>, in the name of the power he is employed 
by, and of the officers and soldiers, who shall be released by 
this agreement, whose rank and numbers shall be indorsed on 
this cartel. 
</p><p>
1st. That there shall be an exchange of prisoners faithfully 
made, returning an equal number of his Majesty's troops of the 
same rank with those released by this agreement, as soon as 
possible, within the space of two months, allowing a moderate 
time for casualties that may render the performance of this article impracticable. 
</p><p>
2d. That the prisoners shall be conducted in safety, with all 
possible convenience and despatch that circumstances will permit 
to the south shore of the River St. Lawrence, from which they 
are to repair to St. John s, and return to their own countries 
immediately, without committing any waste or spoil on their 
march thither, allowing ten or twelve to go to <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a> to 
transact their private affairs. 
</p><p>
3d. That the prisoners so returned shall not, under any pretext whatsoever, either in words, writing, or signs, give the least 
information to Government enemies, or their adherents now in 
arms, in the least prejudicial to his Majesty's service. 
</p><p>
4th. That hostages be delivered for the performance of these 
articles to the full, according to the sense and spirit of the agreement, without any equivocation whatsoever. 
</p><p>
5th. That the security of the subscribers be given to the in 
habitants for all the waste and spoil committed by the detachments under Colonel Bedel, on fair accounts, attested and signed, 
being delivered, and for which the hostages are not to be answerable. 
</p><p>
It being our full intention to fulfil the above articles, we 
mutually sign and interchange them as assurances of performance. 
</p><p>
Given under our hands this 27th day of May, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>. 
</p><p>
VAUDREUIL. 
</p><p>
GEORGE FORSTER, 
Captain Commanding the King's troops. 
</p><p>
Article 2d. The prisoners shall be sent to the south shore 
of St. Lawrence within one league of Caghnawaga, and from 
thence to St. John's and their own country, except twelve, who 
have liberty to go to <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, for which purpose six days shall 
be allowed, and hostilities to cease on both sides. 
</p><p>
Article 4. Four Captains shall be sent to Quebec as hostages, and remain there until prisoners are exchanged. 
</p><p>
Article 5th. The Continental troops, from principle, have ever 
avoided plundering. Upon proof being made of any waste committed by Colonel Bedel's detachment, reparation shall be made. 
Given under our hands this 27th of May, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>, at St. Ann s.

</p><p>
GEORGE FORSTER,

</p><p>
Two Majors, nine Captains, twenty subalterns, four hundred and forty-three soldiers. But if the prisoners can be conducted 
in less time, this truce to cease on the return of the last boats employed on this service, on notice given. 
</p><p>
GEORGE FORSTER, 
Captain Commanding the King's troops. 
</p><p>
May 27th, 1770. Answer. If Captain Forster will choose to 
have hostilities commence in less time than six days, it will be 
perfectly agreeable to me, provided the time is fixed on, and 
notice given this evening.

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have complied with your orders, as for as in my power, 
respecting the destination of the troops. I intended setting off 
this day for Sorel, but have been much hindered by taking the 
goods in town. Every possible obstacle has been thrown in 
my way. However, I shall secure many articles much wanted 
by the army. Yesterday, Colonel Dehaas, with his detachment, 
set off for Sorel. Last night and this morning I have received 
intelligence of four or five hundred savages and Canadians being  on the Island, with the intention of attacking our post at 
La Chine ; and, as the garrison is so weak we can spare few 
men from it, I have thought proper to order Colonel Dehaas 
to return. I think it absolutely necessary some effectual methods should be taken with the savages immediately, or we 
shall be obliged to keep up a large force here. I shall be continually harassed with them. This affair will prevent my joining  you at Sorel as soon as I could wish. It will not be in my power to take an account of the goods, and send them off, these three days. 
</p><p>
I believe the enemy below will not advance very suddenly. 
I make no doubt you will have time to prepare for them, and 
that we shall be reenforced in time to secure this part of the 
country. I have ordered Colonel Bedel, his Major, and Captain Young, to Sorel for their trial. 
</p><p>
An express arrived here from Three Rivers yesterday. I 
must refer you to General Thompson for the advice he brought. 
We have only two pieces of cannon here, and no matrosses. 
</p><p>
With great esteem and affection, I am, dear General, 
Your obedient, humble servant,

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I this moment received a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> at 
Sorel, dated at 4 o clock yesterday evening, informing me that 
a body of the King's troops and a number of ships were between him and Three Rivers, and that he soon expected to be 
attacked. I have sent every man that could be spared to his 
assistance, but am fearful he will be obliged to abandon his 
post. If the enemy land on that side, I am fearful they will endeavour to possess themselves of <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a> and St. John s. 
If they come upon this side (on which they are at present), 
we must evacuate this town. Some days since the sick and 
baggage have been removed to St. John s. I am now removing  a parcel of goods I have seized for the use of the army. 
I expect to have all over this evening. I shall retain only 
four or five hundred men to garrison the place, until I receive 
orders to leave it, or am obliged to quit it by superior force. 
Out of upwards of eight thousand men in this country, not five 
thousand effectives can be mustered. The smallpox has broke 
and divided the army in such a manner that it is almost 
ruined. 
</p><p>
Our want of almost every necessary for the army, and repeated misfortunes and losses, have greatly dispirited the troops. 
Our enemies are daily increasing, and our friends deserting us. 
Under these discouragements and obstacles, with a powerful army 
against us, well disciplined, and wanting in no one article to 
carry on their operations, it will be a miracle, if we keep the 
country. My only expectation is to secure our retreat to St. 
John's or the Isle-aux-Noix, where it will doubtless be thought 
necessary to make a stand ; for which purpose all the bateaux 
and vessels on your side the Lake, that can be spared, should 
be sent over. Our gondolas we shall be obliged to destroy. 
Others ought immediately to be taken in hand to secure the Lake. The enemy, I am well informed, have brought a number with them, framed and done to put up in a short time. 
The want of a little attention in time has lost us this fine 
country. I hope for better things on your side, and that, in 
the rotation of fortune, something better will turn up for us 
here. In every vicissitude of fortune, I am, with great esteem 
and affection, dear General,

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I received your letter of the 28th ultimo to the Honorable 
Commissioners, respecting the Oneidas, the 6th instant. There 
was a meeting of those Indians and several other tribes at 
Caghnawaga, some of whom agreed to deliver up the hatchet 
received from Governor Carleton last year, and remain neuter 
in the present dispute. On the 7th they came to <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, 
when, after the usual speeches and ceremonies, the St. Francis, Caghnawagas, and Conosadagas gave up the hatchet. The 
Oswagatchas pretended they had no authority for doing it; to 
whom I observed we were ready to receive them as friends, 
but if they preferred war to peace, we were ready to meet 
them as enemies ; that we had it in our power to destroy them 
whenever we pleased, which they would soon be convinced of, 
if they did not lay down the hatchet. The Oneidas received 
the presents you desired, except the blankets and clouts, which 
could not be procured in town, having all been sent to <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>. I gave them an order on the Quarter-master there, but 
find, since, that they went directly to St. John s, and did not 
receive them. 
</p><p>
General Thompson left the Sorel three days since, with two 
thousand men, for Three Rivers, where are about three or four 
hundred of the enemy intrenching. One frigate, a brig, and 
eight sloops and schooners are above Richelieu. I expect every 
moment to hear of an action between General Thompson and 
the enemy. A number of Indians and some regular troops are 
about this place, waiting, as is said, for a reinforcement from 
above, and for Governor Carleton to advance, when I expect 
we shall have an opportunity of seeing them here. 
</p><p>
I have received your instructions respecting the Tories and 
their effects. Most of the former had absconded. Great part 
of the latter is secured. I have sent to St. John's a quantity 
of goods for the use of the army, some bought and some seized. 
I am in hopes of fixing on some method, in a day or two. 
of having them made up, as they are much wanted. I am, 
very respectfully, dear General, 
</p><p>

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I went to St. John's yesterday, where I found every thing in 
the greatest confusion ; not one stroke done to fortify the camp ; 
the engineer a perfect sot ; at that place and this-, near three 
thousand sick. I have given orders that the sick draw only half 
rations in future. I have ordered Colonel Antill to St. John s, 
and an abatis and lines to be immediately begun, to inclose the 
two old forts, and an encampment sufficient to hold six thousand 
men. 
</p><p>
I am fully of opinion not one minute ought to be lost in securing  our retreat, and saving our heavy cannon, baggage, and provisions. The enemy will never attack you at Sorel. Their force 
is doubtless much superior to ours, and we have no advice of 
any reinforcements. Shall we sacrifice the few men we have, 
by endeavouring to keep possession of a small part of the country, 
which can be of little or no service to us ? The junction of the 
Canadians with the Colonies, an object which brought us into 
this country, is now at an end. Let us quit them, and secure 
our own country, before it is too late. There will be more honor 
in making a safe retreat, than hazarding a battle against such 
superiority, which will doubtless be attended with the loss of men, 
artillery, &c., and the only pass to our country. These arguments are not urged by fear for my personal safety. I am content to be the last man who quits this country, and fall, so that 
my country rise. But let us not fall all together. 
</p><p>
The goods I seized at <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a> and sent to <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>, under 
the care of Major Scott, have been broken open, plundered, and 
huddled together in the greatest confusion. They were taken in 
such a hurry it was impossible to take a particular account of 
them. Each man's name was marked on his packages. When 
Major Scott arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>, he received your positive orders 
to repair to Sorel. The guard was ordered to return, and the 
goods to be delivered to Colonel Hazen, to be stored. He refused 
receiving or taking any care of them, by which means, and Major 
Scott's being ordered away, the goods have been opened and 
plundered, I believe, to a large amount. It is impossible for 
me to distinguish each man's goods, or ever settle with the 
proprietors. The goods are delivered to Mr. McCarty. This is 
not the first or last order Colonel Hazen has disobeyed. I think 
him a man of too much consequence for the post he is in. I 
am giving him orders to send directly to St. John's all the heavy 
cannon, shot, powder, bateaux, valuable stores, and the sick. I 
go to <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a> immediately, and beg to have your orders as soon 
as possible for my future conduct. I am, with respect and esteem, dear General, 
</p><p>
Your obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. If you should think proper to retire to St. John s, will 
it not be best to order a number of carts to be ready here from 
the neighbouring parishes, and enforce your order by sending a 
number of armed men to secure them ?

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I wrote you a few days since, from <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, that I had seized 
a parcel of goods for the use of the army, by particular orders 
from the Commissioners of Congress. Our hurry and confusion 
was so great when the goods were received, it was impossible 
to take a particular account of them. Every man's name was 
marked on his particular packages, with intention of taking a 
particular account of them at <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>, or St. John s, where the 
goods were ordered to be stored. Major Scott was sent with them, 
with orders to have them stored under the care of Colonel Ilazen, 
who commanded at <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>. On his arrival there, he received 
orders from <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> to repair to Sorel. Colonel Ilazen refused taking the goods into store, or taking any charge of them. 
They were heaped in piles on the bank of the river. Colonel 
Hazen finally received them, and placed sentinels over them. 
They were, however, neglected in such a manner, that great 
part were stolen or plundered. On receiving this intelligence, I 
repaired to <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a> ; the goods were sent to St. John's by 
Colonel Hazen, in different parcels, all under the care of a French 
Corporal, and through them, I found the goods broken open, 
plundered, and all mixed together in the greatest confusion, and 
great part missing. Mr. McCarty has <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a>'s orders, 
and is now receiving the goods. I have sent over to Ticonde-roga a quantity of nails and goods, the property of Thomas 
Walker, Esq., and ordered them to be stored there, and delivered 
to his order. 
</p><p>
We have a report here, that on Sunday last our army, of 
about two thousand men, under the command of General Thompson, attacked the enemy near Three Ivivers, and were repulsed, 
with the loss of twenty men and some bateaux. We have received no particular accounts of this matter, though several days 
have elapsed since the affair happened. 
</p><p>
Near one half of our army are sick, mostly with the smallpox. 
If the enemy have a force of six or eight, and some say ten 
thousand men, we shall not be able to oppose them, sick, divided, ragged, undisciplined, and unofficered, as we are. If we 
are not soon reenforced, I tremble for the event. A loss of our 
heavy cannon, which is all ordered to Sorel, must ensue, if not 
of our army, as our retreat is far from being secured. Not one 
stroke has been struck to secure our encampment here. I have 
ordered men out to-morrow morning to inclose our encampment 
and the two old forts with an abatis and breastwork. 
</p><p>
Dr. Stringer is in a disagreeable situation. Three thousand 
men are sick here and at <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>, and no room or conveniency 
for them. I should advise his going to the Isle-aux-Noix, was 
there any conveniency for the sick, or boards to make any. I 
have wrote <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> on the occasion. I have ordered the 
frames of the vessels here taken in pieces, and sent to Crown 
Point. The timbers are all numbered, and easily put together 
again. 
</p><p>
If any more men are ordered for this country, let me entreat 
you to hurry them on, and all the water-craft. I am, dear 
General, 
</p><p>

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Since writing the foregoing, I arrived here, and met Dr. Center, who left Sorel at 12 o clock this day. He informs me that 
General Thompson, Colonel Irvine, Drs. McKenny and Me Cawley, Lieutenants Bird and Curry are prisoners, and about forty 
men missing. General Thompson has wrote for his baggage, 
which has been sent to him. Burgoyne is with the enemy. Seventy transports, and, by the best accounts, ten thousand troops, 
are arrived in Quebec. The whole force we can muster does not 
exceed four thousand effectives, when they are all collected. I 
have wrote <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> my opinion very freely, which is, 
to collect our whole force at St. John's immediately, and secure 
our retreat. I am told his intention is to remain at Sorel, until 
attacked by the enemy. I believe there will be little danger of 
it. I make no doubt the enemy will pass Sorel, and, as soon as 
in possession of <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, march immediately for St. John s, and 
endeavour to cut off our retreat. In which case, if we save our 
army, the cannon and heavy baggage must fall into the hands 
of the enemy. 
</p><p>
All the craft on your side the Lake, in my opinion, ought immediately to be sent to St. John s, and a number of gondolas 
built as soon as possible to guard the Lake. You may expect 
soon to hear of our evacuating Canada, or being prisoners. I go 
to <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a> in the morning, where I shall remain until I have 
orders to quit it, or am attacked, when it will be too late. I 
am, respectfully, dear General, 
</p><p>
Yours, &c.,

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 20th instant I received last night. I am 
sorry to hear your treaty with the Indians is so long retarded. 
You must have an infinite deal of trouble with them, which I am 
fearful will prejudice your health ; and your presence is much 
wanted both at <a href='/results.php?city=skenesborough' rel='city'>Skenesborough</a> and this place. I wrote you from 
the former place on the 25th instant, at which time only two 
companies of carpenters were arrived, one from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and 
the other from Connecticut ; since which the whole have arrived, 
(o the number of two hundred. I left them such directions as I 
thought necessary, and orders to begin four row-galleys, nearly of 
the construction of those built in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, to carry four 
pieces heavy and two pieces light cannon each. The two largest 
schooners are at Crown Point, the sloop goes this morning, and 
four gondolas will follow in two or three days. I intend to visit 
<a href='/results.php?city=skenesborough' rel='city'>Skenesborough</a> on Monday next. I shall be happy to accelerate the business all in my power, and to take as much trouble from 
off your hands as possible, as I am sensible you have more than your share of it. 
</p><p>
A Frenchman, arrived here in fifteen days from St. Francois, 
confirms the intelligence respecting the Indians, and adds that all 
the tribes in Canada were determined on a neutrality; that the 
troops were busy in building bateaux and several large vessels 
at St. John s. General Carleton has given the French inhabitants 
notice of his intention of crossing Lake Champlain the last of 
August, or beginning of September, and that he should depend 
on their joining him. If we are supplied with the articles I 
wrote for, we shall soon be in a condition to give him a proper 
reception. 
</p><p>
Inclosed is a return of the ordnance stores, shot, &c., &c., 
by which you will observe there are many articles wanting to 
complete the same, as also there is a great deficiency of shot 
in particular, grape, double-headed, chain, and round, which will 
be very serviceable among vessels and bateaux. More heavy 
cannon will be wanted for the row-galleys. The four now building  will carry eight twenty-fours, and eight eighteens. Four 
others will be set up soon, and will require an equal number 
of guns. To supply the row-galleys and lines, we have only 
eleven pieces, and ten twelve-pounders, which may answer, 
though not so well as heavier guns. If they are substituted, 
eleven pieces will still be wanting, with shot, &c., which I wish 
may be sent up, if they can possibly be procured. With the 
approbation of <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> I sent to Connecticut for three 
hundred seamen. The express had orders to call on you (if 
returned), and take your instructions in the matter. As it was 
uncertain, if you were returned, I wrote to Captain Varick desiring him to give the express a warrant on the Paymaster-General for one thousand pounds, to pay the bounty of the 
seamen, as the treasury was empty. lie has proceeded on to 
General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>. We are informed, that of the four regiments coming from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, there is a very considerable number of seamen, who are daily expected. I am, &c.

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Your favor of the olst ultimo was delivered to me on the 4th 
instant. I feel very sensibly for you in your disagreeable situation. I wish the fatigue and anxiety you undergo may not impair your health ; and that you may succeed in your expectation 
with the savages, and soon give us the pleasure of seeing you 
here. 
</p><p>
Captain Varick has been very active and industrious in procuring  the articles for the navy. Many are arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, 
and proper steps taken to procure the others. The carpenters 
go on with great spirit. Eight gondolas will be completed in a 
few days. One row-galley is gone to <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, and will soon 
be fitted and armed. Three others will be launched in ten days 
or a fortnight. Four others will be set up in a few days, great 
part of the timber being cut. Iron, sails, cordage, and anchors 
will be wanted in a few days. About two tons of the former is 
here, and six tons will be wanted to complete the galleys in 
hand ; twelve or fifteen tons will be necessary for the galleys to 
be set up. It will expedite the building if six or eight tons can be sent up in spikes from five to seven inches long, chiefly about six inches. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> transmitted to you, last week, the testimony of two French Captains, lately from Canada, which is contradicted 
by a Lieutenant B. Whitcomb, who was lately sent from Crown Point to St. John s, which place he left the 31st ultimo. He 
went down on the east side as far as <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>, and returned on the west. Says he observed about forty bateaux at St. John's, 
and some others building, but no large vessels ; believes there were about two thousand men there, and one thousand between St. John's and <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>. 
</p><p>
This afternoon I returned to <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, and in a few days propose to go down the Lake with the vessels completed, about ten sail. 
</p><p>
The militia come in very slowly ; not more than fifteen hundred have arrived. Our work at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> goes on briskly. 
The line will be completed in ten days or a fortnight. 
</p><p>
I am, with every sentiment of friendship and esteem, dear General, your obedient, humble servant,

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The 24th instant, I left Crown Point; the 25th, at night, 
anchored at "Willsborough. The same night came on a violent 
storm at northeast; the next day, at two, P. M., was obliged to 
weigh anchor and return to this place, where the whole fleet 
arrived the same evening, except the Spitfire, Captain Ulmer, 
who could not clear the shore, and was obliged to come to an 
anchor again, and rode out the storm, though exposed to the 
rake of Cumberland Bay, fifty miles long. The hard gale made 
an amazing sea; and, when I expected to hear the gondola was 
foundered, or drove on shore, she joined us, having received no 
damage, though a light bateau, veered astern of her, was sunk 
with the sea breaking over her. The severe weather prevented 
my despatching Lieutenant Whitcomb before yesterday morning. 
The first fair wind, I will follow him. I should have gone this 
evening, but the breeze is so light, night would have come on 
before we could have reached a safe place of anchorage. 
</p><p>
I have had no advice from St. John's or Isle-aux-Noix. The 
earliest intelligence I receive shall be communicated to you immediately. I am very anxious to hear from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and 
make no doubt when you receive any material advices, I shall 
soon be acquainted with them. 
</p><p>
Inclosed is a return of the strength of the fleet, by which you 
will observe that seventy-four men are wanting to complete the 
numbers proposed for the vessels, which are barely sufficient 
when complete. I should be extremely glad they were sent to 
us soon. If you think proper to send them, the bearer, Lieutenant Calderwood, will take charge of them. 
</p><p>
Mr. Gilliland has the only good draught I know of Lake Champlain, which, he says, was delivered to Captain Bush for 
you. It will be of great service to me, as I have no draught of 
the Lake. 
</p><p>
If a good officer can be procured to act as Captain of the 
Royal Savage, I think lie might be of service in case any accident should happen to me. The present Master is not fit for the 
command in chief, though a good man in his present station. 
</p><p>
I suppose by this time <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a> has paid you a visit. 
Please to make my respectful compliments to him, if arrived, 
and let him know I will write him very particularly as soon as 
I arrive at the other end of the Lake.

I am, with real affection and esteem, dear General, your obedient, humble servant,

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I intended sending the foregoing from Button-Mould Bay, but 
waited for a boat that I had sent to this place for a barrel of 
fresh salmon, which I had designed for you. The late freshets 
have broke the dam, so that none can be caught till it is mended. Mr. Gilliland sent you a few salted ones, very indifferent, 
which we have eaten, expecting to send you some fresh ones. 
</p><p>
Yesterday, at noon, we left Button-Mould Bay, and arrived 
here last night. Before we passed the Split Rock, we saw two 
sail astern, which we supposed were the Lee and a gondola. 
They have not yet joined us. We are now under way, with a 
fresh southerly breeze, and expect to be at the Isle-aux-Tetes 
before night. I hope soon to have it in my power to send you 
a, very full account of the strength of the enemy by sea and 
land. I hope no time will be lost in forwarding the three galleys. When they have joined us, I am very confident the enemy will not dare attempt crossing the Lake. 
</p><p>
I beg my congratulatory compliments to General St. Clair on 
his promotion. When the enemy drive us back to <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, 
I have some thoughts of going to Congress, and begging leave to 
resign. Do you think they will make me a Major-General? 
</p><p>
Enire nous, I have received a letter from Samuel Chase, Esq., 
in which he mentions your letter to John Adams, Esq., and desires an explanation. I will send it to you when I have time to answer it.

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I wrote you the 2d instant, from Willsborough, by Lieutenant 
Calderwood. The same evening, anchored at Schuyler's Island; 
and, on the 3d instant, arrived safe at this place, which is four 
or five miles from the Isle-aux-Tetes, and seven miles from the 
Isle-la-Motte. We found the Isle-aux-Tetes occupied by the enemy, and several hundred men encamped between that and us, 
who, the evening of our arrival, made a precipitate retreat. I 
have posted my guard-beats at a point running into the Lake, 
about one mile below us. The enemy's boats have several times 
appeared on the Lake, with a view of decoying our boats ; but I 
have never suffered them to be pursued. Lieutenant Whitcomb 
arrived here the 5th instant, in the evening, and went off the 
same night, with three men, for St. John s, on the west side. I 
sent off Ensign McKay early the next morning, on the cast side, 
with three men. They are to send me intelligence from time to 
time. I expect to hear from them to-morrow. 
</p><p>
Early yesterday morning the boats were ordered on shore, to 
cut fascines to fix on the bows and sides of the gondolas, to prevent the enemy's boarding, and to keep off small shot. One of 
the boats went on shore (contrary to orders) before the others 
were ready. They were attacked by a party of savages, who 
pursued them into the water. They all reached the boat; but, 
before they could row off, three were killed and six wounded. 
The party was headed by a regular officer, who called to our 
people to resign themselves. On our firing a few shot among 
them, they immediately dispersed. A party was sent on shore, 
who found a laced beaver hat, the button marked forty-seventh 
regiment. 
</p><p>
The Lee and gondola arrived here yesterday morning. We 
are moored in a line across the Lake, in such a manner that it 
will be impossible for a bateau to pass us. I hope the galleys 
are nearly completed. The force of the enemy is uncertain; 
however, they have this advantage, that they can man all their 
bateaux with soldiers, whenever they think proper to attack us ; 
and our vessels are so low that numbers may carry them by 
boarding. This must be attended with great loss on their side, 
as I am positive that they will not be able to surprise us. If I 
find the enemy have a considerable naval force, I design to retire to Cumberland Head, or Schuyler's Island, until joined by 
the three galleys, which will be superior to all our present force, 
when the whole are joined. 
</p><p>
I believe the Isle-la-Motte will be the best stand, as the enemy can bring nothing against us by land, nor will they dare to 
come on the Island; and, by our guard-boats, we can prevent 
any boats going from Missisco Bay. As you have more troops 
at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> than you want, will it not be prudent to send up 
one thousand or fifteen hundred men, who might encamp on 
the Isle-la-Motte, and be ready at all times to assist us, if 
attacked? Twenty men to a bateau will be sufficient. They 
might load under cover of the vessels, push out and fire, and 
retire under cover again ; and, if the enemy's boats should make 
their principal attack on any particular vessel, those bateaux 
might assist her. Each should be fixed for a swivel in each 
end ; and, if they are arrived, one should be fixed in them. If 
you should think it necessary to send a detachment, it will be 
necessary to bring intrenching tools, that they may cover them 
selves from small-arms. 
</p><p>
We have but very indifferent men in general. Great part of those who shipped for seamen know very little of the matter. 
Three or four good gunners are wanted. Inclosed is a list of our sick, who increase fast. I have sent up, in three bateaux, 
twenty-three men, who will be of no service for some time. I wish fifty-eight seamen could be procured and sent down. 
</p><p>
I inclose you a letter from Samuel Chase, Esq. You will observe he requests an explanation of your letter to Mr. Adams. 
He observes, my character is much injured by a report prevailing  in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, of my having sequestered the goods sek+ed 
in <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>. As you have had an opportunity of hearing that 
matter canvassed on the trial of Colonel Hazen, I beg you will 
be kind enough to write your sentiments to him on the matter. 
I cannot but think it extremely cruel, when I have sacrificed my 
ease, health, and great part of my private property in the cause 
of my country, to be calumniated as a robber and thief, at a 
time too when I have it not in my power to be heard in my own defence. 
</p><p>
The 15th August, when we left <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, the fleet was 
victualled for thirty days, which time is elapsed, except six days. 
We have on board the fleet six or eight days provision, besides 
twenty barrels of flour, left at Crown Point, to be baked, and 
ten barrels of pork, which I have ordered Lieutenant Calderwood 
to bring down, which will serve the fleet to the 20th. As the 
Lake is often very difficult to pass for a number of days, we 
ought to have at least one month's provision on hand. Major G. 
goes up with the sick, to whom I must refer you for particulars. 
We are very anxious to hear from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. I hope soon to 
have that pleasure by one of the galleys, which I think must be 
completed by this time. 
</p><p>
Please to make my compliments to the gentlemen of your 
family, and believe me, with much respect, esteem, and affection, 
dear General, yours, &c.,

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Yesterday morning, at eight o clock, the enemy's fleet, consisting of one ship, mounting sixteen guns, one snow, mounting 
the same number, one schooner, of fourteen guns, two of twelve, 
two sloops, a bomb-ketch, and a large vessel (that did not come 
up), with fifteen or twenty flat-bottomed boats, or gondolas, carrying one twelve or eighteen-pounder in their bows, appeared 
off Cumberland Head. We immediately prepared to receive them. 
The galleys and Royal Savage were ordered under way. The 
rest of our fleet lay at an anchor. 
</p><p>
At eleven o clock they ran under the lee of Valcour Island, 
and began the attack. The schooner, by some bad management, 
fell to leeward, and was first attacked. One of her masts was 
wounded, and her rigging shot away. The Captain thought prudent to run her on the point of Valcour, where all the men 
were saved. They boarded her, and at night set fire to her. 
</p><p>
At half past twelve the engagement became general, and very 
warm. Some of the enemy's ships, and all their gondolas, beat 
and rowed up within musket shot of us. They continued a very 
hot fire, with round and grape-shot, until five o clock, when they 
thought proper to retire to about six or seven hundred yards 
distance, and continued the fire until dark. 
</p><p>
The Congress and <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> have suffered greatly. The latter lost her First Lieutenant, killed, Captain and Master wound 
ed. The <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> lost all her officers, except her Captain. 
The <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> was hulled in so many places that she sunk 
about one hour after the engagement was over. The whole 
killed and wounded amounted to about sixty. The enemy landed 
a large number of Indians on the Island, and each shore, who 
kept an incessant fire on us, but did little damage. The enemy 
had, to appearance, upwards of one thousand men in bateaux, 
prepared for boarding. We suffered much for want of seamen 
and gunners. I was obliged myself to point most of the guns 
on board the Congress, which I believe did good execution. The 
Congress received seven shot between wind and water, was hulled 
a dozen times, had her mainmast wounded in two places, and 
her yard in one. The <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> was hulled a number of 
times, her mainmast shot through, and must have a new one. 
Both vessels are very leaky, and want repairing. 
</p><p>
On consulting with General Waterbury and Colonel Wiggles-worth, it was thought prudent to return to Crown Point, every 
vessel's ammunition being nearly three fourths spent, and the 
enemy greatly superior to us in ships and men. At seven 
o clock Colonel Wigglesworth, in the Trumbull, got under way. 
The gondolas and small vessels followed, and the Congress and 
<a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> brought up the rear. The enemy did not attempt 
to molest us. Most of the fleet is this minute come to an 
anchor. The wind is small to the southward. The enemy's 
fleet is under way to leeward, and beating up. As soon as our 
leaks are stopped, the whole fleet will make the utmost despatch to Crown Point, where I beg you will send ammunition, 
and your further orders for us. On the whole, I think we have 
had a very fortunate escape, and have great reason to return 
our humble and hearty thanks to Almighty God, for preserving  and delivering so many of us from our more than savage 
enemies. I am, dear General, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I had not moved on board the Congress when the 
enemy appeared, and lost all my papers and most of my clothes 
on board the schooner. I wish a dozen bateaux, well manned, 
could be sent immediately, to tow up the vessels in case of 
a southerly wind. 
</p><p>
I cannot, in justice to the officers in the fleet, omit mentioning  their spirited conduct during the action.

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I make no doubt, before this, you have received a copy of my 
letter to <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>, of the 12th instant, dated at Schuyler's 
Island, advising of an action between our fleet and the enemy s, 
the preceding day ; in which we lost a schooner and gondola. We 
remained no longer at Schuyler's Island than to stop our leaks 
and mend the sails of the <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>. At two o clock, afternoon, 
the 12th, weighed anchor, with a fresh breeze to the southward. 
The enemy's fleet, at the same time, got under way. Our gondolas made very little way ahead. 
</p><p>
In the evening the wind moderated, and we made such progress that, at G o clock next morning, we were about off Wills-borough, twenty-eight miles from Crown Point. The enemy's 
fleet were very little above Schuyler's Island. The wind breezed 
up to the southward, so that we gained very little by beating or 
rowing. At the same time the enemy took a fresh breeze from 
the north-east, and, by the time we had reached Split Rock, were 
alongside of us. The <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> and Congress were in the rear; 
the rest of our fleet were ahead, except two gondolas sunk at 
Schuyler's Island. The <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> galley was in such a shattered condition, and had so many men killed and wounded, she 
struck to the enemy, after receiving a few broadsides. We were 
then attacked in the Congress galley, by a ship mounting twelve 
eighteen-pounders, a schooner of fourteen sixes, and one of twelve 
sixes, two under our stern, and one on our broadside, within 
musket shot. 
</p><p>
They kept up an incessant fire upon us for about five glasses, 
with round and grape shot, which we returned as briskly. The 
sails, rigging, and hull of the Congress were shattered and torn 
in pieces ; the First Lieutenant and three men killed ; when, to 
prevent her falling into the hands of the enemy, who had seven 
sail around me, I ran her ashore in a small creek, ten miles 
from Crown Point, on the east side, when, after saving our small 
arms, I set her on fire, with four gondolas, with whose crews I 
reached Crown Point, through the woods, that evening, and very 
luckily escaped the savages, who waylaid the road in two hours 
after we passed. At four o clock yesterday morning I reached this 
place, exceedingly fatigued and unwell, having been without sleep 
or refreshment for near three days. 
</p><p>
Of our whole fleet, we have saved only two galleys, two small 
schooners, one gondola, and one sloop. General Waterbury, with 
one hundred and ten prisoners, was returned by Carleton last 
night. On board of the Congress, we had twenty odd men killed 
and wounded. Our whole loss amounts to eighty odd. The enemy's fleet were last night three miles below Crown Point. Their 
army is doubtless at their heels. We are busily employed in 
completing our lines and redoubts, which, I am sorry to say, are 
not so forward as I could wish. We have very few heavy 
cannon, but are mounting every piece we have. It is the opinion 
of Generals Gates and St. Clair, that eight or ten thousand militia should be immediately sent to our assistance, if they can possibly be spared from below. 
</p><p>
I am of opinion the enemy will attack us with their fleet and 
army at the same time. The former is very formidable, a list 
of which I am favored with by General Waterbury, and have 
inclosed. The season is so far advanced, our people are daily 
growing more healthy. We have about nine thousand effectives ; 
and, if properly supported,. I make no doubt of stopping the career of the enemy. All your letters to me, of late, have miscarried. I am extremely sorry to hear, by <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>, you are 
unwell. I have sent you, by General Waterbury, a small box, 
containing all my public and private papers and accounts, with a considerable sum of hard and paper money, which I beg the favor of your taking care of. I am, dear General,

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Your kind favor of the 17th I received four days since. I am 
greatly obliged to you for the friendship you express on my 
safety and having escaped the enemy. 
</p><p>
I am extremely glad to hear the militia are coming to our 
assistance. I believe the enemy, from the best accounts we can 
collect, are endeavouring to fortify Crown Point. I am afraid 
we shall not be able to detain a sufficient garrison for this place 
from the troops now here. 
</p><p>
A boom will be laid across the Lake this day, and a bridge 
to-morrow from <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> to Mount Independence. We cannot 
ascertain the strength of the enemy. In a few days we shall be 
ready to make a trial of their force, if they think proper to 
attack us. I have only time to add my most respectful compliments. and that I am, with every friendly wish, dear General, 
Your affectionate and obedient, humble servant,

</p><p>
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 
</p><p>
A person going down the river presents the first 
opportunity I have had of writing to your Excellency 
since I left Fort Western ; since which we have had 
a very fatiguing time. The men in general not understanding bateaux, have been obliged to wade, and 
haul them more than half way up the river. The 
last division is just arrived- three divisions are over 
the first carrying-place, and as the men are in high 
spirits, I make no doubt of reaching the Elver Chau-diere in eight or ten days, the greatest difficulty 
being, I hope, already past. We have now with us 
about twenty-five days provisions for the whole detachment, consisting of about nine hundred and fifty 
effective men. I intend making an exact return, but 
must defer it until I come to Chaudiere. 
</p><p>
I have ordered the Commissary to hire people acquainted with the river, and forward on the provisions left behind (about one hundred barrels) to the 
Great Carrying-place, to secure our retreat. The Expense will be considerable, but when set in competition with the lives or liberty of so many brave men, 
I think it trilling- and if we succeed, the provisions 
will not be lost, I have had no intelligence from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a>, and expect none till I reach Chaudiere Pond, where I expect a return of my express, 
and to determine my plan of operation, of which, as 
it is to be governed by circumstances, I can say no 
more than, if we are obliged to return, I believe we 
shall have a sufficiency of provisions to reach this place, where the supply I ordered the Commissary to 
send forward will enable us to return on our way 
home, so far that your Excellency will be able to relieve us. If we proceed on, we shall have a sufficient stock to reach the French inhabitants (where we can be supplied), if not Quebec. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency may possibly think we have been tardy in our march, as we have gained so little; but when you consider the badness and weight of the 
bateaux, and large quantity of provisions, &c., we have been obliged to force up against a very rapid stream, where you would have taken the men for 
amphibious animals, as they were a great part of the time under water; add to this the great fatigue in 
portage; you will think I have pushed the men as fast as they could possibly bear. The officers, volunteers, and privates in general, have acted with the 
greatest spirit and industry. I am, with the greatest respect, your Excellency's

Most obedient humble servant,

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
By this express you will receive advice from <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a> of our evacuating Canada, an event 
which I make no doubt (from our distressed situation. you have some time expected. The particulars of General Thompson's repulse and captivity, as 
nearly as could be ascertained, have been transmitted 
you. On advice of which, [with] very direct intelligence that the enemy were greatly superior to us in 
numbers, I advised <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> to secure his 
retreat by retiring to St. John s. He was determined 
to keep his post at Sorel, if possible, and did not 
retire until the 14th instant, at which time the enemy 
were as high up with their ships as the Sorel. 
</p><p>
On the 15th, at night, when the enemy were at 
twelve miles distance from me, I quitted <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a> 
with my little garrison of three hundred men. The 
whole army, with their baggage and cannon (except 
three heavy pieces left at <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>), arrived at St. John's the 17th, and at the Isle-aux-Noix the 18th; 
previous to which it was determined, by a Council of 
War at St. John s, that in our distressed situation, 
(one half of the army sick, and almost the whole destitute of clothing and every necessary of life, except 
salt pork and flour), it was not only imprudent, but 
impracticable, to keep possession of St. John s. 
</p><p>
Crown Point was judged the only place of health 
and safety, to which the army could retire and oppose the enemy. It was found necessary to remain 
at the Isle-aux-Noix for some few days, until the sick, 
heavy cannon, &c., could be removed. <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> did not choose to leave the Isle-aux-Noix until he 
received positive orders for that purpose, and thought 
it necessary for me to repair to this place, and wait 
on <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a>. I arrived here last night, and 
am happy to find him of our sentiments in quitting 
the Isle-aux-Noix, which, from its low situation, is rendered very unhealthy, and from the narrow channel 
leading to it from the north part of Lake Champlain, 
of six miles in length and from three to eight hundred yards in breadth, is rendered very insecure, as 
the enemy, by light pieces of cannon and smallarms, 
might render all access to it dangerous, if not impracticable. 
</p><p>
It now appears to me of the utmost importance, 
that the Lakes be immediately secured by a large 
number of (at least twenty or thirty) gondolas, row-galleys, and floating batteries. The enemy, from undoubted intelligence, have brought over a large number (it is said one hundred) frames for flat-bottomed 
boats, designed to be made use of on Lake Champlain ; and, from their industry and strength, will 
doubtless become masters of the Lake, unless every 
nerve on our part is strained to exceed them in a 
naval armament. I think it absolutely necessary, that 
at least three hundred carpenters be immediately 
employed. Fifty sent from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, who are acquainted with building that kind of craft, would greatly facilitate the matter. 
</p><p>
A particular return of the army could not be obtained, in our hurry and confusion. It will be transmitted to you in a few days. I believe the whole 
about seven thousand, and at least one half of them sick and unfit for duty, but daily recovering. Upwards of one thousand more are yet to have the 
smallpox. The enemy, from the best intelligence that can be obtained, are near ten thousand, exclusive of Canadians and savages. Few of the latter have joined them as yet. 
</p><p>
I make no doubt it will be thought necessary to 
repair Crown Point, or build a new fort near that 
place. The former, from the advantage of its situation, and the fine barracks nearly completed, will, I 
believe, be thought most proper. I make no doubt 
but <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>, who I am happy to hear is on 
his way here, will pay immediate attention to it. 
</p><p>
I flatter myself our arms, under your immediate 
direction, will meet with more success than they have 
done in this quarter. I make not the least doubt 
our struggles will be crowned with success. I am, 
with every friendly wish, most respectfully, dear General, your affectionate and

Obedient, humble servant,

MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I wrote your Excellency yesterday, that the boats, 
scows, &c. ? were sent up the river, eleven miles, to a place called Tohegan, except such as were necessary 
here, which would be secured from the enemy in case 
of their approach. Since which I have had no direct, 
and but very imperfect intelligence from your Excellency. I am at a loss if any part of your army has 
removed from <a href='/results.php?city=middlebrook' rel='city'>Middlebrook</a>, and more so of your Excellency's intentions. The enemy, I am informed, are 
at Somerset Heights, intrenching. <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> 
is at Flemington, with sixteen hundred Continental 
troops, the Jersey militia, and one thousand men I 
have sent him from this place, half Continental, the 
others militia, I expect Colonel Bull here to-morrow, 
with five hundred State troops, part of two battalions 
engaged for the war. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='colleague met'>General Mifflin</a> wrote me yesterday, that the City 
militia will move this morning; I am informed there 
are about two thousand of them ; they bring ten 
pieces cannon, and one royal howitzer, two hundred 
tents, one thousand felling axes, one thousand spades 
and shovels. One quarter part of the militia of this 
State are ordered out immediately, except two of the 
western counties. The whole, including the City 
militia, I am informed, will make ten thousand men. 
Three thousand of the Southern Continental troops 
are on their march, and will be in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> in 
the course of a week ; six heavy pieces cannon, 
four galleys, and ten armed boats, are arrived at Bristol and <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a> ferries. The enemy must be desperate indeed, if they attempt to push for <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
</p><p>
As the militia can be but illy spared at this busy 
season, I wish to know, as early as possible, your Excellency's orders respecting them ; if you wish to have 
them in the Jerseys or on this side the Delaware. 
If the latter, for the defence of the passes on the river, one half will effectually answer the purpose. I 
have examined; and inclosed your Excellency a sketch 
of the passes between this and <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a> Ferry. Four 
or five thousand men, with a few pieces of cannon, 
will effectually guard the whole, and as for down as 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, with the assistance of the galleys and 
armed boats, against twenty thousand men. Above 
Cornell's Ferry, I am convinced the enemy will never 
attempt to pass. I hope the troops will be ordered 
for a different purpose, that of securing the enemy 
where they are, in the Jerseys. If they are detained 
here, I shall employ them in fortifying the banks of 
the river against the passes. 
</p><p>
I have sent off, this evening, via Flemington, four 
wagons, and musket cartridges sixty-six thousand, 
under an escort of seventy-five men. I have only 
to add, with great respect and esteem, I am

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's favor of the 21st, respecting the 
militia, I received at three o'clock this evening, and 
immediately had as many inhabitants collected at the 
Coffee-House as I could notify. Fifty volunteers have 
engaged to go with <a href='/results.php?tla=jhc' rel='colleague'>General Cadwalader</a>, who this 
minute informs me he expects to collect a consider 
able number more in the morning, in the city. I 
cannot flatter myself with procuring many in the 
vicinity. These are unarmed. Search is making for 
all the arms in the city. I have ventured to order 
Colonel Jackson to march at three o'clock to-morrow 
morning, with the troops under his command. These, 
with the volunteers, and four hundred men now in 
the enemy's rear, will make a formidable body. Their 
places are supplied by Colonel Proctor's regiment, who 
will do garrison duty until a sufficient number of days, on account of the zeal of some members for sealing the letters 
up, and sending them back, without reading, in consequence of some 
harsh expressions against the King of France. However, it was over 
ruled, as you will see, and a more proper method, in my opinion, taken. 
What will be their next steps, time only will discover. In the packet 
to Congress were inclosed a great number of letters to the separate 
members. Some from Governor Johnstone to such of the members as 
he was acquainted with, and others from other persons in England, who 
had any acquaintance with them." 
convalescents can arrive from <a href='/results.php?city=valley forge' rel='city'>Valley Forge</a> ; for which 
purpose I intend giving an order, which, I trust, will 
meet your Excellency's approbation.

One hundred and odd deserters from the enemy 
have arrived in town this day. The whole number 
is little short of three hundred, and great numbers, I 
am informed, are scattered through the Jerseys.
