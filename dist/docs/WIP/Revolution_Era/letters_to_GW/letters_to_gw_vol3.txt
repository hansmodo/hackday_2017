BEALL.

In General Assembly, <a href='/results.php?city=annapolis' rel='city origin'>Annapolis</a>, <a rel='day origin' value='22'>22</a> <a rel="month origin" value="6">June</a>,  <a href='/results.php?year=1780' rel="origin">1780</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
The extreme difficulty of emboddng and marching 
the number of militia, required of this State by your 
Excellency and the Committee of Cooperation; the 
impracticability of marching them in due time, owing 
to the total want of camp equipage, arms, and accoutrements; the difficulty of procuring wagons and 
horses; the approaching harvest, and the importance 
and necessity of securing it, â€” have induced us to lay 
before your Excellency the following proposition. If 
it should meet with your approbation, and that of 
the Committee, we will stretch every nerve to carry 
it speedily into execution. 
</p><p>
We propose to exert our utmost endeavours to 
raise two thousand regulars, to serve during the war, 
fourteen hundred and sixty-nine of this number to 
complete our battalions, according to the late proposed augmentation. The residue we propose ta form 
into a regiment, to act in the place of the militia required; and this State will furnish and fill up the 
regiment, to its full complement, to join the Continental army, whenever we shall be called on to furnish 
aid of militia ; and we flatter ourselves that, as long 
as we furnish our quota of regulars, and this additional battalion, we shall not be required to furnish 
militia, unless in cases of extreme exigency. 
</p><p>
This plan, if generally adopted, would put under 
your Excellency's direction and command a regular 
and efficient force, on which you could constantly depend. It would save a great expense to these States 
in carriage, provisions, arms, and accoutrements. It 
would conduce to reconcile the minds of the people 
to the heavy charges of the war, when assured they 
should be left at home, to cultivate their lands, and 
reap the fruits of their industry. It would certainly 
tend to increase our crops, and afford the means of 
maintaining a much greater regular army than can 
he supported under frequent calls of the militia. It 
would, in some degree, prevent those emigrations of 
our men westward, which is become a very serious 
and alarming consideration to these States in general, and to this in particular. 
</p><p>
If your Excellency, on a view of all circumstances, 
should think it more conducive to the public interest 
to order the fourteen hundred and sixty-nine recruits, 
destined to fill up our battalions, to join the army 
under your immediate command, they shall be sent 
forward with all the despatch in our power. 
</p><p>
If this proposal should meet with your Excellency's 
approbation, and that of the Committee, it will be 
necessary, we apprehend, to draw from our battalions, 
under the Baron de Kalb, a number of officers to 
command, form, and discipline these new recruits. 
</p><p>
If the two thousand two hundred and five militia 
should be thought absolutely necessary, and preferable to the plan proposed, we will use our utmost endeavours to forward them on; but we fear, however 
strong our inclination, it will not be in our power to 
send out that number by the time required. 
</p><p>
We have the honor to be, with the highest respect 
and attachment. Sir, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and most humble servants, 
Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer, 
</p><p>
President of tJie Senate.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Just as I was setting out this morning to join 
your Excellency, I had intelligence that the enemy 
were out, and advancing to Springfield. I immediately wrote to the Commanding Officers of the militia, from Burlington to near Easton (and despatched 
messengers with the letters open) ; desired them to 
push down for further orders ; and wrote General Greene what I had done, that he might, in case the 
enemy retired, send them counter orders. I then 
came through part of Morris county to Chatham, to 
see if I could be of any use in that quarter. I there 
met with General Wilkinson and Charles Stewart, 
who assured me that the enemy, after advancing to 
Springfield, and burning also every house there, 
had retired. The last I can find of them, their rear 
had passed the four-mile stone from <a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a>, on 
full trot. Some militia had got in their rear, and 
others attending their flanks, as regular as their 
flanking parties in their approach. They were early 
skirmished with ; they were checked for some time 
at Connecticut Farms ; the bridge at Springfield was 
nobly contended, for near forty minutes. The fork 
of the road, near Campbell's Mills, was so well disputed as to stop the further progress of the enemy's 
right column. 
</p><p>
In short, in every part, our troops. Continental and 
militia, have behaved gloriously, and have made the 
enemy pay dearly for their jaunt. General Wilkinson informed me that General Greene had intelligence that all the enemy's flanking companies were 
to embark last night. I saw six British and Yagers 
prisoners at Chatham, who all agreed that General Knyphaiisen commanded this day. I suspect Sir 
Harry means to make some lively stroke above you. 
I met General Wayne near Chatham, where he intends to wait your Excellency's further orders. I 
shall be on to join your Excellency early in the 
morning; and am, most sincerely, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most humble servant,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to inclose to you a resolve of 
the Council of War, of this date, in consequence of a 
letter from the Committee of Congress, of the 12th instant, inclosing yours of the 11th, wherein the Committee most earnestly conjure us to send forward the 
troops of this State, without delay. The Council being 
apprehensive that the measure taken by the aforesaid 
resolve, might interfere with your Excellency's orders, 
and anxious to furnish you the most speedy reenforcement of this State's quota, have requested me 
to write your Excellency on this subject that your 
pleasure thereon might be known. 
</p><p>
The General Assembly have ordered six hundred 
and ten men to be raised, to complete this State's 
quota, and, for that purpose, have iroportioned them 
to the several towns, to be raised and rendezvous at 
this place by the first day of July. Some are already raised, and every exertion of Government will 
be made to complete this number, as well as to furnish the supplies required by the Committee. Your 
Excellency may be assured this State will make every 
exertion in their power to answer the expectations 
of the public. I am, with the utmost esteem,

</p><p>
I wrote your Excellency this morning ; since which I have acquired more explicit knowledge of the enemy's situation in Bergen woods. They certainly ma}' 
be expelled the country; perhaps they may be made 
prisoners. It would give peace to the inhabitants for 
twenty miles around, and very much assist agriculture. Scarce a night passes but ten or twelve horses 
are stolen. Another good consequence would result 
from this expedition ; we might collect two or three 
hundred bushels of forage. Our horses are in great 
want. I have fifty infantry now with me ; one hundred more will be necessary. If your Excellency approves of the attempt, I wish to attempt it to-morrow 
night; therefore the necessary reenforcement ought 
to arrive at Paramus Meeting-IIouse by ten o'clock 
in the morning. I shall wait here for your Excellency's answer. 
</p><p>
Yours most respectfully, 
</p><p>
Henry Lee, Jr. 
</p><p>
N. B. If they cannot reach Paramus by ten, we 
must postpone till the next night. In this case, I 
wish them to halt to-morrow (till they hear from me) 
at My. Fell's.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received, from the Committee of Congress, 
at head-quarters, three letters calling for aids of men 
and provisions. I beg leave to refer you to my letter to them, of this date, on those subjects. I thought 
it necessary, however, to suggest to you the preparing an arrangement of officers for the men; for, 
though they are to supply our battalions, yet, as our 
whole Line Officers, almost, are in captivity, I suppose 
some temporary provision must be made. We cheerfully transfer to you every power which the Executive might exercise on this occasion. As it is possible 
you may cast your eye on the unemployed officers 
now within the State, I write to General Muhlenberg 
to send you a return of them. I think the men will 
be rendezvoused within the present month. The bill, 
indeed, for raising them is not actually passed, but 
it is in its last stage, and no opposition to any essential parts of it. I will take care to notify you of 
its passage. 
</p><p>
I have, with great pain, perceived your situation; 
and the more so, as being situated between two fires. 
A division of sentiment has arisen, both in Congress 
and here, as to where the resources of this country 
should be sent. The removal of General Clinton to 
the northward must, of course, have great influence 
on the determination of this question ; and I have n 
doubt hut considerable aids may be drawn hence for 
your army, unless a larger one should be embodied 
in the south, than the force of the enemy there seems 
to call for. I have the honor to be, with every sentiment of respect and esteem, 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I heretofore informed you that the several matters, 
recommended by your Excellency and the Committee 
of Cooperation, as well as those recommended by Congress, were laid before the General Assembly ; and, 
since they adjourned, I wrote to your Excellency 
how far they had complied with the several requisitions. But I find, by your letter of the oOtli ultimo, 
I have not been sufficiently explicit with respect to 
filling up the State regiment, to the number of five 
hundred and four, rank and file. I am sorry to inform you that the Legislature have no otherwise 
complied therewith, than by appointing persons within the State to the recruiting service, owing, as I 
am informed by some of the members, to the regiment's being to the southward. 
</p><p>
I have appointed the officers, and issued orders for 
assembling the regiments, directed to be raised from 
the militia of tMs State, and am in expectation that 
they will be at the place of rendezvous by the time 
assigned in your letter of the oOth ultimo. However, 
I am of opinion that the great bounties given for 
men to fill this, will effectually prevent our recruiting 
in future the State regiment, which, I am persuaded, 
is of much more importance. 
</p><p>
You will find, by the act for furnishing supplies of 
provisions, forage, &c., that the General Assembly 
have invested me with certain powers, for the more 
speedy obtaining the same, which powers, your Excellency may be assured, I shall dgorously and 
steadily exert for the good of the service. I am. Sir, 
with every sentiment of esteem and respect, 
Your Excellency's most obedient humble servant,

FROM PRESIDENT REED. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city origin'>Philadelphia</a>, <a rel='day origin' value='15'>15</a> <a rel="month origin" value="7">July</a>,  <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>, 
</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I must acknowledge and thank you most cordially 
for your truly friendly and valuable letter of the 4th 
instant. I consider it as an inestimable mark of 
that esteem, of which, with a kind allowance for human frailty, I trust I am not altogether unworthy, 
and which I shall be solicitous to improve and preserve, as adding dignity and value to my life. 
</p><p>
I am sensible of the delicacy of my station, and 
that, whether I go forward or stand still, I run infinite hazard. However, personal considerations are 
secondary; I am willing to run any personal risk, if 
the measure bids fair to serve the public interests. 
</p><p>
But there are political impossibilities, as insurmountable, almost, as physical or moral, and which prescribe 
limits to power and influence equally impassable. 
The Turk, as despotic as he is, cannot lay a new tax 
upon his subjects ; nor can the King of France, arbitrary as he is, violate the rank of his army. The 
powers, therefore, supposed to be vested in me, however extensive, must, I take it, to be used with success, have a constant respect and attention to the 
feeling and general approbation of the people. I say 
supposed, because they are not vested in me singly, 
but in the Council, which is composed of five persons, some of whom have just pretensions, from their 
abilities, to very respectable characters. However they 
may be influenced by reason or argument, I neither 
wish, nor do possess, that influence which gains the 
opinion, without convincing the judgment. Their concurrence I must have in every case, and then the 
powers must be exercised under the restrictions I 
have mentioned. 
</p><p>
I entirely agree with you, my dear Sir, that, in 
general, the best way to preserve the confidence of 
the people, is to promote their true interest; but 
then a question arises, whether they ought not to see 
their interest, and the case to be such, as they will be 
disposed to see it, when proper evidence appears. If 
a General declines battle because his interest is to delay or retreat, he may venture, and ought to get over 
the false shame of appearing to decline action; for he 
is certain that time will do him justice, and there is 
no permanent rooted passion of the mind to combat 
his prospects. But, where property is to be invaded, 
force used, life, perhaps, endangered in the struggle 
(for we have had oflicers killed in execution of the 
clearest law), I conceive common prudence suggests, 
not merely a decisive, but also a cautious line. For 
I have found, by experience, that where you touch 
the property, be it of Whig or Tory, arguments, resulting from public good or public necessity, have 
very little weight. In the present instance, the demands for supplies are of such magnitude that the 
Whigs, both real and professional, must bear great 
part. There are but two modes of procuring them, 
persuasion and force ; the former must be accompanied with money, which we have not; for such has 
been the waste of public confidence, that every dollar we can furnish is anticipated, by the calls of Congress, long before it reaches our treasury. Force, 
then, must be used upon so great a proportion, that 
it may be said to be nearly all. But from whence 
is this force to come ? It must be the force of the 
country against the country. Experience enables me 
to say, that it is difficult to turn the force of the 
country against the Tories; for, in themselves, they 
are considerable in point of numbers and weight ; but 
the support they receive from degenerate Whigs, for 
the sake of discrediting the government, enables them, 
if not wholly to defeat, to weaken the best measures 
for the public welfare, lest their enemies should get 
some reputation. I could give you some surprising 
instances of this, if it was necessary, and that from 
men who figure highly as Whigs in profession. 
</p><p>
One mode they have taken is, to depreciate and 
discredit the State money, wliich they know is one 
of the principal means of enabling us to procure the 
supplies. It is an undoubted fact, that, after acknowledging its credit, and agreeing, under their hands, 
to take it in all payments, it is frequently refused 
but for goods ; and then they lay an additional price, 
though they have solemnly agreed to receive it as gold and silver. By arts and practices of this kind ; 
by thwarting every measure of government; refusing 
even communication with it; setting up schemes of 
individuals ; drawing off both the articles and the 
means of procuring them, â€” they not only mean to 
raise some reputation themselves (to which I have no 
objection), but the principal view is, to discredit us 
for not doing what they have prevented, and drive 
us to use violent methods, which, in addition to the 
heavy taxes, will disgust the people, and induce them 
to seek relief in a change of counsels. 
</p><p>
A general combination seems to be entered into 
among them, to exaggerate the resources and supplies of this State far beyond their real bounds ; and 
what I consider as the most unhappy is, that it is so 
agreeable that every ear catches the impression with 
greediness; and even minds that we cannot suppose 
interested in our disputes, receive the impression, and 
act under its influence. My situation, and acquaintance with the State, gives me a good opportunity to 
know, and I have taken care to inform myself x\fter making such a sacrifice of my own time and prospects, to the apparent ruin of my family, I cannot 
be suspected of sparing others unnecessarily. I can, 
therefore, with great truth declare, that the State does 
not possess those supplies which some give out; and 
it is obvious from the state of things, which cannot 
lie. In the first place, there are great numbers who 
will not cultivate or improve their lands as formerly, 
but only raise what is barely necessary for their own 
support, and, lately, to pay the taxes. All that surplus, which formed a great exportation, is not produced. In the second place, we have four entire counties, formerly productive of taxes and exports, which 
now draw their support from the interior country, and 
must have constant advances of money, aid of men, 
&c., to an amount far beyond what strangers or distant observers can suppose. In the third place, the 
enormous debts of the Quarter-master's and Commissary's departments, and the depreciation of the money, 
have poisoned all the springs of industry. Finding, 
by experience, that they receive no value, not even a 
nominal one ; well knowing, that while a war is to 
be carried on, their property, if found, must go, they 
not only have not the usual spur to acquire it, but 
they are laid under the strongest temptations to have 
as little as may be subject to this risk. A most infallible proof of what I advance is, that even for specie, so sought and coveted, articles cannot be procured, even of country produce, but at thirty-three and 
a third advance on former prices. This, surely, is no 
argument of plenty. 
</p><p>
Our trade is supposed, by many, to be a source 
of wealth and strength ; but every day's experience 
shows the fallacy of this reasoning. A supply of a 
few necessary articles is indispensable, and for which 
the luxury of the country might be sent out. But 
what are our importations? Sugar, wines, spirits, and 
gewgaws of every kind, only calculated to gratify 
pride, intemperance and folly ; and for these the men 
and provisions of the country are sent forth in quantities and numbers that would give us great relief, 
if applied to the service of the country. When the 
enemy made their incursion into New Jersey, and the 
most alarming consequences were apprehended, we 
laid an embargo, which lasted only eight days; 
but it is difficult to describe the clamor this created, 
though, in the judgment of the most considerate, a 
measure important to the safety of the city itself 
The merchants sent a deputation to know our reasons, and to expostulate with us on This invasion of 
their property, and restraint of their business. In 
short, there is no measure we pursue, which touches 
interest or pride, but a powerful opposition is immediately made ; and it has become such a fashion to 
find fault with the State of Pennsylvania, that most 
of our young politicians set out with it as their first 
and capital lesson. 
</p><p>
Being influenced very much by your Excellency's 
opinion last winter, that we could not rely upon voluntary enlistment, but must have recourse to drafts 
to answer the demands of the campaign, I pressed 
the measure last March with all my might, but without success. Such are the circumstances, and such 
the disposition of the people, that the Assembly 
would not venture to pass the bill ; nor, if they had, 
do I now think it would have been carried into execution; for no measure has been more generally reprobated. The cry is for voluntary enlistments; and 
the most confident assertions are made, that a sufficient number of men would have been procured, and 
on better terms. And now, such is the temper of 
the counties, that they absolutely refuse to march the 
drafts to the army, alleging the necessity of defending themselves and friends against the savages. The 
whole amount of these drafts would be twelve hundred, of which we suppose about one thousand might 
be thrown into the line; that we could then make 
some addition of voluntary recruits, and pick up some 
deserters, so as to fill up the deficiency stated last 
winter, namely, fourteen hundred and twenty-five men. 
</p><p>
Except militia, I dare not flatter myself with any 
considerable additions. And when it is considered 
what heavy losses this State had in troops in <a href='/results.php?year=1770'>1770</a> ; 
the great proportion of our people who will not bear arms under any pretext ; the force to be kept on the 
frontiers; the drain which trade and privateers will 
unavoidably make ; and the number which have been 
enlisted during the war, and consequently kept constantly in the field, subject to all the casualties of 
disease, desertion, &c., â€” I cannot help thinking we 
are entitled to some degree of credit for what we 
have done, as well as what we may do. I have 
never sought after comparisons with other States, but 
have ever understood, that (Maryland excepted) this 
State always had a greater proportion of troops in 
the field than any State, unless we reckoned the illselected drafts that came in from some Eastern States, 
a proportion of which would not pass muster, and the 
rest went home as soon as they became soldiers. As 
to men enlisted for the war, this State has certainly 
ever had a great proportion, and would have retained 
a much greater, if the Land-Office in Virginia had 
not afforded both an asylum and a temptation for desertion. We now have very sufficient evidence, that 
great numbers of the deserters are at Kentucky, and 
its vicinities, where they are free from taxes, militia 
duties, and other burdens, and enjoy a sort of savage 
freedom, which is highly pleasing to some minds. 
</p><p>
With respect to militia, I hope we shall be able to 
produce the number required without much difficulty, 
now the harvest is got in; but a call three weeks 
sooner would have been very distressing, and, I fear, 
impracticable, from the great scarcity of laborers in 
the country ; that class of people being distressed by 
the war. I cannot say that I am very sanguine in 
my expectations of their being very useful, as they 
have not, in many instances, had that practice and 
familiarity with danger, which many other States have 
had. But the principal reason is, that the gentlemen 
having generally withdrawn themselves entirely, or 
into separate corps, these officers are not such as I 
could wish, though there are some, of whom we expect respectable service. 
</p><p>
We have been using every exertion to procure a 
number of teams, as well voluntarily as by impress, 
and they are coming in daily ; but the Quarter-master's department is so deranged, that it is attended 
with considerable difficulty. I have frequently been 
obliged to interest myself to get them forage and 
provisions, as they are not officially known to the 
Continental officers. The Wagon-masters universally 
represent that they find their situation insupportably 
distressing ; that the number of teams in the country 
has decreased one third ; that, of these, from former 
service unpaid, the inadequate price, and real change 
of circumstances, a part can only be got, the rest 
hiding their horses and grain, and even destroying 
their wagons, that they may not be compelled to go. 
</p><p>
To impress requires a force to support it, and, from 
the nature of the service, a number of people to collect and keep the impressed articles. Most of the 
teams yet obtained are pressed. I hope we shall be 
able to make up the number of two hundred and fifty, and then we shall immediately set about the 
collection of horses, wherein, I presume, there will be 
less difficulty, because we know they are in the 
country, and cannot be concealed with the same 
ease as grain, wagons, &c. We have quartered the 
whole number of wagons and horses on the counties, 
as well as the Commissariat articles, but the expectation of fully answering such a demand, amounting to one half and more (namely, one hundred and 
six millions of dollars) than all the money ever 
issued by Congress, cannot, I fear, be answered. I have not met with one person, in or ont of Congress, 
belonging or not belonging to the State, who does 
not pronounce the requisition, in its full extent, impracticable. I hope we shall get one thousand horses 
at least, and that we shall be able to answer the requisition of February. If we can do more, we shall ; 
for, as I observed before, we have actually demanded 
the whole, have furnished all the Commissioners with 
blanks of various kinds of returns, and directed them 
to send us a weekly account of their progress. Our 
first instructions were for monthly returns ; but they 
were not complied with, owing, as we suppose, to a 
want of skill in making the returns, and to a want 
of time to ascertain what they could do. I do not 
know how it is conducted in other States, but at 
least three parts of my time and labor are employed 
in doing this duty of Quarter-master and Commissary, 
to the great neglect of my other duties. I have 
never, in any part of my life, gone through half the 
fatigue of business that I have done for these two 
months past; and it is very discouraging, that, with so 
unremitted attention to the public service, I find I am 
to be the subject of complaint. I do acknowledge, my 
dear Sir, that my health and spirits daily sink under 
it, and that I find I am every week less capable of 
business. 
</p><p>
While I see hundreds around me securing a comfortable competence for themselves and families, enjoying occasional amusements, and even members of 
Congress themselves, and their officers, partaking of 
the satisfaction of cheerful society, I am sacrificing 
my youth, my profession, my whole time, and denying myself all sorts of relaxation, that I may answer, 
at least in part, the expectations formed at this crisis. My conscience, and the knowledge those have 
who see my course of life, must acquit me of any 
neglect ; and if, after all this, I do not stand justified 
in the opinion of my country and friends, I think I 
have reason to conclude myself an unhappy and an injured character. I have seen some letters from camp, 
and one from Mr. Tilghman, that have hurt me a 
good deal, considering his connection with the State, 
and the station he holds in your family. In this letter, not wrote to a person of the most prudence or 
consideration, he pronounces our exertions scandalous. 
This letter is, doubtless, shown about town. 
</p><p>
You observe, my dear Sir, that our affairs are not 
in the train they ought to be. I am not sensible of 
any material defect, but this I can truly say, that 
they are in as good a train as our abilities and the 
circumstances of things will admit. This State (setting aside the opposition to the Government) is composed of very heterogeneous particles. It has been 
settled by people from all countries, and a great portion of them very incapable to judge of the nature 
and extent of the present controversy, which arising 
from apprehension more than a reality of oppression, 
now that they feel the heavy taxes and the burdens 
which are necessarily laid, they begin to reason from 
their feelings and grow extremely uneasy. They cannot anticipate the future happiness of their country 
in being exempt from foreign laws and jurisdiction, 
when they find they must work harder and pay 
more than they did. Comparisons of former taxe.s, 
burdens, &c., are now frequent; and it is my firm 
opinion, sanctioned by that of many gentlemen of 
more knowledge and experience, that the people of 
this State would, if too heavily pressed, more readily 
renew their connection with Great Britain, than any 
State now in the Union. Even the arguments and influence of Tories have great weight upon Whigs, 
when under the pressure of heavy taxes and burdens. 
</p><p>
They are tohi, you are not well governed, and 
you will find (as you have found) that the yoke of 
Great Britain is easy and her burden light, compared with what you now endure. My best friends 
seem to have adopted a sentiment, which surprises me, 
and use arguments of this nature ; â€” " your enemies 
will serve the public effectually and gain credit, you 
must therefore exert yourself" My dear Sir, I wish 
every man to have credit and success, if he does 
serve the public, whether he is my friend or foe; and 
if he does it effectually, I am content he should have 
reputation. Let him make what use he pleases of it 
to my prejudice, I am conscious of having no object 
to stand in competition with the freedom of my country. This was my first motive for going into public 
service ; it is still the governing principle of my life. 
Those, therefore, who really contribute to effect it, 
gratify me in the most essential point. But it does 
not appear to me that all the modes and measures 
taken lead to that point. The opposition in this 
State has no strength or consequence out of the 
city, that they acknowledge. Their separate schemes, 
therefore, serve only to embarrass ; whereas, did they, 
as they ought, join with the Government, there is 
no point, scarcely, within physical possibility, we 
could not attain. They cannot have popularity, because the thirst of gain continually leads them into 
some scheme opposed to the public interests, which 
is discovered. A late instance has occurred in addition to twenty others. 
</p><p>
The inhabitants of Bermuda have, to discourage 
privateering, associated to buy no prize goods. The 
consequence of which was, that those kinds of goods 
might be had next to nothing ; on which the principal merchants in this city, Messrs. Morris, Nesbitt & 
Company, send a person, or at least employ one, who 
had been proscribed, and who is since under security 
for his good behaviour. He goes to that Island without permission, and then, in company, they purchase 
those prize goods the inhabitants of the Island had associated, out of friendship to us, not to purchase, and 
import them under cover of British papers. We have 
seized the goods, and, upon inquiry, all these facts 
turn out in proof We have never been able to get 
the least assistance from them to prevent taking deserters on board their ships ; whereas a virtuous resolution to employ no Captain who received them, would 
do more good than all the laws, proclamations, and 
searches, that could ever be made. 
</p><p>
But I find myself insensibly drawn to a tedious 
length of letter, which my anxiety to remove any 
unfavorable impressions has hurried me into. I will, 
therefore, trespass but little longer. From what I 
have said, I hope you will not suspect my relaxing 
in the public service, while I have strength of body 
or mind. I must entreat you to do me the justice 
to believe I shall strain the cords as tight as they 
will bear. Those of Government are never tied again, 
if once broken; and governing too much is the way 
not to govern at alL I will use every species of 
influence, argument, and authority I possess, to promote the views of the public at this juncture. I 
have done it for months past, as Congress are very 
sensible, from the letters laid before them, in consequence of a very unkind one from their Committee. 
Every motive that can interest or impel the heart of 
man, I must have on this occasion; and why should 
it be supposed that they will not have due operation? I am not so stupid as not to comprehend the 
force and necessity of corresponding fully with the 
exertions of our ally, nor so insensible of national 
reproach as not to feel for the honor of the country, 
if it should fail in a capital degree in its engagements. No one can more sincerely wish an end to 
the war than I do, or be more sensible that great 
exertions, at this period, may bring about this happy 
issue. Nor am I capable of mean and selfish pain, 
at seeing those who are my enemies more successful 
in serving the public than myself, if it should be so. 
If I know myself, my errors are of the head and 
temper, not of the heart. I rely, therefore, dear Sir, 
much on your friendship and candid construction, and 
shall take it as the greatest favor, if, in the same 
free and friendly manner you have now done, you 
will tell me what is amiss, and how I may rectify it. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Reed and myself are exceedingly gratified 
with the kind and obliging notice you have taken 
of this small proof of our regard, in giving your 
name to our new-born son, and shall be happy, in 
every occasion, to give more extensive and essential 
proofs. And as to your good lady, her company 
gave us so sincere a pleasure, that we could not but 
regret that it was so short. We hope she got safe 
home, as we have not heard from her since we left 
her, a few miles on the way. 
</p><p>
I am persuaded you are so busy that I hope you 
will not think of answering this long, tedious letter, 
which has been wrote by snatches, as I could steal 
a few minutes at one time or another. I shall therefore now conclude, with mentioning that next week 
will take forward two thousand excellent shirts and 
as many overalls, for the State troops, with a large 
supply of refreshments of other kinds; that we have 
sent off a person to Europe, some time since, to 
lay in a good supply of all kinds of clothing for 
officers and six thousand men, so that we need not 
depend on uncertain and precarious supplies. Mrs. 
Reed received your kind favor a few days ago, and 
is exerting herself to comply with your direction ; 
but there is, at present, a very great difficulty in 
procuring the articles, even for money, I am, with 
the greatest respect and most sincere regard, dear 
Sir, your obliged and

Most affectionate, humble servant,

Sir, 
I beg leave to trouble your Excellency on a subject, in which I request your aid. I am sorry to 
inform you, that, contrary to my expectations, I have 
not found my command in the Jersey brigade, for 
some time past, so agreeable as I could wish. I 
would remind your Excellency, that nothing but the 
most pure and disinterested principles induced me to 
enter the service, and, I trust, I have so far your 
good opinion that no endeavours, to the best of my 
abilities, have been wanting to forward the interest 
of my country, which has been my constant study 
since the first commencement of this war. Thus circumstanced, and to be uniform in my good wishes to 
a country I love, I would much rather choose to 
withdraw from a service I am fond of, than to remain where my services could not be made agreeable to my wishes. I therefore request that my resignation may be accepted. 
At The same time, I presume, it would not be improper to ask of Congress all further immunities and 
rewards for my services that other officers of my 
rank may to this time be entitled to. I wish your 
Excellency to obtain as speedy an answer from Congress on this subject as possible, and at the same 
time to assure that honorable body, that my most 
sanguine wishes and services shall ever await both 
them and my country; which shall be gratefully acknowledged by, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Yesterday arrived the frigate Alliance, forty days 
from L' Orient. She has on board two thousand stand 
of arms, a number of cannon, and a quantity of powder, for the United States. Your Excellency will 
give such orders concerning them as you think proper ; but, with respect to the arms, if there be not 
an absolute necessity for all of them, the Council 
would be glad you would allow one thousand of them, 
with bayonets, to be retained by this State, in lieu of the like number ue have lately furnished you 
with, as we have none in our magazines. 
</p><p>
Doctor Lee came passenger in the Alliance. He 
tells me the ships and troops that were intended to 
reenforce the French armament at Newport, remained 
at Brest when the last post came from thence, just 
before he sailed ; and there were then cruising thirtytwo sail of British capital ships before that harbour, 
where were only twelve sail of the line of French 
ships ; but that there were at Cadiz thirty-six sail, 
French and Spanish, which it was supposed would 
proceed to Brest to remove the British and join the 
French ships there. He was surprised to hear that 
Admiral Graves was in this part of America, as they 
apprehended, in France, he had gone with his squadron in another direction. 
</p><p>
The Doctor says a great mob, of fifty or sixty 
thousand men, had appeared in London, and were 
masters of it three or four days, but had no valuable political object in view. They committed many 
robberies, destroyed many houses, particularly Lord 
Mansfield's, and pulled down every jail in London. 
They were finally quelled by the guards and militia, 
who killed three or four hundred of them. The Ministry had intercepted several letters from Lord George 
Gordon, calculated to excite disturbances in Scotland, 
in consequence of which he had been committed to 
the Tower. 
</p><p>
The Russians and Dutch had agreed to insist, that 
none of their ships should be searched by British 
cruisers, and that they would be carriers for any nation whatsoever, which should think proper to employ 
them. There is no other intelligence of importance. 
</p><p>
I have obtained, from a person who came from 
Halifiix about a month ago, a sketch of the fortifications tliere, which I inclose for your further information. It would give us great satisfaction, if your Excellency could inform us there is any probability of 
the allied forces being able to attempt any thing 
â– with effect this campaign. I have the honor to be, 
with the sincerest esteem, Sir, 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
James Bowdoin.

PETITION FROM BEZA WOODWARD AND OTHERS. 
</p><p>
August <a rel='day origin' value='30'>30</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1780' rel="origin">1780</a>. 
</p><p>
To his Excellency George Washington Commander-inchief of the forces of the United States in North 
America, humbly showeth 
</p><p>
The petition of the principal inhabitants on Connecticut River, on both sides, and northward of Charlestown, met in Convention, at Dresden, on the New 
Hampshire Grants, August 30th, A. D. <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>; â€” 
</p><p>
That the union of Canada with the United States 
is, in our opinion, of the greatest importance to them, 
for the following reasons, namely; â€” 
</p><p>
There is but one seaport in that country which we 
shall ever have need to defend; yet good water-carriage for near two thousand miles, stretching itself, in 
a circular manner, round the thirteen United States, 
through an excellent country of land, great part of 
which is inhabited by savages, whose fur and skin 
trade produces to our enemies an annual profit which 
is immense. 
</p><p>
The annual produce of wheat in that country, for 
exportation, is very great, by which the British armies in America receive essential advantage. The 
capture of that country will be a leading step towards securing to the United States the profits of the 
fish, oil, &c., procured at and near the Gulf of St. 
Lawrence, which would be a greatly beneficial acquisition. While they hold possession of Canada, our frontiers must be very extensive, and the savages at their 
command; and, we had almost said, the enemy destroy and take yearly from the frontiers bordering on 
Canada as much in value as the cost of reducing 
and holding that country. We are sure the defence of our frontiers costs more. The securing tliat country in our interest will be the only effectual means 
to enable us to secure those of Ohio and Mississippi, 
both on account of obtaining in that way the interest 
of the savages in our favor, and as the conveyance 
for the enemy (while they hold possession of Canada) 
of men, ammunition, and provisions to those parts, is 
not only as easy, but more expeditious and safe, than 
by the Gulf of Mexico ; and, in our opinion, those 
countries cannot otherwise be effectually secured. 
</p><p>
By obtaining Canada, we add to our force thirty 
thousand fighting men, and destroy the efficacy of 
the bill passed in the British Parliament, in the year 
<a href='/results.php?year=1774'>1774</a>, for extending the Province of <a href='/results.php?city=quebec' rel='city'>Quebec</a>, which 
includes the Province of Maine, and great part of 
New Hampshire, these Grants, &c. ; the establishment 
of which is, without doubt, the main olyect of the 
enemy in taking and holding possessions at Penobscot, and within the extent of which the United States 
have not a single fortress to cover their claim in opposition to that of the British. In short, that bill is 
so extensive, that, should it be established, the United 
States would have little or nothing left worth contending for; and we see not how it can be effectually 
destroyed but by an union of Canada with them. The 
body of inhabitants in that country are desirous of 
such union; and unless it can be brought about speedily, by sending a force into Canada, they will be under necessity to take an active part against us, which 
they have hitherto avoided. 
</p><p>
The whole force of Britain now in arms in Canada, 
at all their posts, from <a href='/results.php?city=quebec' rel='city'>Quebec</a> to Detroit, including 
one thousand five hundred Tories and Indians (who 
are continually roving and destroying our frontiers), 
does not exceed five thousand men. One thousand 
are stationed in The district of <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'><a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a></a>, and six hundred of the rovers have that district for their headquarters. The communication from the settlements 
on this river to St. Charles, on Chamhlee River, is easy; the road already opened more than half the 
way; the rest may be opened at very little expense, 
and the whole will be very good ; the distance about 
one hundred miles. A good Commander, with a few 
Continental troops, in addition to such volunteers as 
may be raised on these Grants and in The New England States, with a suitable quantity of arms and 
ammunition to furnish those Canadians who are now 
eager for such an expedition, and will at once join 
us on the arrival of an army there, will easily take 
possession of and keep the district of <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'><a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a></a> ; and, 
that being secured, the country above, even to and 
beyond the western Lakes, must soon submit to the 
United States. 
</p><p>
Your petitioners are confident that fifteen hundred 
men from these Grants will turn out, if called upon, 
to assist in taking possession of that country. They 
can and will cheerfully furnish five hundred horses, 
one hundred teams, and ten thousand bushels of 
wheat, and more if necessary ; also such other grain 
as may be wanted, on the credit of the Continent, 
from the district of country betwixt the heights on 
the two sides of Connecticut River, and north of the 
Massachusetts Bay, the inhabitants of which (more 
than five thousand families) are now chiefly obliged 
to hold the sword in one hand and tools for husbandry in the other, and probably must continue so 
to do till that country is reduced, unless we have a 
large Continental force continually supported here, to 
defend us from their ravages, as our frontier is very 
extensive. 
</p><p>
We therefore humbly pray, that your Excellency 
will be pleased to recommend to Congress, that, by 
the middle of September next, or as soon as possible, 
a party, under a suitable Commander, be sent on the 
said enterprise, and a recommendation to the people 
in this country and the New England States for 
volunteers to join their force in the expedition ; and 
that ve make ready necessary provisions, which we 
shall cheerfully comply with, to the utmost of our 
power. 
</p><p>
And, as in duty bound, shall ever pray. 
Per order of the Convention, 
</p><p>
Beza Woodward, Clerh.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
A letter from your Excellency to Messrs. Meredith 
and Barclay, at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, has been by those gentlemen handed to us, as best able to give the necessar}'' 
information respecting some of those subjects of inquiry on wMch it turns. We perceive from it, that 
considerable dependence is placed upon the Pennsylvania Bank for keeping the army supplied with provisions ; but how far this dependence should justly 
go, your Excellency will be best able to judge when 
we shall have laid before you a state of its affiiirs. 
</p><p>
The groundwork was a deposit of money arising 
from subscription. This subscription is about eleven 
hundred thousand pounds, Continental currency, of 
which we are now in the receipt of two payments, 
of ten per cent. each. But what we principally rested on, was that convenience the trading people would 
find in lodging their money in the Bank, taking our 
notes payable on demand, by which, as the notes 
might be expected to have a free and continued circulation, we should have the command of a vast fund 
for our purchases. From these two sources of supply 
we have, as yet, drawn but about four hundred thousand pounds, with a well-grounded confidence, however, that the production of the latter will be proportionably greater the longer it remains open. Part 
of this amount, agreeably to the prudential rules of 
similar institutions, it was necessary to reserve in 
our hands ; with the remainder we should haAe proceeded in the purchases of flour, had any been at 
market (which, since the harvest, has not been the 
case), but for the attention we thought ourselves 
obliged to show to the requisition for tents from the 
Committee of Congress with the army, who informed 
us they were of still more indispensable necessity 
than flour. Of these, Mr. Francis, the factor of the 
Bank, has purchased materials for five or six hundred, 
which he has directed to be made up, and will forward to the army. We shall, however, in consequence 
of your Excellency's letter, desist from further purchases in this article, and resume our original design, as flour can be obtained ; but as to the daily or 
weekly quantities, we shall be able to supply, we 
can have no certain answer. 
</p><p>
On the whole our sentiments are, that it will be 
proper to consider the Bank rather as coming in aid 
of the ordinary means of supply, than as being in 
itself equal to any great effect without them; and 
that it will not, by any means, supersede the necessity of any one of them. But, though we cannot 
venture to say what degree of support this establishment may receive from the public, we can assure 
your Excellency, that there is the best disposition in 
all those who have the conduct of it, to extend its 
means, and make it as extensively useful as possible. 
</p><p>
We are, &c., &c..

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
As I know the anxieties you must have felt since 
the late misfortune to the south, and our later accounts have not been quite so unfavorable as the 
first, I take the liberty of inclosing you a state of 
this unlucky affair, extracted from letters from General Gates, General Stevens, and Governor Nash, and 
taken, as to some circumstances, from an officer who 
was in the action. 
</p><p>
Another army is collecting. This amounted, on 
the 23d ultimo, to between four and five thousand 
men, consisting of about five hundred Maryland regulars, a few of Harrison's artillery, and Porterfield's 
corps, Armand's legion, such of the fugitive militia as 
had been reclaimed, and about three thousand North 
Carolina militia, newly embodied. We are told they 
will increase these to eight thousand. Our new recruits will rendezvous in this State between the 10th 
and 25th instant. We are calling out two thousand 
militia, who I think, however, will not be got to Hillsborough till the 25th of October. About three hundred and fifty regulars marched from Chesterfield a week ago. Fifty march to-morrow, and there will be 
one hundred or one hundred and fifty more from that 
post, when they can be cleared of the hospital. This 
is as good a view as I can give you of the force we 
are endeavouring to collect. But they are unarmed. 
Almost the whole small arms seem to have been lost 
in the late rout. There are here, on their way southward, three thousand stand of arms, sent by Congress, 
and we have a few still remaining in our magazine. 
I have written pressingly, as the subject well deserves, to Congress, to send us, immediately, supplies, 
and to think of forming a magazine here, that, in 
case of another disaster, we may not be left without 
all means of opposition. 
</p><p>
I inclosed to your Excellency, some time ago, a resolution of Assembly, instructing us to send a quantity of tobacco to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> for the relief of our officers there, and asking the favor of you to obtain 
permission. Having received no answer, I fear my 
letter or your answer has miscarried. I therefore now 
take the liberty of repeating my ajDplication to you. 
I have the honor to be, with the most profound respect and esteem, &c., &c.

Dear General,

In your favor of the 10th instant, you desired to 
know, through what channel I received ISIr. Anderson's letter. It was by a flag that came to our lines, 
and forwarded to me by Lieutenant-Colonel Jameson. 
It came to me sealed. The person, so often mentioned, has returned from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, where he was detained ten days before he could obtain permission to 
return. He was not suffered to leave his quarters, unless escorted by some person appointed by the Commanding Officer for that purpose; by which means 
he had no opportunity of gaining any intelligence of 
consequence. He will be at your quarters within a 
few days. His name is Elijah Hunter. General Parsons had not arrived at North Castle yesterday at 
twelve o'clock. I am to inform you that I have been 
in arrest two or three days, on a complaint exhibited 
to head-quarters by a villain by the name of Darius 
Stoddard, for defrauding the public, together with 
sundry other charges.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the pleasure of receiving your favor of the 
9th instant, by Doctor Craik, two days ago. There 
is a new arrangement for the Medical department, 
now before Congress, and nearly completed, by which 
there will be a very great reduction of officers. By 
the new system, there will be fifteen principal officers to be elected by Congress, which, I apprehend, 
will be but too much influenced by that spirit which 
has given a well-grounded alarm to the gentlemen 
concerned. Evidently to evince how far such a disposition has already operated, the new Quartermaster-General is allowed to hold his commission at the 
Board of War, in direct violation of a law of Congress, and which has been uniformly practised upon, 
except in a few instances of no importance. But to suffer a man to hold two commissions, of the first 
consequence under the United States, savors so strongly of an outrageous partiality, that I shall he surprised at nothing that may hereafter happen. 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure of being acquainted with most of the gentlemen mentioned by your Excellency, and 
know their worth, and no endeavours shall he wanting, on my part, to promote their reestablishment ; 
hut I fear it will not he in my power to do them 
much service, for I find there is a decided party 
formed against the Committee that were at camp, 
which I have reason seriously to dread will be productive of no good to our public affairs. I owe much 
to the public, but still I owe something to myself. 
I can never tamely suffer a set of miscreants to triumph over me with impunit} Regardless of our 
characters, as members of their own body, I find we 
are to be considered as Quarter-masters, &c., and liable to equal insults, without the least pretensions to 
call such conduct in question. But I can assure 
them they will find me of a temper by no means 
calculated to answer their newfimgled dogmas. 
</p><p>
Although I had heard a good deal, and seen something, of the rancor of these demagogues, yet I never 
imagined it had risen to that height I was made to 
feel it had done, on my resuming my seat in Congress. I took the first opportunity of going very 
largely into the state of our afiairs, in order to found 
some propositions which I made ; but, without allowing them to be worthy of a commitment, much less 
of their consideration, they were, in the lump, rejected. However, I have this consolation, to reflect they 
were approved by those, whose disinterestedness and 
judgment I have the best opinion of Such an insult I never saw offered to any member of Congress before. It shows such a determined and premeditated 
prejudice, as must inevitably lay me under the necessity of doing what I would wish most earnestly to avoid. 
</p><p>
I beg your pardon, Sir, for detaining you so long 
on a subject relative to myself. But as my plan, 
above mentioned, was for the establishment of a permanent army and the means of supporting the war, 
I thought it a subject you were so much interested 
in, that it would not be unacceptable to you to know 
the result of my endeavours, and how little prospect 
I have of being farther useful to this end; for, I 
suppose, any future propositions of mine will be immediately exploded, "as too strongly tinctured with 
those army princiiJles which I had imbibed whilst with 
them." I cannot but think it hard that a man, who 
wishes to be useful, should be thus unjustly precluded 
from being so. However, I know the rectitude of 
my intentions, and can, at all times, retire to my 
own bosom for my justification; and whilst that monitor supports me, I shall continue to act my part, 
regardless of every contentious spirit. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letter of the 20th ultimo has 
now been twenty-four days in the hands of a Committee. I have repeatedly called for a report from 
them; but, by what I can find, little or nothing has 
been yet done upon it. This does not at all surprise 
me ; and, I dare say, by the time the Committee and 
Congress have done with it, the time will arrive when 
the army ought to be in the field. This ruinous delay I wanted to prevent, by Congress taking up my 
propositions in the first instance ; but, by their not 
doing it, I may readily conclude it militated too 
much against the plan they have in contemplation, 
and therefore further conclude it will not be such a one as will, in its operation, be effectual. This may 
look like arrogating too much to myself; but the 
event -will prove whether I am right or not. 
I have the honor to be, &c.,

a continued proof of your attention to the public 
good; and those you particularize will not fail of being supported. 
</p><p>
We are deeply engaged on the subjects of your 
Excellency's several letters. Considerable progress is 
made in that which is the principal, the raising a 
permanent army. Congress unite in sentiment, that 
it is essential; that it is the surest and the only 
means of producing an honorable peace. To render 
it practicable and certain, is the difficulty. There is, 
in my mind, no question but that it will be submitted for your opinion before it becomes conclusive. 
</p><p>
I wish it was in my power to communicate agreeable events, to counterbalance our southern misfortunes. The weight of them daily diminishes, by a 
comparison of facts with the hasty information of the 
Commanding Officer of the detachment. The loss, 
however, of artillery and baggage, and, above all, of 
small arms, must be severely felt; and the precipitate flight of the militia expose us to insult, after 
every alleviation. Of one comfort we cannot be deprived ; our regular troops have acquired unfadingglory. 
</p><p>
I find, with great satisfaction, that the Legislature 
of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> have fallen in with the view of the 
eastern Convention, and particularly to strengthen the hands of Congress, and enable tliem to enforce their 
decisions. We can never manage the public interests 
with success, till this disposition becomes general; 
nor can any thing else, under the Divine blessing, 
be necessary to give us a decided superiority over 
our enemies. We have now obtained military knowledge in an eminent degree ; we have internal resources, and reputation abroad ; we have a great and 
respectable all} Of what, then, are we destitute, but 
vigor and confidence in government, and public spirit in individuals ? 
</p><p>
I shall be happy to be honored with a line, after 
your interview at <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>, if your leisure admits. I 
hope it will prove some relaxation from the severe 
and anxious cares, which have fallen to your share 
too long, and with too much weight. Permit me to 
add, that I am, with every sentiment of the most 
affectionate attachment, &c.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I yesterday forwarded to you a letter from Colonel 
Wood, informing you of his situation. That post has 
been, for some time past, pretty regularly supplied, 
and I hope will continue so to be for some time to 
come. A person, whose punctuality can be relied on, 
offers to contract for victualling it. If we can agree 
on terms, and the Assembly will strengthen our 
"hands sufficiently, we think to adopt that method, as 
the only one to be relied on with certainty. I have 
heard it hinted that Colonel Wood thinks of quitting 
that post. I should be exceedingly sorry, indeed, 
were he to do it. He has given, to those under his 
charge, the most perfect satisfaction, and, at the same 
time, used all the cautions which the nature of his 
charge has required. It is principally owing to his 
prudence and good temper, that the late difficulties 
have been passed over, almost without a murmur. 
Any influence which your Excellency shall think 
proper to use for retaining him in his present situation, will promote the public good, and have great 
tendency to keep up a desirable harmony with the 
officers of that corps. 
</p><p>
Our new levies are rendezvousing very generally. 
Colonel Harrison was uneasy at having none of them 
assigned to his corps of artillery, who have very 
much distinguished themselves in the late unfortunate 
action, and are reduced almost to nothing. We happened to have about one hundred drafts raised in 
the last year, and never called out and sent on duty 
by their County Lieutenants, whom we have collected 
and are collecting. We think to deliver these to 
Colonel Harrison; they are to serve eighteen months 
from the time of rendezvous. 
</p><p>
The numbers of regulars and militia, ordered from 
this State into the southern service, are about seven 
thousand. I trust we may count, that five thousand 
five hundred will actually proceed; but we have 
arms for three thousand only. If, therefore, we do 
not speedily receive a supply from Congress, we must 
countermand a proper number of these troops. Besides this supply, there should certainly be a magazine laid in here, to provide against a general loss 
as well as daily waste. When we deliver out those 
now in our magazine, we shall have sent seven thousand stand of our own into the southern service, in 
the course of this summer. We are still more destitute of clothing, tents, and wagons for our troops. 
The southern army suffers for provision, which we 
could plentifully supply were it possible to find 
means of transportation. Despairing of this, we directed very considerable quantities, collected on the 
navigable waters, to be sent northwardly by the Quarter-master; this he is now doing, slowly however. 
</p><p>
Unapprised of what may be proposed by our allies 
to be done with their fleet in the course of the ensuing winter, I would beg leave to intimate to you, 
that if it should appear eligible to them that it 
should winter in Chesapeake Bay, they may be well 
supplied with provision, taking their measures in due 
time beforehand. The waters communicating with 
that Bay furnish easy, and, in that case, safe transportation, and their money will call forth what is 
denied to ours. I am, with all possible esteem and 
respect, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
Thomas Jefferson.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
The inclosed copy of a letter from Lord Cornwallis 
to Colonel Balfour, was sent me by Governor Rutledge;'-' lest you should not have seen it, I do myself the pleasure of transmitting it, with a letter from General Harrington to General Gates, giving 
information of some late movements of the enemy. 
</p><p>
I was honored, yesterday, with your favor of the 
5th instant, on the subject of prisoners, and particularly of Lieutenant-Governor Hamilton. You are not 
unapprised of the influence of this officer with the 
Indians, his activity and embittered zeal against us. 
You also, perhaps, know how precarious is our tenure 
of the Illinois country, and how critical is the situation of the new counties on the Ohio. These circumstances determined us to retain Governor Hamilton 
and Major Hay within our power, when we delivered 
up the other prisoners. On a late representation from 
the people of Kentucky, by a person sent here from 
that country, and expressions of what they had reason to apprehend from these two prisoners, in the 
event of their liberation, we assured them they 
would not be parted with, though we were giving 
up our other prisoners. 
</p><p>
Lieutenant-Colonel Dubuysson, Aid to Baron de Kalb, lately came here on his parole, with an offer 
from Lord Rawdon, to exchange him for Hamilton. 
Colonel Towles is now here, with a like proposition 
as to himself, from General Phillips, very strongly 
urged by the General. These, and other overtures, 
do not lessen our opinion of the importance of retaining him ; and they have been, and will uniformly 
be, rejected. Should the settlement, indeed, of a cartel, become impracticable, without the consent of the 
States to submit their separate prisoners to its obligation, we will give up these two prisoners, as we 
would any thing, rather than be an obstacle to a 
general good ; but no other circumstances would, I 
believe, extract them from us. These two gentlemen, with a Lieutenant-Colonel Elligood, are the only 
separate prisoners we have retained, and the last 
only on his own request, and not because we set 
any store by him. There is, indeed, a Lieutenant Governor Rocheblawe, of Kaskaskia, who has broken 
his parole, and gone to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, whom we must 
shortly trouble your Excellency to demand for us, as 
soon as we can forward to you the proper documents. 
Since the forty prisoners sent to Winchester, as mentioned in my letter of the 9th ultimo, about one hundred and fifty more have been sent thither, some of 
them taken by us at sea, others sent on by General Gates. 
</p><p>
The exposed and weak state of our western settlements, and the dangers to which they are subject 
from the northern Indians, acting under the influence 
of the British post at Detroit, render it necessary for 
us to keep from five to eight hundred men on duty, 
for their defence. This is a great and perpetual expense. Could that post be reduced, and retained, it 
would cover all the States to the south-east of it. 
We have long meditated the attempt, under the direction of Colonel Clark ; but the expense would be 
so great, that whenever we have wished to take it 
up, this circumstance has obliged us to decline it 
Two different estimates make it amount to two millions of pounds, present money. We could furnish the 
men, provisions, and, I believe, every necessary except powder, had we the money, or could the demands from us be so far supplied from other quarters as to leave it in our power to apply such a 
sum to that purpose ; and, when once done, it would 
save annual expenditures to a great amount. When 
I speak of furnishing the men, I mean that they 
should be militia, such being the popularity of Colonel Clark, and the confidence of the western people 
in him, that he could raise the requisite number at any time. 
</p><p>
We therefore beg leave to refer this matter to 
yourself, to determine whether such an enterprise 
would not be for the general good ; and, if you 
think it would, to authorize it at the general expense. This is become the more reasonable, if, as I 
am informed, the ratification of the Confederation has 
been rested on our cession of a part of our western 
claims, a cession which (speaking my private opinion 
only) I verily believe will be agreed to, if the quantity demanded be not unreasonably great. Should 
this proposition be approved, it should be immediately made known to us, as the season is now 
coming on at which some of the preparations must 
be made. The time of execution, I think, should be 
at the breaking up of the ice in the Wabash, and 
before the Lakes open. The interval, I am told, is 
considerable. I have the honor to be, &c.,

</p><p>
Sir 
</p><p>
This will be delivered to you by John Paulding 
one of the young men that took Major Andre, and 
who nobly refused any sum of money that he should 
demand. The other two young men, that were in 
company with him, are not yet found; as soon as 
they arrive, they shall be sent on. 
</p><p>
I have just seen Kennicutt. He thinks it will be 
impossible for him to go below again. He begs your 
instruction and assistance. Almost all his furniture, 
clothes, and money are below. Some of the plunderers from above have stole his horse, which makes him 
very poor. He has gone down between the lines to 
try to get out some of his things, and to give notice 
to some people that have assisted him in his business. 
</p><p>
I should take it as a particular favor, if you would 
use your influence with Governor Clinton to have 
some Board appointed to inquire into and determine 
the horrid practice of plundering that is carried on 
in this part of the country. I have no doubt but 
that the plunderers, above and below, are connected. 
If some proper Board could be appointed, or the 
Commanding Officer on the lines vested with proper 
authority from Governor Clinton, many petty villains, 
near the lines, may be detected, I make no doubt, 
who hold a correspondence with Delancy's cow-boys. 
</p><p>
I am very sorry that I wrote to General Arnold. 
I did not think of a British ship being up the river, 
and expected that, if he was the man he has since 
turned out to be, he would come down to the troops 
in this quarter, in which case I should have secured 
him. I mentioned my intention to Major Tallmadge, 
and some others of the Field-Officers, all of whom 
were clearly of opinion that it would be right, until 
I could hear from your Excellency. 
</p><p>
The Queen's rangers, I am informed, marched from 
Oyster Bay, last Saturday, for King's Bridge ; the 
17th, on Sunday; and some others are ordered to hold 
themselves in readiness. Two British officers went 
on board the Vulture just above Tarrytown. They 
were out in the country, clothed in mean, ragged, 
country clothes, and, at the river side, changed them 
for fine laced regimentals. Some gentleman came out 
from King's Bridge, about a fortnight ago, with a handkerchief full of gold, changed his clothes for an 
old nankeen jackcoat, and pushed up the North River. 
</p><p>
I am, &c. John Jmieson.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
Confiding that your Excellency was constantly made 
acquainted with whatever related to the military affairs of this and the neighbouring State of South 
Carolina, I thought it unnecessary to increase your 
trouble by opening a direct correspondence with you 
myself, as Governor of this State. But, Sir, the distresses of this country, and the dangers wo are now 
exposed to, in consequence of the defeat of our army 
under General Gates, in August last, oblige me, in 
point of duty, to address myself to your Excellency, 
who, I know, has an equal concern for the safety of 
every part of the United .States. 
</p><p>
I am to acquaint you, Sir, that, for want of an 
early knowledge of the requisition of Congress for 
specific supplies, added to the bad crops of grain 
made in this State, for two years past, the army under Baron de Kalb, and our militia in the beginning 
of the present campaign, suffered the greatest hardships, and were subsisted with the greatest diflficulty. 
This difficulty, however, at length was overcome by 
our army's having made their march good to Pedee 
River, about the beginning of August. Here, Sir, 
they fortunately recovered from the enemy one of the 
most fertile and plentiful settlements in the Southern 
States, and obliged them, in turn, to take post in the 
barren, wretched country of Camden, where they were 
very soon reduced to strait allowance. South Carolina, in the mean time, encouraged by this successful 
advance of our army, was revolting from its late 
masters, in all quarters and in great numbers. The 
militia of the two States had had nine several skirmishes with the enemy, and had been successful in 
every one. In short, the enemy's destruction was inevitable, had not the General determined, unfortunately for us, to risk the fate of the campaign, and with 
it the two Carolinas, on the event of a single battle. 
I think I am justified in saying, he put all to risk, 
as I have mentioned, because no previous effectual 
measures were taken to save the baggage ; nor do I 
learn that any place was assigned for the army to retreat to, in case of misfortune, which, in my opinion, 
might have been reasonably expected. Our men, by 
hard marches and bad living, were sickly and weak; 
and much the greater part of the army were militia, 
who had never been in action. On the other hand, 
the enemy, whose numbers, by the by, were unknown, 
were fresh, and had the sure advantage of engaging 
us when and where they pleased ; of course they 
chose their ground and time to good effect. The action no sooner commenced than, as might have been 
dreaded, the centre and left wing of the line, composed of militia, and a great part of these, riflemen, 
got into confusion, and fled away. 
</p><p>
At this point of time, had the regulars been ordered to retreat to Rugely's Mills, five miles in their 
rear, possibly all might have been saved. One hundred men there, I am told, would have defended the 
pass against the whole British force. But it was not 
done, and the enemy, having nothing to oppose them 
on our left, of course turned it ; and the General might well suppose, as it seems he did, that they 
were all cut off. However, by the superior bravery 
of those excellent troops, they at length extricated 
themselves from their difficulties, and, after making 
great havoc among the enemy, came off in tolerably 
good order, and with less loss than could have been 
expected. 
</p><p>
But, Sir, the loss of these brave men was not our 
greatest loss. We had expended upwards of twenty-five millions of dollars on this army. We had drained every source, and exhausted every fund, in purchasing tents, wagons, horses, arms, ammunition, provisions, spirits, sugar, coffee, camp equipage of every 
kind, in short, every thing appertaining to an army; 
and in a single half hour, all is completely lost, and 
the army, in a manner, annihilated. For the militia 
fled chiefly to their respective homes, spreading terror wherever they went; and the regulars, of course, 
continued retreating on after their General, until they 
at length eventually collected at Hillsborough, two 
hundred and forty miles from the place of action, 
where the General arrived the third day after the 
action, leaving all the country behind open to the 
incursion and ravages of the enemy. At this place. 
Sir, the regular troops now remain, inactive and useless for want of tents, clothes, and other necessaries, 
whilst the enemy are making the most alarming advances into the richest and strongest part of this 
State. My last letter from General DaYidson, who, 
for the present, commands the militia to the westward, dated the 26th ultimo, says, this day, at eleven 
o'clock, the enemy marched in force into Charlotte, 
his army retreating, and meaning to take post on the 
north side of the Yadkin. And Sir, I am to remark 
to you, that from the Yadkin, to within about twenty miles of Hillsborough, the inhabitants are chiefly 
disaffected to our government; so that if our militia 
shall not be able to hold their post on the Yadkin, 
a river fordable anywhere, their further retreat will 
not only be difficult and precarious, but the enemy's 
army will inevitably swell and grow more formidable ; 
and, in such a case, what have we to expect, but 
that General Gates will retreat with the shattered remains of his regular army over the Roanoke, which 
he is now within about thirty miles of ? 
</p><p>
This, Sir, is a true picture of our present deranged 
and feeble condition, the effects of the unfortunate 
affair of the 16th of August. I have acquainted 
Congress with our defenceless state, and of the fatal 
consequences, to the United States, of losing North 
Carolina. I have told them, in plain terms, that our 
funds are exhausted ; that our militia are without 
tents, badly armed, and dispirited, for want of regular 
troops to form a proper basis of defence ; that the 
unsettled state we are in will render precarious any 
dependence on us for a sufficient supply of provisions ; and have urged them, in the strongest terms 
I am capable of, to afford some timely aid. And, 
Sir, I also beg leave earnestly to call your Excellency's attention towards the effectual defence of this 
part of the United States. I know, Sir, both you 
and Congress know the importance of these Southern 
States, and I acknowledge you had made what seemed a very sufficient provision, not only for our defence, but for the recovery of, at least, the upper 
parts of South Carolina. But, Sir, unfortunately for 
us, we have lost all advantage from the former aid, 
and the force of our militia is also weakened and reduced by the entire loss of our field equipage, and 
our incapacity to repair the loss. To give your Excellency some idea of the cruelties practised by the 
enemy over those who fall into their power, I inclose 
to you a copy of Lord Cornwallis's orders to an officer commanding at a separate post. If you desire 
of me. Sir, a continuation of intelligence from this 
part of America, I shall be happy, during my continuance in office, in obeying your orders; 
</p><p>
And am, &c.,

Abner Nash.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
At the time I wrote to you respecting that part 
of the system for the army that had been agreed on 
by Congress, I had despaired of its being submitted 
to your opinion. I had moved for it, but my proposition was rejected, on a principle that the whole 
should go together. We have received your Excellency's sentiments on this very important subject, 
such as I evidently foresaw would be the result of 
your serious consideration. Your observations are incontrovertible ; and, unless Congress are so bigoted to 
the idol they have set up, and are determined to reject every principle that can have the least tendency 
to invalidate the foundation on which it is erected, 
they must ultimately adopt the plan you propose. 
No other, I am convinced, can ever answer our purposes. 
</p><p>
But even in this case, a most tremendous inconvenience arises ; for here is the month of October better 
than half spent, and probably before Congress come to 
a final determination, November will be arrived, and 
then there remains only two months for prosecuting 
this great work. The time is certainly too short for 
its completion. I consequently dread the arrival of 
the first day of January. Had Congress put this 
business in the train that was proposed early in September, so much precious time would have been 
saved as, in all probability, would have given success 
to the plan. However, we must now use our best 
endeavours to put things on as good a footing as the 
nature of the case will admit of Your Excellency's 
letter of the 11th instant is committed to the same Committee who brought in the former report, together 
with that report; but nothing is as yet clone in it. 
</p><p>
My plan, respecting the annual recruits, was only 
meant to render the system as useful as possible ; 
for, if an alternative must be admitted into it, we 
should endeavour to derive every possible advantage 
from it. I therefore thought it best to have the 
power to detain the men, and take our chance for 
its success, rather than that they should, at all events, 
be at liberty to disband themselves at a certain day. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's appointment of General Greene 
to the command of the Southern army has given 
general satisfaction. To the five Southern States I 
know it has given the highest satisfaction. 
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
John Mathews.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have tills morning received certain information 
of the arrival of a hostile fleet, of about sixty sail, in 
our Bay. The debarkation of some light-horse, in the 
neighbourhood of <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, seems to indicate that 
as the first scene of their action. We are endeavouring to collect as large a body to oppose them as 
we can arm. This will be lamentably inadequate, if 
the enemy be in any force. It is mortifying to suppose it possible that a people, able and zealous to 
contend with the enemy, should be reduced to fold 
their arms for want of the means of defence ; yet no 
resources, that we know of, ensure us against this 
event. 
</p><p>
It has become necessary to divert, to this new object, a considerable part of the aids we had destined 
for General Gates. We are still, however, sensible 
of the necessity of supporting him, and have left that 
part of our country, most convenient to him, uncalled 
on at present, that they may reenforce him as soon 
as arms can be received. We have called to the 
command of our forces Generals Weedon and Muhlenberg, of the line, and Nelson and Stephens of the 
militia. You will be pleased to make to these such 
additions as you think necessary. As to aids of 
men, I ask for none, knowing that if the late detachments of the enemy should have left it safe for you 
to spare aids of that kind, you will not await my 
application. Of the troops we shall be able to collect, there is not a single man who ever saw the 
face of an enemy. Whether the Convention troops will be removed is not jet determined ; this must 
depend on the force of the enemy and the aspect of 
their movements. I have the honor to be,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I am just honored with your Excellency's favor of 
the 18th instant, which shall be laid before the Legislature without loss of time. I hope your Excellency's reasonings upon the subject of our embarrassments may have the weight they justly deserve, and 
happily prevent our longer continuing under those 
delusions which have hitherto made the independence 
of America a contested point. I have often been 
chagrined at the propagation of the mischievous doctrine, that the enemy had given over all idea of 
conquest. I am confident they never had more sanguine expectations of it than at present ; and, perhaps, never entertained the idea upon better grounds. 
</p><p>
I do not, by this observation, mean to insinuate 
that I am in the least apprehensive of the probability, and scarcely of the possibility, of such an event, 
in case the States make such exertions as the situation of our affiiirs requires ; but on the supposition 
that we continue to prosecute the war agreeably to 
the system hitherto pursued. For, as such conduct 
on our part will undoubtedly induce them to protract 
the dispute, and as the war, by that means, will soon 
become the measuring of the length of our respective 
purses, instead of that of our swords, I am convinced, from the state of our commerce, and the number of 
our intestine enemies, that the final establishment of 
our liberty principally depends upon such exertions, 
as will compel them to a speedy peace. 
I have the honor to be, &c.,

Sir, 
</p><p>
The Executive of this State think it expedient and

Many circumstances have led to this necessity. It

from this corps; and this expectation may be one 
among the probable causes of this movement of the 
enemy. Should, moreover, a rescue of them be attempted, the extensive disaffection which has been 
lately discovered, and almost total want of arms in the 
hands of our good people, render the success of such 
an enterprise by no means desperate. The fear of 
this, and of the dangerous convulsions to which such 
an attempt would expose us, diverts the attention of a 
very considerable part of our militia from an opposition 
to the invading enemy. An order has, therefore, been 
this day issued to Colonel Wood to take immediate 
measures for their removal, and every aid has been, 
and will be given him, for transporting, guarding, and 
subsisting them on the road, which our powers can 
accomplish. Notice hereof is sent, by the present conveyance, to his Excellency Governor Lee, on whose 
part I doubt not necessary preparations for their reception will be made. I have the honor to be, with 
the greatest esteem and respect, your Excellency's 
Most obedient and most humble servant,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency would long ere now have heard 
from me, but I delayed writing till I could give you 
some information of importance. Before General St. Clair relieved me, I had intimations, from some members of the Legislature, that they wished to see me 
before they broke up, which was agreeable to my intention. When he arrived, I immediately went there, 
and spent a week with them till they adjourned, 
which, I am persuaded, was not ill spent. I gave 
them a particular detail of our public affairs, so far 
as I was capable, and alarmed them with our condition. It had its proper effect. They have passed 
very decisive laws for filling up their regiments for 
the war ; but express their desire to Congress, that 
one of the five may be incorporated into four. They 
have also passed tax laws to the utmost ability of 
the State. The Commissioners, appointed to meet the 
Convention at <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>, are men of enlarged minds, 
fully informed of our civil defects and inertness, as 
well as the feeble state of the army. They are instructed and empowered to agree on the necessity of 
a Continental Executive, with powers similar to those 
mentioned in the inclosure, number One. 
</p><p>
In short. Sir, a great majority of the Legislature 
have a proper spirit for the times, and, so far as our 
safety depends on their exertions, we have nothing 
to fear. To remove all doubts of the intention of the 
Legislature in electing me a member of Congress, 
they were joased to express it in a letter, copy 
of which I take the liberty to inclose you. It appears by it, that they consider my civil capacity but 
a secondary one to my military, and in this relation 
to the army I wish to be considered by the Commander-in-chief; and I beg that no unmilitary delicacy 
may be observed to me, while in the field, from my 
connection with the civil. Whether I am acting in 
the civil or military line, I have but one object, and 
that is, to promote the best interest of this distressed 
country. 
</p><p>
I was honored with your favor of the 24th instant, 
which anticipates the application I purposed to make, when I should be ready to go to Congress, and the 
campaign judged at an end. I now wait only for 
means to bring me out of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, when it shall 
be thought proper for me to take the field. I own 
I fear, and have much reason to fear, I shall not be 
able, in Congress, to answer the virtuous expectations 
of the army and my fellow-citizens j but shall endeavour to do my duty. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c. &c., 
</p><p>
Alexander McDougall.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
Since I had the honor of writing to your Excellency on the 25th ultimo, the enemy have withdrawn 
their force from the north side of James River, and 
have taken post at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, which, we learn, they 
are fortifying. Their highest post is Suffolk, where 
there is a very narrow and defensible pass, between 
Nansemond River and the Dismal Swamp, which covers the country below from being entered by us. 
More accurate information of their forces than we at 
first had, gives us reason to suppose them to be from 
twenty-five hundred to three thousand, of which between sixty and seventy are cavalry. They are commanded by General Leslie, and were convoyed by 
the Romulus, of forty guns, the Blonde of thirty-two, 
the Delight sloop of sixteen, a twenty-gun ship of 
John Goodrich's, and two row galleys, commanded by 
Commodore Gayton. We are not yet assured that 
they have landed their whole force. Indeed, they 
give out, themselves, that, after drawing the force of 
this State to Suffolk, they mean to go to <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>. 
Their movements here had induced me to think they 
came in expectation of meeting with Lord Cornwallis 
in this country ; that his precipitate retreat has left 
them without a concerted object, and that they were 
waiting further orders. Information of this morning 
says, that, on being informed of Lord Cornwallis's 
retreat, and a public paper produced to them wherein 
were printed the several despatches, which brought 
this intelligence from General Gates, they unloaded a 
vessel and sent her off to <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> immediately. 
The fete of this army of theirs hangs on a very slender naval force indeed. 
</p><p>
The want of barracks at Fort Frederic, as represented by Colonel Wood, the difficulty of getting 
wagons sufficient to move the whole Convention 
troops at once, and the state of unreadiness in which 
the regiment of guards is, have induced us to think 
that it will be better to remove those troops in two 
divisions ; and, as the whole danger of desertion to 
the enemy, and of correspondence with the disaffected 
in our southern counties, is from the British only 
(for, from the Germans, we have no apprehensions on 
either head), we have advised Colonel Wood to move 
on the British in the first division, and to leave the 
Germans, in their present situation, to form a second 
division, and to be moved so soon as barracks may 
be erected at Fort Frederic. By these means the 
British may march immediately, under the guard of 
Colonel Crockett's battalion, while Colonel Taylor's 
regiment of guards remain with the Germans. I 
cannot suppose that this will be deemed such a separation as is provided against by the Convention, 
nor that their officers will wish to have the whole 
troops crowded together into barracks, which probably 
are not sufficient for half of them. Should they, however, insist on their being kept together, I suppose 
it would be the opinion that the second division 
should follow the first as closely as possible, and that 
their being exposed to a want of covering would, in 
that case, justly be imputable to themselves only. 
The delay of the second division will lessen the distress for provisions, which may, perhaps, take place 
on their first going to the new post, before matters 
have got into a regular train. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., &c., 
</p><p>
Thomas Jefferson. 
</p><p>
P. S. By a letter from Colonel Wood, received 
since writing the above, I am informed the British 
Conventioners are eight hundred and four, rank and 
file. He does not mention the present number of 
the Germans ; in May last, they were fifteen hundred 
and three, including officers.

Sir, 
</p><p>
I inclose to your Excellency a copy of an intercepted letter from Major-General Leslie to Lord Cornwallis. It was taken on a person endeavouring to 
pass through the country from <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a> towards 
Carolina. When he was apprehended, and a proposal 
made to search him, he readily consented to be 
searched; but, at the same time, was observed to put 
his hand into his pocket and carry something towards 
his mouth, as if it were a quid of tobacco. It was 
examined and found to be a letter, of which the inclosed is a copy, written on silk paper, rolled up in 
gold-beater's skin, and nicely tied at each end, so as 
not to be larger than a goose-quill. As this is the 
first authentic disclosure of their purpose in coming 
here, and may serve to found, with somewhat more 
of certainty, conjectures of their future movements, 
while their disappointment in not meeting with Lord 
Cornwallis may occasion new plans at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, I 
thought it worthy of communication to your Excellency/'' 
</p><p>
Some deserters were yesterday taken, said to be of the British Convention troops, who had found 
means to get to the enemy at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, and were 
seventy or eighty miles on their way back to the 
barracks when they were taken. They were passing

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I should very frequently have done myself the 
honor of writing to your Excellency, since the close 
of our correspondence on my leaving Congress, could 
I have prevailed upon myself to have drawn your 
attention from your weighty concerns ; and am confident my silence will not be attributed to any other 
cause. 
</p><p>
I am now called upon, by the free sufi'rages of my 
fellow-citizens, to take an active part in a sphere of 
public life quite unexpected to me ; which call, upon 
the principles I first advanced, I could not withstand. 
One inducement, among many others, that led to a cheerful compliance with this call, was, that it would 
afford me an agreeable opportunity of convincing you 
that no effort of mine should be wanting to promote 
your Excellency's views, with respect to a permanent 
army ; as my particular station would lead to a correspondence on public concerns, to which I shall always be attentive, and shall be happy, on every occasion, to be informed of the situation of the army, 
and all occurrences, and to expedite the measures 
adopted by this Commonwealth for the accommodation of the army. 
</p><p>
I am now more particularly led to address you, in 
consequence of a resolution of our Assembly, which 
I have the honor to inclose you, respecting the arms 
and accoutrements retained in camp by your order, 
which belonged to the soldiers of this Commonwealth, 
and at the expiration of their time were lodged in 
camp for the benefit of the United States, and no 
compensation made them. These soldiers are constantly making their application to the Assembly for 
a recompense for the loss of their arms and accoutrements, alleging, they were ordered to leave them in 
camp; and the Assembly are at a loss in what manner to proceed without some further knowledge of 
the circumstances. In order that they may conduct 
with propriety (as the United States must be chargeable with the amount), they have passed the inclosed 
resolve, requesting me to make application to your 
Excellency, to order a return to be made of all the 
arms and accoutrements that have been taken from 
the men belonging to this Commonwealth, specifying 
the names of the persons from whom such guns were 
taken or detained, and the regiment, company, and 
town, to which such men belong, in order that payment may be made to those who have benefited the 
public by leaving their arms and accoutrements, and 
have hitherto received no compensation. 
</p><p>
I am, therefore, to request that your Excellency 
will be pleased to give the necessary orders for the 
returns to be made, that the persons interested may, 
as speedily as possible, meet a compensation. 
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>

</p><p>
Sir, 
I have been honored by your Excellency's letter 
of the 8th instant. Having found it impracticable to 
move suddenly the whole Convention troops, British 
and Germans, and it being represented that there 
could not immediately be covering provided for them 
all at Fort Frederic, we concluded to march off the 
British first, from whom was the principal danger of 
desertion, and to permit the Germans, who show little 
disposition to join the enemy, to remain in their present quarters, till something further be done. The 
British accordingly marched on the 20th instant ; 
they cross the Bhie Ridge at the Rock-Fish Gap, 
and proceed along that valley. 
</p><p>
I am to apprise your Excellency, that the officers 
of every rank, both British and German, hut particularly the former, have purchased, -within this State, 
some of the finest horses in it. You will be pleased 
to determine whether it will be proper that they 
carry them within their lines. I believe the Convention of <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a> entitles them to keep the horses 
they then had ; but I presume none of the line, below the rank of Field-Officers, had a horse. 
</p><p>
Considering that the British will be now at Fort 
Frederic, and the Germans in Albemarle, <a href='/results.php?city=alexandria' rel='city'>Alexandria</a> 
seems to be the most central point to which there is 
navigation. Would it not, therefore be better that the 
flag-vessel, solicited by General Phillips, should go to 
that place ? It is about equally distant from the two 
posts. The roads to Albemarle are good. I know 
not how those are which lead to Fort Frederic. 
</p><p>
Your letter, referring me to General Greene for 
the mode of constructing light, portable boats, unfortunately did not come to hand till he had left us. 
We had before determined to have something done 
in that way; and, as they are still unexecuted, we 
should be greatly obliged by any draughts or hints 
which could be given by any body, within the roach 
of your Excellency 
</p><p>
I received advice that, on the 22d instant, the 
enemy's fleet got all under way, and were standing 
towards the Capes. As it still remained undecided 
wdiether they would leave the Bay or turn up it, I 
waited the next stage of information, that you might 
so far be enabled to judge of their destination. This 
I hourly expected, but it did not come till this evening, when, I am informed, they all got out to sea 
in the night of the 22cl. What course they steered 
afterwards, is not known. I must do their General and Commodore the justice to say, that, in every case, 
to which their influence or attention could reach, as 
far as I have been well informed, their conduct was 
such as does them the greatest honor. In the few 
instances of unnecessary and wanton devastation 
which took place, they punished the aggressors. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c.,

I am happy to hear, by my worthy friend Dr. Crosby, that my last letter to your Excellency, with the 
papers inclosed, was not only fxvorably received, but 
revived the remembrance of one whom you are so 
good as to rank among the number of your friends. 
Would to God my abilities were equal to my inclinations ! For, then, I would endeavour to render myself 
worthy of that honor by some eminent public services in defence of my injured country. But alas ! 
threescore years and ten are past with me. All, 
therefore, that remains in my power is, to pray for 
the continuance of that Divine protection, which has 
hitherto so remarkably preserved your invaluable life 
from the secret machinations of perfidious friends and 
the open violence of declared enemies, till the harvest 
of your indefatigable labors shall ultimatel} issue to 
your immortal honor in the salvation of your country. 
</p><p>
Our new-formed Supreme Legislative has postponed all other business to filling up our quota of troops 
during the continuance of the war. It is devoutly to 
be wished that the ways and means to he devised 
for this purpose may he effectual, and equal to the 
importance of the object. But, for my own part, I 
am utterly unable/ to discover where they may be found. 
Our new paper money, issued by recommendation 
of Congress, no sooner began to circulate, than two 
dollars of it were given for a hard one. To restore 
the credit of paper, by making it a lawful tender, by 
regulating acts, or by taxes, are political manoeuvres 
that have already proved abortive, and for this obvious reason, â€” that, in the same proportion as ideal 
money is forced into currency, it must, from the nature of every thing fraudulent, be forced out of 
credit. I have said, "from the nature of every thing 
fraudulent" because I am firmly of the opinion, and 
think it entirely defensible, that there never was a 
paper pound, a paper dollar, or a paper promise of 
any kind, that ever yet obtained a general currency, 
but by force or fraud, generally by both. 
</p><p>
That the army has been grossly cheated; that creditors have been infamously defrauded; that the 
widow and fatherless have been oppressively wronged 
and beggared; that the gray hairs of the aged and 
the innocent, for want of their just dues, have gone 
down with sorrow to their graves, in consequence of 
our disgraceful depreciated paper currency, â€” may now 
be affirmed, without hazard of refutation ; and, I wish 
it could be said, with truth, that the war has not 
thereby been protracted. May it not, therefore, be 
safely concluded that no kind of paper currency is 
adequate to the purpose of collecting and combining 
the forces of these United States for their common 
defence ? 
</p><p>
That our resources are equal to the exigencies of 
the whole, I have not the least doubt; but we have 
wandered so far out of the right road, that I fear it 
is become extremely difficult to find it again. To 
speak without a figure, fictitious wealth, that represents nothing but taxes, to be made a medium of 
trade or measure of commerce, an adequate reward 
for public services, and an equivalent for specie borrowed, either on public or private contract, before 
ever such fictitious wealth had an existence, â€” is certainly going out of the road of truth and justice. 
By consequence, the further we go, the more difficult 
it will be to return. But return we must, and that 
speedily, to the exercise of both ; otherwise, it requires no great sagacity to foresee that our ruin is 
inevitable. 
</p><p>
Should your Excellency ask how it is to be done, 
my answer is short and easy; â€” by reversing our public conduct, in almost every instance since the war began. Permit me to mention one. Instead of a C s 
</p><p>
become despicable, for want of power sufficient to do 
rigid, or odious by exercising an assumed power beyond right, had both the civil and military department 
been united in one and the same person during the 
war, and under the limitation as well as sanction of 
law ; â€” had this measure, I say, been adopted at 
first, it is more than probable our alliance with 
France would not only have commenced sooner, but 
it would have been no sooner ratified and confirmed, 
than the war would have been ended. Other instances might be given, though, perhaps, not of equal 
importance. 
</p><p>
But I find, whilst I am reprehending my superiors 
for going out of the right road, I am insensibly led 
out of it myself Be so good, therefore, as to excuse my intemperate zeal; and believe me to be, &c.,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor of writing to your Excellency on 
the subject of an expedition contemplated by this 
State against the British post at Detroit, and of receiving your answer of October 10th. Since the date 
of my letter The face of things has so far changed, 
as to leave it no longer optional in us to attempt or 
to decline the expedition, but compels us to decide 
iu the affirmative, and to begin our preparations immediately. 
</p><p>
The army the enemy at present have in the south, 
the reenforcements still expected there, and their determination to direct their future exertions to that 
quarter, are not unknown to you. The regular force 
proposed, on our part, to counteract those exertions, 
is such, either from the real or supposed inability of 
this State, as by no means to allow a hope that it 
may be effectual. It is therefore to be expected that 
the scene of war â€¢ will be either within our country, 
or very nearly advanced to it, and {hat our principal dependence is to be on militia; for which reason 
it becomes incumbent to keep as great a proportion 
of our people as possible free to act in that quarter. 
</p><p>
In the mean time a combination is forming in the 
westward, which, if not diverted, will call thither a 
principal and most valuable part of our militia. From 
intelligence received, we have reason to expect that 
a confederacy of British and Indians, to the amount 
of two thousand men, is formed for the purpose of 
spreading destruction and dismay through the whole 
extent of our frontier, in the ensuing spring. Should 
this take place, we shall certainly lose in the south 
all aids of militia from beyond the Blue Ridge, besides 
the inhabitants who must fall a sacrifice in the course 
of the savage irruptions. There seems to be but one 
method of preventing this, which is, to give the western enemy employment in their own country. The regular force Colonel Clark already has, with a proper 
draft from the militia beyond the Alleghany, and 
that of three or four of our most northern counties, will be adequate to the reduction of Fort Detroit, 
in the opinion of Colonel Clark; and he assigns the 
most probable reasons for that opinion. We have, 
therefore, determined to undertake, and to commit it 
to his direction. Whether the enterprise shall be at 
Continental or State expense, we will leave to be decided by Congress hereafter, in whose justice we can 
confide, as to the determination. In the mean time, 
we only ask the loan of such necessaries as, being 
already at <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a>, will save time and an immense 
expense of transportation. These are, four field-pieces, 
six-pounders ; three thousand balls suited to them ; 
one mortar ; three thousand shells suited to it ; two 
howitzers; grape-shot; necessary implements and furniture for the above; one thousand spades; two hundred pickaxes; one travelling forge; some boats ready 
made, should we not have enough prepared in time ; 
some ship-carpenter's tools. 
</p><p>
These articles shall be either identically or specifically returned, should we prove successful. It is 
not improbable they may be where Congress would 
choose to keep them. I am therefore to solicit your 
Excellency's order to the Commandant at <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a>, 
for the above articles, which shall not be called for 
until every thing is in readiness, after which there 
can be no danger of their being wanted for the post 
at which they are. Indeed there are few of the articles essential for the defence of the post. 
</p><p>
I hope 3"our Excellency will think yourself justified in lending us this aid, without awaiting the effect 
of an application elsewhere, as such a delay would 
render the undertaking abortive, by postponing it to 
the breaking up of the ice on the Lake. Independently of the favorable effect which a successful enterprise against Detroit must produce to the United 
States in general, by keeping in quiet the frontier 
of the northern ones, and leaving our western militia 
at leisure to aid those of the south, we think the 
like friendly office performed by us to the States, 
whenever desired, and almost to the absolute exhaustion of our own magazines, give well-founded hopes 
that we may be accommodated on this occasion. The 
supplies of military stores which have been furnished 
by us to <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a> itself, to the Northern army, and, 
most of all, to the Southern, are not altogether unknown to you. I am the more urgent for an immediate order, because Colonel Clark awaits here your 
Excellency's answer by the expresses, though his presence in the western country, to make preparations 
for the expedition, if you enable us to undertake it, 
is so very necessary. 
</p><p>
To the above, I must add a request to you, to 
send for us to Pittsburg persons proper to work the 
mortars and howitzers, as Colonel Clark has none 
such, nor is there one in this State. They shall be 
in the pay of this State from the time they leave 
you. Any money necessary for their journey shall 
be repaid at Pittsburg, on their arrival there, or shall 
be paid here on demand. They should be at Pittsburg, without fail, by the 1st of March. 
</p><p>
At the desire of the General Assembly, I take the 
liberty of transmitting to you the inclosed resolution ; 
and have the honor to be, with the most perfect 
esteem and regard, your Excellency's

Most obedient and humble servant,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have just had the honor to receive your Excellency's favor of the 6th ultimo. Your favors by JNIajor-General Greene I did myself the honor to answer 
some time ago, and expressed how much the Southern States were indebted to you for your attention 
shown to their interests, and the appointment of the 
General to the command here ; and have no doubt he 
will effect every advantage for us that we may enable 
him to do. At the same time I must observe, that 
the provision hitherto made by the Assembly of this 
State, in particular for the support of an army, is so 
inadequate, and the steps taken with regard to the 
currency and other matters of the greatest consequence, so void of policy, that I fear much distress 
must yet be endured before we shall become sufficiently wise for our own interests. The resolutions 
of Congress for filling up our Continental battalions, 
I have repeatedly, and in the most pressing manner, 
recommended to their attention; and have had the 
mortification, as yet, to find nothing effectual done. 
I hope your Excellency's letter to me on this subject, which I shall have the honor of laying before 
them in a few days, will move the Assembly to do 
something suitable to their rank as a sovereign State, 
and indeed absolutely necessary to their political existence. Of all their acts, respecting the great object 
of defence, I shall not fail to acquaint your Excellency as soon as I am afforded an opportunity. 
</p><p>
Since the affair of Ferguson's defeat, which did the 
highest honor to the militia concerned in it, I hear 
the noted Colonel Tarleton has been defeated by another party of militia, under the command of General Sumpter. The Board of War writes me, that in this 
action the British lost ninety men killed, and seventy 
taken prisoners ; and that Tarleton himself was wounded, in two places, through the body, and his thigh 
broken. I have had the same accounts from gentlemen in different parts of the country; but, having it 
not from camp, I dare not give it as fact, though I 
much believe it. 
</p><p>
I have not heard a word of the enemy landed in 
Virginia since they left that country. Immediately 
on their departure, I sent express to General Smallwood, to put him on his guard. The enemy have 
not been entirely free of trouble off <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, and 
on the coast in that quarter. During this summer, 
they have suffered very considerably by our privateers, particularly by open row-boats. These boats, 
with forty or fifty men on board, take almost every 
thing that comes in their wa}'. Two, who went in 
company, returned here this week, after a cruise of 
about twenty days, in which time they took and sent 
in twelve valuable prizes, besides burning, I think, 
four. They also did another important service ; they 
landed in Georgia and took off a Mr. Young, the 
richest man and greatest Tory in that country, except the Governor. They also brought off a considerable number of his negroes. This Mr. Young is 
now a prisoner here. The action is exclaimed against 
by some moderate men. However, as it is exactly in 
the line of retaliation, I shall not fail to encourage 
it, unless I should be overruled. 
</p><p>
There has been, lately, a second transportation of 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> citizens to St. Augustine. Among these 
is Mr. ]Middleton, the younger. Even the ladies do 
not escape their vengeance. Mrs. Kinloch and Mrs. Ben. Huger have written to me of their distresses. 
For the offence of permitting Mr, Pendleton, who escaped from <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, to stay a night in their house, 
they have been taken from their plantation at Waccamaw, and carried prisoners to <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, where 
they are now confined, and reduced from a state of 
the greatest affluence to want; and, to embitter the 
condition of Mrs. Huger (the lady of Major Huger, 
who fell in the siege of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>), she has lost two 
of her small children since she was separated from 
them, probably for want of care. But what I have 
mentioned are trifles, compared to their daily enormities. 
</p><p>
I shall, on all occasions, think myself highly honored in hearing from your Excellency ; and shall not 
Ml, from time to time, giving you such intelligence 
as I shall think it necessary for our Commander-inchief to know. 
</p><p>
And I have the honor to be, &c.,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
It may seem odd, considering the important events 
which have taken place in this State within the 
course of ten days past, that I should not have 
transmitted an account of them to your Excellency. 
But such has been their extraordinary rapidity, and 
such the unremitted exertions they have required 
from all concerned in Government, that I do not recollect the portion of time which I could have taken 
to commit them to paper. 
</p><p>
On the 31st of December, a letter from a private gentleman to General Nelson, came to my hands, notifying that, on the morning of the preceding day, 
twenty-seven sail of vessels had entered the Capes ; 
and, from the tenor of the letter, we had reason to 
expect, within a few hours, further intelligence, whether they were friends or foes, their force, and other 
circumstances. We immediately despatched General Nelson to the lower country, with powers to call on 
the militia in that quarter, or to act otherwise as exigencies should require ; but waited further intelligence before we would call for militia from the middle 
or upper country. No further intelligence came till 
the 2d instant, when the former was confirmed. It 
was ascertained that they were enemies, and had advanced up James River to Wanasqueak Bay. 
</p><p>
All arrangements were immediately taken for calling in a sufficient body of militia for opposition. In 
the night of the 3d, we received advice that they 
were at anchor opposite Jamestown. We then supposed <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a> to be their object. The wind, 
however, which had hitherto been unfavorable, shifted 
fair, and, the tide being also in their favor, they ascended- the river to Kennon's that evening, and, with 
the next tide, came up to Westover, having on their 
way taken possession of some works we had at 
Hood's, by which two or three of their vessels had 
received some damage, but which were, of necessity, 
abandoned by the small garrison of fifty men placed 
there, on the enemy's landing to invest the works. 
Intelligence of their having quitted the station at 
Jamestown, from which we supposed they meant to 
land for <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>, and that they had got in the 
evening to Kennons, reached us next morning, at five 
o'clock, and was the first indication of their meaning 
to penetrate towards this place or Petersburg. As the orders for drawing militia hither had been given 
but two days, no opposition was in readiness. Every 
effort was therefore necessary to withdraw the arms 
and other military stores, records, &c., from this place. 
Every effort was accordingly exerted to convey them 
to the foundery, five miles, and to the laboratory, six 
miles above this, till about sunset of that day, when 
we learnt that the enemy had come to an anchor at 
Westover that morning. We then knew that this, 
and not Petersburg, was their object, and began to 
carry across the river every thing remaining here, 
and to remove what had been transported to the 
foundery and laboratory, to Westham, the nearest crossing, seven miles above this place, which operation was 
continued till they had approached very near. 
</p><p>
They marched from Westover at two o'clock in the 
afternoon of the 4th, and entered <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> at ten 
o'clock in the afternoon of the 5th. A regiment of 
infantry, and about thirty horse, continued on, without halting, to the foundery. They burnt that, the 
boring-mill, the magazine, and two other houses, and 
proceeded to Westham ; but, nothing being in their 
power there, they retired to <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>. The next 
morning they burnt some buildings of public, and 
some of private property, with what stores remained 
in them, destroyed a great quantity of private stores, 
and, about twelve o'clock, retired towards Westover, 
where they encamped within the neck the next day. 
</p><p>
The loss sustained is not yet accurately known. 
As far as I have been able to discover, it consisted, 
at this place, of about three hundred muskets, some 
soldiers' clothing to a small amount., some Quartermaster's stores, of which one hundred and twenty 
sides of leather was the principal article, part of the 
artificers' tools, and three wagons ; besides which, five 
brass four-pounders, which we had sunk in the river, 
"were discovered to them, raised and carried off. At 
the foundery we lost the greater part of the papers 
belonging to the Auditor's Office, and of the books 
and papers of the Council Office. About five or six 
tons, as we conjecture, of powder was thrown into 
the canal, of which there will be a considerable saving by remanufacturing it. The roof of the foundery 
was burnt, but the stacks of chimneys and furnaces 
not at all injured. The boring-mill was consumed. 
Within less than forty-eight hours from the time of 
their landing, and nineteen from our knowing their 
destination, they had penetrated thirty-three miles, 
done the whole injury, and retired. Their numbers, 
from the best intelligence I have had, are about 
fifteen hundred infantry, and, as to their cavalry, accounts vary from fifty to one hundred and twenty; 
the whole commanded by the parricide Arnold. 
</p><p>
Our militia, dispersed over a large tract of country, 
can be called in but slowly. On the day the enemy 
advanced to this place, two hundred only were embodied ; they were of this town and its neighbourhood, and were too few to do any thing. At this 
time, they are assembled in pretty considerable numbers on the south side of James River, but are not 
all yet brought to a point. On the north side, are 
two or three small bodies, amounting, in the whole, 
to about nine hundred men. The enemy were, at four 
o'clock yesterday evening, still remaining in their encampment at Westover and Berkley Neck. In the 
meanwhile Baron Steuben, a zealous friend, has descended from the dignity of his proper command, to 
direct our smallest movements. His vigilance has, in 
a great measure, supplied the want of force in preventing the enemy from crossing the river, which 
might have been very fatal. He has been assiduously 
employed in preparing equipments for the militia, as 
they should assemble, pointing them to a proper object, and other offices of a good Commander. Should 
they loiter a little longer, and he be able to have a 
sufficient force, I shall flatter myself they will not 
escape with total impunity. To what place they will 
point their next exertions, we cannot even conjecture. 
The whole country on the tide waters, and some distance from them, is equally open to similar insult. I 
have the honor to be, with every sentiment of respect, 
your Excellency's 
</p><p>

Hermitage, 12 <a rel="month origin" value="1">January</a>. , <a href='/results.php?year=1781' rel="origin">1781</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I did myself the honor of forwarding to your Excellency two packets from the Committee of Congress, 
which contained every occurrence worth communicating, and prevented my addressing your Excellency 
sooner. 
</p><p>
Upon receiving the disagreeable intelligence respecting the Pennsylvania line, I imagined the enemy 
would have taken the advantage of those disturbances, and have thrown a body of troops into this 
State. I therefore thought it prudent to make some 
disposition to receive them, as well as to answer another obvious purpose. Whilst the Pennsylvanians 
lay at <a href='/results.php?city=princeton' rel='city'>Princeton</a>, I formed a large body of militia 
between them and the Sound, a second at the Baptist meeting-house in Hopewell, a third at Cross wicks, 
and a fourth at South Amboy. This last body was 
composed of the Monmouth militia. Since their removal to <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, I have ordered those troops from 
the meeting-house and Crosswicks to move on to 
<a href='/results.php?city=princeton' rel='city'>Princeton</a>, where I intend visiting them this day. 
The moment an accommodation takes place between 
the Committee and the insurgents, I shall dismiss 
the militia, unless I should receive your Excellency's 
orders to the contrary, or the enemy (which I do not 
now expect) should make a descent into this State. 
</p><p>
The two spies were executed yesterday, pursuant to their sentence, on a gallows erected just above 
Paddy's Ferry, in Pennsylvania. The execution was 
delayed some time for want of a rope and hangman; 
but, at last, the service was performed by a negro 
boy of Paddy. I was glad to hear this necessary 
business was ended. 
</p><p>
The great work is not yet begun, although Commissioners are appointed and preparations making. From 
the best information I can procure, I am of opinion 
that about three hundred of them wished to join the 
enemy. They still persist in retaining their arms until discharged, which is so absurd a demand it 
can never be complied with, nor can I think they 
seriously expect a compliance. I wish the matter 
was finally settled. The difficulty of supplying the 
militia with provisions is very great. I use my utmost exertions to draw supplies from our county contractors ; but the scarcity of cash pervades every 
department, and gives me but little reason to expect 
much support from that quarter. Whatever orders 
your Excellency thinks proper to give shall be executed by 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
Philemon Dickinson.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I am honored with the receipt of your favor of the 
5th instant, by Brigadier-General Knox. Your Excellency's exertions and early communications of the 
alarming situation of our army, demand our most 
grateful acknowledgments, at the same time that the 
late revolt and the present critical situation of our 
army, give us the most anxious concern. Our General Assembly was sitting, when General Knox arrived. 
I immediately laid your letter before them, and General Knox was pleased to give particular information 
of the circumstances of the revolt and situation of 
our army. The Assembly immediately took the matter 
under consideration, and came to a resolution, immediately to collect a sum of money to be exchanged 
for hard money, to send forward twenty-four dollars 
for each non-commissioned officer and private in our 
line, as a gratuity for their good services, and the 
sufferings they have been unavoidably exposed to. 
It was thought, by General Knox, that the New England States would go into this measure, and that it 
would give greater satisfaction than advancing some 
part of their pay. The money, I have no doubt, will 
be forwarded next week. It is the disposition of the 
General Assembly and people of this State to do 
every thing in their power for the support of the 
army. But we have not the means in our power, so 
much as some others may have. 
</p><p>
I am desired, by the General Assembly, to request 
of your Excellency that, as we have a considerable 
number of men belonging to this State now engaged 
in Colonel Jackson's and Hazen's regiments. Major 
Whitcomb's corps, and sundry other regiments not 
particularly belonging to this State, that such men 
may be turned over to some one of our regiments, 
agreeably to the resolution of Congress, which would 
make it much more convenient in providing for and 
settling with our men. I have the honor to be, with 
every sentiment of esteem and respect.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
As the intelligence received yesterday possibly may 
not be conveyed to you through any other channel at this time, and being well assured it will afford 
you much satisfaction to he informed of it, I have 
therefore taken the liberty of communicating it to 
you. Though the information does not come officially 
from the State, yet it comes in such a manner that 
it is to be depended on, â€” that Maryland has at last 
agreed to confederate. We have the resolves as they 
passed the lower House, wliich have since passed the 
upper House. This is a most important circumstance, 
and comes very seasonably to our relief; for Congress have been disputing, for a long time past, what 
powers were necessary to enable them to prosecute " 
the business intrusted to them, and were, at this 
moment, as far from agreeing about it as when we 
began. I hope, now we have some certain principles 
to act upon, we shall be steady and decisive. Though 
the powers of the Confederation are very inadequate 
to vigorous prosecution of the present war, yet we 
must endeavour to make the most of them we can ; 
and it is better to have some authority to regulate 
us, than (as for some time past has been the case) 
have none. 
</p><p>
Viroiuia has agreed to a cession of their back 
lands, with some reservations. This is also a very 
important matter, our present circumstances considered. I flatter myself it will give us some credit, 
which we stand much in need of, and may possibly 
give a spring to our affairs. 
</p><p>
Congress have been seriously engaged, for the last 
ten days, in a Committee of the Whole, considering 
of the ways and means for defraying the expenses 
of the present year. They have agreed to call upon 
the States for a duty of four per cent, on all goods 
imported; the like duty on all prize goods; and one 
eighth of a dollar per ton on all foreign shipping. 
This, it is computed, "SYill produce about six or seven 
hundred thousand specie dollars. This is but a trifle 
when compared with our wants -, but, however, we are 
going on.

Please to make my most respectful compliments 
to Mrs. Washington; and believe me to be, my dear 
General, yours &c.,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
By a letter from General Greene, dated Guilford 
Court-House, 10th February, we are informed that 
Lord Cornwallis had burnt his own wagons in order 
to enable himself to move with greater facility, and 
had pressed immediately on. The prisoners taken at 
the Cowpens were happily saved by the accidental 
rise of a watercourse, which gave so much time as 
to withdraw them from the reach of the enemy. 
Lord Cornwallis had advanced to the vicinity of the 
Moravian towns, and was still moving on rapidly. 
His object was supposed to be to compel General Greene to an action, which, under the difference of 
force they had, would probably be ruinous to the latter. General Greene meant to retire by the way of 
Boyd's Ferry, on the Boanoke. As yet he had lost little or no stores or baggage, but they were far from 
being safe. In the instant of receiving this intelligence, 
we ordered a reenforcement of militia to him from 
the most convenient counties in which there was a 
hope of finding any arms. Some great event must 
arise from the present situation of things, which for a long time will determine the condition of southern afBiirs. 
</p><p>
Arnold lies close in his quarters. Two days ago I 
received information of the arrival of a sixty-four gun 
ship and two frigates in our Bay, being part of the 
fleet of our good ally at Rhode Island. Could they 
get at the British fleet here, they are sufficient to 
destroy them; hut the-se being drawn up into Elizabeth River, into which the sixty-four cannot enter, I 
apprehend they could do nothing more than block up 
the river. This, indeed, would reduce the enemy, as 
we could cut off their supplies by land ; but the 
operation being lengthy, would probably be too dangerous to the auxiliary force. Not having yet had 
any particular information of the designs of the 
French Commander, I cannot pretend to say what 
measures this aid will lead to. 
</p><p>
Our proposition to the Cherokee Chiefs to visit 
Congress, for the purpose of preventing, or delaying, 
a rupture with that nation, was too late. Their distresses had too much ripened their alienation from us, 
and the storm had gathered to a head when Major 
Martin got back. It was determined to carry the 
war into their country, rather than await it in ours; 
and I have it in my power to inform you, that, thus 
disagreeably circumstanced, the issue has been successful. The militia of this State and North Carolina 
penetrated into their country, burnt almost every 
town they had, amounting to about one thousand 
houses in the whole, destroyed fifty thousand bushels 
of grain, killed twenty-nine, and took seventeen prisoners. The latter are mostly women and children. 
I have the honor to be, with great respect. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
Thomas Jefferson. 
</p><p>
P. S. Since writing the above I received information, which, though not authentic, commands attention; 
that Lord Cornwallis had got to Boyd's Ferry on the 
14th. I am issuing orders, in consequence, to other 
counties to embody and march all the men they can 
arm. In this fatal situation, without arms, there will 
be no safety for the Convention troops, but in their 
removal, which I shall accordingly order. The prisoners of the Cowpens were at New London (Bedford 
Court-Iiouse) on the 14th.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the pleasure of receiving a letter from General Greene, dated High Rock Ford, February 29 
(probably March 1), who informs me, that, on the 
night of the 24th, Colonel McCall surprised a subaltern's guard, at Hart's Mill, killed eight, and wounded and took nine prisoners ; and that, on the 25th, 
General Pickens and Lieutenant-Colonel Lee routed a 
body of near three hundred Tories, on the Haw River, 
who were in arms to join the British army, killed upwards of one hundred, and wounded most of the 
rest, which had liad a very happy effect on the disaffected in that country. 
</p><p>
By a letter from Major Magill, an officer of this 
State, whom I had sent to General Greene's headquarters, for the purpose of giving us regular intelligence, dated Guilford county, March 2d, I am informed that Lord Cornwallis, on his retreat, erected 
the British standard at Hillsborough ; that a number of disaffected, under the command of a Colonel 
Piles, were resorting to it, when they were intercepted by General Pickens and Lieutenant-Colonel Lee, 
as mentioned by General Greene, and that their Commanding Officer was among the slain ; that Lord 
Cornwallis, after destroying every thing he could at 
Hillsborough, moved down the Haw Ptiver ; that General Greene was within six miles of him ; that our 
superiority in the goodness, though not the number 
of cavalry, prevented the enemy from moving with 
rapidity or foraging. Having desired Major Magill 
to be particular in informing me what corps of militia, from this State, joined General Greene, he accordingly mentions that seven hundred men, under 
General Stevens, and four hundred from Botetourt, 
had actually joined General Greene ; that Colonel 
Campbell was to join him that day with six hundred, 
and Colonel Lynch, with three hundred from Bedford, 
were shortly expected ; the last three numbers being 
riflemen. Besides these mentioned by Major Magill, 
General Lawson must, before that time, have crossed 
the Boanoke with a body of militia, the number of 
which has not been stated to me. Report makes 
them one thousand, but I suppose the number to be 
exaggerated. Four hundred of our new levies left 
Chesterfield Court-House on the 25th of February, 
and probably would cross the Roanoke about the 1st or 2d of March. 
</p><p>
I was honored with your Excellency's letter of 
February 21st, within seven days after its date. We 
have, accordingly, been making every preparation on 
our part, which we were able to make. The militia, 
proposed to operate, will be upwards of four thousand 
from this State, and one thousand or twelve hundred 
from Carolina, said to be under General Gregory. 
The enemy are at this time in a great measure 
blockaded by land, there being a force on the east 
side of Elizabeth River. Though they have a free 
exit from Elizabeth River, they suffer for provisions, 
as they are afraid to venture far enough to maraud 
in any great degree, lest the French squadron should 
be in their neighbourhood, and come on them. Were 
it possible to block up the river, a little time would 
suffice to reduce them by want and desertions, and 
would be more sure in its event than an attempt by 
storm. I shall be very happy to have it in my power 
to hand you a favorable account of these two armies in the south. I have the honor to be, with the 
greatest esteem and respect, &c.,

FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL PARSONS. 
</p><p>
Reading, 14 <a rel="month origin" value="3">March</a>,  <a href='/results.php?year=1781' rel="origin">1781</a>. 
</p><p>
Dear General, 
</p><p>
In consequence of your Excellency's directions, I 
have to this time been pursuing the objects of the 
inquiry you have ordered ; but have not been able to make the discoveries wished for, with a sufficient 
degree of precision to make any attempt to secure 
the persons concerned. 
</p><p>
I believe it is certain, that an association is formed 
to submit to the British Government on the terms of 
the last proclamation ; that the number of associators is 
daily increasing; that their names are transmitted to 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> as often as opportunity presents ; that a 
register was kept of them in Newtown, but it is not 
certain that this register is now there, or can be 
found, if there ; that a mode of conforming, different 
from that pointed out in the proclamation, is adopted; 
that many persons are engaged in the service of the 
enemy, who are preparing to join them ; about forty 
have made attempts since I have been here, but 
were disappointed. Persons are also employed to enlist these men, and are in the pay of the enemy, 
with the promise of commissions. Regular stages of 
intelligence arc established from the shores through 
the country to Canada. Despatches have lately gone 
through those channels to Vermont. I think it will 
be exceedingly difficult to detect the plan in its extent. So much caution is used by them, that my 
prospects are small of obtaining the register, or exposing to punishment any characters of importance. 
Some of their recruiting officers, some of the recruits, 
pilots, concealers of the enemy, and conveyers of despatches may be taken. 
</p><p>
In the course of my inquiries I have been informed of a great number in Ilorseneck, Stamford, and 
Norwalk, who are supplying the enemy with provisions, who conceal them when they make their excursions from Morrisania and Long Island, and who 
keep up a correspondence and trade with the party 
at Lloyd's Neck. About forty of these I know, who 
are now at home pursuing the same courses, and 
may be taken up; and I believe this is not a quarter part of those who are concerned, and, upon inquiry, may be exposed. By these pernicious practices, the morals of most of the young men in those 
towns have been dissipated, and a thirst for plunder 
and money has induced them to courses which have 
eventually driven many of them to the enemy. 
</p><p>
It has become difficult to know what is best to be 
done in those towns. To make the inquiry thoroughly, and take up all concerned, will drive great numbers to the enemy ; and to omit it, will put the few 
well-affected, who now remain there, wholly in the 
power of the enemy, notwithstanding every effort we 
can make to protect them. Whether it is best to 
apprehend all of them, or let them all remain, or to 
select out some who are most criminal, and punish 
them in the most exemplary manner, without disclosing the names of the other persons concerned, and 
try what effect that may have, â€” are doubts which I 
am unable to resolve. The same questions will arise 
respecting the associators, pilots, conveyers of intelligence, &c. In short, the evil has taken so deep root, 
it is become a subject of a very delicate nature, and 
difficult to know how far it is best to extend the inquiries. 
</p><p>
The State have passed a law subjecting all persons 
coming into the State to plunder, and those who 
aid, assist, or in any way abet their measures, to 
trial by Courts-Martial; declaring those people not exchangeable, and to inflict capital or other discretionary punishments upon them. I must request your 
Excellency's particular directions how far I shall proceed in these matters, and what I shall do with the 
offenders, when apprehended. A temporary check may be given to the intentions of the disaffected by securing a number of them at present ; but no radical 
remedy is yet in my power. 
</p><p>
I am persuaded they expect a descent on the 
coast in April, to favor their designs of joining the 
enemy, and furnishing supplies for them. What probability there is of the event taking place, you 
must be much better informed of The spy, employed 
amongst them, has assurances of generous pay for all 
the time he employs and expenses incurred in this 
service ; of a handsome gratuity "when he has done 
what he can ; to be settled in some more secure 
place, if he is detected and obliged to fly from his 
present settlements (which will be the case, if he is 
discovered) ; and, if he succeeds in discovering the 
full extent of the plan, so that the concerned may 
be detected, and it shall prove to be as extensive as 
is supposed, he shall be gratified with an annuity of 
one hundred dollars per annum for life, as a reward 
for his services. I believe him faithful and industrious in making the discoveries necessary. 
</p><p>
If you think it best to delay taking up any of 
the concerned, until further discoveries are made, I 
should judge it most expedient for me to return to 
camp, leaving Captain Walker to prosecute the inquiries, lest my continuing here should occasion jealousies. I can return again, when any thing is prepared for execution.

Newbern, 4 <a rel="month origin" value="4">April</a>,  <a href='/results.php?year=1781' rel="origin">1781</a>. 
</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I did myself the honor to write your Excellency 
a few lines from General Greene's camp, dated the 
18th ultimo, as the express was just going off, as I 
arrived at the General's. I hope you were good 
enough to excuse the hasty manner in which it appeared to have been written. I am now just arrived 
home from camp, and have the pleasure to acquaint 
you that our worthy and excellent General, with his 
little distressed though successful army, has in turn 
driven his Lordship over Cape Fear River. This he 
passed, as the General informs me, on the 28th, with 
great precipitation, leaving several dead of his late 
wounded, unburied, and leaving his bridge over the 
river undestroyed. The General was very near overtaking the enemy at this place, but says he must 
now make a halt, as a considerable part of the Virginia militia were leaving him, and as his army was 
distressed for provisions. 
</p><p>
I have assured him that the powers of the State shall be exerted to the utmost to support him; and 
that, in aid of the provision made by law for the 
support of the army, I had, with the advice of my 
Council Extraordinary, demanded from the inhabitants of the whole State (those reduced by the contending armies excepted), one fifth part of all their 
bacon and other salted meat, and had appointed 
proper officers in every county to collect this contribution immediately. And as this State has lately 
suffered so much, and been in such imminent danger 
of being entirely overrun and ruined by the enemy, 
I have every reason to hope the requisition will meet 
with no opposition. 
</p><p>
The State is now busily employed in drafting 
their regulars for our four battalions ; and as the 
militia, by a late law, are subjected, in case they 
desert their colors in time of action and run away, 
to the condition of Continental soldiers during the 
war, we expect to derive some good from the evil 
they did in running away from the enemy in the 
action of the loth, at Guilford; and I am sorry, on 
this occasion, to acknowledge that the most important 
advantages were that day lost by the shameful conduct of our men. All ranks of people here seem 
now fully sensible of the necessity of having a regular and well-appointed army, and that the country 
cannot be any other way effectually defended. The 
British, with their small force at Wilmington, still 
keep that post, and are kept in it by a party of our 
militia, who have once had a successful skirmish with 
them. It is pretty certain, from my last letters from 
General Greene, that Lord Cornwallis, with Ms army, 
is now at Cross Creek. The General does not hint 
what he expects will be his Lordship's next enterprises. If the General allows him, it is not improbable lie will now take some rest. With the highest 
respect and esteem, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
Abner Nash.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
On the 18th instant, the enemy came from <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a> up James River, in considerable force, though 
their numbers precisely are not yet known to us. 
They landed at Burwell's Ferry, below <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>, 
and near the mouth of Chickahominy, above it. This 
latter circumstance obliged Colonel Innes, who commanded a body of militia stationed on that side the 
river, to cover the country from depredation, to retire 
upwards, lest he should be placed between their two 
bodies. One of these entered <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a> on the 
20th, and the other proceeded to a ship-yard we had 
on Chickahominy. What injury they have done there, 
I am not yet informed. I take for granted they have 
burnt an unfinished twenty-gun ship we had there. 
</p><p>
Sucli of the stores belonging to the yard, as were 
movable, had been carried some miles higher up the 
river. Two small galleys also retired up the river. 
AVhether by this, either the stores or galleys were 
saved, is as yet unknown. 
</p><p>
I am just informed, from a private hand, that they 
left <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a> early yesterday morning. If this 
sudden departure was not in consequence of some 
circumstance of alarm unknown to us, their expedition to <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a> has been unaccountable. There 
were no public stores there, but those which were 
necessary for the daily use of the men stationed 
there. Where they mean to descend next, the event 
alone can determine. Besides harassing our militia 
with this kind of war, their being taken from their 
farms at the interesting season of planting then- corn, 
will have an unfortunate effect on the crop of the 
ensuing year. I have heard nothing certain of General Greene, since the 6th instant, except that his 
head-quarters were on Little River on the 11th. 
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
Thomas Jefferson.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
Since the letter, which I had the honor of last addressing to your Excellency, the military movements 
in this State have scarcely merited communication, 
except a very late one. The enemy, after leaving 
<a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>, came directly up James River, and 
landed at City Point, being the point of land on the 
southern side of the confluence of Appomattox and 
James Rivers. They marched up to Petersburg, 
where they were received by Major-General Baron 
Steuben with a body of militia somewhat under one 
thousand, who, though the enemy were two thousand 
three hundred strong, disputed the ground very handsomely two hours, during which time the enemy 
gained one mile only, and that by inches. Our troops 
were then ordered to retire over a bridge, which they 
did in perfectly good order. Our loss was between 
sixty and seventy, killed, wounded and taken. The 
enemy's is unknown ; but from circumstances of probability it must have been equal to ours. For their 
own honor they must confess this, as they broke 
twice, and ran like sheep, till supported by fresh 
troops. An inferiority of number obliged our force 
to withdraw about twelve miles upwards, till more 
militia should be assembled. The enemy burnt all 
the tobacco in the warehouses at Petersburg and its 
neighbourhood. They afterwards proceeded to Osborne's, where they did the same, and also destroyed 
the residue of the public armed vessels, and several 
of private property, and then came to Manchester, 
which is on the hill opposite to this place. 
</p><p>
By this time, Major-General the Marquis de Lafayette, having been advised of our danger, had, by 
forced marches, got here with his detachment of Continental troops ; and reenforcements of militia having 
also come in, the enemy, finding we were able to 
meet them on an equal footing, thought proper to 
burn the warehouses and tobacco at Manchester, and 
retire to Warwick, where they did the same. Ill-armed and untried militia, who never before saw the face 
of an enemy, have, at times during this war, given 
occasion of exultation to our enemies. But they afforded us, while at Warwick, a little satisfaction in the 
same way. Six or eight hundred of their picked men, 
of the light infantry, with General Arnold at their head, having crossed the river from Warwick, fled from 
a patrol of sixteen horse, every man into his boat 
as he could, some pushing north, and some south, as 
their fears drove them. 
</p><p>
Their whole force then proceeded to the Hundred, 
being the point of land within the confluence of the 
two rivers, embarked, and fell down the river. Their 
foremost vessel had got below Burwell's Ferry on the. 
Gth instant, when, on the arrival of a boat from 
<a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, and a signal given, the whole crowded 
sail up the river again, with a fair wind and tide, 
and came to anchor at Brandon. There, six days' provision were dealt out to every man. They landed, 
and had orders to march an hour before day the next 
morning. We have not yet heard which w\ay they 
went, or whether they are gone ; but, having about the 
same time received authentic information that Lord 
Cornwallis had, on the 1st instant, advanced from 
Wilmington half way to Halifix, we have no doubt, 
putting all circumstances together, but that these two 
bodies are forming a junction. 
</p><p>
We are strengthening our hands with militia, as 
far as arms, either private or public, can be collected ; 
but cannot arm a force which may face the combined 
armies of the enemy. It will therefore be of very 
great importance that General Wayne's forces be 
pressed on with the utmost despatch. Arms and a 
naval force, however, are what must ultimately save 
us. This movement of our enemies, we consider as 
most perilous in its consequences. 
</p><p>
Our latest advices from General Greene are of the 
26th ultimo, when he was lying before Camden, the 
works and garrison of which were much stronger than 
he had expected to find them.

I have the honor to be, &c.,

</p><p>
Pittsburg, 21 <a rel="month origin" value="5">May</a>,  <a href='/results.php?year=1781' rel="origin">1781</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I this moment received yours of the 25th of 
April. The intelligence is by no means alarming to 
me ; it corresponds with my former suspicion. I have 
for several years past kept up a constant chain of intelligence from the Lakes through the channel of the 
Illinois inhabitants. And a few hours after yours, I 
received despatches from the Mississippi and St. Vincent's ; â€” the whole a confirmation of your Excellency's hints, except that part of their [not] coining by the way of the Alleghany River, but rather through 
the western pass, as more immediately among the 
Indian nations, whom they would wish to have with 
them. And what greatly favors the idea is, that upwards of one thousand Wabash Indians have again 
declared themselves in our favor, and of course will 
draw their attention that way for some time, for fear 
that our troops in that quarter, reenforced by those 
Indians, should make a diversion on the Lakes, while 
they had drawn off their forces to Pittsburg. For 
in fact it has been the influence of our posts on the 
Illinois and Wabash that has saved the frontiers, and 
in a great measure baffled the designs of the enemy 
at Detroit. If they get possession of them, they will 
then command three times the number of valuable 
warriors they do at present, and be fully enabled to 
carry any point they aim at, except we should have 
a formidable force to oppose them. 
</p><p>
I am well acquainted with Colonel Connolly, and 
should be happy to meet him on equal terms. If his 
dependence is principally on Indians, and we should 
fortunately get into the field before him, he will 
probably meet with a disappointment. But should he 
be independent of them, our circumstances will be 
truly deplorable, except we had other measures of 
drawing the inhabitants of This country to the field 
besides persuasive arguments, which are too much our 
dependence at present. I wrote to the Governor of 
Pennsylvania on this subject, but received no answer. 
I cannot think any thing of importance is to be expected by the way of Venango, but much to be apprehended from the other quarter. I refer you to 
Captain Randolph for the news of this quarter. 
I have the honor to be, &c.,

</p><p>
Reduced to the necessity of taking every step to 
carry my point the ensuing campaign, I hope your 
Excellency will excuse me in taking the liberty of 
troubling you with this request. The invasion of 
Virginia put it out of the power of the Governor to 
furnish me with the number of men proposed for the 
enterprise to the west; but he informed me he had 
obtained leave of the Baron Steuben, and agreeably to 
your letters, for Colonel John Gibson and regiment, 
together with Heth's company, to join my forces, â€” 
an addition, he supposed, of more worth than the militia we were disappointed of On consulting Colonel 
Brodhead, he could not conceive that he was at liberty to suffer them to go, as oiir instructions were 
pointed respecting the troops and stores to be furnished by him. From your Excellency's letters to 
Colonel Brodhead, I conceived him to be at liberty to 
furnish what men he pleased. I am convinced he did 
not think as I do, or otherwise he would have had no 
objection, as he appeared to wish to give the enterprise every aid in his power. 
</p><p>
The hope of obtaining a grant of those troops has 
induced me to address your Excellency myself, as it 
is too late to consult Governor Jefferson firther on 
the subject. Wishing to set out on the expedition 
early in June, as our stores of provisions are nearly 
complete, if our force should be equal to the task 
proposed, I cannot conceive that this post, with a 
very small garrison even of militia, will be in any 
danger, as it is attached to a populous country, and. 
during our time in the enemy's, Mcintosh and Wheeling will be useless, or might also be garrisoned by 
small parties of militia. Those I know to be your 
Excellency's ideas. If you should approve of the 
troops in this department joining our forces, though 
they are few, the acquisition may be attended â€¢with. 
great and good consequences, as two hundred only 
might turn the scale in our favor. The advantage 
that must derive to the States from our proving successful, is of such importance that, I think, it deserved a greater preparation to insure it. 
</p><p>
But I have not yet lost sight of Detroit. Nothing 
seems to threaten us but the want of men. But even 
should we be able to cut our way through the Indians, and find they have received no reenforcements 
at Detroit, we may probably have the assurance to 
attack it, though our force may be much less than 
proposed, which was two thousand ; as defeating the 
Indians, wdtli inconsiderable loss on our side, would 
almost insure us success. Should this be the case, a 
valuable peace with them will probably ensue. But, 
on the contrary, should we fall through in our present plans, and no expedition take place, it is to be 
feared that the consequences will be fatal to the 
whole frontiers ; as every exertion will be made by 
the British party to harass them as much as possible, 
and disable them from giving any succours to our 
eastern or southern forces. The Indian war is now 
more general than ever. Any attempts to appease 
them, except by the sword, will be fruitless. 
</p><p>
Captain Randolph waits on your Excellency for an 
answer to this letter, which, I flatter myself, you 
will honor me with immediately. Colonel Gibson, 
who commands in the absence of Colonel Brodhead, 
will keep the troops ready to move at an hour's warning ; conducting myself as though this request 
was granted, impatiently waiting for the happy order. 
It is with gratitude I thank your Excellency for 
the honor you have done me in your several letters. 
The greatest earthly happiness I could possibly enjoy would be to conduct myself with such propriety, 
as to be entitled to your esteem.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I make no doubt you will have heard, before this 
shall have the honor of being presented to your Excellency, of the junction of Lord Cornwallis with the 
force at Petersburg under Arnold, who had succeeded 
to the command on the death of Major-General Phillips. I am now advised, that they have evacuated 
Petersburg, joined at Westover a reenforcement of 
two thousand men just arrived from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, 
crossed James River, and, on the 26th instant, were 
three miles advanced on their way towards <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, 
at which place Major-General the Marquis de Lafayette lay with three thousand men, regulars and militia, that being the whole number we could arm, till 
the arrival of the eleven hundred arms from Rhode 
Island, which are about this time getting to the place 
where our public stores are deposited. The whole 
force of the enemy within this State, from the best 
intelligence I have been able to get, I think is about 
seven thousand men, infantry and cavalry, including 
also the small garrison left at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>. A num- ber of privateers and small vessels, 'hicli are constantly ravaging the shores of our rivers, prevent us 
from receiving any aid from the counties lying on 
navigable waters -, and powerful operations, meditated 
against our western frontier by a joint force of British and Indian savages, have, as your Excellency 
before knew, obliged us to embody between two and 
three thousand men in that quarter. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will judge from this state of things, 
and from what you know of your own country, what 
it may probably suffer during the present campaign. 
Should the enemy be able to produce no opportunity 
of annihilating the Marquis's army, a small proportion 
of their force may yet restrain his movements efifectuall}, wliile the greater part is employed in detachment, to waste an unarmed country, and to lead the 
minds of the people to acquiescence under those 
events which they see no human power prepared to 
ward off. We are too far removed from the other 
scenes of war, to say whether the main force of the 
enemy be within this State ; but I suppose they cannot anywhere spare so great an army for the operations of the field. Were it possible for this circumstance to justify, in your Excellency, a determination 
to lend us your personal aid, it is evident, from the 
universal voice, that the presence of their beloved 
countryman, whose talents have been so long successfully employed in establishing the freedom of kindred 
States, to whose person they have still flattered themselves they retained some right, and have ever looked up as their dernier resort in distress, â€” that your 
appearance among them, I say, would restore full 
confidence of salvation, and would render them equal 
to whatever is not impossible. 
</p><p>
I cannot undertake to foresee and obviate the difficulties which stand in the way of such a resolution. 
The whole subject is before you, of which I see only 
detached parts; and your judgment will be formed 
on view of the whole. Should the danger of this 
State and its consequence to the Union be such as 
to render it best for the whole that you should repair 
to its assistance, the difficulty would then be how to 
keep men out of the field. I have undertaken to 
hint this matter to your Excellency, not only on my 
own sense of its importance to us, but at the solicitations of many members of weight in our Legislature, 
which is not yet assembled, to speak their own desires. A few days will bring to me that period of 
relief which the Constitution has prepared for those 
oppressed with the labors of my office ; and a long declared resolution of relinquishing it to abler hands, 
has prepared my way for retirement to a private station. Still, however, as an individual citizen, I should 
feel the comfortable effects of your presence, and have 
(what I thought could not have been), an additional 
motive of that gratitude, esteem and respect with 
which

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
As Captain Fitzhugh goes immediately to headquarters, I can,not omit so good an opportunity of 
acknowledging the receipt of your letter dated about 
three months since, and thanking you for the sentiments of esteem you so warmly express towards me. 
</p><p>
It is unnecessary to repeat the information relating 
to the movements of the enemy in Virginia, as you 
must be acquainted with every particular in an official way. 
</p><p>
You know so much better than I do the causes 
of those misfortunes which have reduced us to our 
present deplorable situation, that I shall not give you 
the pain which a recital of ill-judged measures must 
occasion. I wish past errors may teach us wisdom 
in conducting our future operations. The idea entertained by most people, that the war was near a 
close after the treaty was concluded with France, has 
excluded every proposal for establishing system, and 
continued those temporary expedients, which M'ere introduced at the commencement of the war, and which 
have brought us to the brink of ruin. To recover the 
lost confidence of the people is certainly the first step 
to be taken, and this cannot be done by mere declarations of the Legislature ; we must give every proof 
in our power of our future honest intentions. Acts 
of violence may procure clotliing and provisions for 
the army ; but these are not suflicient to prevent discontents and a general mutiny. We must find money to pay our troops, and this cannot be obtained 
by any other means than such as tend to restore 
public credit ; and how to effect this, the wisest men 
among us are at a loss to determine. We certainly 
have the means in our possession ; but the difficulty 
is to draw them forth. A Committee of the Whole 
House had these great points under consideration for 
several days; and, after" sitting in silence for hours, 
without any one venturing to suggest a remed}, we 
resolved to submit them to a Committee of both 
Houses. With them the matter rests. We have, 
however, passed a law for the seizure of clothing and provisions, and six hundred horses for the army. 
We have resolved to raise, immediately, seven hundred and fifty negroes, to be incorporated with the 
other troops ; and a bill is now almost completed. 
</p><p>
The people, from every information, are generally 
disposed to act with spirit. But the means of extensive opposition is not in our power for [want of] 
armsj and I fear the measures taken to provide fixed 
ammunition will not afford us a timely and necessary suppl} After carrying on a war for six years, 
we might reasonably expect that affairs would be 
conducted with some degree of method; but we have 
derived no advantages from so much experience. 
</p><p>
That the enemy intend to make the Southern 
States the scene of action the ensuing campaign, is 
past a doubt ; and the consequences are easily foreseen, unless considerable reenforcements very soon 
arrive, either from France or the Northern army. 
But with these, I see no prospect of doing any thing 
to effect whilst the enemy have the command of the 
navigation. You know so well the difficulties I al-.. 
lude to, that it is unnecessary to recite them. The 
possession of these States must be of the last importance to the enemy ; because in these they possess 
the tobacco, rice, indigo, and naval stores, which to 
them, perhaps, are more valuable than all the other 
States together. These, too, are separated by a great 
natural line from the other States ; and it appears to 
me more than probable, considering all circumstances, 
that Great Britain finds it impracticable to possess 
themselves of all America, and is now preparing to 
conquer these States, in hopes that the powers of 
Europe, by their interposition, will secure them 
to her. 
</p><p>
You, however, can best determine where your presence is most necessary, nor do I presume to advise, 
being satisfied that whatever you determine upon will 
best promote the public service. But, permit me. Sir, 
to express that my wishes, and the wishes of every 
person with whom I converse, are, that you may 
think it necessary to take the command of the 
Southern army. Your presence, we conceive, may 
create an unanimity and vigor that would relieve us 
from the dangers that threaten us, and that must 
otherwise overwhelm us. 
</p><p>
I have made a tender of my services to the Executive ; but whether they will honor me with a command or not, I shall not remain a distant spectator. 
I have the honor to be, 
</p><p>
With the greatest esteem, &c.,

I was at Count Rochamheau's this evening, when 
I received your Excellency's despatches. General Chastellux was immediately sent for, and the heads 
of departments consulted on the new-intended route 
of the army. The Count inquired whether your Excellency was acquainted with the removal of the 
Yagers, and some other troops, from Long Island to 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. I assured him your Excellency was perfectly acquainted with it, and all the other movements of the enemy at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>; and that your 
Excellency would never undertake a matter of this 
kind, but upon certain intelligence and the surest 
grounds of success. 
</p><p>
The Count was perfectly satisfied with the plan 
proposed, and assured me that duty, as well as inclination, prompted him to comply with your Excellency's wishes. Orders are accordingly given for the 
march of the first brigade in the morning; and the Duke's legion, which is now at New Stratford, will 
undoubtedly march at the same time. It will be 
at the place of destination by the time proposed, 
twelve o'clock. The rest of the army will follow 
when the other division arrives, which comes up tomorrow. The Count, in his letter, wishes an answer

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My health is so much impaired, by long confinement and application, as compels me to retire from 
Congress. I have the pleasure to inform your Excellency, they have elected his Excellency Thomas McKean, to be their President. It also gives me 
much satisfaction, on retiring, to see our public affairs, 
in many respects, wear a more promising aspect than 
heretofore. The enemy, at present, in every part of 
the United States, seem to be reduced to a situation merely on the defensive ; and, should the States 
improve the opportunity with proper and vigorous 
exertions, we have reason to hope, from the smiles 
of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, yet more favorable events. 
</p><p>
The distresses we have suffered from the deranged 
state of our finances begin to be relieved; and the 
arrangements taken by the appointment of a Superintendent of Finance, and the measures he is adopting, give me great encouragement on that most important subject. I am now to take leave of your 
Excellency, with respect to my official correspondence. 
But be assured, Sir, my warmest wishes still continue 
to attend you, that your military operations may be 
prospered and crowned with the most desirable event, 
a speedy and honorable peace, and that you may 
experience many days of tranquillity in the enjoyment of the happy fruits of your important and arduous services in the cause of your country. 
</p><p>
Whatever my future situation in life may be, I shall 
always love my country. In her happiness and prosperity will consist my own, personally. Should my 
state of health permit me the pleasure of waiting 
upon your Excellency (which a few days' journey 
will determine), I shall certainly improve the opportunity on my return to Connecticut. I have the

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The bearer, Mr. Joliii Love clay, informs me that he 
hath had the honor to he recommended to an office 
in your Excellency's family, by some of your friends 
here. I cannot, in justice, deny him my testimony 
of his character. He has been Messenger of the 
Privy Council of our State four or five years, during 
which time he alwajs behaved with the greatest diligence, attention, and secrecy, and he is, your Excellency may be assured, a strictly honest man. He 
was taken by the enemy a few days before <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> capitulated, trusted with some important messages 
from Mr. Rutledge; was immediately closely confined, 
and, when we were shipped off to Augustine, sent 
with us. He is a sober, prudent, discreet man, very 
firm and steady to the cause. 
</p><p>
Sixty-one of us, with our servants, arrived, in two 
small vessels, from Augustine, part about ten or 
twelve, and the remainder about five or six days 
since, thanks to Heaven, all in good health and spirits. We were in Augustine from the 15tli of September to the 17th of last month, forty-two weeks of 
which I was confined in the Castle, and none of my 
friends permitted to see me, because I would not 
give another parole. I told them I had kept the 
first, as a gentleman ; defied, and do still defy them 
to prove the contrary; and was determined never to 
take a second, which would imply a breach of the 
first. Their treatment of me, when taken up the 
27th of August last, was much more severe and 
pointed than against any of my friends, which appears to me more owing to The station I was in. 
than as Mr. Gadsden (though I believe no favorite 
as such); and my not being mentioned in the capitulation gave them an opportunity to affect treating 
me with rigor and contempt. I thought it a duty 
I owed to the general cause to refuse, to the last, 
giving a second parole, that I might be as a standingprotest againt such outrageous, tyrannical conduct. 
</p><p>
When in the Castle, the officers were ordered, frequently, not to converse with me. However, many 
of them often did, and all of them behaved with decency. I never had the least insult offered me there. 
Once, indeed, there was an order against lighting a 
candle, in consequence of which I was without for 
two or three nights ; but the pitifulness of this they 
were soon ashamed of themselves. 
</p><p>
Mr. Ferguson and myself are waiting for our families, expected in a few days. As soon as we see 
them a little fixed, we shall set off for our State, 
as will most of the Carolina gentlemen here. We 
hope to be gone by the middle of next month, at 
farthest. I beg your Excellency's and the public's 
pardon, for taking up so much of your precious time ; 
and am, with the greatest esteem. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
By a vessel from Cadiz last night, we are informed that our Minister at the Spanish Court, as late 
as the 11th June, had made hut little progress in a 
negotiation "with them. They still appear friendly, 
but aim at cessions we cannot make. They give encouragement respecting money at some times j again 
they are disappointed, and cannot promise any thingcertain. They have, however, given Mr. Jay liberty 
to accept bills to the amount of one hundred and 
fifty thousand dollars, but have no known funds appropriated for the payment. In short, their conduct 
appears rather insincere and mysterious. Our public 
despatches are intercepted, or obstructed, insomuch 
that a free correspondence is almost impracticable. 
Mr. Gardoqui was to set off from Madrid for Phila
accordingly taken in his own house by a file of soldiers, and put on 
board a vessel in the harbour. He knew not why he was taken up, 
nor what was intended to be done with him ; but supposed it was 
introductory to a trial for treason or rebellion, as the British gave 
out that the country was completely conquered. He was soon joined 
by twenty-eight compatriots, who were also taken up on the same day. 
He drew from his pocket half a dollar, and turning to his associates, 
with a cheerful countenance, assured them that was all the money 
he had at his command. The conquerors sent him and his companions to St. Augustine, then a British garrison. On their landing, 
limits of some extent were offered to them on condition of their renewing the parole they had given in <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, 'to do nothing injurious to the British interest.' When this was tendered to General Gadsden, he replied, ' that he had already given one, and honorably 
observed it; that, in violation of his rights as a prisoner under capitulation, he had been sent from <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, and that, therefore, he 
saw no use in giving a second parole.' The Commanding Officer 
replied, ' he would enter into no arguments ; but demanded an explicit answer, whether he would or would not renew his parole.' General Gadsden answered, with that high-minded republican spirit, which 
misfortunes could not keep down, â€” ' I will not ; in God I put my 
trust, and fear no consequences.' He was instantly hurried off to the 
Castle, and there confined for ten months in a small room, and in a 
state of complete separation from his fellow-prisoners, and in total 
ignorance of the advantages gained by his countrymen ; but with most 
ample details of their defeats, and particularly of the sequestration 
of his estate, with that of the other Carolina rebels." 
</p><p>
"In the course of <a href='/results.php?year=1781'>1781</a>, the "victories of General Greene procured 
an equivalent for the release of all the prisoners belonging to Soufh 
Carolina. Mr. Gadsden was discharged from close confinement, and 
rejoined his fellow-prisoners. The reciprocal congratulations on the 
change of circumstances, and on seeing each other, after a ten months' 
separation, though in the same garrison, may be more easily conceived 
than expressed. They were all conveyed by water from St. Augustine to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and there delivered. On their arrival they 
were informed, for the first time, of the happy turn American affairs 
had taken subsequent to Gates's defeat. General Gadsden hastened 
back to Carolina to aid in recovering it from the British." Ramsay's 
Histonj of South Carolina, Vol. IT. p. 461. 
obstruct a measure he has much at heart. It has 
been suggested that, if the United States are heard 
by memorial, it would probably answer; but to this 
France does not seem to consent. The Emperor was 
expected in June or July at Paris, on a visit; the 
probable consequence of which is yet in duhio. 
</p><p>
Sweden and Denmark have refused to assist the 
Dutch with ships of war. Russia is undecided. Count 
Panin, the Prime Minister of Russia, is removed. 
Mr. Necker's resignation has been accepted by his 
most Christian Majesty. This great character was not 
agreeable to the Court of Spain, nor to the officers 
at Versailles. He is said to have conducted with too 
much Jiaideiir. 
</p><p>
Out of Admiral Rodney's thirty-four ships, laden 
with the plunder of St. Eustatia, M. Piquet has certainly captured twenty-four ; and it is said that five 
more have been picked up by privateers. The escort, 
consisting of a seventy-four, one sixty-four, and two 
frigates, with five of the convoy, escaped by their 
swiftness in sailing. An expedition was in great forwardness at Cadiz, to consist of eight sail of the line, 
besides frigates, &c., and eight or ten thousand land 
forces, the destination unknown. They were to sail 
in July, and conjectured to be for the West Indies 
or this Continent. 
</p><p>
By a letter from the Marquis de Lafayette, of the 
6th, from Pamunky, we have intelligence that Lord 
Cornwallis, with the fleet formerly mentioned, and an 
addition of whaleboats, carrying the greatest part of 
the British army, have arrived in York River, and 
landed at Gloucester and Yorktown, which they now 
occup} Your Excellency is probably acquainted with 
their situation. However, the Marquis describes the 
one to be a small neck, projected into the river ; the other, suiTOiinded by the river and a morass. General O'llara commands at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>. The Honorable 
Robert R. Livmgston was ajopointed by Congress, on 
Friday last, Secretary of Foreign Affairs. Georgia 
has reestablished her government, and South Carolina 
is expected to be soon in capacity to do the same. 
I am, Sir, with the most respectful attachment.

FROM ROBERT MORRIS AND RICHARD PETERS. 
</p><p>
Camp, 13 <a rel="month origin" value="8">August</a>,  <a href='/results.php?year=1781' rel="origin">1781</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
The orders of Congress, which we have the honor 
to communicate, directing us to confer with your 
Excellency on the subject of the proposed numbers 
and arrangements of the army for the next campaign, 
not having pointed out the reasons inducing the measure, we have the honor to lay before you our ideas 
on the subject, so far as we are acquainted with the 
matter from a conference, at which we were present 
in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, had by a Committee of Congress, the 
subscriber, as Superintendent of Finance, and the Board 
of War, pursuant to a resolution of Congress, with a 
copy of which your Excellency has been furnished. 
</p><p>
After the full conversation with which we were 
honored the 12th ultimo, it is unnecessary to enter at 
large into those reasons, in order to urge the pressing necessity of economizing our affairs, so as to 
make our revenues, in a great degree, meet our expenses. Your Excellency must be equally sensible 
with us of this necessity; and we are perfectly convinced you are equally disposed to assist in every 
measure tending to promote so desirable an object. 
You are also impressed with the impolicy of calling 
on the States for men and money in numbers and 
quantities so extensive as to alarm the timid, and to 
excite among men, the zealous and considerate, ideas 
of the impracticability of carrying on the war upon 
such terms. Demands of this nature, instead of animating to exertions, are only productive of hopeless 
languor. Your mortifying experience of the inadequate compliances heretofore with former demands, will 
explain the motives inducing to the expediency of 
moderating those demands, so as to render them productive, and, in case of failure, to leave the delinquent State without excuse. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency has doubtless considered, that 
the class of men who are willing to become soldiers 
is much diminished by the war, and therefore the 
difficulties of raising an army, equal to former establishments, have increased, and will continue to increase, and embarrass the States in their measures for 
filling up their quotas, should the mode of recruiting 
the army be continued in the line. You will also 
have considered that the enemy, proportionably debilitated by the war, are incapable of opposing to us the 
force we originally had to encounter ; and therefore 
the necessity of such extensive levies as we formerly 
raised, seems to be in some measure superseded. In 
what degree the forces of these States should be decreased, we do not pretend to determine, leaving this 
to your Excellency's better judgment. But from past 
experience, it should seem that the States are incapable of bringing into the field an army equal to that 
called for by the last arrangement. Or, if all the demands of Congress on the States become merely pecuniary, it does not seem probable that they can, or will, furnish money for raising, equipping and supporting, such an army. 
</p><p>
We should he happ}, were we capable from any 
information we are possessed of, to assist your Excellency in the investigation of the subject, with respect 
to the probable designs or force of the enemy the 
next campaign. This must, in its nature, depend upon 
contingencies, at present even beyond conjecture. At 
this time, therefore, in our apprehension, the only 
solid ground of procedure is to consider what forces 
these States, under present circumstances, are capable 
of producing. 
</p><p>
Having thus in general mentioned the ideas which 
have arisen on the subject, we beg to leave the matter to your Excellency's consideration, and take the 
liberty of proposing the following queries, after further mentioning that it has been conceived it would 
be expedient, in case of reform, to lessen the numbers 
of regiments, so as to make fewer commissioned officers necessary, and to increase the numbers of noncommissioned officers and privates in those regiments. 
It has been supposed that a considerable saving would 
ensue from this measure, by not having so many officers in full pay, with their horses, servants, baggage, 
and other consequential expenses in the field, or if 
they remain in quarters from want of command. We 
presume that gentlemen qualified for Staff-Oncers 
might be found among the retiring officers, and that 
artificers and other persons employed by the Staff 
department should not enter into the present calculation, as the officers at the heads of those departments 
should be enabled to carry on their business without taking men from the line; a practice introduced 
from necessity, very prejudicial to discipline, and productive of pernicious consequences by diminishing the 
effective force of the army. 
1st. Is a reduction of the number of officers and 
men, as fixed by the last arrangement of the army, 
expedient or proper? 
</p><p>
2d. How can this reduction be brought about, consistently with the good of the service ; and what arrangement should be made in consequence of this 
reduction ? 
</p><p>
The answers to the above queries will no doubt 
include the numbers of men necessary for the next 
campaign, and the organization of them, so as to designate the number of regiments and the numbers in 
those regiments, both of commissioned and non-commissioned officers and privates, as well regimentally 
as by companies. The expediency of having fewer 
regiments of horse and artillery, and of consolidating 
the independent corps, will also, we presume, come 
under your Excellency's consideration. 
</p><p>
3d. What periods of enlistment, under present circumstances, are most proper to be adopted? 
</p><p>
4th. What regulations can be made to modify the 
practice of taking soldiers from the line, as servants 
to officers ? 
</p><p>
On this head we beg leave to submit to your 
opinion a copy of a motion made in Congress on 
this subject.  
</p><p>
5th. What is to be done with officers by brevet, or 
those who have no particular command ? Can they 
not be placed in the regiments, or retire on half-pay? 
</p><p>
6th. Would it be practicable, consistently with justice and the good of the service, to call into actual 
service officers who have retired on half-pay, by the 
former arrangements, to fill vacancies happening in 
the lines to which they respectively belong? 
We have the honor to be, &c., 
Robert Morris, Superintendent of Finance. 
Richard Peters, Of the Board of War.

FROM PRESIDENT WEARE. 
</p><p>
Hamptx)ii Falls, 13 <a rel="month origin" value="8">August</a>,  <a href='/results.php?year=1781' rel="origin">1781</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I am honored with the receipt of your Excellency's 
favor of the 2d instant, informing me of the deficiency of the levies for the Continental army, and 
that none of the militia had come in from this State; 
and the critical situation you are now in, which most 
sensibly affects me. I have the fullest conviction of 
the necessity of the army being filled up to their 
full complement at this critical period, and the probable fatal consequences of a failure herein, or in 
their being properly supplied. And your Excellency 
may be assured, that no exertions have been wanting on the part of the Executive of the State for 
procuring their full quota of men and supplies. Immediately on the act passing, orders were issued for 
raising the men to complete our quota of the Continental army, and for raising four hundred of the militia, to be held in readiness to march within one 
week after being called for, agreeably to your Excellency's recommendation in your letter from Wethersfield of the 24th of May. 
At that time Continental bills of the new emission 
had a full currency among us, and were the only 
medium we had. No provision was made for raising 
any specie, nor was there any circulating among us. 
Soon after that, from some unaccountable fatality, for 
what reason I cannot comprehend, the Continental 
bills were refused by the people in Massachusetts to 
be taken in payment for any thing, which was soon 
followed by the other neighbouring States, and they 
are now wholly rejected, and the smallest article of 
any kind cannot be purchased with them, so that we 
are wholly destitute of any medium. Hard money we 
have not, nor can we obtain any on any terms. Had 
it not been for this unaccountable and altogether unexpected destruction of our currency, the only one 
we had, I doubt not we should have been able to 
carry the acts fully into effect, excepting in that part 
of the State which, as I mentioned in my letter of 
the 23d of July, under pretence of joining with what 
they call Vermont, have refused to raise men or furnish supplies of any kind. So that there will be a 
deficiency on that account of more than a quarter 
part, both of men and supplies, until Congress, before whom the matter lies, shall determine upon it 
</p><p>
I am not able to give a perfect account of the 
number of recruits that have been raised for fillino; 
up the army. The returns that have been made 
amount to three hundred and twenty, but I have 
had no returns for more than a month past. As to 
the militia, we had not received the least information 
at what time they were to march and join the army, 
until your letter of the 2d instant, by which it appears you had given directions for their joining the 
army by the 15th of last month, which never came 
to hand. And now, by reason of the fatal rejection of the Continental currency, we find it out of our 
power to raise money sufficient to carry them to the 
army. So that the Executive find themselves brought 
to a full stop, unable to proceed any further; and 
thereupon have sent out orders for convening the 
General Assembly as speedily as possible, who are 
to meet on the 22d instant, to consult what measures 
are to be pursued in our present situation. 
</p><p>
It is with anxious concern that I am oblio-ed to 
give your Excellency this information of our present 
situation. I will still hope that some method may 
be found out to extricate us from our present embarrassments, with respect to a medium. As our militia 
cannot march until the General Assembly meet, I 
wiU ask the favor of a line from you, as soon as 
may be, whether it will be of advantage to forward 
them at that late period. I have the honor to be, 
with every sentiment of respect.

</p><p>
I feel a real satisfaction, my dear General, in having it once more in my power to address you without the restraints that are imposed by captivity, and 
assure you that neither absence nor misfortunes have, 
in the smallest degree, abated the attachment and 
friendship I have so long borne you. I will not 
Avound your humanity by a relation of the many 
hardships and unmanly insults we have sustained 
from British officers, and new-made subjects, during 
our confinement ; nor shall I lament that we have 
suffered, if our sufferings, and the firmness which I 
trust we have shown in the midst of apparent evils, 
can be converted into real blessings, by animating my 
countrymen to a sense of their duty, and convincing 
them that their only resource for happiness is in a 
freedom from British government. 
</p><p>
The Congress seem disposed to avail themselves of 
our late situation, and have desired that we will furnish them with an authentic account of the conduct 
of the enemy, from the surrender of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> to 
the time of our exchange, with a view, as we are 
told, of retaliating. But, to particularize one half of 
their cruelty and injustice, is beyond the reach of 
human labor. However, their most flagrant and atrocious acts of violence and oppression will be pointed 
out J and if the Congress should retain their present 
sentiments, they will soon possess materials, not only 
to justify, but to require and exact (if I may use a 
British officer's expression) "retaliation with a vengeance." Yet I imagine they have too much of the 
milk of human kindness in their composition to bear 
them through this painful, though necessary business. 
Indeed, warmed as I am by my own sufferings, and 
by what is of infinitely greater consequence, I mean 
the sufferings of my friends, I am persuaded I myself shall not be able to do moderate justice to the 
injured. 
</p><p>
I find, by letters which were yesterday received 
from General Greene, that he is extremely anxious 
to have a civil government established in South Carolina. It is certainly a desirable object, but I hope 
it will not be attempted until General Wayne shall 
arrive with his troops in that State. To proceed to 
an election, without enabling such of the militia as 
are in the field to attend, would give vast advantage to the clisafFected and timid; and to withdraw the 
friends of the State from the field would be to expose the Continentals, whom I consider as the stamina of the army, to essential injury. Indeed, our 
country is, and has so long been, in a disjointed condition, that I really believe we shall have the whole 
business of civil government to go over. However, 
we must take " perseverance " for our motto, our 
crest, and arms, and we shall soon see, I hope, an 
end of our labors. I myself shall not be able to go 
to the southward until the latter end of September, 
at soonest. A constitution, naturally feeble, has of 
late years received very many shocks. I would therefore wish to remain in this part of the world until 
I could have a share of new health infused into it, 
as well on account of my country as of my friends 
and family. Yet, before I take a journey to my own 
State, I shall embrace the favorable opportunity which 
I possess, of paying my respects at head-quarters, 
and of assuring you, in person, how truly I am, my 
dear General, 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate friend and humble servant,

Edward Rutledge.

I had the honor of receiving your Excellency's

me. But I am sorry to acquaint your Excellency

much fear will fall short of your expectations. However, I hope to have between twenty and thirty sail

Sir, 
</p><p>
We are honored by your Excellency's letter of the 27th; and we receive, with the greatest satisfaction, 
the intelligence of the approach of the fleet of our 
generous ally. You may rely. Sir, on every exertion 
that is possible for us to make, to accelerate the 
movements of the army on an expedition, the success 
of which must hasten the establishment of the independence of America, and relieve us from many of 
the calamities of war. 
</p><p>
Orders have been issued for the impressing of 
every vessel belonging to the State, and forwarding 
them without delay to the Head of Elk. But we are 
sorry to inform your Excellency that, since the enemy 
has had possession of the Bay, our number of seavessels and craft has been so reduced by captures, 
that we are apprehensive what remains will not transport so considerable a detachment. We have directed 
the State officers to procure immediately, by purchase 
or seizure, five thousand head of cattle and a large 
quantit} of flour. There is very little salt provision 
in the State, but what can be obtained we trust will 
be collected. Part of the provision will be deposited 
at the Head of Elk, <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a> Town, and <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>. 
Most of the cattle will be kept in good pastures not 
far distant from the Bay and rivers, so that they 
may with ease be forwarded to any point where they 
may be required. We have directed sufficient quantities of forage to be laid in at the Head of Elk, 
<a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a> Town, and <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>, for the use of the 
army. The third regiment, consisting of about six 
hundred men, and under the command of Colonel 
Adams, marched from this city last Tuesday ; and 
about seven hundred of the new levies, now here, will 
move in a few days. Every aid that can be given 
Mr. Morris will be afforded with the utmost cheerfulness and alacrity. We have the honor to be, with 
the highest personal respect and esteem, your Excellency's

At a time like this, when your Excellency's every

America, I know you can have but little leisure for 
letters. If the feelings of my heart will not 
permit me to be silent, I cannot avoid congratulating 
your Excellency on the present favorable appearance 
of our affairs. I cannot avoid telling your Excellency 
how much I wish you success, and how much I wish 
that the state of my health woiikl permit me to afford my small services on this great occasion. Such 
has been my peculiar fate, that, during the whole 
course of the present war, I have never on any important event had the honor of serving under your 
Excellency. It is a misfortune I have ever sincerely 
lamented. There is nothing on earth would have 
given more real pleasure, than to have made this

the dangers, and let me add, the glory too, which I

such parts of the Southern States as are now invaded by the enemy. He recommends me to transmit 
him the information I shall be able to procure on 
this subject, with the greatest secrecy and despatch, 
that he may speedily determine on the ultimate plan 
of his operations ; and I am authorized to send him 
an advice-ship, if I can find no immediate opportunity for the Havana. I have thought it indispensably necessary to despatch immediately an express to 
your Excellency, to lay before you the dispositions 
of General Galvez, and entreat you to put it in my 
power to send him such intelligence as may enable 
him to form effectual plans to press the enemy on all 
sides, and bring them sooner to the terms of an honorable peace, which is a common object to us all. 
</p><p>
Inclosed I have the honor to transmit to your 
Excellency a copy of a letter from the same General to Admiral Count de Grasse, respecting the capitulation of Pensacola. I am happy thereby to have it in 
my power to convince you that the friendly disposition of the Spanish towards America is by no means 
altered, and that they have at heart the success of 
these United States as much as their own. 
</p><p>
I beg your Excellency will detain the express as 
little as possible. I have the honor to be, with the 
greatest respect, Sir, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and most humble servant,

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 
</p><p>
(Private.)

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor of writing last to your Excellency 
on the 2Gth of September. Since that time we have 
had letters from Mr. Adams, at Paris, on the loth 
of July, and from Amsterdam on the 3d of August. 
They confirm what I wrote you last. 
</p><p>
On Monday, the rear of the fleet that sailed from 
England with Admiral Digby arrived at Sandy Hook. 
It consists of thirty-four transports, under convoy of 
a ship of forty guns and three frigates. No more, it 
is said, are expected. This information I received late 
last night, from Mr. David Forman, of Freehold. Admiral Graves will, it is believed, make a second at 
tempt to relieve Lord Cornwallis. He is making every 
preparation for that purpose, and it is thought will 
proceed for the Chesapeake immediately. It may be 
well to apprise Count de Grasse of this, without delay. 
</p><p>
Sir Henry Clinton sent off three boats with despatches for Lord Cornwallis. One, named the Andre, 
carrying a brass six-pounder in her bow, eight blun- derlbiisses, and twenty men armed â– witli muskets, sailed on the 26tli of September last ; the second sailed 
on the 28th; and the third, on the 1st instant. We 
have taken the two last; and by means of a little 
address and a promise of pardon to a Tory, who was 
intrusted with one set of despatches, I found it was 
hid on the beach where he was taken. I have procured three gentlemen of ingenuity and fidelity to 
proceed to Little Egg Harbour with the fellow, in 
quest of it. The beach is so extensive, and so many 
places like each other, that it is not yet found, 
though the man is believed to be perfectly sincere 
in his wishes to recover it. The gentlemen went 
from this on Sunday, and I expect their return tomorrow. You shall know the result as soon as they 
arrive. In the mean time, the boat which first sailed 
should be looked for by the fleet. I have written to 
the Presidents of Delaware and the Eastern Shore 
of Maryland to watch for her. 
</p><p>
We shall be obliged to complete Colonel Arm.and's 
legion, and I despair of doing it with Americans, if 
all the Eield-Officers are French gentlemen. There is 
now a vacancy, by the resignation of the Major ; and 
if the Colonel would approve of Captain Allen McLean, who is now on half-pay, to be his Major, it 
would save the half-pay, oblige a very deserving 
officer, be a means of speedily filling his corps, and 
greatly tend to the public benefit. I should be happy 
if you and the Colonel were of this opinion. 
</p><p>
Captain Gilland is said to be arrived in the frigate 
Charlestown in Casco Bay. He has clothing. &c., 
for Congress, to the amount of ten thousand pounds 
sterling and upwards, and I believe a million and a 
half of livres. It is a fortunate arrival, and I sincerely congratulate you upon it ; for I now flatter 
myself your army will be well clothed and paid in future. 
</p><p>
The express delivered your favor of the 1st instant 
only last night; it shall be laid before Congress this 
morning. I have the honor to be, with the greatest 
esteem, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I arrived at this place early on Wednesday morning, although I lost one whole night's run by the 
stupidity of the skipper, who got over upon the Tangier Shoals, and was a whole day crossing, in a calm, 
from <a href='/results.php?city=annapolis' rel='city'>Annapolis</a> to Rock Hall. The wind left me entirely on Sunday evening, thirty miles below <a href='/results.php?city=annapolis' rel='city'>Annapolis</a>. I found that a letter from Count de Grasse to 
Governor Lee, dated the 18th, had gone forward to 
Congress, in which the Count informed the Governor 
that Cornwallis had then surrendered. This made me 
the more anxious to reach <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, as I knew 
both Congress and the public would be uneasy at 
not receiving despatches from you. I was not wrong 
in my conjecture, for some really began to doubt the 
matter. The fatigue of the journey brought back my 
intermittent fever, with which I have been confined 
almost ever since I came to town. 
</p><p>
A Committee, consisting of Mr. Randolph, Mr. Carroll, and Mr Boudinot, were appointed to inquire of 
me the several matters of a particular kind, which 
were not included in your despatches. They not only 
went into these, but into the motives which led to 
the several articles of the capitulation. And I have 
the pleasure to inform you, that they were perfectly 
satisfied with the propriety and expediency of every 
step which was taken ; and so, indeed, were the whole 
body of Congress, except the South Carolinians, whose 
animosities carry them to that length, that they think 
no treatment could have been too severe for the garrison, the officers, and Lord Cornwallis in particular. 
</p><p>
One of them, whose name I will mention when I have 
the pleasure of meeting your Excellency, made a motion that the officers should be detained until the further order of Congress. This was unanimously rejected, as an affront upon you, a violation of the capitulation, a violation of our national honor, and that of 
our ally, whose Admiral and General were parties. 
Upon the whole, Sir, you may be assured that the 
capitulation is considered by every unbiased person, 
both in and out of Congress, as highly honorable to 
the arms, and beneficial to the interests, of both nations. 
</p><p>
I shall set out, as soon as I am well enough to 
ride, to Chestertown, at which place I propose waiting 
until I hear the route which your Excellency intends 
to take. You will, therefore, be good enough to let 
one of the gentlemen direct a line for me, to the care 
of Governor Lee, with a desire to send it immediately 
over to Rock Hall, where I will leave orders to have 
it forwarded to me. I can, by making use of this 
little interval, pay a short visit to my friends, and 
look into my private affairs, which much want my 
inspection. 
</p><p>
Whenever I am acquainted with your determination, 
I shall, without delay, join you. I am too much air 
tached, by duty and affection, to remain a moment 
behind, when I think my presence can render any 
service or assistance to your Excellency. I beg you 
to be assured that I am, with the utmost sincerity, 
your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
Tench Tilghman.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have the honor of transmitting to your Excellency a copy of an Act of Congress of the 7th instant, for your information and satisfaction. Your 
Excellency's letters of the 27th and 31st ultimo have 
been received, and laid before Congress. 
</p><p>
As this is the first opportunity I have had of 
writing to your Excellency, since Congress were pleased to elect me to the singular honor of being their 
President, and as a literary correspondence, from our 
natural situations, becomes indispensably necessary between us, give me leave to assure you, Sir, that it 
will not only be a pleasure of a superior nature, but 
invariably my study, to render that correspondence 
as advantageous and agreeable as possible. Any intelligence worth communicating, which first reaches 
me, shall be related with unreserved freedom, candor, 
and punctuality. And permit me to hope for a similar treatment from your Excellency. Already my 
knowledge of your character leads me to anticipate 
infinite satisfaction. 
</p><p>
I cannot avoid mentioning, that the present aspect 
of our public affairs is particularly pleasing ; so much 
do we seem extricated from our perplexing difficulties, and such hope in the power and force of recent 
experience, that we shall not relapse into our former 
state of imbecility and distress. 
</p><p>
The events of the present campaign will no doubt 
fill the most brilliant pages in the history of America. 
</p><p>
May heaven still continue to smile on our efforts ! 
With the highest sentiments of respect and esteem, 
believe me to be, Sir,

</p><p>
My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My sincerest thanks to you for your friendly congratulations on my promotion to the Government. 
Indeed, my friend, if you knew my true situation, 
and that of this country, you would rather condole 
with me. When I accepted the appointment, I knew 
I had innumerable difficulties to encounter; yet I undertook the task with the hope of surmounting them, 
not with a view of serving myself For there is nothing to be got by it in the best of times; but in 
these, certain loss will attend it. I meant to serve 
the State, and the common cause. I had vanity 
enough to think I could do this better than those 
who were opposed to me. But my hopes and expectations are all blasted by the conduct of the Assembly. What powers there were in the Executive 
are done away, and restrictions substituted in their 
room. Much is required of me, and no means left of doing even little. The eves of the world are fixed 
on me ; it knows not my situation and embarrassments, and therefore expects much. When disappointment takes place, what reputation I had gained, I 
may say by a life of public services, will be lost ; nay 
more, I shall be brought even into contempt. I feel 
this in every nerve ; it tingles in every vein, and almost destroys the very faculty of thinking, whenever 
I begin to contemplate the subject. 
</p><p>
As this is a melancholy theme, at least to me, I 
will quit it, but not before I tell you, however situated, I will not let despondency overwhelm me; but 
will endeavour to merit applause if I cannot attain 
it. The Assembly had risen long before your favor got to hand, and they will not meet again till the 
first Monday in May next. My endeavours shall not 
be wanting to stimulate them to raise the men required by Congress. I think they may be had, with 
money and clothes. But as to the money demanded, 
assure yourself it is absolutely impossible ; there is 
not half the sum in the State. 
</p><p>
I have adopted a mode of my own to endeavour 
to procure men, by calling on the principal persons 
in each county to open a subscription for a sum to 
furnish the bounty, for which they are to have credit in their taxes, with an allowance of interest at 
the rate of ten per cent, per annum for the time it 
shall be advanced. I expect some good from it, 
though, I confess, not a great deal. When I was in 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, I negotiated a loan to the State of a 
variety of clothing, &c., with the Chevalier Luzerne. 
The King of France has nobly complied with my request, and I expect we shall have them in three or 
four months. But, as the regulations of Congress now 
stand, if we put them on the backs of our soldiers, 
we are not to have credit for them out of the money 
demanded from us. This I think strange, and wish 
an alteration ; but would not desire, by any means, 
that Congress should be made acquainted with the 
circumstances of the loan. I suppose I shall be told, 
if I deliver them to the Financier's order I shall get 
credit ; but this I never can agree to, as, in that 
case, our poor fellows would never see them. I think 
they have not received any thing of the kind from 
the Continent since they went to the southward, as 
about three or four hundred of them returned, the 
other day, almost naked. This has so frequently been 
the case, that I am confident it is one great cause of 
the difficulty we find in raising men; for, when the 
subject of clothes is mentioned to a young fellow, he 
instantly points out several that have returned almost naked. 
</p><p>
How comes it about that I see contracts advertised 
for, to feed the troops from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> to Maryland, inclusive, and no attempt of the sort made to the 
southward ? Scan this matter, my friend, and tell me 
if there is not partiality in this. You may depend, 
if the same steps are not taken here that are taken 
in other States, it will create great disturbance. This 
Government has not the means of furnishing troops, 
and, therefore, must be assisted till it can. You will 
see, by the inclosed, the situation of the British sick 
in Gloucester. ' We have taken no step in it yet, nor 
can do any thing till we see the Continental Commissary. I expect he will tell us he has no means, 
and I am sure we have so little that much cannot 
be expected. I, from my heart, pity the poor fellows, 
and will do what I can for their relief General Nelson's resignation was occasioned by ill health ; at least 
this was the reason he gave, though I think this was 
not the only one. He met with very unmerited treatment in many instances. I am, my dear Sir, with 
every sentiment of esteem and friendship, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and most humble servant,

Benjamin Harrison.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
You will do me a great deal of pleasure, if you can make it convenient to yourself to spend part of 
an evening at my apartments, and eat a few oysters, 
or a crust of bread and cheese ; for, besides the favor 
you will do me, I want much to consult with you on 
a matter of public business, though of a secret nature, 
which I have already mentioned to Mr. Morris, whom 
I likewise intend to ask, as soon as yourself shall 
please to mention the evening when. 
</p><p>
Though it is impossible to find out what the British will do by finding what they ought to do, yet 
I have been turning over in my mind the circumstances connected with the probable evacuation of 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, in order to come at their line of policy 
on that measure ; and, as it is a rainy morning, with 
no inducement to go out, and I am sitting at leisure, 
I will take the liberty of communicating them to you. 
</p><p>
First. The foundation of the measure, as well as of 
the (now) general opinion, is, that, if they cannot reenforce, they must evacuate. 
</p><p>
Secondly. That being a Ministerial post. General Clinton must wait either for positive or discretionary 
orders. 
</p><p>
Thirdly. That, as it is now a losing game, I am 
much inclined to believe the Ministry will only give 
discretionary orders. 
</p><p>
Fourthly. That, as Clinton sees the Ministry are 
pushing the matter off their own shoulders on him, 
he has likewise pushed it from himself upon a Council of War; and this I take to have been the subject 
of debate, and not whether <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> or <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> should be evacuated, as mentioned in General Heath's information. 
</p><p>
Fifthly. That orders to prepare for evacuation have 
been sent, and probably have been accompanied with 
instructions not to do it till further orders, unless the 
Commanding Officer at <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> sees necessity. 
</p><p>
Sixthly. But, while these matters were acting, a 
new circumstance has arisen, not at that time known, 
which is the miscarriage of Count de Guichen (whose 
sailing probably produced, in a principal degree, the 
discretionary instructions from the Ministry), and the 
sailing of Admiral Rodney, by which he will be first 
in the West Indies ; and as <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> will, from these 
two events, be safe for a longer time, I think it is 
probable that the evacuation will be delayed. 
</p><p>
Now all this reasoning may be wrong, because they 
act without reason. I am your Excellency's 
Obliged and obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
Thomas Paine.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
Colonel Smith delivered your Excellency's letter 
of the 28th, between four and five yesterday afternoon. You mention having had intimations that, under the idea of the cessation of hostilities, a number 
of people . intend to come over from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to 
our lines ; and express your particular desire, that 
no persons coming from the enemy may be permitted to land, except the Commissioners and those immediately connected with them. The bad weather 
of yesterday prevented those gentlemen from coming 
hither, and we expect them to-day. We have desired Captain Dayton to suffer no persons to land, 
except those who come in the vessel with the Commissioners ; presuming that this is the best line of 
distinction which can at present be drawn. 
</p><p>
We are much inclined to doubt the truth of the 
information your Excellency has received. The situation of the enemy is such as would naturally induce 
caution in permitting persons to come hither, whose 
discretion, as well as fidelity, they are not perfectly 
assured of And when our relative circumstances are 
considered, it must be evident that a reciprocal communication would probably preponderate in our favor. 
Facts, as far as they have come to our knowledge, 
justify this reasoning; and there is an additional force 
derived to it, from the consideration that they have 
had, and (until regulations are made, which neither 
Congress nor their servants are entirely competent 
to) will have, a constant intercourse with this country, while we cannot derive that benefit from it which 
we now may, by having here characters in whom we 
can confide, such as Colonel Ogden. 
</p><p>
There are several persons, whom we may perhaps 
see here, and whom it is of infinite importance to 
see ; but who would be suspected on admittance, 
after a strong line of discrimination had been drawn. 
We have, for instance, a strong probability of gaining 
some of the enemy's pilots. One of the best of them, 
whose name is Morris, was unfortunately taken prisoner the day before yesterday, and will come from 
Brunswick this day. On the whole, we beg leave to 
submit it to your Excellency, whether it might not 
be better to wink at an intercourse from which we 
may now derive benefit, and which will at other times 
subsist to our prejudice. If, however, your Excellency should be of a different opinion, we will rigidly 
comply with your wishes as far as possibly we ca,n. 
We shall write to your Excellency upon the other 
subjects of your letter by Colonel Smith, who will 
wait here for the purpose. We have the honor to 
be, with great respect, your Excellency's

Ellzabetlitown, IG <a rel="month origin" value="4">April</a>,  <a href='/results.php?year=1782' rel="origin">1782</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
General Forman, who is now on his way to you 
with a representation on the hanging of Captain Buddy by the refugees, will have the honor of delivering your Excellency this letter. Previous to the General's arrival, we had heard of this matter, although 
not so particularly. We mentioned it to General Dalrymple and Mr. Elliot. They seemed to be surprised and wounded at the information, and assured 
us of their conviction that the deed had been perpetrated, not only without the order of Sir Henry Clinton, but without his knowledge. We should now 
make a representation on the subject in form, but are 
induced to think, that, as it will have far greater 
weight, so it will come with more propriety from your 
Excellency to General Clinton. 
</p><p>
We have not, in any instance, made a direct and 
formal written inquiry, as to the Board of Refugees, 
conceiving that the event of the business committed 
to us would have rendered it unnecessary. In conversation, however, they have been often mentioned. 
</p><p>
They are, it seems, appointed by, and correspond 
with, the British Ministry. Their agents are commissioned by Sir Henry Clinton. They act by their 
own authority, under sufferance of the British Commander-in-chief, but subordinate to his authority, if he 
pleases to exert it. 
</p><p>
We did expect that our business would have terminated yesterday, but it seems that they have something to propose this day. Should we not finish immediately. Colonel Smith will go hence to-morrow 
morning and carry our proceedings. Should we finish 
this day or to-morrow, we shall make up our report 
as soon as possible, and transmit it by the Colonel. 
We have the honor to be, with great respect. Sir,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I now do myself the honor of particularly addressing myself to answer your Excellency's letter of the 
6th instant. While the whole world must applaud 
your Excellency's resolution of retaliating for the barbarous murder committed upon Captain Huddy, which 
is in favor of humanity, by its tendency to prevent 
the like cruelties, this State, of which he was a good 
citizen and a brave soldier, is particularly obliged to your Excellency for your zeal and exertions upon that occasion. 
</p><p>
Utterh'- divesting myself of- all local attachments, 
and of every possible prejudice in favor of New Jersey, I really do not recollect that the militia of this 
State, or any other of its citizens, have ever committed against a prisoner of war any act of cruelty, or 
treated such prisoner, in any instance, contrary to 
the laws of arms. Sure I am that I should discountenance the practice to the utmost of my power; and 
all that prevents me from issuing the most positive 
orders against it is, that such orders would either imply the previous practice, or be ranked with the folly 
of a Legislator, who should enact laws for punishing 
a crime that had never been committed. If the enemy complain of any cruel treatment from our militia 
towards their prisoners, they ought, like all other accusers, to produce their proof, and then, I am persuaded that they will not complain in vain, as they 
well know that we have done to this very moment. 
</p><p>
Respecting your Excellency's inquiry concerning 
the circumstances of the capture of Hatfield and 
Badgely, and the causes of their detention, I inclose 
a copy of Chief Justice Brearley's letter to me on 
that subject; and have the honor to be, with the 
greatest esteem, your Excellency's

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
Considering the various and important objects of 
your Excellency's constant attention, it is with the 
greatest reluctance I prevail upon myself to engage 
it a single moment by any thing not of some immediate public consequence. Yet such is my present 
situation, that I flatter myself your Excellency will 
pardon my freedom in requesting your attention to it. 
</p><p>
On the 11th of March last, I sailed from Cadiz, 
and was taken by an English frigate on the 25th of 
the month following. At <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, I was committed 
to the Provost, and continued in it until the arrival 
of Sir Guy Carleton, who liberated me on parole. 
Having been absent from America on furlough, without exceeding the term thereof, and having a Lieutenant-Colonel's commission in my pocket, I did not 
think there could be any impropriety in signing a 
parole as such, and in being exchanged accordingly. 
But on perusing the journals of Congress, I find, by 
resolutions passed the 31st of December, <a href='/results.php?year=1781'>1781</a>, and 
21st of January, <a href='/results.php?year=1782'>1782</a>, that I am among those officers who are considered as retiring from service on 
half-pay the first day of the present year. Those resolves your Excellency will readily believe I must 
have been a perfect stranger to, at the time of my 
capture, neither of them having had time to reach 
Madrid when I came away, which was on the 7th of 
February last. This circumstance will, I trust, exculpate me from any censure, and will induce your 
Excellency to permit me to be considered as a Lieutenant-Colonel in any future exchange, agreeably to 
the tenor of my parole. 
</p><p>
I cannot conclude, without taking notice of that 
part of Sir Guy Carleton's first letter to your Excellency, in which he appears to make a merit of my 
enlargement, and to think himself entitled, therefor, 
to some return on the part of your Excellency. Lest 
this circumstance may induce a suspicion that some 
part of my conduct, while in confinement, may have 
given the enemy reason to believe that I considered 
my liberation in the light of a favor, or took improper steps to obtain it, I think it incumbent on me to 
lay before your Excellency a narrative of what passed 
on that occasion. 
</p><p>
Immediately on landing at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, JNIr. Sproat 
informed me, on the part of General Robertson, that 
I was to be confined in the Provost, and Mr. ChiefJustice Smith was sent thither to apologize for my 
being treated in that manner. I told Mr. Smith, that 
throwing a person into a common jail, merely on suspicion of his being the hearer of important despatches, appeared to me an unprecedented and a 
very extraordinary measure ; hut that, as it could 
answer no purpose to enter into an altercation with 
him, I should write to General Robertson himself on 
the subject. And, on pen, ink, and paper being 
brought me, I wrote him a letter of which the inclosed is a copy. 
</p><p>
In answer thereto, the General sent me a polite 
message by Major Wemyss, the purport of which 
was, that "reasons of state rendered my confinement 
necessary, but that I might rest assured it would be 
of very short duration." The Major concluded by 
apologizing for my not receiving a written answer, 
the General's time being wholly engrossed by very 
pressing business. Major Wemyss had scarcely retired, when Captain Cunningham, the Provost-Marshal, 
mentioned to me, for the first time, Lippencott's situation, and what had passed between your Excellency 
and Sir Henry Clinton on that subject. He did not 
seem to speak from authority, but gave me to understand, as politely as he could, that it might be 
well for me to interest myself on the occasion, as it 
was impossible to say to what lengths retaliation 
might be carried, in case your Excellency should 
execute the threat you had thrown out. I was not 
then apprised of all the circumstances relative to 
the murder of Captain Huddy; but, had I been a 
total stranger to your Excellency's character, Cunningham's own state of the matter must have convinced me of the perfect propriety of your requisition. I told him so, and (after laughing at the idea 
of any interest of mine or of my friends being sufficient to induce your Excellency to recede from so 
just a demand) promised to comply with his request, 
provided he would first engage to transmit to your 
Excellency whatever I might think jDroper to write 
on the matter. He replied, General Robertson must 
first see it. This convinced me it would be useless 
to write, from a certainty that my letter would not 
correspond with his wishes, and, of course, not be 
forwarded. I sat down, however, and wrote what is 
inclosed to my father. 
</p><p>
I had now determined to make no further application to General Robertson ; nor did I hear any thing 
more from head-quarters until the arrival of Sir Guy 
Carleton, who sent for me without my applying to 
him, either verbally or by letter. On being introduced to his Excellency, he informed me, in the presence of Mr. Smith, of his being much surprised at 
hearing of my confinement, and very happy to have 
it in his power so soon to put a period to it. Without leaving time to reply, he acquainted me with his 
intention to send his Secretary with a complimentary 
letter to Congress ; and begged of me, in order to facilitate Mr. Morgan's journey, to accept of a seat in 
his carriage. After thanking him for his attention, I 
asked whether Mr. Morgan had permission from Congress or your Excellency to proceed to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>; 
and, on being answered in the negative, told him 
that I recollected Mr. Ferguson's having been stopped 
on a like errand for want of such passport, and that 
Mr. Morgan would probably be obliged to return, 
should he undertake the journey without one. He 
said, the idea was perfectly new to him. He did not 
conceive any necessity of a flag's being furnished 
with a passport; and, if so in Mr. Ferguson's case, 
my going with his Secretary must supersede that 
necessity in the present one. I observed to him, that 
his Excellency must allow that there was a wide difference between sending a military flag to an outpost of our army, and sending a person, in Mr. Morgan's character, through so great a part of the country, to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>; and that without such a pass I must beg leave to decline the pleasure I should otherwise derive from travelling in that gentleman's company. 
</p><p>
Sir Guy then proposed that the Secretary and myself should go together; and, in case of the former 
being stopped, I was to proceed with his despatches 
to Congress. This also I refused, telling him that, as 
it was probable liis letters contained some overtures, 
I could not consent to charge myself with them, unless his Excellency would assure me they contained 
an acknowledgment of our independence, or a promise to withdraw their fleets and armies ; that these 
were the only terms on which Congress had agreed 
to open a treaty in' <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>, and that it was not probable they would listen to any thing short thereof 
now. He seemed somewhat surprised, and, after a 
little hesitation, assured me, upon his honor, that he 
was vested with no such powers; that his intended 
letter to Congress was a matter of mere compliment; 
but if there was any danger of Mr. Morgan's meeting with difficulties, he would postpone his journey 
until he could hear from your Excellency on the 
subject. 
</p><p>
This closed our conversation for that day. The 
next morning, agreeably to his desire, 1 waited on 
Mm again. He received me very politely, talked 
much of the King's pacific dispositions, of his own 
earnest desire of an honorable peace, of his wishes to 
carry on the war, while it did prevail, more consonant 
to the dictates of humanity than heretofore. He was 
persuaded of meeting with corresponding sentiments in your Excellency; that both countries were interested in supporting the British character; that; if 
England and America must separate, it would be 
their mutual interest to part like men of honor, and 
in good humor with each other. After a great deal 
more, to the same purpose, he informed me a barge 
was ready to take me to <a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a>. He then 
put into my hands a letter for my father, some English prints, with a few copies of the Bill, and of the 
votes of the House of Commons, which he said should 
be transmitted to your Excellency by another flag. 
After signing a parole, I took my leave. 
</p><p>
I hope your Excellency will forgive my having 
been so very prolix on this occasion, as nothing but 
an idea of its being my duty has led me to be circumstantial in every thing that passed between the 
Commander-in-chief and myself during my captivity 
in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. I have the honor to be, with the 
highest respect, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
Henry Brockholst Livingston.

<p>
FROM JAMES MONROE. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>Richmond</a>, 15 <a rel="month origin" value="8">August</a>,  <a href='/results.php?year=1782' rel="origin">1782</a>. 
</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
You will pardon the liberty I take in writing to 
you upon a subject, which has no relation to the 
public interest, when I inform you I am induced 
thereto merely from a principle of gratitude, to make 
acknowledgment for the personal service I have received from your Excellency. The introduction you 
gave me some time since to this State, for the purpose of attaining some military appointment, to place 
me in the service of my country, in a line with those 
worthy citizens with whom common hardship and 
danger had nearly connected me, although it failed in 
that instance, has availed me in another line. 
</p><p>
Upon relinquishing my military pursuits, which I 
did with reluctance, and returning to those studies in 
which I had been engaged previous to my joining 
the army, till of late I have been literally a recluse. 
Having gone through that course, which, in the opinion of Mr. Jefferson, to whom I submitted the direction of my studies, was sufficient to qualify me in 
some degree for public business, in my application to 
my country in the first instance, and in the subsequent appointment of the Assembly to the Executive 
Council of the State, I have had the pleasure to experience your friendly letter in my favor, of essential 
service to me. If, therefore, I was so fortunate in 
the management of my conduct more immediately under your eye, as to gain your good opinion and esteem, I flatter myself that, in the discharge of the 
duties of my present office, and a faithful observance 
and attention to the confidence reposed in me by my 
country, I shall take no step which vill entitle me 
to forfeit theirs, or give you cause to repent your 
prepossession in my favor. A consciousness that I 
had, in some degree, merited your approbation, and 
that of the gentlemen of the army with whom I had 
the honor to associate, gave me a consolation and a 
pleasure in my subsequent retirement (though wounded 
and chagrined at my disappointment from the State), 
which I could not have derived from any other 
source. If, in the line of my present appointment, 
fortune should put it in my power to pay attention 
to, or obey in any instance, your Excellency's commands, believe me she could not confer a favor on 
me I should receive with greater pleasure from her 
hands. 
</p><p>
With every sentiment of respect and esteem, with 
which your great and unwearied service to your 
country, and your kind and friendly attention to me, 
can fill my breast, I have the honor to be, your 
Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
James Monroe. 
</p>
