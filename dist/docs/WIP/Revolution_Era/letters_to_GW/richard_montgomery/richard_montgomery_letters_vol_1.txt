DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I take the opportunity of Fulmore's return with the Oneidas, 
to acquaint you of our arrival here on the 17th, in the evening. 
Yesterday, I marched, with five hundred men, to the north side 
of <a href='/results.php?city=st johns' rel='city'>St. John's</a>, where we found a party of the King's troops, with 
field-pieces. This party had beaten off Major Brown f a few 
hours before, who had imprudently thrown himself in their way, 
depending on our more early arrival, which, through the dilatoriness of our young troops, could not be sooner effected. The 
enemy, after an ill-directed fire for some minutes, retired with 
precipitation ; and lucky for them they did, for had we known 
their situation, which the thickness of the woods prevented our 
finding out till it was too late, not a man of them would have 
returned. The old story of treachery spread among the men; as 
soon as we saw the enemy, we were trepanned, drawn under the 
guns of the fort, and what not. The woodsmen % were not so Expert at forming as I expected, and too many of them hung back ; 
had we kept silence at first, before we were discovered, we should 
have got a field-piece or two. 
</p><p>
I have left the five hundred men at the joining of the two 
roads ; this day I have sent them intrenching tools. 
</p><p>
Things seem to go on well among the Canadians. It is 
strongly reported, that the King's stores are embarked at <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, in order to be removed. I have sent Colonel Allen to 
Chamblee, in order to raise a corps. Send me money as fast as 
possible, my dear General. Guy Johnson and Claws have represented us as beggarly miscreants, who have nothing to give away 
to the Indians, nor to pay for what we get. Fulmore will give you an account of our Council. 
</p><p>
I have great dependence on your presence, to administer to our many wants. 
</p><p>
I most earnestly hope this will find you relieved from the 
acuteness of your pain ; a perfect cure, in so short a time, can 
hardly be expected. Believe me, dear Sir, with the fullest esteem and respect, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
P. S. On the 17th, at night, Major Brown intercepted eight 
carts going to the fort, laden with rum and gun-carriages for the 
vessel ; these things were hid in the woods, and were not recovered by the enemy on Brown's discomfiture.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Since my last of the 24th, we have opened a battery of two 
twelve-pounders, upon the ship-yards and schooner. She was 
obliged immediately to haul near the wharf, or rather as near 
the north end of the fort as she could get, This battery is 
screened from the guns of the fort by an epaulement, in a good 
measure. 
</p><p>
I fear I have neither men nor ammunition to carry on any 
attack with success ; to which purpose, it would be absolutely necessary to occupy a very advantageous piece of rising ground on 
the west side, and there erect my battery to rack their defences. 
The largest of the mortars is useless, and on the mortars I principally depended for distressing the garrison. The weather has 
been and is still so exceedingly bad, and the encampment so 
swampy, that I feel exceedingly for the troops; and withal, provisions so scanty, flour as well as pork, that it will require, not 
only good fortune, but despatch, to keep us from distress. I 
hope the thirteen-inch mortar and more powder are on the way. 
</p><p>
Allen, Warner, and Brown are at Laprairie and Longueil, 
with a party of our troops, and some Canadians. How many, I 
cannot tell. They all speak well of the good disposition of the 
Canadians. They have a project of making an attempt on <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>. I fear the troops are not fit for it. Carleton has certainly 
left that town, and it is in a very defenceless state. 
</p><p>
As the garrison is shut up, I hope the Kennebec expedition 
will meet with no obstruction in the attack upon <a href='/results.php?city=quebec city' rel='city'>Quebec</a>. Should 
any thing not go well, I tremble for the fate of the poor Canadians, who have ventured so much. What should I do with them 
should we be obliged to evacuate the country ! Though I hope 
this will not be the case. If possible, do not let us want ammunition, my dear General. I have seen Mr. Livingston, lie has a 
considerable body of Canadians in arms at Chamblee, is very 
active, and they have great confidence in him, I believe. I wish 
to have him taken notice of by the Congress, in a manner suit 
able to his services, and the risk he runs. I am, my dear Sir, 
with the warmest wishes for the recovery of your health, 
Your faithful, humble servant,

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Your vigilance and foresight have saved us from the difficulties that threatened us. We are no longer afraid of starving. I 
wait now with impatience for the arrival of those troops, mentioned in your last, which I believe, from the number of boats on 
the way, will soon be here, to take the advantageous post I formerly spoke of, on a hill to the westward. 
</p><p>
Since my last, I have had some proposals of an accommodation, through the channel of the Caghnawagas, from the formidable St. Luc le Corne, and other principal inhabitants of <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>. To-morrow is appointed for a conference at Laprairie. I 
have sent Major Brown to manage it. Macpherson goes with 
him, and Mr. Livingston of Chamblee will attend. The result 
of this negotiation I hope soon to make you acquainted with. 
Mr. St. Luc's character gives me all the reason in the world 
to be on my guard against him. I shall insist on some substantial proof of his sincerity. Mr. Livingston, some days ago, took 
post at Hazen's house, with near two hundred Canadians. They 
are erecting a battery there, which seems to make the garrison 
very uneasy. 
</p><p>
Yesterday they attacked them with their row-galley, but were 
beaten back without loss on the side of the Canadians. No certain intelligence yet of Arnold's arrival, though there are flying 
reports to that purpose. I wish he was at <a href='/results.php?city=quebec city' rel='city'>Quebec</a>, with all my 
heart. I believe there is nothing to oppose him. I am extremely happy you have sent for more powder. I believe we 
have not more than two and one-half tons. This I am afraid 
will not do. Send us as many men as you can possibly furnish with provisions. I am greatly in want of them. Our feebleness has intimidated the Canadians from embarking in so uncertain an adventure. Were I strong enough to send five hundred 
men to <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, it would certainly declare for us ; at least I 
have great reason to think so. The miserable weather we have 
had has distressed us much, but I hope it is now over. 
</p><p>
Let the hard cash come as soon as possible, that our reputation may hold good. 
</p><p>
Mr. Carleton has not departed, as I informed you. We want 
both iron and steel, and turner's tools. The large mortar is 
ready to play, I shall send some more boats in a few days. 
</p><p>
I am, &c., &c.,

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Some time ago I informed you of my intentions to make my 
approaches on the west side, as soon as the expected reenforcement enabled me to undertake it. I had had a road cut to the 
intended ground, and some fascines made, when I was informed 
by Major Brown, that a general dissatisfaction prevailed ; that 
unless something was undertaken in a few days, there would 
be a mutiny ; and that the universal sense of the army was to 
direct all our attention to the east side. The impatience of the 
troops to get home has prevented their seeing the impossibility 
of undertaking this business sooner, the duty being hard for the 
troops, even on the present confined state of operations. 
</p><p>
When I mentioned my intentions, I did not consider I was at 
the head of troops who carry the spirit of freedom into the field, 
and think for themselves. Upon considering the fatal consequences which might flow from a want of subordination and discipline (should this ill humor continue), my unstable authority 
over troops of different Colonies, the insufficiency of the military 
law, and my own want of powers to enforce it, weak as it is, I 
thought it expedient to call the Field-Officers together. Inclosed 
I send you the result of our deliberations. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rim" rel="me">RICHARD MONTGOMERY</a>. 
</p><p>
Result of the Proceedings of a Council of War, held at <a href='/results.php?city=st johns' rel='city'>St. John's</a>, 
October 13th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775">1775</a>. 
</p><p>
I proposed establishing a battery of all our spare heavy can 
non, on the rising ground exactly opposite the stone house in the 
north redoubt (in the west face of which there is but one embrasure open), at the distance of about four hundred yards, securing 
this battery with a work capable of being well defended by 
two hundred men. From this battery our approaches might be 
continued to the ditch, and by the time we arrived there, the 
fraise around the berme would be destroyed, the rampart in a 
ruinous state, and the large house (which is said to be their 
principal barrack) would be destroyed, as every shot that missed the rampart, must take the house. Two four-pounders on 
the east side would answer the end of securing the west ram 
part in reverse, and thereby slackening the opposition of the 
enemy. 
</p><p>
By this mode of proceeding, if our ammunition held out, there 
would be, in my opinion, some prospect of success, notwithstanding  the superior artillery of the garrison, which could not be 
mounted in its proper place in time enough to prevent the 
erection of our battery. The Field-Officers were, to a man, of 
opinion that my reasons were insufficient, being afraid the designed ground was at this season too wet for approaches, and 
strongly of opinion our heavy cannon on the cast side would 
more effectually distress the enemy by annoying their buildings, 
the fort having a gentle slope to the river, and (which was 
urged as the strongest motive) by destroying their schooner. In 
vain I represented, that even if every building was destroyed, 
the garrison would not surrender without a probability of an 
assault, which could never arise from any attack on the opposite side of the river ; that the vessel could not be destroyed, 
because she would change her place in such a manner as to 
elude our batteries ; that we had little powder or time to throw 
away on experiments; that I had a moral certainty they would find themselves mistaken ; and finally that they must take it 
upon themselves, for I would not oppose the general sense of 
the army, and should enforce the measure by every effort in 
my power. 
</p><p>
I cannot help observing, to how little purpose I am here. 
Were I not afraid the example would be too generally followed, 
and that the public service might suffer, I would not stay an 
hour at the head of troops whose operations I cannot direct. 
I must say I have no hopes of success, unless from the garrison's wanting provisions.

SIR, 
</p><p>
I have received information, from different quarters, that the prisoners you have made are treated with cruel and unnecessary 
severity, being loaded with irons ; and that Colonel Allen himself meets with this shocking indignity. 
</p><p>
Your character, Sir, induces me to hope I am ill informed ; nevertheless, the duty I owe the troops committed to my charge, 
lays me under the necessity of acquainting your Excellency that, if you avow this conduct and persist in it, I shall, though with 
the most painful regret, execute with rigor the just and necessary law of retaliation upon the garrison of Chamblee, now in my 
possession, and upon all others who may hereafter fall into my hands. I must be understood to stipulate for those unfortunate 
Canadians, your prisoners, who have thrown themselves into the arms of the United Colonies for protection, whose enraged countrymen have with difficulty been restrained from acts of violence on the garrison of Chamblee. 
</p><p>
I shall expect your Excellency's answer in six days. Should the bearer not return in that time, I must interpret your silence 
into a declaration of a barbarous war. I cannot pass this opportunity, without lamenting the melancholy and fatal necessity which 
obliges the firmest friends of the Constitution to oppose one of the most respectable officers of the Crown. I am, &c.,

SIR, 
</p><p>
The advanced season of the year will not admit of your proposal. I do assure you, upon the honor of a gentleman, that 
what the prisoner has informed you of is true, as far as has 
come to my knowledge. However, if it wants further confirmation, Mr. Depane, of <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, who is also my prisoner, will, I 
believe, give you the same intelligence. 
</p><p>
Having now acquitted my conscience, I must, to save time 
and prevent trouble, acquaint you, if you do not surrender this 
day, it will be unnecessary to make any future proposals. The garrison shall be prisoners of war without the honors of 
and I cannot insure the officers their baggage. Should you wish 
to send an officer to Mr. Depane, who is on board the sloop, you 
have my permission. Captain Stewart carries an order for that 
purpose. Should you still be inclined to persist in a useless 
defence, you will immediately fire a cannon without shot, as a 
signal. I am, &c.,

MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to acquaint you the garrison surrendered 
last night. This morning, we take possession ; to-morrow, I hope 
the prisoners will set off. Inclosed you have the capitulation, 
which I hope will meet your approbation and that of Congress. 
</p><p>
I have ventured to permit an officer or two to go to their 
families, which are in some distress, at <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, upon their pa 
role. They can t do us any harm, and there would have been 
a degree of inhumanity in refusing them. When we had played 
on the fort some hours from our battery of four twelve-pounders, 
on the north-west, and another, of two twelve-pounders and two 
four-pounders, on the east side, some prisoners arrived who had 
been taken in an action with Governor Carleton, at Longueil. He 
made an attempt to land with thirty-four boats, full of men. 
Warner's detachment, consisting of the Green Mountain Boys 
and second regiment of Yorkers, repulsed them with loss ; took 
two Indians and two Canadians prisoners. We have buried three 
Indians, and it is supposed many in the boats must have been 
killed ; we had not a man even wounded. This, I believe, is his 
last effort. 
</p><p>
One of the above-mentioned prisoners I sent into the fort to 
inform Major Preston of the circumstances of the action, that he 
might judge what prospect he had of relief. It had the desired 
effect; the garrison having been on half allowance for some time. 
</p><p>
I am making the necessary preparation to proceed immediately 
to <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, by way of Laprairie, as the enemy have armed vessels in the Sorel. Send everybody you possibly can immediately 
down, as it is much to be apprehended many of the men on this service will insist on returning home when their times are Expired. It will not be necessary to keep people with arms for the 
present at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>. Several men of rank in Canada are 
among the prisoners. I have permitted them to remain at Crown 
Point till the return of two gentlemen they send to their friends 
for money, &c. They pleaded hard to return home ; but they 
are too dangerous to let loose again. 
</p><p>
I have this moment received your letter of the 27th October. 
Not a word of Arnold yet. I have sent two expresses to him 
lately ; one by an Indian, who promised to return with expedition. The instant I have any news of him, I will acquaint you 
by express. 
</p><p>
Colonel Easton and Major Brown, with that corps, and Mr. 
Livingston, with, I believe, one thousand Canadians, are going to 
wards the mouth of the Sorel, and pushing Colonel Allan Mc 
Lean before them. McLean had many Canadians, but they 
joined him through fear of fire and sword; you may judge easily 
how they will fight. I send you a list of stores, articles, &c., 
and am, my dear Sir, with respect and esteem,

GENTLEMEN, 
</p><p>
My anxiety for the fate of <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a> induces me to request, 
that you will exert yourselves among the inhabitants to prevail 
on them to enter into such measures as will prevent the necessity of opening my batteries on the town. When I consider the 
dreadful consequences of a bombardment, the distress that must 
attend a fire (at this season especially), when it is too late to repair the damage which must ensue, how many innocent people 
must suffer, and that the firm friends of liberty must be involved in one common ruin with the wicked tools of despot 
ism, my heart bleeds at the dire necessity which compels me 
to distress that unfortunate city. I conjure you, by all the ties 
of humanity, to take every possible step to soften the heart of 
the Governor, who, if he be sincere in his professions to the 
people committed to his charge, must commiserate their condition. In vain will he persist in a resistance, which can only 
be attended with misery to the inhabitants and with lasting Disgrace to his own humanity. I am, gentlemen, with earnest 
wishes for the success of your negotiation,

have only to appeal to your own observation, whether such a 
proceeding be consistent with our conduct since we have entered this Province.

</p>
<p rel="heading">
I do hereby certify, that the above articles were presented to 
me, to which I have given the following answer ; 
</p><p>
The city of <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, having neither ammunition, artillery, 
troops, nor provisions, and having it not in their power to fulfil 
one article of the treaty, can claim no title to a capitulation. 
</p><p>
The Continental army have a generous disdain of every act of 
oppression and violence; they are come for the express purpose 
of giving liberty and security. The General, therefore, engages 
his honor to maintain, in the peaceable enjoyment of their property of every kind, the individuals and religious communities of 
the city of <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>. 
</p><p>
The inhabitants, whether English, French, or others, shall be 
maintained in the free exercise of their religion. 
</p><p>
The present unhappy contention between Great Britain and 
her Colonies puts it out of his power to engage for freedom of 
trade to the mother country; nor can he make a general promise of passports; as far as it may consist with the safety of 
the troops and the public good, he shall be happy to promote 
commerce, and, for that purpose, promises to grant passports for 
the upper countries, when required. 
</p><p>
The General hopes to see such a virtuous Provincial Convention assembled, as will enter with zeal into every measure that 
can contribute to set the civil and religious rights of this and her 
sister Colonies on a permanent foundation. He promises for him 
self, that he will not compel the inhabitants of the town to take 
up arms against the Mother Country, or contribute towards the 
expenses of carrying on the present war. 
</p><p>
The Continental army came into this province for its protection ; they, therefore, cannot consider their opposers as taking up 
arms for its defence. 
</p><p>
It is not in the General's power to engage for the return of 
prisoners ; motives of humanity will induce him to use his interest for their return to their families, provided it can be done 
without endangering the public safety. 
</p><p>
Speedy measures shall be taken for the establishing Courts 
of Justice upon the most liberal plan conformable to the British 
Constitution. 
</p><p>
The inhabitants shall not be burdened with troops but when necessity requires it; of which necessity the General must be judge. 
</p><p>
The inhabitants of the country, and savages, shall not enter 
the town till the guards are posted. 
</p><p>
To-morrow morning, at nine o clock, the Continental troops 
shall take possession of the Recollect Gate. The proper officers 
must attend, with the keys of all public stores, upon the Quartermaster-General at nine o clock at the Recollect Gate. 
</p><p>
This engagement is understood and declared to be binding on 
any future commanding officer of the Continental troops, that 
may succeed me in this district.

MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The badness of the weather, and worse roads, have put it 
out of my power to get here before yesterday. A favorable 
wind enabled, the night before, Mr. Carleton to get away, with 
his little garrison on board ten or eleven little vessels, reserved 
for that purpose, and to carry away the powder and other important stores. I don t despair of getting hold of the powder yet. No diligence shall be wanting for that purpose. By 
intercepted letters, I find that <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Arnold</a> is certainly arrived in the neighbourhood of <a href='/results.php?city=quebec city' rel='city'>Quebec</a> ; that the king's friends 
are exceedingly alarmed, and expect to be besieged; which, with 
the blessing of God, they shall be, if the severe season holds off, 
and I can prevail on the troops to accompany me. The Lizard, 
man-of-war, is arrived there; she has brought twenty thousand 
pounds sterling, and one hundred marines. They have had some 
other little reinforcements of recruits for McLean's regiment, and 
artificers, to the amount, in all, including marines and sailors, 
of four hundred and fifty men. One of the brigs is arrived 
with clothing and arms for the faithful Canadians, as Mr. Carleton with propriety terms them. 
</p><p>
This morning we have taken possession of the town ; I send 
you their articles of capitulation, with my answer, and hope it 
may meet with approbation. 
</p><p>
I can t help feeling great uneasiness till I know the determination of the troops with respect to engaging for six months 
longer. I was obliged, at <a href='/results.php?city=st johns' rel='city'>St. John's</a>, to promise all such their dismission as chose it, to coax them to <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>. 
</p><p>
Indeed, Wooster's regiment showed the greatest uneasiness. 
I make no doubt of retaining as many as will hold the ground 
already gotten ; but it is of the utmost importance to finish this 
business at once, that the Ministry may have no hopes left 
of carrying on their infernal plan in this important quarter. 
At any rate, it will be highly expedient to throw in a large 
body of troops, as soon as the ice will bear, in order to make 
n vigorous attack on <a href='/results.php?city=quebec city' rel='city'>Quebec</a>, before the arrival of succours in 
the spring, should it not fall into our hands this winter ; but, 
should this instance of good fortune crown our labors, some 
advantageous post must be chosen below <a href='/results.php?city=quebec city' rel='city'>Quebec</a>, where a large 
corps of troops, strongly posted, a boom over a narrow channel, and floating batteries, may baffle all attempts from Europe. 
I am told a difficult pass, termed the Travers, will answer this 
purpose. If your health will not permit you to engage in this 
affair, I think Lee ought, by all means, to have the command 
here. I send some choice letters of that worthy and steady 
friend of the Colonies, Brook Watson, whose zeal is only to 
be equalled by his sincerity. You will think them of importance enough, I believe, to be communicated to General Washing ton and the Congress. Your friend, Mr. William Smith, has been pretty well humbugged by this gentleman. 
</p><p>
I am exceedingly sorry Congress have not favored me with 
a Committee. It would have had a great effect with the troops, 
who are exceedingly turbulent, and indeed mutinous. My vexation and distress can only be alleviated by reflecting on the 
great public advantages, which must arise from my unparalleled 
good fortune. 
</p><p>
I shall clothe the troops completely, who engage again. I 
find with pleasure that my politics have squared with the views 
of Congress, and shall lose no time in calling a Convention, 
when my intended expedition is finished. 
</p><p>
Will not your health permit you to reside at <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a> this 
winter? I must go home, if I walk by the side of the Lake, 
this winter. I am weary of power, and totally want that patience and temper, so requisite for such a command. 
</p><p>
I will take it as a favor, if you will send Harry Livingston 
with your despatches for Congress. 
</p><p>
I wish some method could be fallen upon of engaging gentlemen to serve; a point of honor, and more knowledge of the world, 
to be found in that class of men, would greatly reform discipline, and render the troops much more tractable. 
</p><p>
The officers of the first regiment of Yorkers and artillery 
company, were very near a mutiny the other day, because I 
would not stop the clothing of the garrison of <a href='/results.php?city=st johns' rel='city'>St. John's</a>. I 
would not have sullied my own reputation, nor disgraced the. 
Continental arms, by such a breach of capitulation, for the universe ; there was no driving it into their noddles, that the clothing  was really the property of the soldier; that he had paid 
for it, and that every regiment, in this country especially, saved 
a year's clothing to have decent clothes to wear on particular 
occasions. I am, &c., <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rim" rel="me">RICHARD MONTGOMERY</a>.

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I wrote to you the other day, in a great hurry, by express, 
sending a letter for <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a> from <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Arnold</a>. 
I have this morning had another express from <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Arnold</a>, 
acquainting me he has crossed the river to the <a href='/results.php?city=quebec city' rel='city'>Quebec</a> side ; 
that he had been near surprising the town ; that it was closely 
invested ; that they were in the greatest confusion within, the 
inhabitants having refused to take arms. A scarcity of provisions and wood must bring the garrison to terms, were a blockade alone to be the measure adopted. Mr. Carleton is in statuquo, about fifteen miles on this side of Sorel, where I hope 
they will not let him pass. I suppose Mr. Carleton is on board 
the fleet, which left this upon my arrival; as I have never 
had any account of his making his escape. I have not yet 
been able to adjust the new-formed corps, or get our warm 
clothing ready to go down, touching which I am exceedingly 
impatient, Arnold having no artillery, and being in want of warm clothing. 
</p><p>
I have appointed a Mr. Mason, one of our friends in this town, postmaster, till the pleasure of Congress be known. 
</p><p>
I find Mr. Price so active and intelligent, so warm a friend to the measures adopted by Congress, that I wish to have him 
mentioned in the strongest terms to Congress. 
</p><p>
I have set a regiment on foot of Canadians, James Livings 
ton, Colonel, to be engaged twelve months, should this unhappy 
controversy last so long. 
</p><p>
I have made the inhabitants acquainted with the views of 
Congress relative to this province, declaring I should call a 
Convention on my return from <a href='/results.php?city=quebec city' rel='city'>Quebec</a>. I have had some conversation with Pere Flacquet, a Jesuit at the head of the society 
here, and esteemed a very sensible fellow; he complained of 
some little indignities shown their order, particularly in making 
part of their house the common prison by his Majesty's Governors. I promised redress, and hinted, at the same time, the 
great probability of that society enjoying their estate (notwithstanding Sir Jeffery Amherst's pretensions), should this province 
accede to the General Union. 
</p><p>
I hope this hint may be of service ; the priests hitherto having  done us all the mischief in their power in many parishes. 
They will not yet give the people absolution. However, I have 
shown all the respect in my power to religion, and have winked 
at this behaviour in the priests, for fear of giving malice a 
handle. 
</p><p>
I wish I could have apprised you, in time, of your obligation. to Captain McKay. He generously offered Mr. Carleton, 
if he would give him two hundred men, to go and burn the 
new church at <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a> last summer. He is so inveterate a 
fellow that I think, if the other prisoners should be indulged 
in returning to their families this winter, he ought not to be 
permitted to enter this province. "When a Convention is assembled, I propose requesting the return of the other gentlemen, 
on their parole. The inhabitants are our friends on both sides 
of the river to <a href='/results.php?city=quebec city' rel='city'>Quebec</a>; our expresses go without interruption 
backwards and forwards ; a young man who is got out of <a href='/results.php?city=quebec city' rel='city'>Quebec</a>, informs me, that the Lieutenant-Governor, the Chief Justice, 
and several others, have put their baggage on board ship, and 
that no ship is permitted to sail ; this looks as if they despaired of making a defence. Colonel McLean has threatened a 
[sally,] and Arnold is apprised of it, and his troops wish for it. 
</p><p>
I hear there is a considerable quantity of powder at Niagara ; 
perhaps this may be thought an object worthy of attention; they have been very apprehensive of an attack from the Virginians in that quarter all this summer. 
</p><p>
I fear Carleton has thrown a great quantity of powder into the river. I have desired a severe message to be delivered to him on that subject. 
</p><p>
Farewell, my dear Sir, and believe me, with all regard and respect, Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rim" rel="me">RICHARD MONTGOMERY</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. Hard money should be sent down. I can get some thousands here from Price, though not sufficient to answer all expenses, and it is too soon to offer paper.

</p><p>
MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I am ashamed of dating my letter from hence ; you will be 
surprised at my long stay here, but day after day have I been 
delayed without a possibility of getting to Arnold's assistance. 
His last letter I inclose to you, together with one for General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>. 
</p><p>
To-morrow, I believe, I shall sail with two or three hundred men, some mortars and other artillery. It is with great 
indignation I hear Lieutenant Halsey, whom I left as Assistant 
Engineer at <a href='/results.php?city=st johns' rel='city'>St. John's</a>, to put the barracks in a proper state 
for the reception of a garrison, has run away without leave, 
taking with him the artificers I had left to carry on the work. 
This behaviour deserves the severest punishment. I beg he may 
be made an example of; he is a fit subject of it, and deserved 
to have been dismissed for endeavouring to persuade the soldiers to return from <a href='/results.php?city=st johns' rel='city'>St. John's</a>, and not to proceed to <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>. Lieutenant Graham, of the fourth regiment, and several others, can prosecute him. 
</p><p>
It will be necessary to send hard money here immediately, 
as paper will not yet go down. Price has lent me five thou 
sand pounds, York money; Walker has been so fortunate as to 
get home, being retaken in one of the vessels. Poor Allen 
is sent to England in irons. Should any accident befall him, 
I hope Prescott will fall a sacrifice to his manes. 
</p><p>
I sent by <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Schuyler</a> a return of provisions, taken in the 
vessels. I wish Lee could sec off immediately for the command 
here. I have thoughts of disarming the Tories in this town; 
not so much from any apprehensions I have of them, as to 
quiet the jealous apprehensions of the troops. Several Commissioners and other officers are flown without settling their accounts. I hope those people will incur the heavy censure of 
Congress. One, Mr. Waterhouse, who was appointed by Colonel Bedel, and whose conduct must be inquired into, having, I fear, 
made great waste of public stores ; one, Mr. Stewart, who acted 
at Laprairie ; one, Mr. Power, who acted at <a href='/results.php?city=st johns' rel='city'>St. John's</a>. Lieu 
tenant-Colonel Warner has, I believe, large accounts unsettled. 
In short, there are great abuses to be rectified. 
</p><p>
I wish exceedingly for a respectable Committee of Congress. 
I really have not weight enough to carry on business by my 
self. I send you the two Indians taken in Carleton's attack. 
I forgot to make you this present before. 
</p><p>
With respect to the Canadian soldiery, I think you may venture to send them back. The I should imagine might 
influence in some measure the choice of representation for a Convention. I am, my dear General, with sentiments of real 
esteem and respect, your most affectionate, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rim" rel="me">RICHARD MONTGOMERY</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. The Indians are of the Conosadago. I have not, I believe, more than eight hundred effective here. However, I 
can have as many Canadians, as I know how to maintain ; atleast I think so, while affairs wear so promising an aspect.

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have been this evening favored with yours of the 19th 
ultimo. I return you many thanks for your warm congratulations. Nothing shall be wanting on my part to reap the advantage of our good fortune. The season has proved so favorable as to enable me to join <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Arnold</a> at Point-aux-Trembles, where I arrived with the vessels Mr. Prescott made 
us a present of. They carried the few troops, about three 
hundred, who were equipped for a winter's campaign, with the 
artillery, &c. Colonel Livingston is on his way with some 
part of his regiment of Canadians. 
</p><p>
Mr. Carleton, who is, I suppose, ashamed to show himself 
in England, is now in town, and puts on the show of defence. 
The works of <a href='/results.php?city=quebec city' rel='city'>Quebec</a> are extremely extensive, and very in 
capable of being defended. His garrison consists of McLean's 
banditti, the sailors from the frigates and other vessels laid up, 
together with the citizens obliged to take up arms, most of 
whom are impatient of the fatigues of a siege, and wish to see 
matters accommodated amicably. I propose amusing Mr. Carleton with a formal attack, erecting batteries, &rc., but mean to 
insult the works, I believe towards the Lower Town, which is 
the weakest part. I have this day written to Mr. Carleton, 
and also to the inhabitants, which I hope will have some effect. 
I shall be very sorry to be reduced to this mode of attack, 
because I know the melancholy consequences. But the approaching  severe season, and the weakness of the garrison, together 
with the nature of the works, point it out too strongly to be 
passed by. 
</p><p>
I find <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Arnold</a>'s corps an exceeding fine one, inured 
to fatigue, and well accustomed to cannon shot (at <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>). 
There is a style of discipline among them much superior to 
what I have been used to see this campaign. He himself is 
active, intelligent, and enterprising. Fortune often bailies the 
sanguine expectations of poor mortals. I am not intoxicated 
with the favors I have received at her hands, but I do think 
there is a fair prospect of success. 
</p><p>
The Governor has been so kind as to send out of town 
many of our friends, who refused to do military duty ; among 
them several very intelligent men, capable of doing me consider 
able service. One of them, a Mr. Antill, I have appointed 
Chief Engineer. Mr. Mott and all his suite have returned home. 
</p><p>
Be so good as to show Congress the necessity I was under 
of clothing the troops, to induce them to stay, and undertake 
this service at such an inclement season. I think, had their 
Committee been with me, they would have seen the propriety 
of grasping at every circumstance in my power to induce them 
to engage again. I was not without my apprehensions of not 
only being unable to make any appearance here, but even of 
being obliged to relinquish the ground I had gained. How 
ever, I hope the clothing and dollar bounty will not greatly 
exceed the bounty offered by Congress. 
</p><p>
Whilst the affair of Chamblee was in agitation, Major Brown, 
as I am well informed, made some promises to the Canadians 
who engaged on that service, which I believe I must, from 
motives of policy as well as justice, make good; namely, to 
share the stores, except ammunition and artillery. When matters are settled, I shall pay them in money, it being inconvenient to part with the provisions. 
</p><p>
Upon another occasion I have also ventured to go beyond 
the letter of the law. Colonel Easton's detachment at the mouth 
of the Sorel was employed on the important service of stop 
ping the fleet. They were half naked, and the weather was 
very severe. I was afraid that not only they might grow 
impatient, and relinquish the business in hand, but I also saw 
the reluctance the troops at <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a> showed to quit it. By 
way of stimulant I offered, as a reward, all public stores taken 
in the vessels to the troops who went forward, except ammunition and provisions. Warner's corps refused to march, or at 
least declined it. Bedel's went on, and came in for a share 
of the labor and honor. I hope the Congress will not think 
this money ill laid out. 
</p><p>
With a year's clothing of the seventh and twenty-sixth, I have relieved the distresses of Arnold's corps, and forwarded 
the clothing of some other corps. The greatest part of that clothing is a fair prize, except such as immediately belonged 
to the prisoners taken on board. They must be paid for theirs, as it was their own property. We shall have more time here after to settle this affair. 
</p><p>
Should there be any reason to apprehend an effort next 
spring to regain Canada, I would not wish to see less than 
ten thousand men ordered here. The Canadians will be our 
friends so long as we are able to maintain our ground, but 
they must not be depended upon, especially for defensive operations. The great distance from any support or relief, renders 
it, in my opinion, absolutely necessary to make the most formidable preparations for the security of this important Province. 
What advantages the country below <a href='/results.php?city=quebec city' rel='city'>Quebec</a> affords for defence, 
I cannot yet assert, but the Rapids of Richelieu, some miles 
above, may be defended against all the navy and all the military force of Great Britain, by such a body of troops as I 
have mentioned, provided with sufficient artillery, row-galleys, and proper vessels fitted for fire-ships. 
</p><p>
Some time since, you desired a return from <a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'>General Wooster</a> of the men he had discharged between <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>. I was afraid there might be something disagreeable 
to him in the desire, and, as it was too critical a time to put anybody out of humor, I therefore suppressed it. I shall now make him acquainted with your pleasure on that head. 
</p><p>
There are several appointments I have thought necessary to make, which I shall soon make known to you. I hope the 
Congress will not yield to any solicitations to the prejudice of the troops who have borne the burden of the service here. 
I have paid particular attention to <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Arnold</a>'s recommendations. Indeed, I must say, he has brought with him many pretty young men. 
</p><p>
I do not know that I informed you, that it was in vain to 
think of engaging the troops for twelve months. The loth of 
April, which allows them time to plant their corn upon returning  home, was all I dared to ask. I hope the proper measures will be taken for sending fresh troops into the country 
</p><p>
before that time. I am, &c.,

SIR, 
</p><p>
Notwithstanding the personal ill treatment I have received at 
your hands, notwithstanding the cruelty you have shown to the 
unhappy prisoners you have taken, the feelings of humanity induce me to have recourse to this expedient to save you from the 
destruction which hangs over your wretched garrison. Give me 
leave to inform you, that I am well acquainted with your situation ; 
a great extent of works, in their nature incapable of defence, 
manned with a motley crew of sailors, most of them our friends, 
and citizens who wish to see us within their walls, a few of the 
worst troops that call themselves soldiers, the impossibility of relief, and the certain prospect of wanting every necessary of life, 
should your opponents confine their operations to a single blockade, 
point out the absurdity of resistance. Such is your situation. 
</p><p>
I am at the head of troops accustomed to success, confident 
of the righteous cause they are engaged in, inured to danger and 
fatigue, and so highly incensed at your inhumanity, illiberal abuse, 
and the ungenerous means employed to prejudice them in the minds 
of the Canadians, that it is with difficulty I restrain them, till 
my batteries are ready, from insulting your works, which would 
afford them the fair opportunity of ample vengeance and just 
retaliation. 
</p><p>
Firing upon a flag of truce, hitherto unprecedented, even among 
savages, prevents my following the ordinary mode of conveying 
my sentiments. However, I will at any rate acquit my conscience. 
Should you persist in an unwarrantable defence, the consequence 
be upon your own head. Beware of destroying stores of any 
sort, public or private, as you did at <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, or in the river ; 
if you do, by heavens there will be no mercy shown.

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The bearer, Mr. Melchior, I sent express to <a href='/results.php?city=st johns' rel='city'>St. John's</a> for artillery stores. Be so good as to give him all the assistance in 
your power, particularly in money matters. Yesterday we opened 
a battery of five guns and a howitzer, and, with very little effect, 
I attempted to summon the Governor by a flag of truce. He 
would not receive any letter. The enemy have very heavy 
metal, and I think will dismount our guns very shortly. Some 
they have already rendered almost useless. This gives very little 
uneasiness ; I never expected any other advantage from our artillery, than to amuse the enemy, and blind them as to my real intention. 
</p><p>
I propose, the first strong northwester, to make two attacks by 
night, one with about a third of the troops on the Lower Town, 
having first set fire to some houses, which will in all probability 
communicate their flames to the stockade lately erected on the 
rock, near St. Roc suburbs; the other upon Cape Diamond bastion, by escalade. I have not time to point out my reasons for 
this particular attack. Let it suffice that it is founded on the 
nature of the ground, works, and the best intelligence I have been 
able to procure. However, I am not certain whether or no the 
troops relish this mode of proceeding. I am fully convinced of the 
practicability. But should it not appear in the same advantageous 
light to the men, I shall not press it upon them, well knowing 
the impossibility of making troops act with the necessary vigor, 
on such an occasion, if their minds are possessed with imaginary terrors . 
</p><p>
We are exceeding weak, it is true, but the enemy are so too, 
in proportion to the extent of their works ; and as they know 
not where they will be attacked, all must be guarded. Indeed, 
their apprehensions for the Lower Town, induce them to bestow 
their greatest attention on that quarter. I hope the arms, lead, 
and flints are on their way. I could wish for a reinforcement, 
if to be spared. We have not much above eight hundred men 
fit for duty, exclusive of a few ragamuffin Canadians. 
</p><p>
I believe you will not think it proper to let the contents of this 
letter go abroad. Should you have no accounts of any cash on 
the way, I must beg you will send an express to hasten it. I 
shall soon be exceedingly distressed, if a supply don t arrive. I 
must therefore beg you to raise what you can, for fear of accidents. Let a considerable number of shirts be sent down as 
soon as possible. Our men are much in want of them. I must 
refer you to Mr. Melchior for particulars. Believe me, dear Sir, 
with much esteem,

MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have been near a fortnight before <a href='/results.php?city=quebec city' rel='city'>Quebec</a>, at the head of upwards of eight hundred men ; a force, you will say, not very 
adequate to the business in hand. But we must make the best of it. It is all I could get. I have been so used to struggle with difficulties, that I expect them of course. 
</p><p>
I hope the troops will be sent down as soon as possible, for 
should we fail in our first attempt, a second or a third may do 
the business, before relief can arrive to the garrison. Possession 
of the town, and that speedily, I hold of the highest consequence. 
The enemy are expending the ammunition most liberally ; and I 
fear the Canadians will not relish a union with the Colonies, till 
they see the whole country in our hands, and defended by such 
a force as may relieve them from the apprehensions of again 
falling under the ministerial lash. Were it not for these reasons, 
I should have been inclined to a blockade, till towards the first 
of April, by which time the garrison would probably be much

MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
When last I had the honor to write, I hoped before now to 
hive had it in my power to give you some good news. I then 
had reason to believe the troops well inclined for a coup-de-main. I have since discovered, to my great mortification, that 
three companies of <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Arnold</a>'s detachment are very averse 
from the measure. There is strong reason to believe their difference of sentiment from the rest of the troops arises from the 
influence of their officers. Captain  , who has incurred 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Arnold</a>'s displeasure by some misconduct, and thereby 
given room for harsh language, is at the bottom of it, and has 
made some declarations which I think must draw upon him the 
censure of his country, if brought to trial. Captain and 
</p><p>
Hubbard seem to espouse his quarrel. A Field-Officer is concerned in it, who wishes, I suppose, to have the separate command of those companies, as the above-mentioned Captains have 
made application for that purpose. This dangerous party threatens the ruin of our affairs. I shall at any rate be obliged to 
change my plan of attack, being too weak to put that in execution I had formerly determined on. I am much afraid my 
friend is deeply concerned in this business. I will have 
</p><p>
an eclaircissement with him on the subject. I will hereafter acquaint you more particularly with this matter. In the mean 
time, I wish you would not mention names, for I know not 
whether the situation of affairs will admit of doing the public 
the justice I could wish. 
</p><p>
Strain every nerve to send a large corps of troops down, the 
instant the Lake is passable. It is of the utmost importance 
we should be possessed of <a href='/results.php?city=quebec city' rel='city'>Quebec</a> before succours can arrive ; and 
I must here give it to you as my opinion, and that of several 
sensible men acquainted with this Province, that we are not to 
expect a union with Canada till we have a force in the country sufficient to insure it against any attempt that may be 
made for its recovery. I believe I have mentioned this in my 
last, but I can t help repeating it again. One difficulty occurs 
to me. How are those troops to be paid here? The Continental money will not be received by the inhabitants. I had 
distributed part of it to the troops at <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a> ; few would receive it. The consequence was, the soldier offered it for less 
than its value, and so it became depreciated. One scheme has 
occurred to me, which I shall communicate by this opportunity 
to Price and our other friends at <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>. If they can send 
down to the army such articles as soldiers choose to lay out 
their money upon, employing sutlers for that purpose, who will 
receive our paper, the troops may then be paid in Continental 
currency, which will not be depreciated ; the soldier will not 
grumble, as he may be regularly paid ; and, by degrees, the 
inhabitants may acquire confidence in it, seeing our merchants 
take it freely. What hard cash can be mustered might pay 
the contingencies of the army, such as transportation of bag 
gage, &c., and purchase provisions. 
</p><p>
I am amazed no money is yet arrived. The troops arc uneasy, and I shall by and by be at my wits end to furnish the 
army with provisions. I am the more surprised, as I am 
credibly informed cash arrived from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> three weeks since. I have almost exhausted Price, having 
had upwards of five thousand pounds York from him. I must take this opportunity of acknowledging his services. He has 
been a faithful friend to the cause indeed. His advice and 
assistance, upon every occasion, I have been much benefited 
by ; and when I consider that he has been the first mover of 
those measures which have been attended with so many and 
great advantages to the United Colonies, I can t help wishing 
the Congress to give him an ample testimony of their sense 
of his generous and spirited exertions in the cause of freedom. 
</p><p>
Having so early reported to you my determination to return 
home, I take it for granted measures are taken to supply my 
place. Should not anybody arrive shortly for that purpose, I 
must conclude Congress mean to leave the management of affairs in <a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'>General Wooster</a>'s hands ; and therefore, if this business should terminate in a blockade, I shall think myself at 
liberty to return. However, if possible, I shall make an effort 
for the reduction of the town. I will shortly comply with 
several articles of directions, which I have received from you, 
and which I deferred in hopes of complying with them before 
now, in peaceable possession of <a href='/results.php?city=quebec city' rel='city'>Quebec</a>. The strange divided 
state of the troops all this campaign has prevented my sending 
returns, having never been able to get one with any tolerable 
exactness. The three discontented companies are within a few 
days of being free from their engagements. I must try every 
means to prevent their departure, and in this matter I am much 
embarrassed. Their officers have offered to stay, provided they 
may join some other corps. This is resentment against Arnold, 
and will hurt him so much, that I don t think I can consent to 
it. I am, dear Sir, with great respect and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and affectionate, humble servant, 
</p><p>
