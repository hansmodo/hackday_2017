</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I make no doubt but your Excellency is acquainted with the present ineffective state of the cavalry. 
In this situation it cannot be appropriated to any other service than that of orderlies, or reconnoitering 
the enemy's lines, which your Excellency must be 
persuaded is not the only service expected from a 
corps, which, when on a proper footing, is so very 
formidable. Although it is the opinion of many, that, 
from the construction of the country, the cavalry can 
not act to advantage, your Excellency must be too 
well acquainted with the many instances wherein the 
cavalry have been decisively serviceable, to be of this 
opinion, and not acknowledge that this corps has more 
than once completed victories. To this end I would 
wish to discipline the cavalry ; and I flatter myself by 
next campaign to render it essentially serviceable. 
</p><p>
What has greatly contributed to the present weak 
state of the cavalry was, the frequent detachments 
ordered to the suite of general and other officers, 
while a Colonel commanded, which were appropriated 
to every use, and the horses drove at the discretion 
of the dragoons. 
</p><p>
The confidence, with which the Congress and your Excellency have honored me, is a sure guaranty to 
the zeal I shall ever act with, in the service of the 
United States. But, notwithstanding my great desire 
of rendering the cavalry as useful as its first institution intended, I find it impracticable, seeing it is deficient in its principal requisitions ; my reflections on 
which, I have judged necessary to communicate to 
your Excellency, as a proof of my attachment to the 
good of the service, and desire of executing your Excellency's designs ; hoping for an opportunity of 
deserving the favor conferred on me by your Excellency. 
</p><p>
ARTICLE I. It is absolutely necessary, that the cavalry have a Master of Exercise, who should instruct 
the commissioned and non-commissioned officers in the 
rules of service, as, having the command,, I am obliged 
to act with precaution; but this officer, actuated by 
different motives, would remove the bad habits and 
correct the defects of the superior officers. There is 
an officer now in this country, whose name is Kowacz. 
I know him to have served with reputation in the 
Prussian service, and assure your Excellency that he 
is every way equal to this undertaking. 
</p><p>
II. That twenty-four dragoons be drafted from the 
different regiments to form a separate corps, who shall 
be taught the use of the pike or lance, of which two 
or three days will render them masters. For this purpose I must have chosen men. 
</p><p>
III. A Quartermaster-General to the cavalry is essentially necessary to procure winter-quarters, stables, 
and provender, also to provide arms, accoutrements, 
and clothing. An intelligent officer, acquainted with 
the cavalry, should be chosen for this purpose. I 
would recommend to your Excellency, Major Blackden, of Colonel Sheldon's regiment, a gentleman who 
has displayed his knowledge in the equipment of said 
regiment, and whom I think sufficiently qualified to 
merit this trust. 
</p><p>
IV. It is full time the Quartermaster-General was 
sent to the place assigned for winter-quarters, in order to provide magazines, that the cavalry may be 
kept embodied and conveniently exercised and disciplined. The horse service has ever been respected. 
One third of the cavalry is generally on duty, often 
the whole. When it returns to camp, it should draw 
provision, and cook it agreeably to orders ; but their 
full allowance is seldom granted. This I know by 
experience, being the worst served of any General in 
the service. To prevent this evil, a Commissary should 
be appointed to the cavalry. The cavalry in an army 
generally forms a separate division, and has greater 
privileges than the infantry, which the honor of the 
service exacts ; but here I find it is the contrary. Not 
that I aim at a superiority over the rest of the army, 
but am desirous of having justice done the corps I 
command. It is my duty. For my own part I wish to 
be subject to your Excellency's order only, agreeably 
to my request upon entering the service, which is 
the limit of my ambition.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
In my preceding representations, I have been particular respecting the present state of the cavalry, 
and the means by which it may be augmented and 
completed ; but, on this head, I must necessarily know 
your Excellency's determination. The advantages that 
would arise from a superiority in cavalry are too obvious to be unnoticed. It may be further observed 
that, during this war, the country will daily become 
more open and clear of woods and fens, and consequently better adapted to the manoeuvres and service 
of the cavalry. 
</p><p>
While we are superior in cavalry, the enemy will 
not dare to extend their force, and, notwithstanding 
we act on the defensive, we shall have many opportunities of attacking and destroying the enemy by 
degrees ; whereas, if they have it in their power to 
augment their cavalry, and we suffer ours to diminish 
and dwindle away, it may happen that the loss of a 
battle will terminate in our total defeat. Our army, 
once dispersed and pursued by their horse, will never 
be able to rally. Thus our retreat may early be cut 
off, our baggage lost, our principal officers taken, and 
many other events occur not less fatal. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency must be too much occupied to 
take cognizance of the detail of every department, 
A workman requires proper tools to carry on his 
business, and, if he does not use them in their place, 
he cannot be perfect. Your Excellency is undoubtedly acquainted with yours ; therefore a person, possessing your confidence, and properly authorized, is 
essentially necessary to answer decisively such proposals as I have made in my late representations respecting the cavalry. 
</p><p>
I must not omit to mention, here, the dissatisfaction 
you have expressed at my seeming inattention to 
your orders. Your Excellency may be assured, that 
the good of the service is my constant study, but the 
weak state of the corps I command, renders it impossible to perform every service required ; nay, my reputation is exposed, as, being an entire stranger in 
the country, the least accident would suffice to injure 
me ; but, notwithstanding, I cannot avoid harding 
every thing that is valuable in life.

SIR, 
</p><p>
I arrived here yesterday with the cavalry, where I 
expected to have found forage sufficient to subsist the 
cavalry, at least for a few days. My Brigade Forage-master had been informed, by Colonel Biddle, that such 
provision was made, and that he would have nothing 
more to do than issue the same ; but, so far to the 
contrary, there was not a load of hay in town. With 
the greatest difficulty we have "been enabled to put 
our heads under cover. I applied to the civil magistrates for directions relative to the forming a magazine. In the mean while, the horses must subsist. I 
am, therefore, obliged to divide them into several 
squads, and send them out about two miles in the 
rear of the town, until the necessary provision, both 
for forage and quarters, can be made. 
</p><p>
It will be impossible for me to quarter the cavalry 
in this place, unless the galley-men are removed ; but 
they say they have an order from the Governor and 
Council to remain here ; and, having prior possession, 
think they are entitled to hold it. I wait your Excellency's positive order in what manner to proceed; 
and if, in this case, I must execute my first orders, 
it will be necessary that the galley-men should receive orders to evacuate the town. I have the honor 
to assure your Excellency that the cavalry is in want 
of every article. It must be exercised and taught 
the service, from the Colonel to the private. Colonel Kowacz is a man of great merit, and deserves the 
charge of Master of Exercise. He is an officer worthy 
of research ; and, exclusive of a thorough knowledge 
of his abilities, I request his being employed by your Excellency. I can recommend, and assure your Excellency will never have reason to repent your confidence in him. If this proposal should be agreeable 
to your Excellency, the sooner I am informed the 
better, as he will be of infinite service to the cavalry 
this winter in quarters. 
</p><p>
I have met with an armourer, who lives at Easton. 
He undertakes to furnish me with pikes, pistols, carbines, &c. If your Excellency approves of him, the 
Quartermaster-General will take your orders on that head. 
</p><p>
There are some excellent horses in this country ; 
and; as Colonel Luterloh has received orders to press 
all horses fit for the service, he may procure a number here ; but this must not be delayed, as I am in 
formed many persons buy them for the use of the 
enemy. I am, with respect, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Very humble, and obedient servant,

SIR, 
</p><p>
Without going into a detailed history of my life, 
which would be too long, it will suffice to say to 
you, in the language of an old soldier and of a 
citizen, that, in coming to America, my sole object 
has been to devote myself entirely to her welfare 
and glory, in using every exertion in my individual 
power to secure her freedom. 
</p><p>
I think the nation was satisfied of my sentiments 
when it saw that I accepted the post of Brigadier General of cavalry, though a long service, and my 
former rank of Commander-in-chief of the army of 
Poland, had given me a right to expect a higher position. But the sole desire to distinguish myself by 
my zeal in the cause of the United States, has disposed me to sacrifice my repose and my life to its 
support, at all times, and in whatever position. I 
venture to flatter myself, Sir, that my conduct at the 
head of the cavalry has proved this to the complete 
satisfaction of the people and the Honorable Congress ; 
happy, General, if I may now be assured of that confidence, on your part, to which I aspire, and if, as I 
hope, you will honor with your approbation a plan 
which I have conceived with a sole view to the 
public good. Here it is, just as I have conceived it 
to be best adapted to benefit the army and the 
public. 
</p><p>
The corps placed under my command shall be in 
dependent, and formed of the two companies of 
horse and of six companies of infantry. If the Board 
of War, on which it will depend, shall see fit to en 
large it, on seeing, by experience of its courage and 
conduct, that it might be thus made of greater utility, it will be for them to decide. 
</p><p>
The duty of the Commandant-m-chief of this corps 
will be always to observe, very close at hand, all the 
movements of the enemy ; to take upon himself different enterprises, of the nature of surprises, ambuscades, affairs of posts, rear-guards, protecting flanks, 
&c., and to advise the Commander-in-chief of the 
army, and the Board of War, of every thing which 
he shall find to be of interest. It is easy to see 
that the whole system of the Commander of such a 
corps is simply one of active operation. So that, 
without enlarging on the advantages to be derived 
from it, it is easy to see that a corps which shall 
have no other object than to surprise the enemy, to 
watch them incessantly, and attack them at all points 
by continual surprises, must be of great utility. 
</p><p>
The corps will be recruited from the people of the 
country, from deserters, and from prisoners of war, 
agreeably to the letter of General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>. 
</p><p>
I would propose, for my subaltern, an experienced 
officer, by name Kow r acz, formerly a Colonel and partisan in the Prussian service. And as my plan is to 
employ all the other officers whom I personally know 
to be capable of serving with distinction and honor, 
after obtaining the consent of the Honorable Congress for the execution of the plan, I shall have the 
honor to mention them. 
</p><p>
The muskets for the infantry, the pistols for the 
lancers, the sabres, and the horses, to be furnished 
me as soon as possible. I will undertake to execute 
the rest; and as it is difficult to find leather for 
boots, saddles, &c., I request an order upon the Commissary of Leather to furnish it to me, and upon the 
different Commandants where my recruits may be, for 
quarters and rations. 
</p><p>
I hope that the instructions may be such, that one third of the cost of equipping the corps may be furnished at once ; another third, in proportion as the 
corps is filled up ; and so on. 
</p><p>
You enjoy, General, the most distinguished, estimation in our army. I reverence your virtue and your valor; and your military knowledge gives me a 
confident hope, in presenting this view, of the success 
of a plan which is only interesting to me through 
my desire to make myself useful to the nation. 
</p><p>
I hope, General, that you will do me the favor to 
obtain a prompt decision. 
</p><p>
