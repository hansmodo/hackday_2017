The letter you honored me with, my dear General, of the 10th of May, has given me the greatest pleasure. I see you at the glorious end of all your toils, 
and with the desire to come to France. Try, my dear General, to effectuate this project. Let nothing oppose itself to the idea. Come and receive, in a 
country which honors you, and which has admired you, the plaudits due to a great man. You may be assured of a reception without example. You will be 
received, as you deserve to be, after a revolution which has not its like in history. Everybody smiles, already, at the hopes you give me in your letter, 
and my heart beats with pleasure at the thought of embracing you once more.

It seems to me you should embark about the beginning of October, so as to be here about the beginning of November. You will then find the Court returned 
from Fontainbleau. You will pass your winter in the midst of the gayeties of Paris and of Versailles; and, in the spring, we will carry you to our country seats. 
Come, my dear General, and satisfy the desires of a nation whose hearts are already yours. You will eclipse all the English, who arrive in crowds here for 
a change of air, and whom we receive well, because we are polite and civil. But the reception of <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a> will be in the hearts of the French. 
I have the honor to be, &c.,
