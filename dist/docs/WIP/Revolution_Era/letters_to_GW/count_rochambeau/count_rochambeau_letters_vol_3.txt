Sir, 
</p><p>
The enemy are doing what they ought to do. 
Graves, immediately after having joined Arbuthnot, 
comes to cruise before us with nine or ten ships of 
the line, five frigates, and four other small vessels. 
He moors at present at Block Island, with the object 
of opposing our designs, and intercepting the second division from France. Our despatch-boat, charged 
with letters, and escorted by three frigates, has been 
obliged to return yesterday, chased by all the enemy's fleet. I see that it "will be good to have cruisers at the Capes of Delaware and Chesapeake, to advertise our second convoy, as soon as it shall appear, 
to debark at the south, or at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> ; the former will 
be best. I pray my General to transmit this to the 
<a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='colleague'>Chevalier De La Luzerne</a>, that he may act in consequence. 
</p><p>
We are going to try to convey our letters to France 
in a vessel from one of the ports in the State of 
Massachusetts. I wait here that part of the Bourbonne which have fortunately debarked at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. 
We have more than six hundred sick, besides one 
hundred whom the Bourbonne left at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. The 
fleet has more than one thousand sailors, and has not 
here wherewith to change them, as Graves did at 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. A good month's refreshment will reestablish the greatest part. 
</p><p>
I am, with respect, &c. &c.,

Sm, 
</p><p>
I have received your Excellency's letter of the 9th 
instant, brought by Colonel Robert Dillon. The legion de Lauzun by this time must be arrived at 
Charlotte Court-House. It will be needful that it 
stay there some time, because the men are almost quite naked, and I shall forward them their clothing 
which I expect from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, as well as that of all 
the army, as soon as possibly can be done after its 
arrival. In these circumstances, I have not thought 
fit to empower M. de Choisy to proceed further, because, on one part, I feared that the requests for that 
movement might not be absolutely necessary, and on 
the other part, I knew too well the ardor and desire 
of going forward, and to be detached from the main 
body, which is natural to our nation. I am here at 
hand to send them orders relative to the intelligence, 
which they will send me from <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>'s army, if the circumstances were so urgent as to render 
their march absolutely necessary. About eight days 
ago, several detachments of different southern regiments, amounting to five hundred men, marched towards that army. In a little excursion I made in 
the heart of the State, I have seen Colonel Armand's legion, at <a href='/results.php?city=charlottesville' rel='city'>Charlottesville</a>. It will be ready in 
a month, if sixty horses, which he expects from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, arrive. If your Excellency does not hurry 
the assembling of the reenforcements, which this 
State is to furnish to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>'s army, I think 
I ought to let you know, that the Assembly has 
broken up without resolving any thing, or furnishing 
the means of recruiting ; so that it should seem, that 
Virginia, the present moment, looks on itself as in 
possession of peace. 
</p><p>
The privateers are become very bold since the loss 
of the Diligente ; some are entered the Bay. The 
Sybille is gone out to chase them. I presume that, 
before long, we shall receive from France a plan of 
next campaign. In that case, I think it would be 
very necessary that we should have a conference together. I am confident your Excellency would not 
be against seeing <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>, your agreeable seat. 
If convenient, it should be our place of rendezvous, 
as the most suitable place, 
</p><p>
I am very sensible to your Excellency's attention 
about the engraving of the field-pieces which you 
destine for me. I do not look upon them as very 
urgent to be delivered ; and I think it would be most 
'suitable to keep them at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, whence Mr. 
Morris might send them to France when peace is 
made. They might be transported to Nantes, whence, 
by going up the river as far as Tours, I would get 
them carried to Rochambeau, which is only twelve 
leagues distant from that city. I am, with respect 
and personal attachment. Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=cdr" rel="me">Le <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague'>Compte De Rochambeau</a></a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I think the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='colleague'>Chevalier De La Luzerne</a> must, by this time, be on the road to come here ; if he is 
not, I beg you would tell him to have no uneasiness about the privateers, because M. de la Villebrune will take care to see him carried safely over.

Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor to write to your Excellency that, 
at my departure from York in Virginia, I would 
leave in that place a detachment of four hundred 
French troops, which were to he joined by a corps 
of the Virginian militia, to assure the possession of 
that harbour to the French navy now there, and that 
may arrive in future. At the moment of my leaving 
that place, the American militia were just beginning 
to arrive ; and I have left M. de Lavalette, Brigadier-General, with four hundred French troops. I 
have expressly recommended to him the American artillery, which remained there after the siege of York, 
with orders to place it upon <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, to join it 
to our siege artillery, in case superior land and sea 
forces should oblige him to retreat on <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, 
with the King's navy. I think that the quantity of 
American artillery left at York is much greater than 
is necessary for the conservation of that post, and 
that at least one half may be taken away, whenever 
your Excellency shall think fit. 
</p><p>
One battery of eight pieces at York, and another 
of six at Gloucester, will be sufficient to protect the 
harbour ; and I am of opinion that <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a> 
will do very well to send his orders that the rest, 
amounting to thirty pieces and upwards, according to 
the best of my knowledge, may be removed. This is 
my opinion. Sir, in answer to the letter which you 
did me the honor to write me on that object yesterday. I am, with respect and personal attachment. 
Sir, your Excellency's

P. S. I send to your Excellency my answer to 
Sir Guy Carleton, which I beg you would read, and 
send by the first occasion to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>.

Sir, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to send to your Excellency a 
letter, which the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='colleague'>Chevalier De La Luzerne</a> begs you would send by the dragoons established on the road 
to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> for carrying on the correspondence. It 
contains a generous offer made by Congress to the King of a seventy-four gun ship. 
</p><p>
The news which I have here of the British fleet, 
are that Admiral Pigot is got into <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> with 
very few ships, himself in a bad state of health, and 
that Admiral Hood, with the greatest part of the 
fleet, has sailed for <a href='/results.php?city=halifax' rel='city'>Halifax</a>. If your Excellency has 
the same intelligence confirmed, I beg you would 
send my letter to M. de Vaudreuil. It is, however, 
certain that M. Dumas, Deputy Quartermaster-General, 
has seen yesterday a great part of the fleet under 
sail before the Hook. I expect that I shall arrive, 
with the first division, on the 14th, at Haverstraw. 
The second division will arrive on the loth; and I 
promise to myself a great pleasure in embracing your 
Excellency. I am, with respect and personal attachment. Sir, your Excellency's

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
At the moment of my departure for <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> this 
morning, I received a letter from M. de Yaudreuil, 
saying that he is sorry to have appointed the 8th 
of next month for my arrival with my troops at 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, because the men-of-war at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a> are 
not yet ready, and he does not believe that he will 
be in readiness to set sail before the 20th of November. In consequence of which, I have resolved 
to stay here four days longer ; then to go as far as 
<a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, by very short journeys, where I shall 
stay until the fleet be ready. By these means I 
shall have more time to receive intelligence from 
your Excellency concerning the motions of the enemy, and to know, first, if Admiral Pigot is really 
gone with a part of the fleet to the West Indies ; 
secondly, if the counter order for the non-evacuation of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> has really been sent as it is reported; 
thirdly, if this counter order is arrived timely enough 
to hinder the evacuation; on which three objects I 
beg of your Excellency to inform me, as you know 
that on these objects depends the embarkation of the 
troops, or their not embarking. 
</p><p>
I shall leave two hussars at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and two at 
Voluntown, to bring me your Excellency's letters at 
<a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>. I am, with respect and personal attachment. Sir,

Sir, 
</p><p>
The legion of Lauzun had began to march, when very cold weather came on, and the ground was covered with snow six inches deep. As, by the intelligences I had from your Excellency, and those I got 
from the flag, it appears that the reenforcement from 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> for <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> does not exceed thirteen 
hundred men, I have not judged this rapid movement 
of the legion quite necessary, when, in these melted 
snows, all its equipments, both of horse and foot, 
would have been utterly spoiled; and therefore have 
ordered it into its quarters again, until the weather 
be milder. In the mean time, I hope I shall receive 
your Excellency's answer. 
</p><p>
The news I had from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> by the flag are, 
that all the men-of-war under sixty-four are gone, a 
month since, to join Admiral Hood ; that there remain only at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> the Lion, commanded by Digby, some fifty and forty-gun ships, and several 
frigates. That is quite sufficient to keep the Romulus in awe. They brag, likewise, at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, of an 
immediate large reenforcement from Ireland, with the 
same particulars of two regiments of dismounted dragoons. Though I have not the least faith in it, I 
believe it would be necessary, before we come to 
any resolution, to know whether this storm will take 
its direction to the northward or towards the south. 
It is the same report which was spread in <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, 
and which has alarmed <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>. 
</p><p>
As your Excellency's answer might be long coming, 
by reason of the rivers being full of floating ice, and 
of our not having had any intercourse with the Northern States this fortnight past, I have resolved to send 
back to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> all the convalescents, which it 
will be possible to assemble, that they may be exchanged against our convalescents of the West India 
brigade, taken in the Bonetta. I believe it will be 
better for both to return among their countrymen, 
there to receive the assistance they stand in need of 
I am, with respect and personal attachment. Sir, 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
In the moment I was writing to your Excellency I received a confirmation of the result of the engagement on the 12th of April, which, by all the 
reports from the Cape, Port au Prince, and all the intelligence from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and Jamaica, seems very bad for us.
</p><p>
I was proposing to join that, as there was not as yet 
any plan for the campaign decided at our Court, and 
as I waited, with the greatest impatience, for the arrival of the Duke of Lauzun, I thought that it was 
suitable to march the corps towards <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, that, 
jointly with your army, we might hinder the enemy 
from sending any forces to the aid of Jamaica. These 
bad news quite overthrow that military speculation, 
so that I see no more reason for that march of the French corps to join you, unless there be political 
ones, which I must submit to your reflection and to your order. 
</p><p>
The Captain of a flag, arrived yesterday from New 
York, assures that he had sailed with thirty-six transports, escorted by three ships of war, going to <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>. They are empty, and it is believed they are going to evacuate those places. If that 
be the case, all their forces being assembled there, 
there is nothing more for us to do. If the army 
moves that way, we must assure a protection to 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, where will stay our navy 
and heavy artillery, by a body of militia which Virginia must furnish, to which I would add five [regiments of] French troops; and, considering the resolution of the British Parliament not to carry on an 
offensive war on the Continent, I cannot see any good 
proceeding from the march of the French troops on 
New York. On the contrary, I think it might engage Carleton to send a detachment and make some 
undertaking against our ships, when the army would 
be at a great distance, as he might undertake against 
the French without deviating from the resolution not 
to carry on any longer an ofiensive war on the Continent, to endeavour to reduce America by force. 
Such, Sir, are my observations. I communicate them 
to the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='colleague'>Chevalier De La Luzerne</a>, and submit them to 
the reflections and orders of your Excellency. I am, 
with respect and personal attachment. Sir, your Excellency's

Sir,

The <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> has wrote to the Viscount de Noailles, his brother-in-law, and shows the greatest desire to see him. I find his demand so just, that though I have given leave to several of our Colonels 
to go and wait on your Excellency, I have added 
likewise the Viscount de Noailles, and the Marquis de Damas. If your Excellency does not find a moment to come and see this part of your army, I am 
afraid that the whole of it will desert, so great is 
their desire to see their General. I beg you will be 
persuaded of the extreme desire I would have to receive you here, if you can find an opportunity. The 
<a href='/results.php?tla=cdt' rel='colleague'>Chevalier De Ternay</a> has sent back to-day Mr. Roger, 
Arbuthnot's Lieutenant, who was here for the second 
time as a flag of truce. He had kept him three 
weeks, pretty closely confined in his vessel, to weaken a little his desire of making us a third visit. He 
sends likewise a flag to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, to carry some 
ladies. I am, with respect. Sir, &c.,
