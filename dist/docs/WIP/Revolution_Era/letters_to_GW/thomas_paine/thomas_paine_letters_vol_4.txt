</p><p>
I am made exceedingly happy by the receipt of 
your friendly letter of the 10th instant, which is this 
moment come to hand ; and the young gentleman 
that brought it, a son of Colonel George Morgan, 
waits while I write this. It had been sent to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and on my not being there, was returned, 
agreeably to directions on the outside, to Colonel Morgan at <a href='/results.php?city=princeton' rel='city'>Princeton</a>, who forwarded it to this place. 
I most sincerely thank you for your good wishes and 
friendship to me, and the kind invitation you have 
honored me with, which I shall with much pleasure 
accept. 
</p><p>
On the resignation of <a href='/results.php?tla=rol' rel='colleague friend'>Mr. Livingston</a> in the winter, and likewise of <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Robert Morris</a> , it 
was judged proper to discontinue the matter which took place when you were in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. It was 
at the same time a pleasure to me to find both these gentlemen (to whom I was, before that time, but little known), so warmly disposed to assist in 
rendering my situation permanent; and <a href='/results.php?tla=rol' rel='colleague friend'>Mr. Livingston's</a> letter to me, in answer to one of mine to him, 
which I inclose, will serve to show that his friendship to me is in concurrence with yours. 
</p><p>
By the advice of <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Morris</a>, I presented a letter 
to Congress expressing a request that they would be 
pleased to direct me to lay before them an account 
of what my services, such as they were, and situation, had been during the course of the war. This 
letter was referred to a Committee, and their report 
is now before Congress, and contains, as I am informed, a recommendation that I be appointed Historiographer to the Continent. I have desired some members, that the further consideration of it be postponed, 
until I can state to the Committee some matters 
which I wish them to be acquainted with, both with 
regard to myself and the appointment. And as it 
was my intention, so I am now encouraged by your 
friendship, to take your confidential advice upon it 
before I present it. For, though I never was at a 
loss in writing on public matters, I feel exceedingly 
so in what respects myself 
</p><p>
I am hurt by the neglect of the collective, ostensible body of America, in a way in which it is probable they do not perceive my feelings. It has an effect in putting either my reputation, or their generosity, at stake ; for it cannot fail of suggesting that 
either I (notwithstanding the appearance of service) 
have been undeserving their regard, or that they are 
remiss towards me. Their silence is to me something like condemnation, and their neglect must be justified 
by my loss of reputation, or my reputation supported 
at their injury ; either of which is alike painful to 
me. But, as I have ever been dumb on every thing 
which might touch national honor, so I mean ever to 
continue so. Wishing you. Sir, the happy enjoyment 
of peace, and every public and private felicity, I remain, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obliged and obedient, humble servant,

<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city origin'>Philadelphia</a>, <a rel='day origin' value='2'>2</a> <a rel="month origin" value="10">October</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1783' rel="origin">1783</a>. 
</p><p>
I have drawn up the inclosed with a design of 
presenting it to the Committee to whom a letter of 
mine to Congress was referred, and who have delivered in a report, as mentioned in my former letter 
to your Excellency. I have not read the narrative 
over, since I wrote it. A man's judgment in his own 
behalf, situated as I am, is very likely to he wrong, 
and between the apprehensions of saying too little or 
too much, he probably errs in both. 
</p><p>
What I can best say in favor of it is, that it is 
true, and contains matters which I wish Congress to 
know; and though there is an awkwardness in the 
information coming from me, yet, as it cannot come 
from anybody else, I feel an excuse to myself in 
doing it. I have shown it to no person whatever, 
nor mentioned it to any one except <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Robert Morris</a>, who advised the measure, and for that reason 
wished it to be done without his knowing any thing 
further of it. Therefore, as it is yet in embryo, 
should there be any thing in it that might be thought 
improper, I shall be much obliged to you to point it 
out to me. 
</p><p>
The case, as it appears to me, turns thus. If Congress and the country are disposed to make me any 
acknowledgments, it is right and necessary that they 
should know what the narrative mentions ; and if not, 
it will serve to exculpate me, in the opinion of future Congresses, from the implied demerit which the 
neglect of former ones serve to lay me under. And 
these are the points I chiefly had in view in drawing it up. Mr. Clarke, and Mr. Peters, who are of 
the Committee, were earnest with me to communicate 
myself to them freely ; and had proposed my meetr 
ing them on the Monday on which the alarm of the 
soldiers happened at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. This, of consequence, prevented it, and I then proposed doing it 
in writing; and, therefore, as I am under the obligation of presenting something to the Committee, from 
whom it will probably come before Congress, my 
wish to your Excellency is, that you would give me 
your confidential opinion whether I am acting in or 
out of character, in what I have drawn up for that 
purpose. 
</p><p>
My landlord, where I lodged at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, having removed from the house, occasioned my coming 
to town, to pack up my things; after which I shall 
return to Bordentown. and hope, in a few days, to 
have the happiness to see you well at Rocky Hill. 
I am now at Colonel Biddle's. <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel=''>General Greene</a> is 
come to <a href='/results.php?city=annapolis' rel='city'>Annapolis</a>; and I hope for the opportunity 
of seeing him before I leave town, as I understand 
from Colonel Pettit that his health is on the recovery. 
</p><p>
We have no news here. The definitive treaty and 
treaty of commerce are long in completing. I suppose the British begin to find out the weak part of 
America. The imprudent conduct and publications 
of Rhode Island have, among other things, served to 
show it. The British, I believe, would have had no 
idea of superior advantages in a treaty of commerce, 
had they not discovered that the authority of Congress was not sufficient to control or prevent them. 
</p><p>
Though I am most exceedingly obliged to you for 
your good opinion and kind disposition towards me, 
yet I have not a great deal of expectation from Congress. The constant coldness they have shown in 
every thing which respects me, does not, I am apt 
to think, arise from my not having done enough, but 
too much. Many of them, hitherto, were not friends 
to fame in individuals, and perhaps less so to me, 
because that which I gained, or rather, could not 
avoid, though a service to them, was in a line which 
bordered too nearly on their own. So far as this is 
a reason, it makes the case the harder ; yet I cannot help thinking there is some truth in it. I am, 
with every wish for your health and happiness, your 
Excellency's

Our very good friend, the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>, has intrusted to my care the key of the Bastille, and ti 
drawing handsomely framed, representing the demolition of that detestable prison, as a present to your 
Excellency, of which his letter will more particularly inform. I feel myself happy in being the person 
through whom the Marquis has conveyed this early trophy of the spoils of despotism, and the first ripe 
fruits of American principles transplanted into Europe, to his master and patron. When he mentioned to 
me the present he intended you, my heart leaped with joy. It is something so truly in character, that 
no remarks can illustrate it, and is more happily expressive of his remembrance of his American friends, 
than any letters can convey. That the principles of America opened the Bastille is not to be doubted; and therefore the key comes to the right place. 
</p><p>
I beg leave to suggest to your Excellency the propriety of congratulating the King and Queen of 
France (for they have been our friends) and the National Assembly, on the happy example they are giving to Europe. You will see, by the King's speech, 
which I inclose, that he prides himself on being at the head of the revolution ; and I am certain that 
such a congratulation will be well received, and have a good effect. 
</p><p>
I should rejoice to be the direct bearer of the Marquis's presents to your Excellency, but I doubt I 
shall not be able to see my much-loved America till next spring. I shall therefore send it by some American vessel to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. I have permitted no 
drawing to he taken here, though it has been often requested, as I think there is a propriety that it 
should first be presented. But Mr. West wishes Mr. Trumbull to make a painting of the presentation of the key to you. 
</p><p>
I returned from France to London, about five weeks ago ; and I am engaged to return to Paris, when the Constitution shall be proclaimed, and to carry the 
American flag in the procession. I have not the least doubt of the final and complete success of the French Revolution. Little ebbings and flowings, for 
and against, the natural companions of revolutions, sometimes appear, but the full current of it is, in my opinion, as fixed as the Gulf Stream. 
</p><p>
I have manufactured a bridge (a single arch), of one hundred and ten feet span, and five feet high from the chord of the arch. It is now on board a 
vessel, coming from Yorkshire to London, where it is to be erected. I see nothing yet to disappoint my hopes of its being advantageous to me. It is this 
only which keeps me in Europe ; and happy shall I be, when I shall have it in my power to return to America. I have not heard of <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jefferson</a> since he 
sailed, except of his arrival. As I have always indulged the belief of having many friends in America, or rather no enemies, I have nothing else particularly 
to mention, but my affectionate remembrances to all ; and am. Sir, with the greatest respect.

Sir, 
</p><p>
By Mr. James Morris, who sailed in the May packet, I transmitted you a letter from the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>, at the same time informing you that 
the Marquis had intrusted to my charge the key of the Bastille, and a drawing of that prison, as a 
present to your Excellency. <a href='/results.php?tla=jhr' rel='colleague met'>Mr. J. Rutledge</a>, Jr. had intended coming in the ship. <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> and I had chosen that opportunity for the purpose of transmitting the present ; but the ship not 
sailing at the time appointed, <a href='/results.php?tla=jhr' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Rutledge</a> takes his passage in the packet, and I have committed to 
his care those trophies of liberty, which I know it will give you pleasure to receive. The French revolution is not only complete, but triumphant ; and the 
envious disposition of this nation is compelled to own the magnanimity with which it has been conducted. 
</p><p>
The political hemisphere is again clouded by a dispute between England and Spain ; the circumstances 
of which you will hear before this letter can arrive. A messenger was sent from hence the 6th instant 
to Madrid, with very peremptory demands, and to wait there only forty-eight hours. His return has 
been expected for two or three days past. I was this morning at the Marquis del Campo's ; but nothing is yet arrived. <a href='/results.php?tla=jhr' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Rutledge</a> sets off at four 
o'clock this afternoon ; but, should any news arrive before the making up the mail on Wednesday, June 2d, I will forward it to you under cover. 
</p><p>
The views of this Court, as well as of the nation, so far as they extend to South America, are not for the purpose of freedom, but conquest. They already 
talk of sending some of the young branches to reign over them, and to pay off their national debt with 
the produce of the mines. The bondage of those countries will, as far as I can perceive, be prolonged by what this Court has in contemplation. 
</p><p>
My bridge is arrived, and I have engaged a place to erect it in. A little time will determine its fate; but I yet see no cause to doubt of its success, 
though it is very probable that a war, should it break out, will, as in all new things, prevent its progress, so far as regards profits. 
</p><p>
In the partition, in the box which contains the key of the Bastille, I have put up half a dozen razors, manufactured from cast-steel, made at the works 
where the bridge was constructed, which I request you to accept as a little token from a very grateful heart. I received, about a week ago, a letter from 
Mr. G. Clymer. It is dated the 4th of February, but has been travelling ever since. I request you to acknowledge it for me, and that I will answer it when 
my bridge is erected. With much affection to all my friends, and many wishes to see them again, I am, 
Sir, your much 
</p><p>
Obliged and obedient, humble servant.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I received your favor of last August, by <a href='/results.php?tla=dah' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Humphreys</a> ; since which I have not written to or 
heard from you. I mention this that you may know no letters have miscarried. 
</p><p>
I took the liberty of addressing my late work, 
" Rights of Man," to you ; but though I left it, at 
that time, to find its way to you, I now request your 
acceptance of fifty copies, as a token of remembrance 
to yourself and my friends. The work has had a 
run beyond any thing that has been published in 
this country on the subject of government ; and the 
demand continues. In Ireland it has had a much 
greater. A letter I received from Dublin, 10th of 
May, mentioned that the fourth edition was then on 
sale. I know not what number of copies were printed at each edition, except the second, which was ten 
thousand. The same fate follows me here, as I at 
first experienced in America, — strong friends and 
violent enemies ; but, as I have got the ear of the 
country, I shall go on, and at least show them, what 
is a novelty here, that there can be a person beyond 
the reach of corruption. 
I arrived here from France about ten days ago. 
M. de Lafayette was well. The affairs of that country are verging to a new crisis, — whether the Government shall be monarchical and hereditary, or wholly 
representative. I think the latter opinion will very 
generally prevail in the end. On this question the 
people are much forwarder than the National Assembly. 
</p><p>
After the establishment of the American Revolution, 
it did not appear to me that any object could arise, 
great enough to engage me a second time. I began 
to feel myself happy in being quiet. But I now experience that principle is not confined to time or 
place, and that the ardor of Seventy-six is capable 
of renewing itself I have another work in hand, 
which I intend shall be my last; for I long much to 
return to America. 
</p><p>
It is not natural that fame should wish for a rival. 
But the case is otherwise with me ; for I do most sincerely wish there was some person in this country 
that could usefully and successfully attract the public 
attention, and leave me with a satisfied mind, to the 
enjoyment of quiet life. But it is painful to see 
errors and abuses, and sit down a senseless spectator. 
Of this, your own mind will interpret mine. 
</p><p>
I have printed sixteen thousand copies. When the whole are gone, of which there remain between three 
and four thousand, I shall then make a cheap edition, just sufficient to bring in the price of the printing and paper, as I did by " Common Sense." 
</p><p>
Mr. Green, who will present you this, has been very much my friend. I wanted, last October, to 
draw for fifty pounds on General Lewis Morris, who has some money of mine ; but as he is unknown in 
the commercial line, and American credit not very good and my own expended, I could not succeed, 
especially as <a href='/results.php?tla=gom' rel='colleague'>Gouverneur Morris</a> was then in Holland. <a href='/results.php?tla=dah' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Humphreys</a> went with me to your agent, Mr. Walsh, to whom I stated the case, and took the liberty of saying, that I knew you would not think it a 
trouble to receive it of General Morris, on Mr. Walsh's account. But he declined it. Mr. Green afterwards 
supplied me, and I have since repaid him. He has a troublesome affair on his hands here, and is in danger of losing thirty or forty thousand pounds, embarked under the flag of the United States, in East 
India property. The persons who have received it, withhold it, and shelter themselves under some law 
contrivance. He wishes to state the case to Congress, not only on his own account, but as a matter that may be nationally interesting. 
</p><p>
The public papers will inform you of the riots and 
tumults at Birmingham, and of some disturbances at 
Paris; and, as Mr. Green can detail them to you 
more particularly than I can do in a letter, I leave 
those matters to his information. I am. Sir, with 
affectionate concern for your happiness and Mrs. 
Washington's, &c.,
