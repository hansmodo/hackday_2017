SIR, 
</p><p>
I beg leave to congratulate your Excellency upon 
your being appointed General of the Armies of the 
United Colonies, which hath given sincere pleasure 
to every friend of America, and will, I hope, prove 
glorious to yourself, and be attended with essential 
advantages to your country. 
</p><p>
The General Assembly of this Colony have the 
deepest sense of the necessity of a strict union, and 
the most vigorous efforts, of the Colonies to preserve 
them from unlimited servitude ; and their utmost Exertions in the common cause may be depended upon. 
</p><p>
I also assure your Excellency, that I shall give 
you every possible assistance in my power; and that 
I am with very great regard, Sir, your Excellency's 
Most obedient humble servant,

</p><p>
SIB, 
</p><p>
I am favored with your Excellency's letter of the 
26th instant. Having just before the receipt of it had 
accounts "by a private hand of the sailing of a number 
of men-of-war and transports from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, which I conjectured were designed to supply the enemy with fresh 
provisions, I immediately sent the intelligence to Block 
Island, together with a quantity of powder, ball, and 
flints, to enable them to defend their property, and give 
them assurances of further assistance if necessary. 
</p><p>
We have no account of this fleet from any part of 
our coast; so that I think it probable they were destined to the eastward. 
</p><p>
I desire your Excellency to oblige me with a return 
of the army ; and when any thing of importance occurs, 
I shall esteem an early communication of it a favor. I 
am, with great truth and regard, Sir, your Excellency's 
Most humble and most obedient servant,

SlR, 
</p><p>
Last evening Colonel Porter delivered me your letter of the 4th instant, to which I have paid all the attention the importance of it demands. 
</p><p>
This Colony, the last fall, not confiding entirely in 
the precarious supply of powder that might be expected from the merchants, imported a considerable quantity, though not so large as was ordered. The supplying the inhabitants, who were in a manner utterly 
destitute, the army near <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and our armed vessels, has so exhausted this stock, that the powder now left, which is all in this place, is greatly insufficient to resist even a short attack upon it. Our situation is the same with respect to lead. So that at present none of either article can be spared from the Colony. 
</p><p>
By a vessel, which arrived here on the 30th ultimo from Cape Francois, we are informed that the 
captain of the vessel, sent from this port to the 
Cape for a quantity of warlike stores, in which the 
Committee of Safety for the Colony of the Massachusetts had interested themselves, had executed his 
commission, and was to sail with a large quantity in 
a day or two, so that she may be hourly expected. 
This Colony, about four weeks ago, despatched a 
suitable vessel with money to purchase fifteen tons 
of powder and other warlike stores, which may also 
soon be expected. Of these vessels we have the 
highest reason to think the enemy have gained intelligence ; the ships of war upon this station having for several days past cruised continually off Block Island, and from thence to Montauk Point, and up the Sound. 
</p><p>
This hath made us think it absolutely necessary to 
send the smallest of our armed sloops to cruise with 
out the ships of war, and endeavour, at all hazards, 
to speak with the vessels expected with powder, and 
order them to another port. She will sail this day. 
The other armed sloop, by being within the river, 
prevents the cutters and barges from committing depredations, so that she cannot be spared; nor, indeed, 
is a vessel of her force required for the enterprise 
you mention. 
</p><p>
We have, in this harbour, a very fine sailing packet 
that would answer the purpose extremely well ; which 
might be equipped with swivels, manned with about 
twenty men, and be ready to sail in less than two 
days. But as I do not think it prudent that her sole 
dependence should be upon getting powder at Bermuda, it will be necessary to send a sum of money 
to purchase a quantity at some other port, in case 
of a disappointment at Bermuda. In the present state 
of the Colony, I do not think it probable that a 
sufficient sum can be procured here for that purpose 
before the sitting of the General Assembly ; and there 
fore advise that application be made to the General 
Court of the Massachusetts Bay to advance part of 
the sum necessary. I believe we may be able to 
supply one half the sum here. Colonel Porter hath 
been at Bedford, and along the Eastern Shore, but 
can hear nothing of Harris. He is now bound as far 
as New London, to endeavour to meet with him; but 
is greatly apprehensive that he is fallen into the 
hands of the enemy. 
</p><p>
We have information that several ships of war and 
transports were, the day before yesterday, at New London; and that the country round were alarmed 
and mustering. We also hear that they have taken some stock off the east end of Long Island. 
</p><p>
Sensible of the great scarcity of lead in the country, I some time ago wrote to the Congress of the 
Massachusetts Bay, and to our delegates at the Continental Congress, recommending that a part of the 
large quantity of lead at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> should be immediately brought down; and still think the measure necessary. 
</p><p>
I shall immediately give orders to the Committee 
of Safety to purchase, for the use of the Colony, all 
the tow-cloth that can be had. 
</p><p>
If the powder, supposed to be at Bermuda, be private property, it must be immediately paid for. If 
not, I imagine it will be settled with our other disputes. This is a matter that ought to be known and provided for. 
</p><p>
Upon further consideration, I am very doubtful 
whether a vessel can be immediately provided with 
men here ; and therefore am of opinion that twenty-five or thirty sailors had better be drafted from 
the army, and held in readiness to embark immediately upon the arrival of Harris. 
</p><p>
This letter waits upon you by my son, whom I beg leave to recommend to your favorable notice. I am, with very great esteem, 
</p><p>
Sir, your most obedient 
</p><p>
And most humble servant,

SIR, 
</p><p>
Since my last to you, Mr. Ward, one of the Dele 
gates, hath returned from the Congress. He informs 
me that some of the Bermudians had been at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, soliciting for liberty to import provisions for 
the use of the Island. They gave information of the 
powder mentioned in your letter to me, and were of 
opinion it might be easily obtained. They were told 
by the Delegates, that every vessel they should send 
to the northward with powder should be permitted to 
carry provisions to the Island. Whether their situation will not probably prevent them from bringing 
the powder, I submit to your Excellency. Mr. Porter 
and Mr. Harris are both here. To Mr. Porter, who 
can fully inform you in the matter, I refer you. 
</p><p>
I have forwarded about thirteen hundred pounds 
of lead, which is air that can be procured at present, that article being extremely scarce among us. 
In my last to you, I mentioned that I thought it 
might be brought from <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> with more ease 
than it can be procured in any other way; I am 
still of the same opinion. 
</p><p>
I have given orders to the Committee of Safety 
to purchase all the tow-cloth that is to be bought in 
the Government; but I am afraid the quantity will 
be small, the scarcity of coarse linens in the Colony 
having occasioned a great use of that article in families. I am, with great esteem, Sir, your Excellency's 
Most obedient humble servant,

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letter of the 14th instant is 
now before me, the contents of which I have duly considered. When it came to hand, our small sloop 
of war was out upon the cruise which I mentioned to your Excellency in a former letter. She 
hath since returned. The sending her on the enterprise you propose could not be done without some 
new and further powers from the General Assembly, 
which sat here last week ; and the nature of the 
business was such, that I did not think proper to 
lay it before so large a body. I therefore procured 
a committee to be appointed to transact all business 
necessary for the common safety during the recess 
of the Assembly, particularly with power to employ 
the two vessels of war in such service as they should 
think necessary. The committee is summoned to 
meet this day, before whom I shall lay your letter. 
At present the undertaking appears to me extremely difficult. The most suitable man we have for the 
purpose is confined to his bed by sickness. 
</p><p>
We have accounts that a number of vessels have 
sailed lately from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, which we apprehend are 
designed to plunder the stock along the coast. The 
General Assembly have ordered it all to be removed 
from all the islands in this Colony, excepting Rhode 
Island. We have now about three hundred men employed in that business. I am requested, by the 
General Assembly, to apply to you to give direction 
to the Commissary-General, that all the stock taken 
from the islands that are fit to kill be taken for the 
use of the army, in preference to any stock which 
is secure in the country. The drought hath been 
so severe along the sea-coast this summer, that there 
is no possibility of providing for this stock in any 
other way. 
</p><p>
The scarcity of coarse linens hath caused such a 
demand for tow-cloth for family use, that upon inquiry I find there is scarcely any of that article to 
be had in the Government at any rate. 
</p><p>
The vessel our small sloop was cruising for, arrived 
on the 28th instant at Norwich. She hath brought 
powder, lead, flints, and small arms. What quantity 
of each I am not certain. They are now on their 
way by land. 
</p><p>
This letter waits upon your Excellency by Captain 
Joseph Brown, who is an eminent merchant here, a 
true friend to the liberties of his country, extremely 
well respected among us, and noted for his superior 
mechanical genius. If he hath any thing to propose 
for the service of the common cause, I have no 
doubt of your paying attention to it, and giving it 
the weight it shall appear to you to deserve. I am, 
with very great esteem and regard, Sir, your Excellency's most obedient and

SIR, 
</p><p>
I am favored with your Excellency's letter, of the 
31st of last month, by Captain Baylor, who hath 
purchased the warlike stores imported by Messrs. 
Clarke & Nightingale. The prices appear to be very 
high ; but, considering the cost, expenses, and risk, I 
believe they are as low as can reasonably be expected. 
</p><p>
In the letter I did myself the honor to write you 
by Mr. Brown, I mentioned the extreme scarcity of 
tow-cloth in the Colony. There is indeed none to 
be purchased. 
</p><p>
The Committee, appointed to act during the recess 
of the General Assembly, have given your proposal 
for taking the powder from Bermuda a full consideration, and have come to a resolution to make 
the attempt. Captain Abraham Whipple, the commander of the two armed vessels in the service of 
this Colony, who hath been very ill, but is now 
upon the recovery, hath been consulted, and will 
undertake the enterprise as soon as his health will 
permit. He is deemed the most suitable person to 
conduct it that we have. He requests your Excellency to give him a line under your hand, assuring 
the people of Bermuda that, in case of their assistance, you will recommend it to the Continental Congress to permit them to fetch provisions for the use 
of the Island. He does not propose to make any 
use of it, unless he shall find it utterly impracticable 
to obtain the powder without their assistance. I am, 
with much esteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient Humble servant,

SIR, 
</p><p>
I am to acknowledge the receipt of your Excellency's letter of the 6th instant, and to inform you, 
that, zealous to do every thing in our power to 
serve the common cause of America, the Committee 
have determined, instead of the small armed sloop, 
to send the large vessel, with fifty men, upon the 
Bermuda enterprise ; with orders to Captain Whipple 
to cruise ten days off Sandy Hook for the packet 
expected from England; and, if he is so fortunate as 
to meet her, to put the letters ashore at South 
Hampton, and send them by express to your Excellency. She will sail, wind and weather permitting, 
the beginning of the week. 
</p><p>
There is in this town a Mr. De Ville. a French 
man, who hath made several voyages from this port 
during the last four or five years, and is esteemed a 
person every way well qualified, and to be depended 
upon, for the execution of the plan he proposes. 
He was with Captain Hopkins the last voyage, 
when lie imported the ammunition, &c,, lately purchased of Messrs. Clarke & Nightingale for the 
army; and hath brought with him a set of papers 
to qualify a brig as a French bottom. 
</p><p>
His scheme is to proceed to Bayonne, in France, 
where he is well acquainted, and there to take in a 
load of powder, which he says can be effected in 
three days. This despatch will be so great, that intelligence of the vessel cannot be sent to England 
timely enough for any measures to be taken to intercept her upon her return. I think the plan practicable, and likely to be attended with success. We 
have here a brig, a fast sailer, and otherwise a suitable vessel for the voyage, which will bring about eighty tons, and we will undertake to fit one quarter of her, and to supply the money to purchase one quarter part of the quantity of powder; which is the most we can do here. 
</p><p>
I have written to <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Governor Trumbull</a> upon this subject, and desired him, if the plan meets with his 
approbation, to despatch a trusty person to confer with you upon it ; who can return through <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, and let me know the result, so that we may 
immediately equip the vessel for the voyage. 
</p><p>
I have communicated to Messrs. Clarke & Nightingale that part of your letter that related to them. 
They desire me to present to you their respectful thanks for the polite notice you have taken of them. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with much esteem and

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I am favored with a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Governor Trumbull</a>, in answer to mine proposing a voyage to Bayonne, in which he informs me that the Council of 
the Colony of Connecticut are summoned to meet this day to take the scheme into consideration. This, Sir, is the time to exert ourselves in sending 
to Europe for powder, as the vessels may perform their voyages and return upon this coast in the winter, when the enemy's ships are unable to cruise. 
I have written to our Delegates, strongly recommending it to them to use their influence, that measures 
may be taken to procure sufficient quantities of that necessary article. I have also advised them to move in Congress for opening some lead mines immediately, as the depending upon a precarious supply by sea, when we have such quantities in our own country, seems to me very preposterous. And I believe 
the article in this way will cost us less money than it can be imported for. 
</p><p>
Captain Whipple sailed on Tuesday, with sixty-one men on board; his vessel being clean, and every way in good order. I have given him instructions 
to cruise fourteen days off Sandy Hook for the packet, and, if he is so fortunate as to meet her, to take her at all events; to take out of her the arms, 
ammunition, and warlike stores, and to land the letters at South Hampton, and forward them immediately by express. After the taking of the packet, 
or the expiration of the time, he is immediately to proceed to Bermuda, and, if possible, take the powder into possession, without any communication with 
the inhabitants. I have given to him strictly in charge not to make any use of your Address, unless in case of absolute necessity. 
</p><p>
The noble example set by the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Livery of London, in their late Address to the King, will, I hope, have a good effect in the 
other parts of the kingdom, and, together with the disaffection of the people of Ireland to the iniquitous measures now pursuing against the Colonies, added to 
our own efforts, compel the ministry to depart from their favorite plan of establishing arbitrary power in America.

This letter waits on you by Joshua Babcock, Esq. He is a gentleman of a genteel fortune, a member of our General Assembly, and hath highly distinguished himself in the glorious cause in which America is embarked.

SIR, 
</p><p>
In consequence of your letter of the 18th instant, 
we have sent out our small armed vessel with orders 
to Captain Whipple to relinquish the voyage to Bermuda, and to prolong his cruise for the packet to 
the 6th day of October. 
</p><p>
Agreeably to your advice I have communicated 
the proposed adventure to Bayonne to the Congress, 
and most heartily wish it may be pursued, as the 
ability and integrity of De Ville are perfectly relied 
upon here. The following extract from Governor 
Trumbull's letter to me, of the 18th instant, will in 
form you of his sentiments respecting the enterprise, 
and his reasons for declining to take a part in it. 
</p><p>
"In mine of the 11th instant, in answer to your 
esteemed favor of the 9th, I acquainted you with my 
purpose to lay your letter before my Council, on 
Thursday, the 14th, which I did. They approve your 
proposition ; the way appears to them promising at 
the same time we have advanced money so largely 
for that article, and have great reason to expect a 
supply in a similar method, that they judge it not 
expedient for us to proceed further at this time. It 
is an article which requires our attention, and wish 
every method, that appears probable to obtain it, may 
be pursued. I hope General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> will hearken 
to your application, and suitably encourage and promote your generous design." 
</p><p>
The time for which the combined army was enlisted being nearly expired, it is of great importance 
to provide some method of reenlisting them, in order 
to keep up a sufficient force to restrain the enemy 
during the winter, and to take the field in the 
spring. My anxious concern on this head, which appears to me to be of the last importance, will excuse 
my suggesting to you the necessity of giving it the 
earliest attention, as I greatly fear difficulties may 
arise which will require time to obviate, and I can 
safely assure you of the concurrence of this Colony 
in every prudent measure for the effecting this most 
essential point. I am, with great truth and respect, 
Sir, your Excellency's most humble and 
</p><p>
Most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=nic" rel="me">NICHOLAS COOKE</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. Since the sailing of the small vessel, I 
observe, in the <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> papers, that a packet is 
arrived there from Falmouth, which I take to be the 
same that Captain Whipple was sent after. If so, the opportunity is lost ; but by extending his cruise 
a little longer, he may have a chance for the August packet.

SIR, 
</p><p>
Captain Whipple returned here from his voyage to 
Bermuda on Friday last. He had received authentic 
intelligence of the arrival of the packet at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, 
before the first time limited for his cruise was Expired, and immediately sailed for Bermuda. He had 
light, flattering winds for several days, and when near 
the Island met with a violent gale, which drove him 
three or four degrees to the southward, and occasioned his having a long voyage. He put in at 
the west end of the Island, where the inhabitants, 
taking him to be an armed vessel belonging to the 
King, were thrown into the utmost confusion, and 
the women and children fled into the country ; but 
upon showing his commission and instructions, were 
satisfied, and treated him with great cordiality and 
friendship. They informed him, that, upon the powder being removed, the Governor had given General 
Gage an account of the part they had taken in the 
transaction, who had despatched a sloop of war, and 
a transport of six hundred tons, to take all the pro-visions sent to the Island. They then lay at George 
town, and treated the islanders as rebels. Captain Whipple had five of the King's Council on board 
his sloop, who all assured him, that the inhabitants 
were hearty friends of the American cause, and 
heartily disposed to serve it. As the assistance they 
gave in the removal of the powder hath made them 
obnoxious to the enemy, and reduced them to a disagreeable situation, I think they ought to be treated 
with every mark of friendship. I submit to your 
Excellency the propriety of our representing their 
case to the Continental Congress, and recommending 
them to favor. 
</p><p>
We are fitting out Captain Whipple for a cruise to 
the Eastward, with all possible expedition, which I 
hope will prove more fortunate than his last. I am, 
with acknowledgment of the polite treatment I received from you at <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>, and with great respect,

SIR, 
</p><p>
I have your Excellency's letter of the 17th, which I have laid before the General Committee. Should the force sailed from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> be destined for Rhode 
Island, I tremble for the consequences, as the Colony, 
in its present exhausted state, cannot, without assistance, defend the Island. At their unanimous request, 
I apply to your Excellency for a detachment from 
the Continental Army, of one regiment, to be stationed 
upon Rhode Island, and that you would please to 
appoint a general officer to take the command of the 
whole force there. They also desired me to inform 
you, that General Lee will be very acceptable to the 
Colony, and to request that the general officer who 
may be appointed may set out immediately, to take 
the command of the troops upon the Island, and put 
it in the best posture of defence. 
</p><p>
We have, at head-quarters, about two hundred and 
fifty men, and shall immediately place on there about 
four hundred more, and hold as many more in readiness as possible. I need not point out to you the 
importance of the Island, and the inability of the 
Colony. I am, in great haste, 
</p><p>
Your very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=nic" rel="me">NICHOLAS COOKE</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. Captain Wallace hath hinted, to some of his 
friends, that he expects a reenforcernent daily.

SIR, 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 6th instant I received, and laid 
before the General Assembly. It had great weight; 
and I believe that no supplies to the enemy's ships 
would have been permitted, had it not appeared to 
us that the members of the Continental Congress 
were of opinion that they should be continued. The 
following is an extract from our Delegates on that 
subject. "A Memorial from the Town of Newport, 
forwarded to us by express, having been referred to 
the General Assembly, we now inclose that, with the 
papers pertinent thereto. We should not do justice to the benevolence of Congress, or to the Distressed situation of the town, if we did not acquaint 
you that all the gentlemen, who spoke in this debate, 
expressed the most tender regard for the distressed 
people, and gave it as their opinion that, as long as 
the ships of war now in the harbour could be sup 
plied with fresh provisions, beer, and such like necessaries for their own immediate support, consistently with 
the great principles of the general good and safety 
of America, the town ought to he permitted to furnish them; the greatest care being taken by government that no more than the barely necessary supplies 
be furnished from time to time, lest the common enemy 
in other parts of the Continent should, through them, 
obtain provisions." In consequence of which the 
General Assembly have ordered that Captain Wallace 
should be supplied, as you will see by the inclosed 
vote. But, as he may cannonade, and even burn the 
town, a discretionary power, by a private vote, which 
it is designed should be kept a profound secret, is 
given to the commander of the forces on Rhode 
Island to permit supplies in cases of imminent danger, until the next session, to be holden on the last 
Monday in next month. 
</p><p>
Similar measures to those taken by Connecticut, 
as mentioned in your letter, have been adopted by 
this Colony. Besides- which, the commanding officer 
of any body of Continental troops is empowered to 
impress carriages, &c. 
</p><p>
The General Assembly ordered an Address to the 
Congress, a copy of which I do myself the honor 
to inclose you. We are not without hopes that the 
Congress will take the whole brigade into their service, especially as the necessity, arising from so powerful an invasion, of establishing the whole force we 
have ordered, is clear and manifest. From the nature 
of the Avar, and the circumstances of the Colonies, I 
think every idea of partial and Colonial defence 
ought to be given up. There must be a supreme, 
superintending power, to exert and direct the force 
of the whole, for the defence and safety of all ; other 
wise the exertions and burdens will not only be very unequal, to the greatly endangering the union, 
upon which the welfare of America depends, but 
Colony after Colony may be subdued without the 
chance of making resistances. I shall only add, on 
this head, that unless the Continent enter upon the 
defence of the Colony, it must be abandoned, to the 
great detriment of the common cause. I beg the 
favor of your Excellency seriously to consider this 
matter, and to give us your assistance with the members of the Congress for procuring such a body of 
forces as the interest of this and the United Colonies 
in general shall require. 
</p><p>
We had procured upwards of an hundred blankets, 
which were designed for the army under your immediate command; but the descent upon Prudence 
obliged us to send forty of them to our troops upon 
that Island; and to supply the additional forces, ordered to be raised, will demand every blanket that 
can be spared in the Colony. I am, with great respect and esteem, Sir, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and most humble servant,

SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's favor, in which you assure me 
you will recommend this unhappy Colony to the continental Congress, hath been laid before the General 
Assembly, to whom it gave great satisfaction. 
</p><p>
I inclose you a copy of Colonel Babcock's dismis 
sion. The office of Brigadier-General is still kept 
vacant, in hopes that the brigade will be put upon 
the Continental establishment, and that a Commander-in-chief will be appointed by Congress. 
</p><p>
I also inclose a copy of an act, discharging the inhabitants of this Colony from allegiance to the King of Great Britain, which was carried in the House of Deputies, after a debate, with but six dissentient voices, there being upwards of sixty members present. I may also inform your Excellency, that the Delegates 
from this Colony are instructed and authorized to 
join with the major part of the Delegates in entering  into a treaty with any Prince, State, or Potentate for the security of the Colonies, and to adopt 
any other measures that may be thought prudent and 
effectual. This instruction passed ncm. con. 
</p><p>
The Lower House afterwards passed a vote for 
taking the sense of the inhabitants at large, upon 
the question of Independence ; but the Upper House 
having represented to them, that it would probably 
be discussed in Congress before the sense of the 
inhabitants could be taken, and transmitted to the 
Delegates, in which case the Colony would lose their 
voice, as the Delegates would be laid under the necessity of waiting for instructions from their constituents, and further observed that the Delegates, 
when they should receive a copy of the vote, renouncing  allegiance to the British King, and their instructions, could not possibly be at a loss to know the 
sentiments of the General Assembly, upon this the 
matter was dropped. 
</p><p>
I have also the satisfaction to inform your Excellency that, at a very full town-meeting of the inhabitants of Newport, held last Monday, it was unanimously voted to enter into the defence of the town; 
and last Thursday a considerable body of them began 
to work upon the fort to be erected upon Brenton's 
Point. This happy event, I have great hopes, will 
make us an united people, and root up every seed 
of disaffection in the Colony. 
</p><p>
I take the liberty, once more, to press your Excellency in behalf of the Colony, the defence of which must be abandoned unless we receive assistance from 
the Congress. I am, with great respect, Sir, your 
Most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=nic" rel="me">NICHOLAS COOKE</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. By this day's post I have forwarded to Mr. Hopkins an instruction from the General Assembly, 
directing him to make immediate application to congress to put our troops upon the Continental establishment.

SIR, 
</p><p>
The necessity, which caused the unexpected evacuation of Long Island, hath alarmed the General Assembly of this State, as it seems that communications 
cannot be kept open with an island where the enemy's ships can approach. This hath filled us with 
apprehensions for the town of Newport and the Island 
of Rhode Island, which are of so great importance to 
this and the other United States. Upon which the 
Assembly have thought proper to appoint John collins, Joshua Babcock, and Joseph Stanton, Esqs., a 
Committee to wait upon your Excellency, to acquaint 
you with the state of this Government, and to confer 
with you upon the best measures to be taken for its 
defence, and with respect to the Island of Rhode Is 
land. I beg the favor of your Excellency to treat 
them with the most entire confidence ; and have no 
doubt but that the same disposition which hath always induced you to manifest your regard to this 
State, will induce you to give us your best advice 
and assistance. 
</p><p>
Upon receiving information of the landing of the 
enemy upon Long Island, and a letter from Governor 
Trumbull, acquainting us with your request that a 
body of men might be thrown upon the east end of 
that Island, this State ordered the whole brigade, with 
the two galleys, and a sufficient quantity of provisions 
and ammunition, to proceed to that Island, and ordered them to be replaced by the militia of the State. 
We exerted ourselves to get them in readiness; and 
some of them were under orders to proceed, when 
we received the most uncertain and aggravated accounts of the evacuation of Long Island, which occasioned us to stop the men until we could receive 
intelligence to be depended upon ; which we did not 
gain until the last evening. I beg leave to observe 
to your Excellency the advantages that may accrue 
to the common cause from the several States having 
early and authentic intelligence of all matters of importance that shall happen, and to request your Excellency to favor us with accounts of every thing 
material. I have the honor to be, with every sentiment of esteem and respect, Sir, your Excellency's 
Most obedient, humble servant,
