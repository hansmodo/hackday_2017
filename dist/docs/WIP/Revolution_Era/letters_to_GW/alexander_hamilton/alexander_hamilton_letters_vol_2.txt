DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I lodged last night in the neighbourhood of New 
Windsor. This morning early, I met Colonel Morgan 
with his corps, about a mile from it, in march for 
head-quarters. I told him the necessity of making 
all the despatch he could, so as not to fatigue his 
men too much which he has promised to do. 
</p><p>
I understand, from Colonel Morgan, that all the 
Northern army were marching down on both sides the 
river, and would probably be to-morrow at <a href='/results.php?city=new windsor' rel='city'>New Windsor</a> and this place; and that <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a> had 
held a Council for the general disposition of them, in 
which it was resolved to send you four thousand men. 
and to keep the rest on this side the river. I came 
here in expectation that matters were in such a train 
as to enable me to accomplish my errand without 
going any farther, unless it should be to hasten the 
troops that were on their march. But, on my arrival, I learn from Mr. Hughes, an Aid-de-camp of 
General Grates, that the following disposition of the 
Northern army had taken place. 
</p><p>
General Patterson's, Glover's, and Nixon's brigades, 
and Colonel Warner's Mountain Boys to remain in 
and about <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>; barracks building for them. 
</p><p>
General Poor's brigade, marching down this side of 
the river to join <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a>, will probably be 
here to-morrow. General Learned's brigade, Morgan's 
corps, Warner's brigade of Massachusetts militia, and 
some regiments of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> militia, on their march 
on the west side of the river. 
</p><p>
I have directed <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a>, in your name, 
to send forward, with all despatch, to join you, the 
two Continental brigades and Warner's militia brigade. 
This last is to serve till the latter end of this month. 
Your instructions did not comprehend any militia; 
but as there are certain accounts here that most of 
the troops from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> are gone to reenforce 
General Howe, and as so large a proportion of the <meta>

St Croix, Nov. 11, 1769. 

DEAR EDWARD, 

This serves to acknowledge the receipt of yours per Capt. Lowndes, which was delivered me yesterday. The 
truth of Capt. Lightbowen and Lowndes' information is now verified by the presence of your father and sister, for whose 
safe arrival I pray, and that they may convey that satisfaction to your soul, that must naturally flow from the sight of 
absent friends in health ; and shall for news this way, refer you to them. 

As to what you say, respecting your soon having the happiness of seeing us all, I wish for an accomplishment of 
your hopes, provided they are concomitant with your welfare, otherwise not ; though doubt whether I shall be present or not, for to confess my weakness, Ned, my ambition is prevalent, so that I contemn the grovelling condition of 
a clerk, or the like, to which my fortune condemns me, and would willingly risk my life, though not my character, to exalt my station. I am confident, Ned, that my youth excludes me from any hopes of immediate preferment, nor do I desire it ; but I mean to prepare the way 
for futurity. I'm no philosopher, you see, and may be justly said to build castles in the air ; my folly makes me ashamed, 
and beg you'll conceal it ; yet, Neddy, we have seen such schemes successful, when the projector is constant. I shall conclude by saying, I wish there was a war. 

I am, 

Dear Edward,
 
Yours, 

ALEX. HAMILTON. 

P. S. I this moment received yours by William Smith, 
and pleased to see you give such close application to study.

HAMILTON TO A COMMITTEE OF THE PROVINCIAL CONGRESS. 

Head Quarters, Morristown, April 5th, 1777. 

GENTLEMEN : 

Since my last I have had the pleasure of receiving your 
reply to my two favours of 29th ultimo and 2d current. I 
am happy enough to be able to inform you, that my indisposition, which was the occasion of my brevity when I last 
wrote, is now removed. 

The opinion I advanced respecting the enemy's not moving before the beginning of May, seems to be shaken, though 
not entirely overthrown, by some present appearances. We 
have received information, that they are embarking about 
three thousand men on board of transports, which are lying 
at the Hook, by way of Staten Island. This, it is conjectured, is with a view to the Delaware ; and the supposition 
is confirmed, by the circumstance of a confederacy lately 
detected at Philadelphia, who, among other things, were 
endeavouring, by the temptation of fifty pounds, to engage 
persons as pilots up that river. The extreme difficulties 
they must labour under for want of forage, and the infinite 
hazard they must run by moving with a small body of about 
five thousand men, with an enemy in the rear, incapable of 
sparing any considerable body of troops to form a post behind, and be an asylum to them in case of accident, these 
circumstances will hardly allow me to think they will be 
daring enough to make the attempt at this time. But on 
the other hand, as they know we are in a progressive state 
as to numbers, and other matters of importance, and as they 
have no prospect of early reinforcement, and are in a state 
of uncertainty as to any, from the bustling aspect of European affairs, it is probable they may conceive a necessity of 
making a push at all risks. Perhaps, however, this embarkation is intended for some other purpose ; to make a diversion, or execute some partizan exploit elsewhere. On 
the whole, I find it difficult to believe they are yet ready 
for any capital operation. 

As to your apprehensions of an attempt up the North 
river, I imagine you may discard any uneasiness on that 
score, although it will be at all times advisable to be on the 
watch against such a contingency, it is almost reduced to a certainty, that the principal views of the enemy in the ensuing 
campaign will be directed towards the southward, and to 
Philadelphia more immediately ; of which idea, the discovery before mentioned, with respect to pilots, is no inconsiderable confirmation. Philadelphia is an object calculated to strike and attract their attention. It has all along 
been the main source of supplies towards the war, and the 
getting it into their possession would deprive us of a wheel 
we could very badly spare, in the great political and military machine. They are sensible of this, and are equally 
sensible, that it contains in itself, and is surrounded by a 
prodigious number of persons attached to them, and inimical to us, who would lend them all the assistance they could 
in the further prosecution of their designs. It is also a 
common and well-grounded rule in war, to strike first and 
principally at the capital towns and cities, in order to the 
conquest of a country. 

I must confess I do not see any object equally interesting 
to draw then- efforts to the northward. Operations merely 
for plundering and devastation can never answer their end ; 
and if they could, one part of the continent would do nearly 
as well as another. And as to the notion of forming a 
junction with the northern army, and cutting off the communication between the northern and southern states, I 
apprehend it will do better in speculation than in practice. 
Unless the geography of the country is far different from 
any thing I can conceive, to effect this would require a 
chain of posts, and such a number of men at each, as would 
never be practicable or maintainable, but to an immense 
army. In their progress, by hanging upon their rear, and 
seizing every opportunity of skirmishing, their situation 
might be rendered insupportably uneasy. 

But for fear of mistake, the general has determined to 
collect a considerable body of troops at or about Peekskill, 
which will not be drawn off till the intentions of the enemy 
have acquired a decisive complexion. These will be ready, according to conjunctures, either to proceed northerly or 
southerly, as may be requisite. Every precaution should 
be taken to prevent the boats from being destroyed, by collecting them at the first movement of the enemy under 
cover of one of the forts, or into some inlet, difficult of access and easily defensible with a small number of men. 
The loss of them would be an irreparable disadvantage. 

The enemy's attempt upon Peekskill is a demonstration 
of the folly of having any quantity of stores at places so 
near the water, and so much exposed to a sudden inroad. 
There should never be more there than sufficient to answer 
present demands. We have lost a good deal in this way at 
different" times, and I hope experience will at last make 
us wiser. 

His excellency lately had a visit from the Oneida chief 
and five others. He managed them with a good deal of 
address, and sent them away perfectly satisfied. He persuaded them to go to Philadelphia, but they declined it, 
alleging their impatience to return, and remove the errone



I 

74 

ous opinions of their countrymen, from the misrepresentations of British emissaries, which they were apprehensive 
might draw them into some rash proceedings. They parted, after having made the most solemn protestations of 
friendship and good will. His excellency has been very 
busy all day in despatching the southern post, which has 
prevented me giving him your resolve. It will, no doubt, 
be very acceptable ; and it is with pleasure I inform you, 
that the zeal and abilities of the New- York convention hold 
the first rank in his estimation. 

No news from France, save that the congress have obtained a credit there, for which they can draw bills to the 
amount of 100,000 sterling. This will be extremely serviceable in carrying on a trade with the French. The new 
troops begin to come in. If we can shortly get any considerable accession of strength, we may be able to strike 
some brilliant stroke. 

I am, Gentlemen, with the greatest respect, 
Your most obedient servant, 

A. HAMILTON. 

P. S. We have been some time endeavouring to negotiate a regular cartel ; but it has been lately broken off 
principally on account of Major General Lee. General 
Howe will not allow him to be comprehended under the 
general idea of American prisoners. 

On the 17th of the same month, he again wrote to the 
committee, giving a particular account of the attack of the 
enemy on the American troops commanded by General 
Lincoln, at Boundbrook, and informing them that three of 
the enemy's vessels had entered the Delaware, and that a 
vessel from France had been attacked in the river, and, to 
prevent her falling into their hands, was blown up. 

To aid in counteracting any sudden movement of the 
enemy, Washington extended his army from Morristown 
to the high ground of Middlebrook, a strong position within 
a few miles of New-Brunswick, where the English had collected their principal stores, which enabled him, at the same 
time, to keep up his communication with Philadelphia, 
which he was confirmed in his belief was the enemy's 
ultimate destination. 

The state of the public mind in that city, at this expected invasion, is strongly shown in the following letter from 
Mr. Duer, a very able and eloquent delegate in congress 
from New- York, whose conduct from the commencement 
of the revolution had been marked with boldness and intelligence.

WILLIAM DUER TO ABRAHAM TEN BROECK. 

Philadelphia, April 17, 1777. 

" I am extremely sorry to inform you, that notwithstanding the invasion which threatens this city, a languor prevails amongst the inhabitants of almost all ranks. The 
disputes about their constitution, and a want of vigilance 
and vigour in detecting and defeating the designs of the 
disaffected, have given the malignants a dangerous ascendency. The depreciation of the continental money is astonishingly rapid, and I see, with concern, that no attempts 
are made to check so fatal a measure. You will see by 
the enclosed resolutions of congress of the 14th and 15th 
of April, that they have been under the necessity of supplying an executive authority in this state. 

"By the recess of the Supreme Executive Council, there 
was an absolute interregnum, and if congress had not interposed, this state would have fallen an easy prey to a very 
small body of the enemy's army. Only six hundred and 
eighty-five men at Ticonderoga fit for duty, including one 
hundred and twenty artificers. I have the pleasure to assure the convention, that the state of New- York stands in 
a very high point of light in the eyes of the continent, and 
that General Washington, in his public letters to congress, 
gives the most honourable testimonials in its favour. These, 
sir, are the happy effects of our unanimity and vigour." 

It is also stated, " the disputes in Pennsylvania grew out 
of no want of attachment to the cause, but from disputes 
about the constitution. I wish the establishment of new 
forms of government had been deferred. The union, vigour, and security derived from conventions and committees, 
are not to be found in any state under its new constitution." 

The severe campaign of the preceding year, though one 
of continued successes until the affair of Trenton, had been 
productive of little service to the British cause, excepting 
the capture of New-York ; for the enemy could boast nothing more than the ground which their armies occupied. 
Sir William Howe now judged that the honour of the British arms required some new enterprise worthy of the force 
under his command. 

None seemed more imposing than that of Philadelphia. 
It was regarded as the capital of the country. It was the 
seat of government of Pennsylvania, and the most important 
city of the colonies ; and although, as a military post, its 
possession would yield few advantages, its occupation by an 
enemy would weaken the cause of America in Europe, 
strengthen the hands of the British ministry, and produce, 
he hoped, such a depressing effect on the minds of the Americans, as might predispose them to yield more readily to 
conciliator}' propositions. Having in vain essayed every art 
to bring on a general engagement, and not daring to venture on the bold experiment of crossing the Delaware with 
an enemy in his rear, the English general decided upon a 
new plan of operations. His whole force now exceeded 
forty thousand men ; from these, leaving a sufficient strength 
to protect New- York, he selected eighteen thousand of his 
choicest soldiers, and about the middle of July embarked at 
mboy. During this interval of inactivity, the attention of 
the Americans was principally directed to the operations on 
the northern frontier ; and the advance of one army towards 
Albany, and the embarkation, at the same time, of another 
for an apparently remote expedition, baffled speculation. 
The following letter from Colonel Hamilton, to a friend, 
written at this time, marks the state of opinion. 

<!--Begin Letter-->

Head duarters, Smith's Clove, July 22d, 1777. 

Your favour of the eighteenth, from Saratoga, reached 

me yesterday Your pronouncing Fort Edward among 

the other forts, indefensible, surprises me a little, as it is 
entirely contrary to the representations of several gentlemen of judgment, who have had an opportunity of seeing 
and considering its situation, by whom we have been taught 
to believe that it would be an excellent post, at least for 
checking and retarding Burgoyne's progress. I agree with 
you that our principal strength in the quarter you are, will 
be in the forests and natural strength of the country, and in 
the want of forage, provisions, carriages, &c. in which the 
enemy may easily be thrown, by taking away what there 
are of those articles which you observe have never been in 
great abundance. 

I am doubtful whether Burgoyne will attempt to penetrate far, and whether he will not content himself with harassing our back settlements by parties, assisted by the savages, who, it is to be feared, will pretty generally be 
tempted by the enemy's late successes, to confederate in 
hostilities against us. 

This doubt arises from some appearances that indicate a 
southern movement of General Howe's army, which if it 
should really happen, will certainly be a barrier agains: 
any further impressions of Burgoyne ; for it cannot be supposed he would be rash enough to plunge into the bosom of 
the country without an expectation of being met by General Howe. Things must prove very adverse to us indeed, should he make such an attempt and not be ruined 
by it. I confess, however, that the appearances I allude 
to do not carry a full evidence in my mind ; because they 
are opposed by others of a contradictory kind, and because 
I cannot conceive upon what principle of common sense or 
military propriety Howe can be running away from Burgoyne to the southward. 

It is much to be wished he may, even though it should 
give him the possession of Philadelphia, which, by our remoteness from it may very well happen. In this case we 
may not only, if we think proper, retaliate, by aiming a 
stroke at New- York ; but we may come upon him with the 
greatest part of our collective force, to act against that 
part which is under him. We shall then be certain that 
Burgoyne cannot proceed, and that a small force of continental troops will be sufficient for that partizan war which 
he must carry on the rest of the campaign. 

A small force will also be sufficient to garrison the posts 
in the Highlands, and prevent any danger there ; so that 
we shall be able to bring nearly the whole of the continental army against Mr. Howe. The advantages of this are 
obvious. Should he be satisfied with the splendour of his 
acquisition, and shut himself up in Philadelphia, we can 
ruin him by confinement. Should he leave a garrison 
there, and go forward, we can either fall upon that or his 
main body, diminished as it will be by such a measure, 
with our whole force There will, however, be many disagreeable consequences attending such an event ; amongst 
which, the foremost is, the depreciation of our currency, 
which, from the importance in which Philadelphia is held, 
cannot fail to ensue. 

I am, dear sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

ALEX. HAMILTON.

TO THE HONOURABLE JOHN HANCOCK, PRESIDENT 
. OF CONGRESS. 

September 18th, 1777, 9 o'clock at night. 
SIR, 

I did myself the honour to write you a hasty line this evening, giving it as my opinion that the city was no longer a place 
of safety for you. I write you again lest that letter should 
not get to hand. The enemy are on the road to Swedes 
Ford, the main body about four miles from it. They sent a 
party this evening to Daviser's ferry, which fired upon me and 
some others in crossing it, killed one man, wounded another, 
and disabled my horse. 

They came on so suddenly, that one boat was left adrift 
on the other side, which will of course fall into their hands, 
and by the help of that, they will get possession of another, 
which was abandoned by those who had the direction of it, 
and left afloat, in spite of every thing that I could do to the 
contrary. These two boats will convey fifty men across at 
a time, so that in a few hours they may throw over a large 
party, perhaps sufficient to overmatch the militia who may be 
between them and the city. This renders the situation of 
congress extremely precarious, if they are not on their guard : 
my apprehensions for them are great, though it is not improbable they may not be realized. 

The most cogent reasons oblige me to join the army this 
night, or I should have waited upon you myself. I am in 
hopes our army will be up with the enemy before they pass 
Schuylkill ; if they are, something serious will ensue. 
I have the honour to be, 
With much respect, 

Sir, your most obedient, 
A. HAMILTON.

Head Quarters, Philadelphia, August 4th, 1777. 

I have been duly honoured by your several favours of the 
25th, 27th, and 30th of July. The misfortune at Ticonderoga, has produced a very disagreeable alteration in our affairs, and has thrown a gloom upon the favourable prospect 
which the campaign previous to that event afforded. But I 
am in great hopes, the ill consequences of it will not continue 
to operate long, and that the jealousies and alarms which so 
sudden and unexpected an accident has occasioned in the 
minds of the people both of your state and to the eastward, 
will shortly subside, and give way to the more rational dictates of self-preservation and regard to the common good. 
In fact, the worst effect of that disaster is, that it has served 
to create those distrusts and apprehensions ; for if the matter were coolly and dispassionately considered, there would 
be found nothing so formidable in Mr. Burgoyne, and the 
force under him, with all his successes, as to countenance 
the least languor or despondency, and experience would 
show that a tolerable degree of vigour in the states more 
immediately interested, would be sufficient to check his 
career, and perhaps convert the advantages he has gained 
into his ruin. But while people continue to view what has 
happened through the medium of supineness or fear, there is 
no saying to what length an enterprising genius may push 
his good fortune. I have the fullest confidence that no endeavours of the council will be omitted to bring your state 
(with the distresses of which I am sensibly affected,) to every 
effort it is capable of making in its present mutilated condition, and they may rely upon it no means in my power will 
be unemployed to co-operate with them in repelling the danger that threatens the state, and through it the continent. 
If I do not give as essential aid as might be wished to the 
northern army, it is not from want of inclination, nor from 
being too little impressed with the importance of doing it. 
It would be the height of impolicy to weaken ourselves too 
much here, in order to increase our strength there, and it must 
certainly be more difficult, as well as of greater moment, to 
control the main army of the enemy, than an inferior, and, I 
may say, dependent one ; for it is pretty obvious, if General 
Howe can be completely kept at bay, and prevented effecting any capital purposes, the successes of General Burgoyne, 
whatever they may be, must be partial and temporary. 
Nothing that I can do shall be wanting to rouse the eastern states, and excite them to those exertions which the exigency of our affairs so urgently demands. I lament that they 
have not yet done more, that so few of their militia have 
come into the field, and that those few have been so precipitate in returning home at this critical period ; but I have, 
nevertheless, great reliance upon those states. I know they 
are capable of powerful efforts, and that their attachment to 
the cause, notwithstanding they may be a little tardy, will not 
allow them long to withhold their aid, at a time when their 
own safety, and that of a sister state, and, in a great measure, 
the safety of the continent, calls for their greatest zeal and 
activity. 

I flatter myself the presence of General Arnold and General Lincoln in the Northern Department will have a happy 
effect upon them. Those gentlemen possess much of their 
confidence, particularly the latter, than whom there is, perhaps, no man from the state of Massachusetts, who enjoys 
more universal esteem and popularity. And in addition to 
that, they are both to be considered as very valuable officers. 
You intimate a wish that some assistance could be drawn 
from the southern states at this time. But while things remain in their present posture, and appearances, however 
illusory they may prove in the issue, afford the strongest reason to keep their force at home, to counteract the seeming 
intentions of General Howe, I could neither ask nor expect 
them to detach succours to the northern states, who are so 
well able to defend themselves against the force they now 
have to oppose. 

I hope an exaggerated idea of the enemy's numbers may 
have no injurious influence on our measures. There is no 
circumstance I am acquainted with that induces me to believe General Burgoyne can have more than five or six 
thousand men; and if the force left in Canada is so considerable as the information you send me makes it, he cannot have even so many. The representations of prisoners 
and deserters in this respect are of little validity ; their 
knowledge is always very limited, and their intentions, particularly the former, very often bad. 

Beyond what regards their own companies, little or no 
attention is due to what they say ; the number of regiments your informant mentions corresponds with other 
accounts ; but the number of men in each company he 
gives the establishment, is not, I am persuaded, their actual 
state. The enemy's army in Canada last campaign, though 
they suffered little by action, must have decreased materially by sickness and other casualties ; and if the recruits 
to them, both from England and Germany bore any proportion to those which have reinforced General Howe, the 
state of their regiments must be greatly inferior to what 
your information holds forth. ******** 

The appointment of General Clinton to the government 
of your state, is an event that, in itself, gives me great pleasure, and very much abates the regret I should otherwise 
feel for the loss of his services in the military line. That 
gentleman's character is such, as will make him peculiarly 
useful at the head of your affairs, in a situation so alarming 
and interesting as that which you now experience. 

These paternal councils had the happiest effect in silencing the jealousies which prevailed at Albany, where the 
arm of the government was invigorated by the personal 
energy of Clinton. 

Schuyler, by a series of masterly movements, and by interposing innumerable obstacles, delayed the progress of 
the enemy, weakened by the diversions of Stark at the 
east, and Willet at the west. The eastern troops, convinced 
of their common interest in repelling the invasion of that 
state, poured in to the aid of New- York; and while the advance of Burgoyne was looked upon with consternation, by 
a series of unparalleled sufferings which no energy could 
surmount, he was gradually broken down, until a brief contest compelled him to surrender at Saratoga ; an event 
which, maturing the confidence that the battle of Germantown had inspired in the councils of France, confirmed her 
determination openly to espouse the cause of the United 
States. 

Intelligence of this event reached the head-quarters of 
Washington at the close of the month of October, a few days 
after his army had removed to Whitemarsh, and he immediately addressed a letter to Gates, in which, after congratulating him on his success, and expressing his regret " that a 
matter of such magnitude should have reached him by report 
only, or through the chance of letters, instead of an authentic communication under his own signature," he says, " Our 
affairs having terminated to the northward, I have, by the 
advice of the general officers, sent Colonel Hamilton, one of 
my aids, to lay before you a full state of our situation, and 
that of the enemy in this quarter. He is well-informed upon the subject, and will deliver my sentiments upon the 
plan of operations that is now necessary to be pursued. I 
think it improper to enter into a detail. From Colonel Hamilton, you will have a clear and comprehensive view of 
things ; and I persuade myself you will do every thing in 
your power to facilitate the objects I have in contemplation." On the 30th of October Colonel Hamilton departed 
under the following instructions :

WASHINGTON TO HAMILTON. 

Head Quarters, Philadelphia county, 30th Oct. 1777. 
DEAR SIR, 

It having been judged expedient by the members of a 
council of war held yesterday, that one of the gentlemen of 
my family should be sent to General Gates, in order to lay 
before him the state of this army and the situation of the enemy, and to point out to him the many happy consequences 
that will accrue from an immediate reinforcement being sent 
from the northern army, I have thought it proper to appoint 
you to that duty, and desire that you will immediately set 
out for Albany, at which place, or in the neighbourhood, I 
imagine you will find General Gates. 

You are so fully acquainted with the principal points on 
which you are sent, namely, the state of our army and the 
situation of the enemy, that I shall not enlarge on those heads. 
What you are chiefly to attend to, is to point out in the clearest and fullest manner to General Gates, the absolute necessity that there is for his detaching a very considerable part 
of the army at present under his command to the reinforcement of this ; a measure that will in all probability reduce 
General Howe to the same situation in which General Burgoyne now is, should he attempt to remain in Philadelphia 
without being able to remove the obstructions in the Delaware, and open a free communication with his shipping. The 
force which the members of the council of war judge it safe 
and expedient to draw down at present, are the three NewHampshire and fifteen Massachusetts regiments, with Lee's 
and Jackson's two of the sixteen, additional. But it is more than 
probable that General Gates may have detained part of those 
troops to the reduction of Ticonderoga, should the enemy not 
have evacuated it, or to the garrisoning of it. If they should, in 
that case the reinforcement will be according to circumstances ; but, if possible, let it be made up to the same number 
out of other corps. If upon your meeting with General 
Gates, you should find that he intends, in consequence of his 
success, to employ the troops under his command upon some 
expedition, by the prosecution of which the common cause 
will be more benefitted than by their being sent down to reinforce this army, it is not my wish to give any interruption 
to the plan. But if he should have nothing more in contemplation than those particular objects which I have mentioned 
to you, and which it is unnecessary to commit to paper, in 
that case you are to inform him that it is my desire that the 
reinforcements before mentioned, or such part of them as 
can be safely spared, be immediately put in motion to join 
the army. 

I have understood that General Gates has already detached Nixon's and Glover's brigades to join General Putnam, and General Dickinson informs me, Sir Henry Clinton has come down the river with his whole force ; if this 
be a fact, you are to desire General Putnam to send the two 
brigades forward with the greatest expedition, as there can 
be no occasion for them there. 

I expect you will meet Colonel Morgan's corps upon their 
way down; if you do, let them know how essential their 
services are to us, and desire the Colonel or commanding 
officer to hasten their march as much as is consistent with 
the health of the men after their late fatigues. 

G. W. 

P. S. I ordered the detachment belonging to General 
McDougal's division to come forward. If you meet them, 
direct those belonging to Greene's, Angel's, Chandler's, and 
Duryee's regiments not to cross Delaware, but to proceed 
to Red Bank.

HAMILTON TO WASHINGTON. 
DEAR SIR, 

I lodged last night in the neighbourhood of New- Windsor. This morning early I met Colonel Morgan with his 
corps, about a mile from it, in march for head quarters. I 
told him the necessity of making all the despatch he could, 
so as not to fatigue his men too much, which he has promised to do. 

I understood from Colonel Morgan, that all the northern 
army were marching down on both sides the river, and 
would, probably, be to-morrow at New-Windsor and this 
place ; and that General Putnam had held a council for 
the general disposition of them, in which it was resolved to 
send you four thousand men, and to keep the rest on this 
side the river. I came here in expectation that matters 
were in such a train as to enable me to accomplish my 
errand without going any farther, unless it should be to 
hasten the troops that were on their march ; but on my 
arrival, I learned from Mr. Hughes, an aid-de-camp of General Gates, that the following disposition of the northern 
army had taken place. 

General Patterson's, Glover's, and Nixon's brigades and 
Colonel Warner's mountain boys to remain in and about 
Albany, barracks building for them. General Poor's 
brigade marching down this side of the river to join General Putnam, will be here probably to-morrow. General 
Learned's brigade, Morgan's corps, Warner's brigade of 
Massachusetts militia, and some regiments of New- York 
militia, on their march on the west side of the river. 

I have directed General Putnam, in your name, to send 
forward with all despatch to join you, the two continental 
brigades and Warner's militia brigade ; this last is to serve 
till the latter end of this month. Your instructions did not 
comprehend any militia, but as there are certain accounts 
here that most of the troops from New- York are gone to 
reinforce General Howe, and as so large a proportion of 
continental troops have been detained at Albany, I concluded you would not disapprove of a measure calculated to 
strengthen you, though but for a small time, and have ventured to adopt it on that presumption. 
Being informed by General Putnam, that General Wynds, 
with seven hundred Jersey militia was, at King's Ferry, with 
intention to cross to Peekskill, I prevailed upon him to relinquish that idea, and send off an immediate order for them 
to march towards Red Bank. It is possible, however, unless your excellency supports this order by an application 
from yourself, he may march his men home, instead of marching them to the place he has been directed to repair to. 

Neither Lee's, Jackson's regiments, nor the detachments 
belonging to General McDougal's division have yet marched. I have urged their being sent, and an order has been 
despatched for their instantly proceeding. Colonel Hughes 
is pressing some fresh horses for me. The moment they 
are ready, I shall recross the river in order to fall in with 
the troops on the other side, and make all the haste I can 
to Albany to get the three brigades there sent forward. 

Will your excellency permit me to observe, that I have 
some doubts, under present circumstances and appearances, 
of the propriety of leaving the regiments proposed to be left 
in this quarter ? But if my doubts on this subject were 
stronger than they are, I am forbid, by the sense of council, 
from interfering in the matter. 

General Poor's brigade is just arrived here ; they will 
proceed to join you with all expedition. So strongly am I 
impressed with the importance of endeavouring to crush 
Mr. Howe, that I am apt to think it would be advisable 
to draw off all the continental troops. Had this been determined on, General Warner's sixteen hundred militia 
might have been left here. 

I have the honour to be, 

With the warmest esteem and respect, 
Your excellency's most obedient servant, 

A. HAMILTON.

HAMILTON TO WASHINGTON. 

Albany, November, 1777. 
DEAR SIR, 

I arrived here yesterday at noon, and waited upon General Gates immediately On the business of my mission, but 
was sorry to find his ideas did not correspond with yours, 
for drawing off the number of troops you directed. I used 
every argument in my power to convince him of the propriety of the measure, but he was inflexible in the opinion 
that two brigades at least of continental troops should remain in and near this place. His reasons were, that the 
intelligence of Sir Henry Clinton's having gone to join 
Howe was not sufficiently authenticated to put it out of 
doubt ; that there was, therefore, a possibility of his returning up the river, which might expose the finest arsenal in 
America (as he calls the one here,) to destruction, should 
this place be left so bare of troops as I proposed, and that 
the want of conveniences and the difficulty of the roads 
would make it impossible to remove artillery and stores 
for a considerable time ; that the New-England states would 
be left open to the depredations and ravages of the enemy ; 
that it would put it out of his power to enterprise any thing 
against Ticonderoga, which he thinks might be done in the 
winter, and which he considers it of importance to undertake. 

The force of these reasons did by no means strike me ; 
and I did every thing in my power to show they were unsubstantial ; but all I could effect was to have one brigade 
despatched in addition to those already marched. I found 
myself infinitely embarrassed, and was at a loss how to act. 
I felt the importance of strengthening you as much as possible ; but, on the other hand, I found insuperable inconveniences in acting diametrically opposite to the opinion of a 
gentleman whose successes have raised him to the highest importance. 

General Gates has won the entire confidence of the eastern states. If disposed to do it, by addressing himself to 
the prejudices of the people, he would find no difficulty to 
render a measure odious, which it might be said with plausibility enough to be believed, was calculated to expose 
them to unnecessary dangers, notwithstanding their exertions during the campaign had given them the fullest title 
to repose and security. General Gates has influence and 
interest elsewhere ; he might use it, if he pleased, to discredit the measure there also. On the whole, it appeared 
to me dangerous to insist on sending more troops from hence, 
while General Gates appeared so warmly opposed to it. 
Should any accident or inconvenience happen in consequence of it, there would be too fair a pretext for censure, 
and many people are too well disposed to lay hold of it. 
At any rate, it might be considered as using him ill, to take 
a step so contrary to his judgment in a case of this nature. 
These considerations, and others which I shall be more explicit in when I have the pleasure of seeing you, determined me not to insist upon sending either of the other brigades remaining here. I am afraid what I have done may 
not meet with your approbation, as not being perhaps fully 
warranted by your instructions ; but I ventured to do what 
I thought right, hoping that at least the goodness of my intention will excuse the error of my judgment. 

I was induced to this relaxation the more readily, as I 
had directed to be sent on two thousand militia which were 
not expected by you, and a thousand continental troops out 
of those proposed to be left with General Putnam, which I 
have written to him since I found how matters were circumstanced here, to forward to you with all despatch. I 
did this for several reasons : because your reinforcement 
would be more expeditious from that place than from this ; 
because two thousand continental troops at Peekskill will 
not be wanted in its present circumstances, especially as 
it was really necessary to have a body of continental troops 
at this place for the security of the valuable stores here, 
and I should not, if I had my wish, think it expedient to 
draw off more than two of the three brigades now here. 

This being the case, one of the ends you proposed to be 
answered, by leaving the ten regiments with General Putnam, will be equally answered by the troops here ; I mean 
that of covering and fortifying the eastern states, and one 
thousand continental troops in addition to the militia collected and that may be collected here, will be sufficient in the 
Highlands for covering the country down that way, and 
carrying on the works necessary to be raised for the defence of the river. 

The troops gone and going to reinforce you are near five 
thousand rank and file continental troops, and two thousand 
five hundred Massachusetts and New-Hampshire militia. 
These, and the seven hundred Jersey militia, will be a larger reinforcement than you expected, though not quite an 
equal number of continental troops, nor exactly in the way 
directed. General Lincoln tells me the militia are very excellent, and though their times will be out by the last of this 
month, you will be able, if you think proper, to order the 
troops still remaining here,to join you by the time their term 
of service expires. 

I cannot forbear being uneasy lest my conduct should 
prove displeasing to you, but I have done what, considering all circumstances, appeared to me most eligible and prudent. Vessels are preparing to carry the brigade to NewWindsor, which will embark this evening. I shall, this 
afternoon, set out on my return to camp, and on my way 
shall endeavour to hasten the troops forward. 
Disappointed in the orders issued by General Gates, Hamilton, in pursuance of the requisition of the commanderin-chief, addressed him on the 5th November, prior to his 
departure from Albany, in the following decisive tone. 

<!--Begin Letter-->

COLONEL HAMILTON TO GENERAL GATES. 

Albany, November 5, 1777. 
SIR, 

By inquiry, I have learned that General Patterson's brigade, which is the one you propose to send, is by far the 
weakest of the three now here, and does not consist of more 
than about six hundred rank and file fit for duty. It is 
true, that there is a militia regiment with it of about two 
hundred, but the time of service for which this regiment is 
engaged is so near expiring, that it would be past by the 
time the men could arrive at their destination. 

Under these circumstances, I cannot consider it either as 
compatible with the good of the service, or my instructions 
from his excellency General Washington, to consent that 
that brigade be selected from the three to go to him, but I 
am under the necessity of desiring, by virtue of my orders 
from him, that one of the others be substituted instead of 
this, either General Nixon's or General Glover's, and that 
you will be pleased to give immediate orders for its embarkation. 

Knowing that General Washington wished me to pay the 
greatest deference to your judgment, I ventured so far to 
deviate from the instructions he gave me, as to consent, in 
compliance with your opinion, that two brigades should 
remain here instead of one. At the same time, permit me 
to observe, that I am not myself sensible of the expediency 
of keeping more than one, with the detached regiments in 
the neighbourhood of this place, and that my ideas coincide 
with those gentlemen whom I have consulted on the occasion, whose judgment I have much more reliance upon than 
on my own, and who must be supposed to have a thorough 
knowledge of all the circumstances. Their opinion is, that 
one brigade and the regiments before mentioned would 
amply answer the purposes of this post. When I preferred your opinion to other considerations, I did not imagine 
you would pitch upon a brigade little more than half as 
large as the others, and finding this to be the case, I indispensably owe it to my duty to desire, in his excellency's 
name, that another may go instead of the one intended, and 
without loss of time. As it may be conducive to despatch 
to send Glover's brigade, if agreeable to you, you will give 
orders accordingly. 

<!--Begin Letter-->

HAMILTON TO WASHINGTON. 
DEAR SIR, 

I arrived here last night from Albany. Having given 
General Gates a little time to recollect himself, I renewed 
my remonstrance on the necessity and propriety of sending 
you more than one brigade of the three he had detained 
with him, and finally prevailed upon him to give orders 
for Glover's in addition to Patterson's brigade to march 
this way. 

As it was thought conducive to expedition to send the 
troops by water as far as it could be done, I procured all 
the vessels that could be had at Albany fit for the purpose, 
but could not get more than sufficient to take Patterson's 
brigade. It was embarked the 7th instant, but the wind has 
been contrary ; they must probably be here to-day. General Glover's brigade marched at the same time, on the 
east side of the river, the roads being much better than on 
this side. I am this moment informed, that one sloop with 
a part of Patterson's has arrived, and that the others are in 
sight. They will immediately proceed by water to King's 
Ferry, and thence take the shortest route. 

I am pained beyond expression to inform your excellency 
that on my arrival here, I find every thing has been neglected and deranged by General Putnam, and that the two 
brigades, Poor's and Learned's, still remain here and on the 
other side of the river at Fishkill. Colonel Warner's militia, I am told, have been drawn to Peekskill, to aid in an expedition against New-York, which it seems is, at this time, 
the hobby-horse with General Putnam. Not the least attention has been paid to my order in your name for a detachment of one thousand men from the troops hitherto stationed at this post. Every thing is sacrificed to the whim 
of taking New- York. 

The two brigades of Poor and Learned, it appears, would 
not march for want of money and necessaries ; several of 
the regiments having received no pay for six or eight 
months past. There has been a high mutiny among the 
former on this account, in which a captain killed a man, 
and was himself shot by his comrade. These difficulties, 
for want of proper management, have stopped the troops 
from proceeding. Governor Clinton has been the only 
man who has done any thing towards removing them, but 
for want of General Putnam's co-operation, has not been 
able to effect it. He has only been able to prevail with 
Learned's brigade to agree to march to Goshen, in hopes 
by getting them once on the go, to induce them to continue 
their march. On coming here, I immediately sent for Colonel Bailey, who now commands Learned's brigade, and 
persuaded him to engage to carry the brigade on to head 
quarters as fast as possible. This he expects to effect by 
means of five or six thousand dollars, which Governor Clinton was kind enough to borrow for me, and which Colonel 
Bailey thinks will keep the men in good humour till they 
join you. They marched this morning towards Goshen. 

I shall, as soon as possible, see General Poor, and do 
every thing in my power to get him along, and hope I shall 
be able to succeed. 

The plan I before laid having been totally deranged, a 
new one has become necessary. It is now too late to send 
Warner's militia ; by the time they reached you, their term 
of service would be out. The motive for sending them, 
which was to give you a speedy reinforcement has, by the 
past delay, been superseded. 

By Governor Clinton's advice, I have sent an order in the 
most emphatical terms to General Putnam, immediately to 
despatch all the continental troops under him to your assistance, and to detain the militia instead of them. 

My opinion is, that the only present use for troops in this 
quarter is, to protect the country from the depredations of 
little plundering parties, and for carrying on the works necessary for the defence of the river. Nothing more ought 
to be thought of. 'Tis only wasting time and misapplying 
men to employ them in a suicidal parade against NewYork, for in this it wil undoubtedly terminate. NewYork is no object, if it could be taken, and to take it would 
require more men than could be spared from more substantial purposes. Governor Clinton's ideas coincide with mine. 
He thinks that there is no need of more continental troops 
here than a few to give a spur to the militia in working 
upon the fortifications. In pursuance of this, I have given 
the directions before mentioned. If General Putnam attends to them, the troops under him may be with you nearly 
as early as any of the others, (though he has unluckily 
marched them down to Tarrytown,) and General Glover's 
brigade, when it gets up, will be more than sufficient to 
answer the true end of this post. 

If your excellency agrees with me in opinion, it will be 
well to send instant directions to General Putnam to pursue the object I have mentioned, for I doubt whether he will 
attend to any thing I shall say, notwithstanding it comes in 
the shape of a positive order. I fear unless you interpose, 
the works here will go on so feebly for want of men, that 
they will not be completed in time ; whereas, it appears to 
me of the greatest importance they should be pushed with 
the utmost vigour. Governor Clinton will do every thing 
in his power. I wish General Putnam was recalled from 
the command of this post, and Governor Clinton would accept it : the blunders and caprices of the former are endless. Believe me, sir, no body can be more impressed with 
the importance of forwarding the reinforcements coming 
to you with all speed, nor could any body have endeavoured to promote it more than I have done ; but the ignorance 
of some, and the design of others, have been almost insuperable obstacles. I am very unwell, but I shall not spare 
myself to get things immediately in a proper train, and for 
that purpose intend, unless I receive other orders from you, 
to continue with the troops in the progress of their march. 
As soon as I get General Poor's brigade in march, I shall 
proceed to General Putnam's at Peekskill.

HAMILTON TO GATES. 

November 12th, 1777. 
SIR, 

Ever since my arrival in this quarter, I have been endeavouring to collect the best idea I could of the state of things in 
New- York, in order the better to form a judgment of the probable reinforcement gone to General Howe. On the whole, 
this is a fact well ascertained, that New- York has been stripped as bare as possible ; that in consequence of this, the few 
troops there and the inhabitants are under so strong apprehensions of an attack, as almost to amount to a panic ; that 
to supply the deficiency of men, every effort is making to excite the citizens to arms for the defence of the city. For this 
purpose, the public papers are full of addresses to them, that 
plainly speak the apprehensions prevailing on the occasion. 

Hence I infer that a formidable force is gone to General 
Howe. The calculations made by those who have had the 
best opportunities of judging, carry the number from six to 
seven thousand. If so, the number gone and going to General Washington is far inferior. five thousand at the utmost. 
The militia were all detained by General Putnam, till it became too late to send them. 

The state of things I gave you when I had the pleasure of 
seeing you, was, to the best of my judgment, sacredly true. 
I give you the present information, that you may decide whether any farther succour can with propriety come from you. 

The fleet, with the troops on board, sailed out of the Hook 
the 5th instant. This circumstance demonstrates, beyond 
a possibility of doubt, that it is General Howe's fixed intention 
to endeavour to hold Philadelphia at all hazards, and removes 
all danger of any farther operations up the North river this 
winter; otherwise Sir Henry Clinton's movement at this 
advanced season is altogether inexplicable. 

If you can with propriety afford any farther assistance, the 
most expeditious mode of conveying it, will be to acquaint General Putnam of it, that he may send on the troops with him, 
to be replaced by them. You, sir, best know the uses to 
which the troops with you are to be applied, and will determine accordingly. I am certain it is not his excellency's wish 
to frustrate any plan you may have in view for the benefit of 
the service, so far as it can possibly be avoided, consistent 
with a due attention to more important objects. 

I am, with respect, sir, your most obedient, 

ALEX. HAMILTON, A. D. C. 

<!--Begin Letter-->

HAMILTON TO WASHINGTON. 

I arrived at this place last night, and unfortunately find myself unable to proceed any farther. Imagining I had gotten 
the better of my complaint which confined me at Governor 
Clinton's, and anxious to be about attending to the march of 
the troops, the day before yesterday I crossed the ferry in order to fall in with General Glover's brigade, which was on its 
march from Poughkeepsie to Fishkill. I did not, however, 
see it myself, but received a letter from Colonel Shepherd, 
who commands the brigade, informing me he would be last 
night at Fishkill, and this night at King's Ferry. Wagons, &c. 
are provided on the other side for his accommodation, so that 
there need be no delay but what is voluntary; and I believe 
Colonel Shepherd is as well disposed as could be wished to 
hasten his march. General Poor's brigade crossed the ferry 
the day before yesterday. Two York regiments, Cortland's 
and Livingston's, are with them : they were unwilling to be 
separated from the brigade, and the brigade from them. 
General Putnam was unwilling to keep them with him, and if 
he had consented to do it, the regiments to replace them 
would not join you six days as soon as these. The troops 
now remaining with General Putnam, will amount to about 
the number you intended, though they are not exactly the 
same. He has detached Colonel Charles Webb's regiment 
to you. He says the troops with him are not in a condition 
to march, being destitute of shoes, stockings, and other necessaries ; but I believe the true reasons of his being unwilling 
to pursue the mode pointed out by you, were his aversion to 
the York troops, and his desire to retain General Parsons with 
him. I am, with much respect and esteem, 

Your excellency's most obedient servant, 

A. HAMILTON.

DEAR SIR, 

I have duly received your several favours from the time 
you left me to that of the 12th instant. I approve entirely of 
all the steps you have taken, and have only to wish that the 
exertions of those you have had to deal with, had kept pace 
with your zeal and good intentions. I hope your health will, 
before this, have permitted you to push on the rear of the 
whole reinforcement beyond New-Windsor. Some of the 
enemy's ships have arrived in the Delaware, but how many 
have troops on board, I cannot exactly ascertain. The enemy has lately damaged Fort Mifflin considerably, but our 
people keep possession, and seem determined to do so to the 
last extremity. Our loss in men has been but small, Captain Treat is unfortunately among the killed. I wish you a 
safe return, and am, dear sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

G. WASHINGTON.

GATES TO WASHINGTON. 

Albany, December 8th, 1777. 
SIR, 

I shall not attempt to describe what, as a private gentleman, I cannot help feeling, on representing to my mind the 
disagreeable situation in which confidential letters, when 
exposed to public inspection, may place an unsuspecting 
correspondent ; but as a public officer, I conjure your excellency to give me all the assistance you can, in tracing 
out the author of the infidelity which put extracts from 
General Conway's letters to me into your hands. 

Those letters have been stealingly copied, but which of 
them, when, and by whom, is to me yet an unfathomable 
secret. 

There is not one officer in my suite, nor amongst those 
who have free access to me, upon whom I could, with the 
least justification to myself, fix the suspicion, and yet my 
uneasines may deprive me of the usefulness of the worthiest men. It is, I believe, in your excellency's power to 
do me and the United States a very important service by 
detecting a wretch who may betray me, and capitally injure the very operations under your immediate directions. 
For this reason, sir, I beg your excellency will favour me 
with the proof you can procure to that effect. But the crime 
being eventually so important, that the least loss of time 
may be attended with the worst consequences, and it being 
unknown to me whether the letter came to you from a member of congress or an officer, I shall have the honour of 
transmitting a copy of this to the president, that the congress 
may, in concert with your excellency, obtain as soon as possible a discovery which so deeply affects the safety of the 
states. Crimes of that magnitude ought not to remain unpunished. I have the honour to be, with the greatest respect, 
Your excellency's most humble 

And most obedient servant, 

HORATIO GATES.

WASHINGTON TO GATES. 

Valley Forge, January 4th, 1777. 
SIR, 

Your letter of the 8th ultimo, came to my hands a few 
days ago, and to my great surprise informed me that a copy 
of it had been sent to congress, for what reason I find myself unable to account ; but as some end, doubtless, was intended to be answered by it, I am laid under the disagreeable necessity of returning my answer through the same 
channel, lest any member of that honourable body should 
harbour an unfavourable suspicion of my having practised 
some indirect means to come at the contents of the confidential letters between you and General Conway. 
I am to inform you, then, that Colonel Wilkinson, on his 
way to congress, in the month of October last, fell in with 
Lord Stirling at Reading, and not in confidence, that I ever 
understood, informed his aid-de-camp, McWilliams, that 
General Conway had written thus to you : " Heaven has 
been determined to save your country, or a weak general 
and bad counsellors would have ruined it." Lord Stirling, 
from motives of friendship, transmitted the account, with 
this remark, " the enclosed was communicated by Colonel Wilkinson to Major McWilliams. Such duplicity of 
conduct I shall always think it my duty to defeat." 

In consequence of this information, and without having 
any thing more in view than merely to show that gentleman 
that I was not unapprized of his intriguing disposition, I 
wrote him a letter in these words : " Sir, A letter which I 
received last night, contained the following paragraph in a 
letter from General Conway to General Gates, he says, 
' heaven has been determined to save your country, or a 
weak general and bad counsellors would have ruined it.' 
I am," &c. 

Neither this letter, nor the information which occasioned 
it, was ever directly or indirectly communicated by me to 
a single officer in this army out of my own family, excepting the Marquis de la Fayette, who having been spoken to 
on the subject by General Conway, applied for, and saw, 
under injunctions of secrecy, the letter which contained Colonel Wilkinson's information. So desirous was I of concealing every matter that could in its consequences give the 
smallest interruption to the tranquillity of this army, or afford 
a gleam of hope to the enemy by dissensions therein. 

Thus, sir, with openness and candour, which I hope will 
ever characterize and mark my conduct, have I complied 
with your request. The only concern I feel upon the occasion, finding how matters stand, is, that in doing this, I have 
necessarily been obliged to name a gentleman whom I am 
persuaded, (although I never exchanged a word with him 
on the subject,) thought he was rather doing an act of justice, than committing an act of infidelity ; and sure I am, 
that till Lord Stirling's letter came to my hands, I never 
knew that General Conway (whom I viewed in the light of a 
stranger to you,) was a correspondent of yours, much less 
did I expect that I was the subject of your confidential letters. Pardon me, then, for adding, that so far from conceiving that the safety of the states can be affected, or in 
the smallest degree injured by a discovery of this kind, or 
that I should be called on in such solemn terms to point out 
the author, that I considered the information as coming from 
yourself, and given with a friendly view to forewarn, and, 
consequently, forearm me against a secret enemy ; or in 
other words, a dangerous incendiary, in which character, 
sooner or later, this country will know General Conway. 
But in this, as in other matters of late, I have found myself 
mistaken. I am, sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

GEO. WASHINGTON. 
The Hon. Major General Gates. 

<!--Begin Letter-->

GATES TO WASHINGTON. 

SIR, 

The letter of the 4th inst. which I had the honour to receive yesterday from your excellency, has relieved me from 
unspeakable uneasiness. I now anticipate the pleasure it 
will give you when you discover that what has been conveyed to you for an extract of General Conway's letter to 
me, was not an information which friendly motives induced a man of honour to give, that injured virtue might be 
forewarned against secret enemies. The paragraph which 
your excellency has condescended to transcribe is spurious. 
It was certainly fabricated to answer the most selfish and 
wicked purposes. 

I cannot avoid sketching out to your excellency the history of General Conway's letter from the time that it came 
to my hands, by Lieutenant-Colonel Troup, my aid-decamp, to whom General Conway delivered it at Reading, 
on the llth of October, to this time, as far as it has affected 
me, and the officers of my family. 

That letter contained very judicious remarks upon that 
want of discipline which has often alarmed your excellency, and I believe all observing patriots. The reasons 
which, in his judgment, deprived us of the success we would 
reasonably expect, were methodically explained by him ; 
but neither the weakness of any of our generals, nor " bad 
counsellors," were mentioned, and consequently cannot be 
assigned or imagined as part of those reasons to which 
General Conway attributed some of our losses. He wrote 
to me as a candid observer, as other officers in every service write to each other for obtaining better intelligence 
than that of newspapers, and that freedom renders such 
letters thus far confidential in some measure. The judgment of the person who received them points out to him, 
according to time and circumstances, the propriety or impropriety attending their being communicated when no 
particular injunction of secrecy was requested. 

Particular actions, rather than persons, were blamed, 
but with impartiality ; and I am convinced that he did not 
aim at lessening, in my opinion, the merit of any person. 
His letter was perfectly harmless : however, now that various reports have been circulated concerning its contents, 
they ought not to be submitted to the solemn inspection of 
those who stand most high in the public esteem. 

Anxiety and jealousy would arise in the breast of very 
respectable officers, who, rendered sensible of faults which 
inexperience, and that alone may have led them into, 
would be unnecessarily disgusted, if they perceived a probability of such errors being recorded. 

Honour forbids it, and patriotism demands, that I should 
return the letter into the hands of the writer. I will do it, 
but at the same time I declare that the paragraph conveyed 
to your excellency as a genuine part of it, was in words as 
well as in substance, a wicked forgery. 

About the beginning of December I was informed that 
letter had occasioned an explanation between your excellency and that gentleman. Not knowing whether the whole 
letter or part of it had been stealingly copied, but fearing 
malice had altered its original features, I own, sir, that a 
dread of the mischiefs which might attend the forgery I 
suspected would be made, put me for some time in a most 
painful situation. When I communicated to the officers in 
my family the intelligence I had received, they all entreated me to rescue their characters from the suspicions they 
justly conceived themselves liable to until the guilty person 
should be known. To facilitate the discovery, I wrote your 
excellency; but unable to learn whether General Conway's letter had been transmitted to you by a member of 
congress, or a gentleman hi the army, I was afraid much 
time would be lost in the course of the inquiry, and that the 
states might receive some capital injury from the infidelity 
of the person who I thought had stolen a copy of the obnoxious letter, was it not probable that the secrets of the 
army might be attained and betrayed through the same 
means to the enemy ? 

For this reason, sir, not doubting that congress would 
most cheerfully concur with you in tracing out the criminal, I wrote to the president, and enclosed to him a copy of 
my letter to your excellency. 

About the same time I was forwarding these letters, Brigadier General Wilkinson returned to Albany. I informed 
him of the treachery which had been committed, but I concealed from him the measures I was pursuing to unmask 
the author. Wilkinson answered, he was assured it never 
would come to light, and endeavoured to fix my suspicions on Lieutenant-Colonel Troup, who said he might 
have incautiously conversed on the substance of General 
Conway's letter with Colonel Hamilton, whom you had 
sent not long before to Albany. I did not listen to this insinuation against your aid-de-camp and mine. I considered 
it ungenerous ; but the light your excellency has just assisted me with, exhibiting the many qualifications which 
are necessarily blended together by the head and heart of 
General Wilkinson, I would not omit this fact. It would 
enable your excellency to judge whether or not he would 
scruple to make such a forgery as that which he now stands 
charged with, and ought to be exemplarily punished. To 
attempt sowing dissensions among the principal officers of 
the army, and rendering them odious to each other by false 
suggestions and forgeries, is, in my opinion, a crime of the 
first magnitude, and involves with it all the consequences of 
positive treason. That the forgery now in view was machinated for injuring General Conway, and perhaps myself, 
in your judgment, is now evident to me ; and I trust the 
detection will operate, as it ought to operate, upon your excellency, as well as the members of the congress before 
whom your letter necessitates me to lay this answer. The 
station of the calumniator seems to justify your excellency 
for having believed till now that the extract was genuine : 
and yet, sir, I cannot help wishing you had sent me a copy 
of it immediately after your explanation with General 
Conway. 

Would that your excellency's prediction relative to him 
had not been inserted in your letter which came to me unsealed, through the hands of congress. I sincerely wish the 
detection of this forgery may render us all more cautious ; 
and that to procure a fair and dispassionate explanation 
whenever insinuations are made to the prejudice of respected characters, may become an established rule in society, 
as well as in public business throughout the United States. 
I am with unfeigned respect, sir, 

Your excellency's most humble and 
Most obedient servant, 

HORATIO GATES.

WASHINGTON TO GATES. 

Head Quarters, Valley Forge, February 9th, 1778. 

SIR: 

I was duly favoured with your letter of the 23d last month, to which I should have replied sooner, had I not 
been delayed by business that required my more immediate attention. 

It is my wish to give implicit credit to the assurances of 
every gentleman ; but on the subject of our present correspondence, I am sorry to confess, there happens to be 
some unlucky circumstances which involuntarily compel 
me to consider the discovery you mention, not so satisfactory and conclusive as you seem to think it.* 

* In a private letter from General Washington to Mr. Jay, dated April 14, 
1779, he observes, " I discovered very early in the war, symptoms of coldness 
and constraint in General Gates' behaviour to me. These increased as he rose 
into greater consequence, but we did not come to a direct breach till the beginning of last year. This was occasioned by a correspondence, which I thought 
made rather free with me, between him and General Conway, which accidentally came to my knowledge. The particulars of this affair, you will find 
delineated in the packet herewith, endorsed ' Papers respecting General ConI am so unhappy as to find no small difficulty in reconciling the spirit and import of your different letters, and 
sometimes the different parts of the same letter with each 
other. 

It is not unreasonable to presume, that your first information of my having notice of General Conway's letter, came 
from himself; there were very few in the secret, and it is 
natural to suppose, that he being immediately concerned, 
would be the most interested to convey the intelligence to 
you. It is also far from improbable, that he acquainted you 
with the substance of the passage communicated to me ; 
one would expect this, if he believed it to be spurious, in 
order to ascertain the imposition and evince his innocence, 
especially as he seemed to be under some uncertainty as to 
the precise contents of what he had written, when I signified my knowledge of the matter to him. If he neglected 
doing it, the omission cannot easily be interpreted into any 
thing else than a consciousness of the reality of the extract, 
if not literally, at least substantially. If he did not neglect 
it, it must appear somewhat strange that the forgery remained so long undetected, and that your first letter to me 
from Albany, of the eighth of December, should tacitly recognise the genuineness of the paragraph in question; while 
your only concern at that time seemed to be, the " tracing 
out the author of the infidelity, which put extracts of General Conway's letters into my hands." Throughout the 
whole of that letter, the reality of the extracts is, by the fairest implication, allowed, and your only solicitude was to find 
out the person who brought them to light. After making 
the most earnest pursuit of the author of the supposed 
treachery, without saying a word about the truth or falsehood of the passage, your letter of the twenty-third ultimo, 

way.' Besides the evidence contained in them of the genuineness of the offensive correspondence, / have other proems still more convincing, which having 
been given me in a confidential way, I am not at liberty to impart." 
to my great surprise, proclaims it in words, as well as substance, a " wicked forgery." 

It is not my intention to contradict this assertion, but 
only to intimate some considerations, which tend to induce 
a supposition, that though none of General Conway's letters 
to you contain the offensive passage mentioned, there might 
have been something in them too nearly related to it, that 
could give such an extraordinary alarm. It may be said, 
if this were not the case, how easy, in the first instance, to 
declare there was nothing exceptionable in them, and to 
have produced the letters themselves in support of them ? 
This may be thought the most proper and effectual way of 
refuting misrepresentations, and removing all suspicion. 
The propriety of the objections suggested against submitting 
them to inspection, may very well be questioned ; the various reports circulated concerning their contents were, perhaps, so many arguments for making them speak for themselves, to place the matter upon the footing of certainty. 
Concealment, in an affair which had made so much noise, 
though not by my means, will naturally lead men to conjecture the worst, and it will be a subject of speculation 
even to Candour itself. The anxiety and jealousy you apprehend from revealing the letter, will be very apt to be 
increased by suppressing it. It may be asked, why not 
submit to inspection a performance perfectly harmless, and 
of course conceived in terms of proper caution and delicacy? 
Why suppose that " anxiety and jealousy" would have arisen in the breasts of very respectable officers, or that they 
would have been necessarily disgusted at being made sensible of their faults when related with judgment and impartiality by a candid observer ? Surely they could not have 
been unreasonable enough to take offence at a performance 
so perfectly inoffensive, " blaming actions rather than persons," which have evidently no connexion with one another, and indulgently "recording the errors of inexperience." 
You are pleased to consider General Conway's letters 
as of a confidential nature, observing, that "time and circumstances must point out the propriety or impropriety of 
communicating such letters." Permit me to inquire, whether, when there is an impropriety in communication, it is 
only applicable with respect to the parties who are the subject of them ? One might be led to imagine this to be the 
case, from your having admitted others into the secret of your 
confidential correspondence, at the same time that you 
thought it ineligible it should be trusted to those officers 
whose actions underwent its scrutiny. Your not knowing 
whether the letter under consideration " came to me from 
a member of congress or from an officer," plainly indicates 
that you had originally communicated it to at least one of 
that honourable body ; and I learn from General Conway, 
that before his late arrival at York-Town, it had been committed to the perusal of several of its members, and was 
afterwards shown by himself to three more. It is somewhat difficult to conceive a reason, founded in generosity, 
for imparting the free and confidential strictures of this ingenuous censor on the operations of the army under my 
command, to a member of congress ; but, perhaps, " time 
and circumstances pointed it out." It must be indeed acknowledged, that the faults of very respectable officers, not 
less injurious for being the result of inexperience, were not 
improper topics to engage the attention of members of congress. 

It is, however, greatly to be lamented, that this adept in 
military science, did not employ his abilities in the progress 
of the campaign, in pointing out those wise measures which 
were calculated to give us "that degree of success we 
might reasonably expect." The United States have lost 
much by that unseasonable diffidence, which prevented his 
embracing the numerous opportunities he had in council, of 
displaying those rich treasures of knowledge and experirience he has since so freely laid open to you. I will not 
do him the injustice to impute the penurious reserve, which 
ever appeared in him on such occasions, to any other cause 
than an excess of modesty ; neither will I suppose he possesses no other merit than of that kind of sagacity, which 
qualifies a man better for profound discoveries of errors 
that have been committed, and advantages that have been 
lost, than for the exercise of that foresight and provident 
discernment, which enable him to avoid the one and anticipate the other ; but, willing as I am to subscribe to all his 
pretensions, and believe that his remarks on the operations 
of the campaign were very judicious, and that he has sagaciously descanted on many things that might have been 
done, I cannot help being a little sceptical as to his ability 
to have found out the means of accomplishing them, or to 
prove the sufficiency of those in our possession. These 
minutiae, I suspect, he did not think worth his attention, 
particularly as they might not be within the compass of his 
views. 

Notwithstanding the hopeful presages you are pleased to 
figure to yourself of General Conway's firm and constant 
friendship to America, I cannot persuade myself to retract 
the prediction concerning him, which you so emphatically 
wish had not been inserted in my last. A better acquaintance with him than I have reason to think you have had, 
from what you say, and a concurrence of circumstances 
oblige me to give him but little credit for the qualities of his 
heart, of which, at least, I beg leave to assume the privilege of being a tolerable judge. Were it necessary, more 
instances than one might be adduced from his behaviour and 
conversation, to manifest that he is capable of all the malignity of detraction, and all the meanness of intrigue, to 
gratify the absurd resentment of disappointed vanity, or to answer the purposes of personal aggrandizement, and promote the interest of a faction. 

I am, with respect, sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

GEO. WASHINGTON. 

Major General Gates.

GATES TO WASHINGTON. 

SIR, 

I yesterday had the honour to receive your excellency's 
letter of the 9th instant, and earnestly hope no more of that 
time, so precious to the public, may be lost upon the subject of General Conway's letter. Whether that gentleman 
does or does not deserve the suspicions you express, would 
be entirely indifferent to me, did he not possess an office of 
high rank in the army of the United States ; for that reason solely, I wish he may answer all the expectations of 
congress. 

As to the gentleman, I have no personal connexion with 
him, nor had I any correspondence previous to his writing 
the letter which has given offence, nor have I since written 
to him, save to certify what I know to be the contents of 
the letter. He, therefore, must be responsible ; as I 
heartily dislike controversy, even upon my own account, 
and much more in a matter wherein I was only accidentally concerned. In regard to the parts of your excellency's 
letter addressed particularly to me, I solemnly declare, that 
I am of no faction, and if any of my letters, taken aggregately 
or by paragraphs, convey any meaning which, in any construction, is offensive to your excellency, that was by no 
means the intention of the writer. After this, I cannot believef your excellency will either suffer your suspicions, or 
the prejudices of others, to induce you to spend another 
moment upon the subject. 

With great respect, I am, sir, 

Your excellency's most obedient, humble serv't, 

HORATIO GATES.

WASHINGTON TO GATES. 

Valley Forge, February 24th, 1778. 

SIR: 

I yesterday received your favour of the 19th instant. I am 
as averse to controversy as any man ; and had I not been 
forced into it, you never would have had occasion to impute to me even a shadow of a disposition towards it. 
Your repeatedly and solemnly disclaiming any offensive 
views in these matters which have been the subject of our 
past correspondence, makes me willing to close with the 
desire you express, of burying them hereafter in silence ; 
and, as far as future events will permit, oblivion. 

My temper leads me to peace and harmony with all 
men ; and it is particularly my wish to avoid any personal 
feuds or dissensions with those who are embarked in the 
same great national contest with myself; as every difference of this kind must, in its consequences, be injurious. 
I am, Sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

GEORGE WASHINGTON.

<!--Begin Letter-->

HAMILTON TO DUER. 

Head Quarters. 
DEAR SIR : 

I take the liberty to trouble you with a few hints on a 
matter of some importance. Baron Steuben, who will be 
the bearer of this, waits on Congress to have his office arranged upon some decisive and permanent footing. It will 
not be amiss to be on your guard. The Baron is a gentleman for whom I have a particular esteem, and whose zeal, 
intelligence, and success, the consequence of both, entitle 
him to the greatest credit. But I am apprehensive, with 
all his good qualities, a fondness for power and importance, 
natural to every man, may lead him to wish for more extensive prerogatives in his department, than it will be for 
the good of the service to grant. I should be sorry to excite any prejudice against him on this account ; perhaps I 
may be mistaken in my conjecture. The caution I give 
will do no harm, if I am ; if I am not, it may be useful. In 
either case, the Baron deserves to be considered as a valuable man, and treated with all the deference which good 
policy will warrant. 

On the first institution of this office, the General allowed 
him to exercise more ample powers than would be proper 
for a continuance. They were necessary in the commencement ; to put things in a train, with a degree of despatch 
which the exigency of our affairs required ; but it has been 
necessary to restrain them, even earlier than was intended. 
The novelty of the office excited questions about its boundaries ; the extent of its operations alarmed the officers of 
every rank for their own rights. Their jealousies and discontents were rising fast to a height that threatened to 
overturn the whole plan. It became necessary to apply a 
remedy. The General has delineated the functions of the 
inspectorship in general orders, a copy of which will be 
sent to congress. The plan is good, and satisfactory to the 
army in general. 

It may be improved, but it will be unsafe to deviate essentially from it. It is, of course, the General's intention 
that whatever regulations are adopted by him, should undergo the revision, and receive the sanction of congress ; 
but it is indispensable, in the present state of our army, that 
he should have the power, from time to time, to introduce 
and authorize the reformations necessary in our system. 
It is a work which must be done by occasional and gradual 
steps, and ought to be entrusted to a person on the spot, 
who is thoroughly acquainted with all our defects, and has 
judgment sufficient to adopt the progressive remedies they 
require. The plan established by congress, on a report of 
the Board of war, when Conway was appointed, appears to 
me exceptionable in many respects. It makes the inspector 
independent of the commander-in-chief ; confers powers 
which would produce universal opposition in the army, and, 
by making the previous concurrence of the Board of war 
requisite to the introduction of every regulation which should 
be found necessary, opens such a continual source of delay 
as would defeat the usefulness of the institution. Let the 
commander-in-chief introduce, and the legislature afterwards ratify or reject, as they shall think proper. Perhaps 
you will not differ much from me, when I suppose, that so 
far as relates to the Board of war, the former scheme was 
a brat of faction, and therefore ought to be renounced. 

There is one thing which the Baron has much at heart, 
which, in good policy, he can by no means be indulged in : 
it is the power of enforcing that part of discipline, which 
we understand by subordination, or an obedience to orders. 
This power can only be properly lodged with the commander-in-chief, and would inflame the whole army if put 
into other hands. Each captain is vested with it in his 
company, each colonel in his regiment, each general 
in his particular command, and the commander-in-chief 
in the whole. 

When I began this letter, I did not intend to meddle with 
any other subject than the Inspectorship ; but one just 
comes into my head, which appears to me of no small importance. The goodness or force of an army depends as 
much, perhaps more, on the composition of the corps which 
form it, as on its collective number. The composition is 
good or bad, not only according to the quality of the men, 
but in proportion to the completeness or incompleteness of 
a corps in respect to numbers. A regiment, for instance, 
with a full complement of officers, and fifty or sixty men, 
is not half so good as a company with the same number of 
men. A colonel will look upon such a command as unworthy his ambition, and will neglect and despise it ; a 
captain would pride himself in it, and take all the pains in 
his power, to bring it to perfection. In one case, we shall 
see a total relaxation of discipline, and negligence of every 
thing that constitutes military excellence ; on the other, 
there will be attention, energy, and every thing that can be 
wished. Opinion, whether well or ill founded, is the governing principle of human affairs. A corps much below 
its establishment, comparing what it is, with what it ought 
to be, loses all confidence in itself, and the whole army 
loses that confidence and emulation which are essential to 
success. These, and a thousand other things that will occur to you, make it evident, that the most important advantages, attend the having complete corps, and proportional 
disadvantages, the reverse. Ten thousand men, distributed 
into twenty imperfect regiments, will not have the efficiency 
of the same number, in half the number of regiments. The 
fact is, with respect to the American army, that the want 
of discipline, and other defects we labour under, are as 
much owing to the skeleton state of our regiments, as to 
any other cause. What then ? 

Have we any prospect of filling our regiments ? My 
opinion is, that we have nearly arrived to our ne plus ultra. 
If so, we ought to reduce the number of corps, and give 
them that substance and consistency which they want, by 
incorporating them together, so as to bring them near their 
establishment. By this measure, the army would be infinitely improved, and the state would be saved the expense-, 
of maintaining a number of superfluous officers. 

In the present condition of our regiments, they are incapable even of performing their common exercises without joining two or more together, an expedient reluctantly submitted to by those officers who see themselves made second 
in command of a battalion, instead of first, as their commission imports, which happens to every younger colonel 
whose regiment is united with that of an elder. 

What would be the inconveniences, while the officers 
who remain in command, and who might be selected from 
the others on account of superior merit, would applaud 
themselves in the preference given them, and rejoice at a 
change which confers such additional consequence on themselves ? 

Those who should be excluded by the measure, would 
return home discontented, and make a noise, which would 
soon subside and be forgotten among matters of greater 
moment. To quiet them still more effectually, if it should 
be thought necessary, they might be put upon half-pay for 
a certain time. 

If on considering this matter, you should agree with me 
in sentiment, it were to be wished the scheme could be immediately adopted, while the arrangement now in hand is 
still unexecuted. If it is made, it will be rather inconvenient immediately after to unhinge and throw the whole 
system again afloat. 

When you determined on your last arrangement, you did 
not know what success the different states might have had 
in drafting and recruiting. It would then have been improper to reduce the number of corps, as proposed. We have 
now seen their success ; we have no prospect of seeing the 
regiments filled ; we should reduce them. 
, Believe me to be, with great esteem and regard, 
Dear sir, your obedient servant, 

A. HAMILTON. 

<!--Begin Letter-->

WASHINGTON TO GREENE. 

In answer to your favour of the third, I give it clearly 
as my opinion, that no change has happened in our affairs, 
which will justify the least relaxation in any of our military 
preparations, and consequently, that the provisions you have 
been, and are making in your department, ought to be continued in their fullest vigour and extent. 
The intelligence from abroad is extremely favourable, 
and affords us an earnest of success, with proper management, but there is nothing in it that can make it prudent to 
depart in the smallest degree from the exertion we should 
otherwise have made. There may still be business enough 
to call out our most strenuous efforts. Britain is a country 
full of resources. Her interest and connexions in Europe 
are great ; an union within, under a popular administration, which a principle of common danger may produce, 
would render her capable of great internal exertions. 

The storm which now seems to be rising in Europe may 
subside, and a compromise ensue between the contending 
powers, from which a change in the system may result, very 
advantageous to the views of our enemies. All these are 
events which may happen ; and which, if there were no 
other considerations, would make it unwise to suffer ourselves to be lulled into security, or to remit any endeavours 
that may serve to put our military affairs upon the most 
respectable footing possible. 

But it is also to be remembered, that the British army in 
America is still very considerable ; and if collected, would 
be formidable to all the force we should be able to oppose to 
it. In all probability, it will either be withdrawn or assembled at one point, for some vigorous and enterprising push, 
if it were only to make the way for a negotiation. The former is more to be wished than expected. British pride 
would never submit to it, but in the last extremity; and perhaps we should flatter ourselves too much, to suppose that 
extremity exists. If the latter should be the case, remissness 
in our present preparations might be fatal ; or at any rate, 
could not fail to have a very injurious influence. The enemy might obtain successes which would have a most unhappy operation upon the current of our sentiments at home, 
and upon the progress of our negotiations and growing 
friendships abroad. 
If we had nothing to fear from any offensive operations of 
the enemy, policy may require very extensive and important 
offensive operations on our part, which will make it necessary we should be prepared in the amplest manner at all 
points. 

In a word, in what manner so ever the remainder of the 
contest is to be prosecuted, whether it is to depend upon 
fighting or negotiation, a powerful army, well furnished 
with every apparatus of war, will put it in our power to 
meet all contingencies, with confidence and advantage, and 
to pursue the true interests of these States, through any combination of circumstances that shall present itself, with firmness and decision. 

Whether any or what change may happen in the local 
situation of the army, in the approaching campaign, or what 
disposition in your department may be requisite in consequence, are matters which, for particular reasons, I cannot 
yet determine. A council will soon be held, in which will 
be decided a general plan of operations for the army. When 
this is done, you will receive your instructions accordingly : 
in the mean time, you will proceed in the plan already on 
foot. With great esteem, I am, sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

G. W.

HAMILTON TO WASHINGTON. 

Robins' Tavern, 8 miles from Allentown, 12 o'clock. 

SIR, 

" We have halted the troops at this place, eight miles from 
Allentown. The enemy, by our last reports, were four 
miles from this, and had passed the road which turns off 
towards South Amboy, which determines their route towards Shrewsbury. Our reason for halting is, the extreme 
distress of the troops for want of provisions. General 
Wayne's detachment is almost starving, and seem both unwilling and unable to march till they are supplied. If we 
do not receive an immediate supply, the whole purpose of 
our detachment must be frustrated. 

"On my arrival at Cranberry last evening, I proceeded, by 
desire of General the Marquis, immediately to Hyde's 
Town and Allentown, to take measures for co-operating 
with the different parts of the detachments, and to find what 
was doing to procure intelligence. I found every precaution neglected ; no horse was near the enemy, or could 
be heard of till late in the morning ; so that before we could 
send out parties, and get the necessary information, they 
were in full march, and as they have marched pretty expeditiously, we should not be able to come up with them 
during the day, even if we did not suffer the impediment we 
do on the score of provisions. 

" We are entirely at a loss where the army is, which is 
no inconsiderable check to our enterprise. If the army is 
wholly out of supporting distance, we risk the total loss of 
the detachment in making an attack. If the army will 
countenance us, we may do something clever. We feel 
our personal honour, as well as the honour of the army and 
the good of the service, interested, and are heartily desirous 
to attempt whatever the disposition of our men will second, 
and prudence authorize. It is evident, the enemy wish to 
avoid, not to engage us. An officer is just come in, who 
informs he left the enemy's force near five miles off, still in 
march. To ascertain more fully their route, I have ordered a fresh party on their left, and towards the head of their 
column. They have three brigades in rear of their baggage." 
In the after part of the same day he again writes to General Washington, who, at the head of the main body, was 
detained at Cranberry by a heavy storm. 

<!--Begin Letter-->

HAMILTON TO WASHINGTON. 
" SIR, 

"The result of what I have seen and heard respecting the 
enemy is, that they have encamped with their van a little 
beyond Monmouth Court-House, and their rear at Manalapans river, about seven miles from this place. Their 
march to-day has been very judiciously conducted ; their 
baggage in front, and their flying army in the rear, with a 
rear guard of one thousand men about four hundred paces 
from the main body. 

To attack them in this situation, without being supported 
by the whole army, would be folly in the extreme. If it 
should be thought advisable to give the necessary support, 
the army can move to some position near the enemy's left 
flank, which would put them in a very awkward situation, 
with so respectable a body in their rear, and would put it 
out of their power to turn either flank, should they be so 
disposed. Their left is strongly posted ; and I am told 
their right is also. By some accounts, one part of his army 
lies in the road leading from the Monmouth road to South 
Amboy. It is not improbable that South Amboy may still 
be the object. I had written thus far when your letter to 
the Marquis arrived. This puts the matter on a totally different footing. The detachment will march to-morrow 
morning at three o'clock to Englishtown."

The defence made by Lee, was regarded as highly disingenuous ; and as will be seen from the following letter, 
an answer was contemplated by Colonel Laurens, but 
abandoned, from the delicacy due to an officer, whose 
sentence was then before congress. 

MY DEAR HAMILTON, 

You have seen, and by this time considered, General 
Lee's infamous publication. I have collected some hints 
for an answer ; but I do not think, either that I can rely upon 
my own knowledge of facts and style to answer him fully, 
or that it would be prudent to undertake it without counsel. 
An affair of this kind ought to be passed over in total silence, or answered in a masterly manner. 

The ancient secretary is the Recueil of modern history 
and anecdotes, and will give them to us with candour, elegance, and perspicuity. The pen of Junius is in your hand ; 
and I think you will, without difficulty, expose in his defence, letters, and last production, such a tissue of falsehood 
and inconsistency, as will satisfy the world, and put him 
forever to silence. 

I think the affair will be definitively decided in congress 
this day. He has found means to league himself with the 
old faction, and to gain a great many partizans. 

* December 5th, 177S. The votes in congress were as follows : 

Negatives. Messrs. Whipple, N.H.; S. Adams, Lovell, Mass. ; Carmichaei, 
Maryland ; M. Smith, Virginia ; Harnett, N. C. ; Langworthy, Georgia. 

fAffirmalive. Messrs. Frost, N. H. ; Holten, Mass.; Collins, Rhode 
Island; Sherman, Ellsworth, Connecticut; Scudder, New-Jersey; Searle, 
Pennsylvania ; Henry, Maryland ; F. L. Lee, Virginia ; Penn, Williams, N. 
C. ; Laurens, Drayton, S. C. 

Having written a very offensive letter to congress, he was on the 10th of 
January, 1780, dismissed the service. 
Adieu, my dear boy : I shall set out for camp to-morrow.

The introduction of these letters would too much interrupt the progress of this narrative ; but the following will 
be perused with interest, as giving a brief but expressive 
picture of the condition of the soldiers. It is from Fleury, 
dated Light Infantry Camp, Highlands. 

DEAR COL. 

The officers of the two first battalions of light infantry, 
which I actually command, have applied to me for leave to 
run over these craggy mountains barefooted, and beg that I 
would write to head quarters to have an order from his excellency to get a pare shoes for each. The shoes they 
hint to are at New-Windsor, and their intention is to pay 
for. 

" Do not be so greedy for shoes as for my blanket, and 
think that the most urgent necessity has determined their 
application. They are quite barefooted. 

" N. B. As his excellency could form a very advantageous 
idea of our condition in shoes, the appearance of the officers who dined to.-day at head quarters and were not quite 
without, I beg you would observe to him, if necessary, that 
each company has furnished a shoe for their dressing" 

This intimate intercourse with these gentlemen, was often 
turned to a useful purpose. It enabled him to keep up a 
correspondence with France, and gave him the channel for 
many communications which reached her court, free from 
all official formality. With Du Plessis, who was in favour, 
he corresponded in cypher, and it is stated by Colonel 
Fish, as one of the incidents of this intimacy, that Hamilton 
was the first person to suggest the introduction of a French 
army into the United States.

HAMILTON TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

DEAR SIR, 

Colonel Laurens, who will have the honour of delivering 
you this letter, is on his way to South Carolina, on a project which I think in the present situation of affairs there, is 
a very good one, and deserves every kind of support and 
encouragement. This is, to raise two, three, or four battalions of negroes, with the assistance of the government of 
that state, by contributions from the owners, in proportion 
to the number they possess. If you should think proper to 
enter upon the subject with him, he will give you a detail of 
his plan. He wishes to have it recommended by congress 
to the state, and as an inducement, that they would engage 
to take their battalions into continental pay. 

It appears to me, that an expedient of this kind in the 



characterised him, addressed the French government and their ambassador 
here on the subject, urging the advantages which would result to both nations 
from having a French military force in this country. This proposition was 
immediately patronized and enforced by the family and connexions of the Marquis, which were then in power and great influence in France, and adopted by 
that government. I deem it a duty incumbent on me, and a tribute due to his 
memory, that the knowledge of this fact should be recorded as an additional 
evidence of bis pre-eminent services to his country." 
present state of southern affairs, is the most rational that 
can be adopted, and promises very important advantages. 
Indeed, I hardly see how a sufficient force can be collected 
in that quarter without it ; and the enemy's operations 
there are growing infinitely serious and formidable. I have 
not the least doubt that the negroes will make very excellent soldiers, with proper management ; and I w r ill venture 
to pronounce that they cannot be put in better hands than 
those of Mr. Laurens. He has all the zeal, intelligence, and 
enterprise, and every other qualification requisite to succeed in such an undertaking. It is a maxim with some 
great military judges, that with sensible officers, soldiers 
can hardly be too stupid ; and on this principle it is thought 
that the Russians would make the best soldiers in the world 
if they were under other officers than their own. The 
King of Prussia is among the number who maintains this 
doctrine, and has a very emphatic saying on the occasion, 
which I do not exactly recollect. I mention this because I 
have frequently heard it objected to the scheme of embodying 
negroes, that they are too stupid to make soldiers. This is 
so far from appearing to me a valid objection, that I think 
their want of cultivation, (for then- natural faculties are probably as good as ours,) joined to that habit of subordination 
which they acquire from a life of servitude, will enable 
them sooner to become soldiers than our white inhabitants. 
Let officers be men of sense and sentiment, and the nearer 
the soldiers approach to machines, perhaps the better. 

I foresee that this project will have to combat much opposition from prejudice and self-interest. The contempt we 
have been taught to entertain for the blacks, makes us fancy many things that are founded neither in reason nor experience ; and an unwillingness to part with property of so 
valuable a kind, will furnish a thousand arguments to show 
the impracticability or pernicious tendency of a scheme 
which requires such sacrifices. But it should be considered, that if we do not make use of them in this way, the enemy probably will, and that the best way to counteract the 
temptations they will holdout, will be, to offer them ourselves. 
An essential part of the plan is, to give them their freedom with their swords. This will secure their fidelity, animate 
their courage, and, I believe, will have a good influence upon 
those who remain, by opening a door to their emancipation. 
This circumstance, I confess, has no small weight in inducing me to wish the success of the project ; for the dictates 
of humanity and true policy equally interest me in favour 
of this unfortunate class of men. 

When I am on the subject of southern affairs, you will 
excuse the liberty I take in saying, that I do not think measures sufficiently vigorous are pursuing for our defence in 
that quarter. Except the few regular troops of South 
Carolina, we seem to be relying wholly on the militia 
of that and the two neighbouring states. These will 
soon grow impatient of service, and leave our affairs in a 
miserable situation. No considerable force can be uniformly kept up by militia ; to say nothing of the many obvious and well-known inconveniences that attend this kind 
of troops. I would beg leave to suggest, sir, that no time 
ought to be lost in making a draft of militia to serve a 
twelve-month, from the states of North and South Carolina and Virginia. But South Carolina, being very weak 
in her population of whites, may be excused from the draft, 
on condition of furnishing the black battalions. The two 
others may furnish about three thousand five hundred men, 
and be exempted, on that account, from sending any succours to this army. The states to the northward of Virginia 
will be fully able to give competent supplies to the army 
here, and it will require all the force and exertions of the 
three states I have mentioned, to withstand the storm 
which has arisen, and is increasing in the south. 

The troops drafted must be thrown into battalions, and 
officered in the best manner we can. The supernumeraryofficers may be made use of as far as they will go. If 
arms are wanted for their troops, and no better way of 
supplying them is to be found, we should endeavour to levy 
a contribution of arms upon the militia at large. Extraordinary exigencies demand extraordinary means. I fear 
this southern business will become a very grave one. 
With the truest respect and esteem, I am, sir, 
Your most obedient servant, 

ALEX. HAMILTON. 

Head Quarters, March 14, 1779. 

His Excellency John Jay, President of Congress.

LAURENS TO HAMILTON. 

Charleston. 

Ternant will relate to you how many violent struggles I 
have had between duty and inclination how much my 
heart was with you, while I appeared to be most actively 
employed here. But it appears to me that I should be inexcusable in the light of a citizen, if I did not continue my 
utmost efforts for carrying the plan of the black levies into 
execution, while there remain the smallest hopes of success. 

Our army is reduced to nothing almost, by the departure 
of the Virginians. Scott's arrival will scarcely restore us 
to our ancient number. If the enemy destine the reinforcements from Great Britain to this quarter, as in policy they 
ought to do, that number will be insufficient for the security 
of our country. The Governor, among other matters to be 
laid before the House of Assembly, intends to propose the 
completing our continental battalions by drafts from the militia. This measure, I am told, is so unpopular that there 
is no hope of succeeding in it. Either this must be adopted, 
or the black levies, or the state will fall a victim to the improvidence of its inhabitants. 

The House of Representatives have had a longer recess 
than usual, occasioned by the number of members in the 
field. It will be convened, however, in a few days. I intend to qualify, and make a final effort. Oh, that I were a 
Demosthenes ! The Athenians never deserved a more bitter exprobation than our countrymen. 

General Clinton's movement, and your march in consequence, made me wish to be with you. If any thing important should be done in your quarter, while I am doing 
daily penance here, and making successless harangues, I 
shall execrate my stars, and be out of humour with the 
world. I entreat you, my dear friend, write me as frequently as circumstances will permit, and enlighten me 
upon what is going forward. 

Adieu. My love to our colleagues. I am afraid I was 
so thoughtless as to omit my remembrances to Gibbes. 
Tell him that I am always his sincere well-wisher, and hope 
to laugh with him again ere long. Adieu, again. 

Yours ever, 

JOHN LAURENS. 

P. S. You know my opinion of Ternant's value. His 
health and affairs call him to the North. If you can render 
him any services, they will be worthily bestowed. We have 
not hitherto availed ourselves of his zeal and talent.

HAMILTON TO LAURENS. 

" Cold in my professions warm in my friendships I 
wish, my dear Laurens, it were in my power, by actions, 
rather than words, to convince you that I love you. I shall 
only tell you, that till you bid us adieu, I hardly knew the 
value you had taught my heart to set upon you. Indeed, 
my friend, it was not well done. You know the opinion I 
entertain of mankind ; and how much it is my desire to preserve myself free from particular attachments, and to keep 
my happiness independent of the caprices of others. You 
should not have taken advantage of my sensibility, to steal 
into my affections without my consent. But as you have 
done it, and as we are generally indulgent to those we love, 
I shall not scruple to pardon the fraud you have committed, 
on one condition ; that for my sake, if not for your own, 
you will continue to merit the partiality which you have so 
artfully instilled into me. 

" I have received your two letters ; one from Philadelphia, the other from Chester. I am pleased with your 
success so far ; and I hope the favourable omens that precede your application to the Assembly, may have as favourable an issue ; provided the situation of affairs should 
require it, which I fear will be the case. But, both for 
your country's sake, and for my own, I wish the enemy 
may be gone from Georgia before you arrive ; and that 
you may be obliged to return, and share the fortunes of 
your old friends. In respect to the commission which you 
received from Congress, all the world must think your conduct perfectly right. Indeed, your ideas upon this occasion 
seem not to have their wonted accuracy; and you have had 
scruples, in a great measure, without foundation. By your 
appointment as aid-de-camp to the commander-m-chief, 
you had as much the rank of lieutenant-colonel as any officer in the line. Your receiving a commission as lieutenantcolonel, from the date of that appointment, does not in the 
least injure or interfere with one of them ; unless by virtue 
of it you are introduced into a particular regiment, in violation of the right of succession, which is not the case at 
present, neither is it a necessary consequence. As you 
were going to command a battalion, it was proper you 
should have a commission ; and if this commission had 
been dated posterior to your appointment as aid-de-camp, 
I should have considered it derogatory to your former rank, 
to mine, and to that of the whole corps. The only thing 
I see wrong in the affair is this : congress, by their conduct, 
both on the former and present occasion, appear to have 
intended to confer a privilege, an honour, a mark of distinction, a something upon you, which they withheld from 
other gentlemen of the family. This carries with it an air 
of preference, which, though we can all truly say we love 
your character and admire your military merit, cannot fail 
to give some of us uneasy sensations. But in this, my dear, 
I wish you to understand me well. The blame, if there is 
any, falls wholly upon congress. I repeat it, your conduct 
has been perfectly right, and even laudable ; you rejected the offer when you ought to have rejected it, and you 
accepted it when you ought to have accepted it ; and let 
me add, with a degree of over-scrupulous delicacy. It was 
necessary to your project. Your project was the public 
good ; and I should have done the same. In hesitating, 
you have refined on the refinements of generosity. 

" There is a total stagnation of news here. Gates has 
refused the Indian command. Sullivan is come to take it. 
The former has lately given a fresh proof of his impudence, 
his folly, and his *********. 'Tis no great matter ; but a 
peculiarity in the case prevents my saying what. 
" Fleury shall be taken care of. All the family send love. 
In this join the General and Mrs. Washington ; and what is 
oest, it is not in the style of ceremony, but sincerity." 

The departure of D'Estaing leaving little prospect of active operations at the south, Laurens again rejoined the 
staff of Washington. On his return, he thus writes to his 
friend, from Philadelphia, where congress was in session.

LAURENS TO HAMILTON. 

December 18, 1779. 

i 

MY DEAR HAMILTON, 

On my arrival in town, I was informed by the President, 
that congress had suspended the business of appointing a 
secretary to their minister plenipotentiary at Versailles until my return, in hopes that I might still be prevailed upon 
to accept the office. I replied, that I thought my letter upon 
the subject sufficiently explicit, and assured him of my sincere desire to be excused from serving in that capacity at 
the present juncture of our affairs. 

He urged the unanimity of the choice with respect to me 

the difficulty of uniting the suffrages of all parties, in case 
of a new nomination, and the advantages of this union. Several delegates of congress declared to me the embarrassment of congress since I had declined. One, in particular, 
suggested to me his apprehension of interest being made for 
a late delegate of New- York, who is candidate for the office, 
and to whom the world in general allows greater credit for 
his abilities than his integrity ; and said, " he was determined to oppose him with all his influence." When I quitted 
town the sixteenth, these matters crowded into my mind. 
I fell into a train of serious reflections and self-examination, 

endeavoured to investigate whether I had acted consonantly to the xaXov xai ayadov, and fulfilled the duties of a 
good citizen in the transaction. In fine, I agitated the grand 
question, whether a citizen has a right to decline any' office 
to which his countrymen appoint him ; upon what that 
right is founded, and whether it existed in my case. 

After undergoing the severest conflict I ever experienced, sometimes reproaching, sometimes justifying myself, 
pursuing my journey, or turning retrograde, as the arguments on the one side or the other appeared to prevail, I 
determined that I had been deficient in the duties of a good 
citizen. I returned to Philadelphia, communicated my sentiments to the President and two other members ; declared 
to them that I thought it incumbent on me, in the first place, 
to recommend a person equally qualified in point of integrity, and much better in point of ability. That if, unhappily, they could not agree on Colonel Hamilton, and that I 
was absolutely necessary to exclude a dangerous person, or 
to prevent pernicious delays, I should think it my duty to 
obey the orders of congress. The persons now in nomination, are, Colonel Hamilton, Mr. Lovell, Mr. G. Morris, 
Major Stewart. Great stress is laid upon the ability and 
integrity of the person to be employed in this commission. 
I have given my testimony of you in this and the other 
equally essential points. 

My love, as usual. Adieu. 

JOHN LAURENS.

Tappan, October 1, 1780. 

"Buoyed above the terror of death, by the consciousness of a life devoted 
to honourable pursuits, and stained with no action that can give me remorse, 
I trust that the request I make to your excellency, at this serious period, and 
which is to soften my last moments, will not be rejected. 

" Sympathy towards a soldier, will surely induce your excellency, and a 
military tribunal, to adapt the mode of my death to the feelings of a man of 
honour. 

" Let me hope, sir, if aught in my character impresses you with esteem towards me, if aught in my misfortunes marks me as the victim of policy, and 
not of resentment, I shall experience the operation of these feelings in your 
breast, by being informed that I am not to die on a gibbet" 
nerous feelings, nevertheless, seemed wholly to take possession of him, and during all the period of Andre's confinement and trial, he exhausted every means to alleviate his 
sufferings, and to withdraw him from the bitterness of his 
reflections. 

As soon as he was brought in, addressing to a much loved 
friend the unnecessary request, he said, " Major Jackson, 
I have learned that Andre was very kind to you when you 
were a prisoner, will you not visit him ?" Thus awakening 
the sympathies of the army, he turned their resentment 
upon the traitor, to whose criminal arts the British officer 
had unhappily lent himself. The conduct of Andre's captors was the theme of honest pride, and every soldier in the 
camp participated in their triumph ; but when the day of 
his execution came, he was followed only by the brigade on 
duty, and with the exception of those officers who surrounded the scaffold to soothe its victim, not an officer or 
soldier was to be seen as a spectator. All retired to their 
tents, exhibiting that delicacy and sensibility which became 
the soldiers of such a cause. 

It is, indeed, impossible to trace the annals of the revolution without remarking the kind temper of the Americans 
towards their enemies, and the happy commingling of the 
heroic with the milder virtues, both in the army and in the 
people. 

Habituated to all the comforts, indeed luxuries, which 
render the condition of the American commonalty an object of envy among those of less happy regions, and free as 
the wilderness which surrounded them, the aggravated privations that followed the march of war, aggravated by 
the insolent bearing of an enemy, who threatened to visit 
on them the calamities which their own nation had experienced in a former age, and avowed the dispossession of 
the inhabitants, and the disherison of their progeny, as the 
reward promised to the subjugation of rebels, amid rapine and devastation, when even congress felt it necessary 
to advise the people to erect places of refuge in the forest, 
far from their dwellings, for their aged parents, their children, and their wives, yet whenever the instruments of 
these evils fell into their hands, they are seen nursing their 
wounds, fostering them amid their sufferings, and winning 
them by their kindnesses to a detestation of the cause in 
which they had embarked. In vain are sought instances of 
cruelty to the enemy. It would have been too great a violation of public sentiment, and would have doomed its perpetrators to infamy. 

This virtue of a humane people, was followed by its reward. The enemy lost more by desertion than by the 
sword, especially among the mercenaries of the continent ; 
and thus the seeds of those kind feelings were planted in the 
midst of war, which have drawn within the bosom of our 
country, and linked to her institutions, the oppressed of 
every other. 



CHAPTER XII. 

[1780.] 

DURING the series of events which have been related in 
the preceding chapter, the mind of Hamilton, roused to the 
great political questions which engaged so strongly the 
public attention, though oppressed with the various labours 
of his situation, to which the letters of his friends frequently 
advert, turned with eager aptitude to an examination of 
the defects of the existing government, and the remedies 
which might be applied. 

Mere military movements had become of secondary interest ; temporary expedients for the financial embarrassments were sought in vain ; and while the public press 
was engaged in the discussion of transient questions, he 
was looking with intense anxiety to the adoption of some 
great and effectual mean by which the distresses of the 
country might be reached at their sources. 

From his first entrance into the public service, he felt 
the necessity of a more energetic system ; and it was objected to him then, as it has been since, that he looked 
with too fearful an apprehension upon a government merely 
federative and advisory. 

An attempt, the most flagitious, was made on this ground, 
to produce a breach between him and the commander-inchief, which was detected, exposed, and defied with a lofty 
tone of conscious purity.* 

The same sense of the public dangers, influenced in common the minds of Washington and Hamilton ; and while 

* The instrument was Doctor Gordon, author of the History of the American War. 
the former in his addresses to congress was enforcing his 
apprehensions with all the solemnity which the dignity of 
his station authorized, the other, by letters to his friends, 
and by personal solicitation, sought, within a more limited 
sphere, to urge attention to this great object of his just and 
honest solicitude. In a letter to Isaac Sears, with whom 
his intimacy had been formed in the early struggles of NewYork, he thus expresses himself: 

" I was much obliged to you, my dear sir, for the letter 
which you did me the favour to write me since your return 
to Boston. I am sorry to find that the same spirit of indifference to public affairs prevails. It is necessary we should 
rouse, and begin to do our business in earnest, or we shall 
play a losing game. It is impossible the contest can be 
much longer supported on the present footing. We must 
have a government with more power. We must have a 
tax in kind. We must have a foreign loan. We must 
have a bank, on the true principles of a bank. We must 
have an administration distinct from congress, and in the 
hands of single men under their orders. We must, above 
all things, have an army for the war, and an establishment 
that will interest the officers in the service. 

" Congress are deliberating on our military affairs ; but I 
apprehend their resolutions will be tinctured with the old 
spirit. We seem to be proof against experience. They 
will, however, recommend an army for the war, at least as 
a primary object. All those who love their country, ought to 
exert their influence in the states where they reside to determine them to take up this object with energy. The states 
must sink under the burden of temporary enlistments, and 
the enemy will conquer us by degrees during the intervals 
of our weakness. 

"Clinton is now said to be making a considerable detachment to the southward. My fears are high, my hopes low. 
We are told here, there is to be a congress of the neutral 
powers at the Hague, for mediating of peace. God send 
it may be true. We want it ; but if the idea goes abroad, 
ten to one if we do not fancy the thing done, and fall into a 
profound sleep, till the cannon of the enemy awaken us 
next campaign. This is our national character. I am, 
with great regard, dear sir, your most obedient servant, 

A. HAMILTON." 

On these measures he seemed, at this time, perpetually to 
descant. Many of his letters have been lost, others cannot 
be obtained ; but in all that are known, his mind appeared 
intent on the accomplishment of what he early foresaw could 
alone save the country 7 , a re-organization of the government. 

A letter written at this period, to his friend Duane, contains a comprehensive view of the subjects which engrossed 
his thoughts, and will give a clear insight into the character 
of his mind. 

In this will be seen, how early and how deeply he looked 
into the wants of the country ; and with what enlarged ideas 
he projected a form of government, by which congress 
should have complete sovereignty in all that relates to war, 
peace, trade, and finance, and to the management of foreign 
affairs ; reserving merely to the states, that part of internal 
police which relates to the rights of property and life among 
individuals, and to raising money by internal taxes, the 
distribution of the powers of the government into separate 
departments, recruiting the army on a permanent establishment, and an extensive and comprehensive system for 
drawing out the resources of the country, and rendering 
them most effectually applicable to its necessities. 

The admirable perspicuity of his style, the extraordinary 
faculty which he showed in what he terms " a hastily written production," and when, as he says, " he is merely skimming the surface," of comprehending in a summary of his 
thoughts every particular essential to the developement of 
them ; but what will be especially observed, the ripeness of 
his views, and that keen insight into the nature and operation of political institutions, which have given to his opinions 
such an authoritative influence, are here strongly manifested. 
He not only suggests the adoption of many of the leading 
measures which were soon after introduced, but points to a 
CONVENTION OF THE STATES, for the creation of a FEDERAL 
CONSTITUTION ; suggests the mode of enforcing its necessity 
on the minds of the people, by " sensible and popular writings;" thus hinting at the idea which gave birth to the "Federalist," and unfolding some of those far-reaching views of 
national polity, which are there more fully developed.

COLONEL HAMILTON TO THE HON. JAMES DUANE. 

Liberty Pole, 1780. 
DEAR SIR, 

Agreeable to your request, and my promise, I sit down to 
give you my ideas of the defects of our present system, and 
the changes necessary to save us from ruin. They may, 
perhaps, be the reveries of a projector, rather than the sober 
view's of a politician. You w r ill judge of them, and make 
what use you please of them. 

The fundamental defect is a want of power in congress. 
It is hardly worth while to show in what this consists, as it 
seems to be universally acknowledged ; or to point out how 
it has happened, as the only question is how to remedy it. 
It may, however, be said, that it has originated from three 
causes, an excess of the spirit of liberty, which has made 
the particular states show a jealousy of all power not in 
their own hands ; and this jealousy has led them to exercise 
a right of judging, in the last resort, of the measures recommended by congress, and of acting according to their own 
opinions of their propriety or necessity; a diffidence in 
congress of their own powers, by which they have been 
timid and indecisive in their resolutions ; constantly making 
concessions to the states, till they have scarcely left themselves the shadow of power ; a want of sufficient means 
at their disposal to answer the public exigencies, and of 
vigour to draw forth those means, which have occasioned 
them to depend on the states, individually, to fulfil their engagements with the army ; the consequence of which has 
been to ruin their influence and credit with the army, to 
establish its dependence on each state, separately, rather 
than on them ; that is, than on the whole collectively. 

It may be pleaded that congress had never any definitive 
powers granted them, and of course could exercise none, 
could do nothing more than recommend. The manner in 
which congress was appointed would warrant, and the public good required, that they should have considered themselves as vested with full power to preserve the republic 
from harm. 

They have done many of the highest acts of sovereignty, 
which were always cheerfully submitted to ; the declaration of independence, the declaration of war, the levying 
an army, creating a navy, emitting money, making alliances 
with foreign powers, appointing a dictator, &c. &c. ; all 
these were implications of a complete sovereignty, were 
never disputed, and ought to have been a standard for the 
whole conduct of administration. Undefined powers are 
discretionary powers, limited only by the object for which 
they were given ; in the present case, the independence 
and freedom of America. The confederation made no 
difference ; for as it has not been generally adopted, it had 
no operation. 

But, from what I recollect of it, congress have even descended from the authority which the spirit of that act gives 
them ; while the particular states have no farther attended 
to it, than as it suited their pretensions and convenience. 
It would take too much tir.ie to enter into particular instances ; each of which, separately, might appear inconsiderable, but united are of serious import. I only mean to 
remark, not to censure. 

But the confederation itself is defective, and requires to 
be altered ; it is neither fit for war, nor peace. The idea 
of an uncontrollable sovereignty in each state, over its internal police, will defeat the other powers given to congress, and make our union feeble and precarious. There 
are instances, without number, where acts necessary for 
the general good, and which rise out of the powers given 
to congress, must interfere with the internal police of the\ 
states ; and there are as many instances in which the particular states, by arrangements of internal police, can effectually, though indirectly, counteract the arrangements 
of congress. You have already had examples of this, for 
which I refer you to your own memory. 

The confederation gives the states, individually, too much 
influence in the affairs of the army ; they should have nothing to do with it. 

The entire formation and disposal of our military forces 
ought to belong to congress. It is an essential cement of 
the union ; and it ought to be the policy of congress to destroy all ideas of state attachments in the army, and make 
it look up wholly to them. For this purpose, all appointments, promotions, and provisions whatsoever, ought to be 
made by them. It maybe apprehended, that this may be 
dangerous to liberty. But nothing appears more evident to 
me, than that we run much greater risk of having a weak 
and disunited federal government, than one which will be 
able to usurp upon the rights of the people. 

Already some of the lines of the army would obey their 
states in opposition to congress, notwithstanding the pains 
we have taken to preserve the unity of the army. If any 
thing would hinder this, it would be the personal influence 
of the General a melancholy a nd mortifying consideration. 
The forms of our state constitutions must always give them 
great weight in our affairs, and will make it too difficult to 
blind them to the pursuit of a common interest, too easy to 
oppose whatever they do not like, and to form partial combinations, subversive of the general one. There is a wide 
difference between our situation and that of an empire under one simple form of government, distributed into counties, provinces, or districts, which have no legislatures, but 
merely magistratical bodies to execute the laws of a common sovereign. Here the danger is, that the sovereign will 
have too much power, and oppress the parts of which it is 
composed. In our case, that of an empire composed of confederative states, each with a government completely organized within itself, having all the means to draw its subjects to a close dependence on itself, the danger is directly 
the reverse. It is, that the common sovereign will not have 
power sufficient to unite the different members together, and 
direct the common forces to the interest and happiness of 
the whole. 

The leagues among the old Grecian republics are a proof 
of this. They were continually at war with each other, and 
for want of union fell a prey to their neighbours. They frequently held general councils, but their resolutions were no 
farther observed, than as they suited the interests and inclinations of all the parties, and, at length, they sunk entirely 
into contempt. 

The Swiss cantons are another proof of the doctrine. 
They have had wars with each other, which would have 
been fatal to them, had not the different powers in their 
neighbourhood been too jealous of one another, and too 
equally matched, to suffer either to take advantage of their 
quarrels. That they have remained so long united at all, 
is to be attributed to their weakness, to their poverty, and 
to the cause just mentioned. These ties will not exist in 
America. A little time hence, some of the states will be 
powerful empires ; and we are so remote from other nations, that we shall have all the leisure and opportunity we 
can wish to cut each other's throats. 

The Germanic corps might also be cited as an example 
in favour of the position. 

The United Provinces may be thought to be one against 
it. But the family of the Stadtholders, whose authority is 
interwoven with the whole government, has been a strong 
link of union between them. Their physical necessities, 
and the habits founded upon them, have contributed to it. 
Each province is too inconsiderable by itself to undertake 
any thing. An analysis of their present constitution would 
show, that they have many ties which would not exist in 
ours ; and that they are by no means a proper model for us. 

Our own experience should satisfy us. We have felt the 
difficulty of drawing out the resources of the country, and 
inducing the states to combine in equal exertions for the 
common cause. The ill success of our last attempt is striking. Some have done a great deal ; others little, or scarcely any thing. The disputes about boundaries, &c. testify 
how flattering a prospect we have of future tranquillity, if 
we do not frame in time a confederacy capable of deciding 
the differences, and compelling the obedience of the respective members. 

The confederation, too, gives the power of the purse too 
entirely to the state legislatures. It should provide perpetual funds in the disposal of congress, by a land tax, poll tax, 
or the like. All imposts upon commerce ought to be laid 
by congress, and appropriated to their use ; for without certain revenues, a government can have no power ; that power which holds the purse strings absolutely, must rule. This 
seems to be a medium, which, without making congress altogether independent, will tend to give reality to its authority. 

Another defect in our system is, want of method and 
energy in the administration. This has partly resulted from 
the other defect ; but in a great degree from prejudice and 
the want of a proper executive. Congress have kept the 
power too much in their own hands, and have meddled 
too much with details of every sort. Congress is properly 
a deliberative corps, and it forgets itself when it attempts 
to play the executive. It is impossible that a body, numerous as it is, constantly fluctuating, can ever act with sufficient decision, or with system. Two thirds of the members, 
one half the time, cannot know what has gone before them, 
or what connexion the subject in hand has to what has been 
transacted on former occasions. The members who have 
been more permanent, will only give information that promotes the side they espouse, in the present case, and will as 
often mislead as enlighten. The variety of business must 
distract, and the proneness of every assembly to debate, 
must at all times delay. 

Lately, congress, convinced of these inconveniences, have 
gone into the measure of appointing boards. But this is, in 
my opinion, a bad plan. A single man, in each department 
of the administration, would be greatly preferable. It would 
give us a chance of more knowledge, more activity, more 
responsibility, and, of course, more zeal and attention. 
Boards partake of a part of the inconveniences of larger assemblies ; their decisions are slower, their energy less, 
their responsibility more diffused. They will not have the 
same abilities and knowledge as an administration by single 
men. Men of the first pretensions will not so readily engage in them, because they will be less conspicuous, of less 
importance, have less opportunity of distinguishing themselves. The members of boards will take less pains to inform themselves and arrive at eminence, because they have 
fewer motives to do it. All these reasons conspire to give 
a preference to the plan of vesting the great executive departments of the state in the hands of individuals. As these men will be, of course, at all times under the direction of 
congress, we shall blend the advantages of a monarchy and 
republic in one constitution. 

A question has been made, whether single men could be 
found to undertake these offices. I think they could ; because there would be then every thing to excite the ambition of candidates. But in order to this, congress, by their 
manner of appointing them, and the line of duty marked 
out, must show that they are in earnest in making these offices, offices of real trust and importance. 

I fear a little vanity has stood in the way of these arrangements, as thotfgh they would lessen the importance of congress, and leave them nothing to do. But they would have 
precisely the same rights and powers as heretofore, happily disencumbered of the detail. They would have to inspect the conduct of their ministers, deliberate upon their 
plans, originate others for the public good, only observing this rule, that they ought to consult their ministers, and 
get all the information and advice they could from them, before they entered into any new measures, or made changes 
in the old. 

A third defect is, the fluctuating constitution of our army. 
This has been a pregnant source of evil ; all our military 
misfortunes, three-fourths of our civil embarrassments, are 
to be ascribed to it. The General has so fully enumerated 
the mischiefs, in a late letter to congress, that I could only 
repeat what he has said, and will, therefore, refer you to 
that letter. 

The imperfect and unequal provision made for the army, 
is a fourth defect, \vhich you will find delineated in the same 
letter. Without a speedy change, the army must dissolve ; 
it is now a mob rather than an army, without clothing, without pay, without provision, without morals, without discipline. We begin to hate the country for its neglect of us ; the country begins to hate us for our oppressions 
of them. Congress have long been jealous of us ; we have 
now lost all confidence in them, and give the worst construction to all they do. Held together by the slenderest 
ties, we are ripening for a dissolution. 

The present mode of supplying the army by state purchases 
is not one of the least considerable defects of our system. 
It is too precarious a dependence, because the states will never be sufficiently impressed with our necessities. Each will 
make its own ease a primary object, the supply of the army a secondary one. The variety of channels through 
which the business is transacted, will multiply the number 
of persons employed, and the opportunities of embezzling 
public money. From the popular spirit on which most of 
the governments turn, the state agents will be men of less 
character and ability ; nor will there be so rigid a responsibility among them as there might easily be among those in 
the employ of the continent ; of course not so much diligence, care, or economy. Very little of the money raised 
in the several states will go into the continental treasury, 
on pretence that it is all exhausted in providing the quotas 
of supplies, and the public will be without funds for the 
other demands of government. The expense will be ultimately much greater, and the advantage much smaller. 
We actually feel the insufficiency of this plan, and have 
reason to dread, under it, a ruinous extremity of want. 

These are the principal defects in the present system that 
now occur to me. There are many inferior ones in the 
organization of particular departments, and many errors 
of administration, which might be pointed out ; but the 
task would be troublesome and tedious, and if we had once 
remedied those I have mentioned, the. others would not be 
attended with much difficulty. 

I shall now propose the remedies which appear to me 
applicable to our circumstances, and necessary to extricate our affairs from their present deplorable situation. 
The first step must be to give congress powers competent to the public exigencies. This may happen in two 
ways : one by resuming and exercising the discretionary 
powers I suppose to have been originally vested in them 
for the safety of the states, and resting their conduct on the 
candour of their countrymen and the necessity of the conjuncture ; the other, by calling immediately a convention 
of all the states, with full authority to conclude finally upon 
a general confederation, stating to them beforehand explicitly the evils arising from a want of power in congress, 
and the impossibility of supporting the contest on its present footing, that the delegates may come possessed of 
proper sentiments, as well as proper authority, to give efficacy to the meeting. Their commission should include a 
right of vesting congress with the whole or a proportion of 
the unoccupied lands, to be employed for the purpose of 
raising a revenue, reserving the jurisdiction to the states by 
w 7 hom they are granted. 

The first plan, I expect, will be thought too bold an expedient by the generality of congress ; and, indeed, their 
practice hitherto has so rivetted the opinion of their want 
of power, that the success of this experiment may very 
well be doubted. 

I see no objection to the other mode that has any weight 
in competition with the reasons for it. The convention 
should assemble the first of November next ; the sooner 
the better ; our disorders are too violent to admit of a common or lingering remedy. The reasons for which I require them to be vested with plenipotentiary authority arc, 
that the business may suffer no delay in the execution, and 
may in reality come to effect. A convention may agree 
upon a confederation ; the states, individually, hardly ever 
will. We must have one, at all events, and a vigorous 
one, if we mean to succeed in the contest and be happy 
hereafter. As I said before, to engage the states to comply with this mode, congress ought to confess to them, 
plainly and unanimously, the impracticability, of supporting 
our affairs on the present footing, and without a solid coercive union. I ask that the convention should have a 
power of vesting the whole or a part of the unoccupied 
lands in congress, because it is necessary that body should 
have some property, as a fund for the arrangements of 
finance ; and I know of no other kind that can be given 
them. 

The confederation, in my opinion, should give congress a 
complete sovereignty ; except as to that part of internal 
police which relates to the rights of property and life 
among individuals, and to raising money by internal taxes. 
It is necessary that every thing belonging to this should be 
regulated by the state legislatures. Congress should have 
complete sovereignty in all that relates to war, peace, 
trade, finance ; and to the management of foreign affairs ; 
the right of declaring war, of raising armies, officering, 
paying them, directing their motions in every respect ; of 
equipping fleets, and doing the same with them ; of building fortifications, arsenals, magazines, &c. &c. ; of making 
peace on such conditions as they think proper ; of regulating trade, determining with what countries it shall be carried on; granting indulgences; laying prohibitions on all 
the articles of export or import ; imposing duties, granting 
bounties and premiums for raising, exporting, or importing ; 
and applying to their own use the product of these duties, 
only giving credit to the states on whom they are raised 
in the general account of revenues and expense ; instituting admiralty courts, &c. ; of coining money, establishing 
banks on such terms, and with such privileges, as they 
think proper ; appropriating funds, and doing whatever 
else relates to the operations of finance ; transacting 
every thing with foreign nations ; making alliances, offensive and defensive, treaties of commerce, &c. &c. 
The confederation should provide certain perpetual revenues, productive and easy of collection ; a land tax, poll 
tax, or the like, which, together with the duties on trade, 
and the unlocated lands, would give congress a substantial 
existence, and a stable foundation for their schemes of 
finance. What more supplies were necessary, should be 
occasionally demanded of the states, in the present mode of 
quotas. 

The second step I would recommend is, that congress 
should instantly appoint the following great officers of 
state : A Secretary for Foreign Affairs ; a President of 
War ; a President of Marine ; a Financier ; a President of 
Trade ; instead of this last, a Board of Trade may be preferable, as the regulations of trade are slow and guarded, 
and require prudence and experience, (more than other 
qualities,) for which boards are very well adapted. 

Congress should choose for these offices, men of the first 
abilities, property, and character, in the continent ; and 
such as have had the best opportunities of being acquainted 
with the several branches. General Schuyler, whom you 
mentioned, would make an excellent President of W^ar ; 
General McDougal a very good President of Marine ; Mr. 
Robert Morris would have many things in his favour for 
the department of Finance. He could, by his own personal influence, give great weight to the measures he should 
adopt. I dare say, men equally capable may be found for 
the other departments. 

1 know not if it would not be a good plan to let the Financier be President of the Board of Trade ; but he should 
only have a casting voice in determining questions there. 
There is a connexion between trade and finance, which 
ought to make the director of one acquainted with the 
other; but the financier should not direct the affairs of 
trade, because, for the sake of acquiring reputation by increasing the revenues, he might adopt measures that would 
depress trade. In what relates to finance he should be 
alone. 

These officers should have nearly the same powers and 
functions as those in France analogous to them, and each 
should be chief in his department, with subordinate boards, 
composed of assistants, clerks, &c., to execute his orders. 

In my opinion, a plan of this kind would be of inconceivable utility to our affairs ; its benefits would be very speedily felt. It would give new life and energy to the operations of government. Business would be conducted with 
despatch, method, and system. A million of abuses now 
existing would be corrected, and judicious plans would be 
formed and executed for the public good. 

Another step of immediate necessity is, to recruit the 
army for the war, or at least for three years. This must 
be done by a mode similar to that which is practised in 
Sweden. There the inhabitants are thrown into classes of 
sixteen, and when the sovereign wants men, each of these 
classes must furnish one. They raise a fixed sum of money, and if one of the class is willing to become a soldier, 
he receives the money and offers himself a volunteer ; if 
none is found to do this, a draft is made, and he on whom 
the lot falls, receives the money, and is obliged to serve. 
The minds of the people are prepared for a thing of this 
kind ; the heavy bounties they have been obliged to pay 
for men to serve a few months, must have disgusted them 
with this mode, and made them desirous of another, that 
will, once for all, answer the public purposes, and obviate 
a repetition of the demand. It ought by all means to be 
attempted ; and congress should frame a general plan, and 
press the execution upon the states. When the confederation comes to be framed, it ought to provide for this, by 
a fundamental law ; and hereafter there would be no doubt 
of the success. But we cannot now wait for this : we 
want to replace the men whose times of service will expire the first of January ; for then, without this, we shall 
have no army remaining, and the enemy may do what 
they please. The General, in his letter already quoted, 
has assigned the most substantial reasons for paying immediate attention to this point. 

Congress should endeavour, both upon their credit in Europe, and by every possible exertion in this country, to provide clothing for their officers, and should abolish the whole 
system of state supplies. The making good the depreciation of the currency, and all other compensations to the 
army, should be immediately taken up by congress, and 
not left to the states ; if they would have the accounts of 
depreciation liquidated, and governmental certificates given 
for what is due, in specie, or an equivalent to specie, it 
would give satisfaction, appointing periodical settlements 
for future depreciation. 

The placing the officers upon half-pay, during life, would 
be a great stroke of policy, and would give congress a 
stronger tie upon them than any thing else they can do. 
No man, that reflects a moment, but will prefer a permanent provision of this kind, to any temporary compensation ; nor is it opposed to economy ; the difference between 
this, and what has been already done, will be insignificant. 
The benefit of it to the widows, should be confined to those 
whose husbands die during the war. As to the survivors, 
not more than one-half, on the usual calculation of men's 
lives, will exceed the seven years for which the half-pay is 
already established. Besides this, whatever may be the 
visionary speculations of some men at this time, we shall 
find it indispensable, after the war, to keep on foot a considerable body of troops ; and all the officers retained for 
this purpose, must be deducted out of the half-pay list. If 
any one will take the pains to calculate the expense on 
these principles, I am persuaded he will find the addition 
of expense from the establishment proposed, by no means 
a national object. 

The advantages of securing the attachment of the army 
to congress, and binding them to the service, by substantial 
ties, are immense. 

We should, then, have discipline ; an army in reality, as 
well as in name. Congress would then have a solid basis 
of authority and consequence ; for with me it is an axiom, 
that in our constitution an army is essential to the American union. 

The providing of supplies, is the pivot of every thing 
else ; (though a well constituted army would not, in a small 
degree, conduce to this, by giving consistency and weight 
to government,) there are four ways, all which must be 
united, a foreign loan, heavy pecuniary taxes, a 
tax in kind, a bank founded on public and private credit. 

As to a foreign loan, I dare say, congress are doing every 
thing in their power to obtain it. The most effectual way 
will be, to tell France that without it, we must make terms 
with Great Britain. This must be done with plainness and 
firmness,but with respect and without petulance ; not as a menace, but as a candid declaration of our circumstances. We 
need not fear to be deserted by France ; her interest and 
honour are too deeply involved in our fate ; and she can 
make no possible compromise. She can assist us, if she is 
convinced it is absolutely necessary, either by lending us, 
herself, or by becoming our surety, or by influencing Spain. 
It has been to me astonishing, how any man could have 
doubted, at any period of our affairs, of the necessity of a 
foreign loan. It was self-evident that we had not a fund 
of wealth in this country, capable of affording revenues 
equal to the expenses. We must, then, create artificial revenues, or borrow ; the first was done, but it ought to have 
been foreseen, that the expedient could not last, and we 
should have provided in time for its failure. 
Here was an error of congress. I have good reason to 
believe, that measures were not taken in earnest early 
enough to procure a loan abroad : I give you my honour, 
that from our first outset, I thought as I do now ; and wished 
for a foreign loan, not only because I foresaw it would be 
essential, but because I considered it a tie upon the nation 
from which it was derived, and as a mean to prop our cause 
in Europe. 

Concerning the necessity of heavy pecuniary taxes, I 
need say nothing, as it is a point in which every body is 
agreed; nor is there any danger, that the product of any 
taxes raised in this way, will overburthen the people, or exceed the wants of the public. Indeed, if all the paper in 
circulation were drawn annually into the treasury, it would 
neither do one nor the other. 

As to a tax in kind, the necessity of it results from this 
principle, that the money in circulation is not a sufficient 
representative of the productions of the country, and consequently no revenues raised from it, as a medium, can be 
a competent representative of that part of the products 
of the country, which it is bound to contribute to the support 
of the public. The public, therefore, to obtain its due, or 
satisfy its just demands and its wants, must call for a part 
of these products themselves. This is done in all those 
countries which are not commercial ; in Russia, Prussia, 
Denmark, Sweden, &c., and is peculiarly necessary in our 
case. 

Congress, in calling for specific supplies, seem to have 
had this in view ; but their intention has not been answered. The states, in general, have undertaken to furnish the 
supplies by purchase, a mode, as I have observed, attended with every inconvenience, and subverting the principle on which the supplies were demanded, the insufficiency of our circulating medium, as a representative for 
the labour and commodities of the country. It is, therefore, necessary, that congress should be more explicit; 
should form the outlines of a plan for a tax in kind, and recommend it to the states, as a measure of absolute necessity. 

The general idea I have of a plan is, that a respectable 
man should be appointed by the state in each county to 
collect the taxes, and form magazines ; that congress should 
have in each state an officer to superintend the whole, and 
that the state collectors should be subordinate and responsible to them. This continental superintendent might be 
subject to the general direction of the quarter-master-general, or not, as might be deemed best ; but if not subject to 
him, he should be obliged to make monthly returns to the 
President at War, who should instruct him what proportion to deliver to the quarter-master-general. It may be 
necessary, that the superintendents should sometimes have 
power to dispose of the articles in their possession, on public account ; for it would happen, that the contributions, 
in places remote from the army, could not be transported 
to the theatre of operations without too great expense ; in 
which case, it would be eligible to dispose of them, and 
purchase with the money so raised in the counties near the 
immediate scene of war. 

I know the objections which may be raised to this plan, 
its tendency to discourage industry and the like ; but 
necessity calls for it ; we cannot proceed without, and less 
evils must give place to greater. It is, besides, practised 
with success in other countries, and why not in this ? It 
may be said, the examples cited are from nations under 
despotic governments, and that the same would not be 
practicable with us ; but I contend, where the public good 
is evidently the object, more may be effected in governments like ours, than in any other. It has been a constant 
remark, that free countries have ever paid the heaviest 
taxes ; the obedience of a free people to general laws, however hard they bear, is ever more perfect than that of 
slaves to the arbitrary will of a prince. To this, it may be 
added, that Sweden was always a free government, and 
is so now, in a great degree, notwithstanding the late revolution. 

How far it may be practicable to erect a bank on the faint 
credit of the public, and of individuals, can only be certainly 
determined by the experiment ; but it is of so much importance that the experiment ought to be fully tried. When I 
gaw the subscriptions going on to the bank established for 
supplying the army, I was in hopes it was only the embryo 
of a more permanent and extensive establishment. But I 
have reason to believe I shall be disappointed. It does not 
seem to be at all conducted on the true principles of a bank. 
The directors of it are purchasing with their stock, instead 
of bank notes as I expected ; in consequence of which, it 
must turn out to be a mere subscription of a particular sum 
of money, for a particular purpose. 

Paper credit never was long supported in any country, 
on a national scale, where it was not founded on the joint 
basis of public and private credit. An attempt to establish 
it on public credit alone, in France, under the auspices of 
Mr. Law, nearly ruined the kingdom. We have seen the 
effects of it in America ; and every successive experiment 
proves the futility of the attempt. Our new money is depreciating almost as fast as the old, though it has, in some 
states, as real funds as paper money ever had. The reason is, that the moneyed men have not an immediate interest 
to uphold its credit. They may even, in many ways, find 
it their interest to undermine it. The only certain manner 
to obtain a permanent paper credit, is to engage the moneyed 
interest immediately in it, by making them contribute the 
whole or part of the stock, and giving them the whole or 
part of the profits. 

The invention of banks, on the modern principle, originated in Venice. There, the public, and a company of moneyed men, are mutually concerned. The Eank of England 
unites public authority and faith, with private credit ; and 
hence we see what a vast fabric of paper credit is raised on 
a visionary basis. Had it not been for this, England would 
never have found sufficient funds to carry on her wars ; but 
with the help of this, she has done, and is doing, wonders. 
The Bank of Amsterdam is on a similar foundation. 

And why cannot we have an American bank ? Are our 
moneyed men less enlightened to their own interest, or less 
enterprising in the pursuit ? I believe the fault is in government, which does not exert itself to engage them in 
such a scheme. It is true, the individuals in America are 
not very rich ; but this would not prevent their instituting 
a bank; it would only prevent its being done with such 
ample funds as in other countries. Have they not sufficient 
confidence in the government, and in the issue of the cause ? 
Let the government endeavour to inspire that confidence, 
by adopting the measures I have recommended, or others 
equivalent to them. Let it exert itself to procure a solid 
confederation, to establish a good plan of executive administration, to form a permanent military force, to obtain, at all events, a foreign loan. If these things were in 
a train of vigorous execution, it would give a new spring 
to our affairs ; government would recover its respectability, 
and individuals would renounce their diffidence. 

The object I should propose to myself, in the first instance, from a bank, would be an auxiliary mode of supplies ; for which purpose contracts should be made between 
government and the bank, on terms liberal and advantageous to the latter. Every thing should be done, in the first 
instance, to encourage the bank ; after it gets well established, it will take care of itself, and government may make the 
best terms it can for itself. 

The first step to establishing the bank, will be to engage 



302 TIM. LIFE OF 

a number of moneyed men of influence to relish the project, 
and make it a business. The subscribers to that lately established, are the fittest persons that can be found ; and their 
plan may be interwoven. 

The outlines of my plan would be to open subscriptions, 
in all the states, for the stock, which we will suppose to be 
one million of pounds. Real property, of every kind, as 
well as specie, should be deemed good stock ; but at least 
a fourth part of the subscription should be in specie or 
plate. There should be one great company, in three divisions ; in Virginia, Philadelphia, and at Boston ; or two, 
at Philadelphia and Boston. The bank should have a right 
to issue bank notes, bearing two per cent, interest for the 
whole of their stock ; but not to exceed it. These notes 
may be payable every three months, or oftener ; and the 
faith of government must be pledged for the support of the 
bank. It must, therefore, have a right, from time to time, 
to inspect its operations ; and must appoint inspectors for 
the purpose. 

The advantages of the bank may consist in this : in the 
profits of the contracts made with government, which should 
bear interest, to be annually paid in specie ; in the loan of 
money at interest, say six per cent. ; in purchasing lives by 
annuities, as practised in England, &c. The benefit resulting to the company is evident, from the consideration, that 
they may employ in circulation a great deal more money 
than they have specie in stock, on the credit of the real 
property which they will have in other use. This money 
will be employed, either in fulfilling their contracts with 
the public, by which, also, they will gain a profit, or in 
loans, at an advantageous interest, or in annuities. 

The bank may be allowed to purchase plate and bullion, 
and coin money, allowing government a part of the profit. 

I make the bank notes bear interest, to obtain a readier 
currency, and to induce the holders to prefer them to specie, to prevent too great a run upon the bank, at any time, 
beyond its ability to pay. 

If government can obtain a foreign loan, it should lend to 
the bank, on easy terms, to extend its influence, and facilitate a compliance with its engagements. If government 
could engage the states to raise a sum of money in specie, 
to be deposited in bank, in the same manner, it would be 
of the greatest consequence. If government could prevail 
on the enthusiasm of the people, to make a contribution in 
plate, for the same purpose, it would be a master stroke. 
Things of this kind sometimes succeed in popular contests; 
and if undertaken with address, I should not despair of its 
success ; but I should not be sanguine. 

The bank may be instituted for a term of years, by way 
of trial ; and the particular privilege of coining money be 
for a term still shorter. 

A temporary transfer of it to a particular company can 
have no inconvenience, as the government are in no condition to improve this resource ; nor could it, in our circumstances, be an object to it, though with the industry of a 
knot of individuals, it might be a valuable one to them. 

A bank of this kind, even in its commencement, would 
answer the most valuable purposes to government, and to 
the proprietors ; in its progress, the advantages will exceed 
calculation. It will promote commerce, by furnishing a 
more extensive medium, which we greatly want, in our circumstances. I mean a more extensive, valuable medium. 
We have an enormous nominal one at this time ; but it is 
only a name. 

In the present unsettled state of things, in this country, 
we can hardly draw inferences, from what has happened in 
others ; otherwise I should be certain of the success of this 
scheme ; but I think it has enough in its favour to be worthy of trial. 

I have only skimmed the surface of the different subjects 
I have introduced. Should the plans recommended come 
into contemplation in earnest, and you desire my farther 
thoughts, I will endeavour to give them more form and 
particularity. 

I am persuaded a solid confederation, a permanent army, a reasonable prospect of subsisting it, would give us 
treble consideration in Europe, and produce a peace this 
winter. 

If a convention is called, the minds of all the states and 
the people ought to be prepared to receive its determinations by sensible and popular writings, which should conform 
to the views of congress. There are epochs in human affairs, when novelty even is useful. If a general opinion 
prevails that the old way is bad, whether true or false, and 
this obstructs or relaxes the operations of the public service, a change is necessary if it be but for the sake of 
change. This is exactly the case now. 'Tis an universal 
sentiment that our present system is a bad one, and that 
things do not go right on this account. The measure of a 
convention would revive the hopes of the people, and give 
a new direction to their passions, which may be improved 
in carrying points of substantial utility. The eastern states 
have already pointed out this mode to congress : they ought 
to take the hint, and anticipate the others. 

And in future, my dear sir, two things let me recommend, 
as fundamental rules for the conduct of congress : to attach 
the army to them by every motive, to maintain an authority, (not domineering,) in all their measures with the 
states. The manner in which a thing is done, has more influence than is commonly imagined. Men are governed 
by opinion : this opinion is as much influenced by appearances as by realities. If a government appears to be confident of its own powers, it is the surest way to inspire the 
same confidence in others. If it is diffident, it may be certain there will be a still greater diffidence in others, and 
that its authority will not only be distrusted, controverted, 
but contemned. 

I wish, too, congress would always consider, that a kindness consists as much in the manner as in the thing. The best 
things, done hesitatingly, and with an ill grace, lose their 
effect, and produce disgust rather than satisfaction or gratitude. In what congress have at any time done for the army, 
they have commonly been too late. They have seemed to 
yield to importunity, rather than to sentiments of justice, or 
to a regard to the accommodation of their troops. An attention to this idea is of more importance than it may be 
thought. I, who have seen all the workings and progress 
of the present discontents, am convinced that a want of 
this has not been among the most inconsiderable causes. 

You will perceive, my dear sir, this letter is hastily written, and with a confidential freedom, not as to a member 
of congress, whose feelings may be sore at the prevailing 
clamour ; but as to a friend, who is in a situation to remedy 
public disorders, who wishes for nothing so much as truth, 
and who is desirous for information, even from those less 
capable of judging than himself. I have not even time to 
correct and copy,* and only enough to add, that I am, very 
truly and affectionately, dear sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

A. HAMILTON. 

Such were the plans which his extensive genius originated, to raise this country above all the chances of the revolution, to give to it a national government, to call out 
all its resources, and to relieve it from that entire dependence on France, which, though not a native, he felt with all 
a native's pride.

306 TUB LIFE OF 

This feeling is strongly indicated in the following letter 
to congress from head quarters. 

****** We may soon be reduced to the humiliating 
condition of seeing the cause of America, in America, upheld by foreign arms. The generosity of our allies has a 
claim to all our confidence and all our gratitude ; but it is 
neither for the honour of America, nor for the interest of 
the common cause, to leave the work entirely to them." 

The measures thus suggested by Hamilton, were before 
the times. His remark, that the people were proof against 
experience, was too true ; and the moment when a government, possessing all the energies necessary for its own preservation, and all the checks essential to freedom, might 
have been formed, passed away. 

A short time after this subject was brought before congress, the news of the defeat of Gates, at Camden, was received, and a deeper gloom was spread over the public 
mind, now sadly disappointed in the fond hopes which had 
been indulged, of the benefits to be derived from the cooperation of France. Hamilton thus speaks of this event, 
in a letter of the sixth of September, written to a near friend 
in perfect confidence. 

" Most people here are groaning under a very disagreeable piece of intelligence, just come from the southward, 
that Gates has had a total defeat near Camden, in South 
Carolina. Cornwallis and he met in the night of the fifteenth, by accident, marching to the same point. The advanced guards skirmished, and the two armies halted and 
formed till morning. In the morning a battle ensued, in 
which the militia, and Gates with them, immediately ran 
away, and left the continental troops to contend with the 
enemy's whole force. 

"They did it obstinately, and probably are most of them 
cut off. Gates, however, who writes to congress, seems 
to know very little what has become of his army. He 
showed that age, and the long labours and fatigues of a 
military life, had not in the least impaired his activity ; for 
in three days and a half he reached Hillsborough, one hundred and eighty miles from the scene of action, leaving all 
his troops to take care of themselves, and get out of the 
scrape as well as they could. He has confirmed, in this 
instance, the opinion I always had of him. This event 
will have very serious consequences to the southward. 
People's imaginations have already given up North Carolina and Virginia ; but I do not believe either of them will 
fall. I am certain Virginia cannot. This misfortune affects me less than others, because it is not in my temper to 
repine at evils that are past, but to endeavour to draw 
good out of them, and because I think our safety depends 
on a total change of system, and this change of system will 
only be produced by misfortune." 

On being informed of this disaster, congress wisely confided to Washington the selection of a successor to the unfortunate general. The importance of this trust, was strongly 
felt at head quarters, and though Washington preferred 
Greene, yet when called upon to act under the resolution 
of that body, he duly appreciated the full extent of their 
confidence, and with that slow, but sure discretion, which 
rarely erred, he weighed every circumstance connected with 
the station. Respect for local feelings, might have led him 
to prefer a general officer from the south, had any such been 
deemed equal to this high command ; a regard, also, for the 
prejudices of certain members of congress against Greene, 
and the injurious conduct which had been exhibited to him 
as quarter-master-general, gave rise to a fear that he might 
not receive that support which the scene of his operations 
eminently demanded. These well-grounded reasons for 
hesitation, induced the ardent friendship of Hamilton to apprehend, lest, in the interval of decision, some circumstance 
might occur to bias the judgement of the commander-inchief, and lose to the country the services of a man, in whose 
superior qualifications he had unmeasured confidence. He 
immediately exerted all his influence to induce an instant 
decision. The other members of the family, in whom the 
character of Greene had inspired similar sentiments, concurred in urging his selection ; and Washington, thus sustained by his disinterested and most confidential advisers, 
chose a Deliverer for the south, a choice which, under the 
peculiar circumstances which existed, is perhaps among the 
most exalted acts of his life. 

" This choice," says La Fayette, " when made public, was 
generally approved by the army, but not to the high degree 
in which it was afterwards applauded; Congress and the 
country supposed the share of friendship in the choice, 
greater than it had been. Many suspended, or flatly denied 
their approbation, until it was universally acknowledged, 
that in General Greene were united all the abilities and 
virtues which fitted him for this important command." 

A letter from Colonel Harrison, written at this time 
marks the state of opinion in congress on this subject. 

HARRISON TO HAMILTON. 

October 27, 1780. 
MY DEAR HAMILTON, 

We are only leaving Philadelphia. The most flattering 
attentions have been paid to Meade and myself, and such 
as would not permit us to progress before, unless we had 
shown ourselves entirely disregardless of the great world ; 
besides, motives of a public nature concurred to make us 
stay thus long. From all I have seen and heard, there is a 
good disposition in congress to do all they can for the army 
and the public interest, and there are many very sensible 
men among them. In general, they are most warmly attached to the General, and his recommendations will have 
their weight, while the same spirit prevails. It is said, there 
has been infinitely more harmony among them for some time 
past, than has appeared since the first years of their appointment. I am not, however, without some apprehension, that 
if they proceed in the case of Lee, &c. the MONSTER (PARTY,) 
may show itself again, and that we may have a second 
edition of the measures adopted in the instance of Deane. 
Our friends Sullivan and Carroll have been of great service; 
and gentlemen who are, or pretend to be, in the secrets of the 
cabinet, say they have contributed immeasurably, by their 
independent conduct, to destroy the EASTERN ALLIANCE. 
Bland is very clever, and without question wishes to push on 
in the true and right road. Grayson says this is the best 
congress we have had since the first. Our dear Laurens 
respects many of the members ; and General Greene's appointment, I believe, is entirely consonant to the wishes of 
congress in general, though we have heard there were members much disposed, if facts had not been so obstinate, to 
excuse General Gates. The former is here, and I suppose 
will set out in a day or two ; Meade and I will serve him 
all we can. We have done what we could already. Apropos, you delivered him my letter. Our finances are entirely 
deranged, and there is little or no money in the treasury. 
1 believe they are a subject of much consideration and puzzlement ; the supplies of the army are also matters of present attention, but I don't know what will be done. I hope 
we shall, by Christmas, have some clothing from the West 
Indies, if the moth have not destroyed it ; a quantity it is 
said has, been lying there. It is much to be wished that 
General Greene were at the south. The delegates from 
that quarter think the situation of Cornwallis delicate, and 
that by management, and a proper application and use of 
the force there, the late check given Ferguson might be improved into the Earl's total defeat. This, I fear, is too much 
even to hope. The sending the Baron is considered, as far 
as I have heard, perfectly right, and Lee's corps give great 
satisfaction. I am just about to mount my horse, and therefore shall say but little more. Laurens will write unto you 
in a few days, I suppose, and communicate any new occurrences. My love to the lads of the family, the same to 
you. May you be long happy. My most respectful compliments to the General. 

Most truly and affectionately, 

ROB. H. HARRISON. 

P. S. The Board have been absolutely too poor to procure parchment for the many promotions that have been 
required. 

Greene, on the annunciation to him of his appointment, 
by Hamilton, proceeded to head quarters,* and, after an 
interview with Washington, visited Philadelphia, to concert the measures necessary for the supplies of his army ; 
and having made every exertion to secure the co-operation 
of individuals possessing influence, near the scene of his future operations, arrived at Charlotte, the head quarters of 
the army, on the second of December, where he received 
a letter from Hamilton, directing him to call a court martial on Gates, without delay, and give him every facility for 
an immediate defence, who wrote to Congress,-]- complaining of his not being notified, in due time, of his being 
superseded. The defeat of King's Mountain induced Cornwallis to order a detachment, under Leslie, of three thousand men, which Clinton had sent on to co-operate in Virginia, to join him by the way of Charleston ; and as it was 
advancing in the direction of Camden, Greene moved with 
his main body to the vicinity of the troops under General 
Morgan. 

The situation of the country, and of the army, when 
Greene took the command, is thus described, in a letter 

* October 22d, 1780. t January 3d, 1781. 
from him to Colonel Hamilton, written from the camp, at 
the falls of the Pedee. 

GENERAL GREENE TO COLONEL HAMILTON. 

January 10th, 17S1. 
MY DEAR COLONEL, 

General Du Portail being on his way to the northward, 
gives me an opportunity to write you, which I should have 
done before, had not my letters to his excellency contained 
as full information of the state of things as I was able to 
give, from the little time I had been in the department. 

When I was appointed to this command, I expected to 
meet with many new and singular difficulties ; but they infinitely exceed what I apprehended. This is really carrying on a war in an enemy's country ; for you cannot establish the most inconsiderable magazine, or convey the 
smallest quantity of stores from one post to another, without being obliged to detach guards for their security. The 
division among the people is much greater than I imagined, 
and the whigs and tories persecute each other, with little 
less than savage fury. There is nothing but murders, and 
devastations, in every quarter. 

The loss of our army at Charleston, and the defeat of 
General Gates, has been the cause of keeping such shoals 
of militia on foot, and their service has been accompanied 
with such destruction and loss, as has almost laid waste the 
whole country. Nothing has been more destructive to the 
true interest of this country, than the mode adopted for its 
defence. Two misfortunes happening, one after the other, 
may have rendered it unavoidable the last season ; but 
should it be continued, the inhabitants are inevitably ruined, 
and the resources of the country rendered incapable of affording support to an army competent to its defence. Government here is infinitely more popular than to the northward, and there is no such thing as national character or 



312 TH E LIFE OF 

national sentiment. The inhabitants are from all quarters 
of the globe, and as various in their opinions, projects, and 
schemes, as their manners and habits are from their early 
education. Those in office, from a vanity to be thought 
powerful, join in the measure of imposing upon the public 
respecting the strength and resources of these southern 
states ; and while congress, and the minister of France, are 
kept under this fatal delusion, I fear little support will be 
given to this department. The inhabitants are numerous ; 
but they would be rather formidable abroad than at home. 
They are scattered over such a vast extent of country, that 
it is difficult to collect, and still more difficult to subsist 
them. There is a great spirit of enterprise among the back 
people, and those that come out as volunteers are not a little formidable to the enemy. There are, also, some particular corps, under Sumpter, Marion, and Clarke, that are 
bold and daring ; the rest of the militia are better calculated to destroy provisions than oppose the enemy. 

At Philadelphia, and all my journey through the country, 
I endeavoured to impress upon those in power, the necessity of sending clothing, and supplies of every kind, immediately to this army. But poverty was urged as a plea, in bar 
to every application. They all promised fair, but I fear 
will do but little : ability is wanting with some, and inclination with others. 

Public credit is so totally lost, that private people will not 
give their aid, though they see themselves involved in one 
common ruin. It is my opinion, that General Washington's 
influence will do more than all the assemblies upon the continent. I always thought him exceeding popular; but in 
many places he is little less than adored, and universally 
admired. His influence in this country might possibly 
effect something great. However, I found myself exceedingly well received, but more from being the friend of the 
General, than from my own merit.

* 

HAMILTON. 313 

This country wants for its defence a small, but well appointed army, organized so as to move with great celerity. 
It should consist of about five thousand infantry, and from 
eight hundred to a thousand horse. The enemy cannot 
maintain a large force in this quarter, neither can we. The 
resources of the country are too small to subsist a large 
body of troops at any one point ; and to draw supplies from 
a distance through such long tracts of barren land, will be 
next to impossible, unless the business can be aided by a 
water transportation, and in cither case, it will be accompanied with an amazing expense. Could we get a superiority 
of horse, we could soon render it difficult for Lord Cornwallis to hold his position so far in the country. Nor should 
I be under any apprehension with a much inferior force to 
his, of taking post near him, if I had but such a body of 
horse. But the enemy's horse is so much superior to ours, 
that we cannot move a detachment towards them, without 
hazarding its ruin. 

When I came to the army, I found it in a most wretched 
condition. The officers had lost all confidence in the General, and the troops all their discipline. The troops had not 
only lost their discipline, but they were so addicted to 
plundering, that they were a terror to the country. The 
General and I met at least upon very civil terms; and he 
expressed the greatest happiness at my being appointed to 
succeed him. 

General Smallwood and he were not upon good terms ; 
the former suspected the latter of having an intention to 
supplant him, but many think without reason. Others^ 
again, are of opinion, his suspicions were well founded, and 
that Smallwood was not a little mortified at my being appoint^ 
ed to this department, and got outrageous when he heard 
Baron Steuben was coming also. How the matter was, I 
know not ; certain it is, he is gone home, having refused to 
act under Baron Steuben, and declares he will not serve at 
all, unless congress will give him a commission, dated at 
least two years before his appointment. This, I think, can 
never happen, notwithstanding his private merit, and the 
claim of the state. The battle of Camden.here is represented widely different from what it is to the northward. 
Colonel Williams thinks that none of the general officers 
were entitled to any extraordinary merit. The action was 
short, and succeeded by a flight, wherein every body took 
care of himself, as well officers as soldiers. Not an officer, except Major Anderson, and one or two captains, that 
brought off the field of battle a single soldier. The Colonel also says, that General Gates would have shared little 
more disgrace, than is the common lot of the unfortunate, 
notwithstanding .he was early off, if he had only halted at 
the Waxhaws or Charlotte ; the first about sixty, and the 
last about eighty miles from the field of battle. What little incidents either give or destroy reputation ? How many 
long hours a man may labour with an honest zeal in his 
country's service, and be disgraced for the most trifling error either in conduct or opinion? Hume very justly observes, no man will have reputation, unless he is useful to society, be his merit or abilities what they may. 
Therefore, it is necessary for a man to be fortunate, as well 
as wise and just. The greater part of the loss of the Maryland line, in the action of Camden, happened after they began to retreat : indeed,. this was the case with all the troops. 
What gave Smallwood such great reputation, was his halt 
at Salisbury, which was nothing but accident. You know 
there are great parties prevailing in the Maryland line, and 
perhaps his merit is not a little diminished on that account. 
I think him a brave and good officer, but too slow to effect 
any thing great in a department like this, where embarrassments are without number ; and where nothing can be effected without the greatest promptitude and decision. This 
army is in such a w r retched condition, that I hardly know 



A MILTON. 315 

what to do with it. The officers have got such a habit of 
negligence, and the soldiers so loose and disorderly, that it 
is next to impossible to give it a military complexion. 
Without clothing, I am sure I shall never do it. I call no 
councils of war, and I communicate my intentions to very 
few. The army was posted at Charlotte when I came up 
with it, and in a council, it had been determined to winter 
there ; but the difficulty of procuring subsistence, and other 
reasons, induced me not only to take a new position, but to 
make an entire new disposition. All this I effected by a 
single order, having first made the necessary inquiry respecting the new positions, by sending a man to examine the 
grounds and other requisites. If I cannot inspire the army 
with confidence, and respect by an independent conduct, I 
foresee it will be impossible to instil discipline and order 
among the troops. General Leslie has arrived, and joined 
Lord Cornwallis, whose force now is more than three times 
larger than ours ; and we are subsisting ourselves by our 
own industry, and I am not without hopes of forming something like a magazine. I am labouring also to get clothing 
from every quarter ; Baron Steuben is in Virginia, and is 
indefatigable in equipping and forwarding the troops from 
that state. I left General Gates in Maryland for the same 
purpose ; but I have got nothing from there yet, nor do I 
expect much for months to come. The North Carolina 
state have such a high opinion of the militia, that I don't 
expect they will ever attempt to raise a single continental 
soldier; notwithstanding the most sensible among them 
will acknowledge the folly of employing militia. 

But I must have tired your patience, and therefore will 
make a full stop concerning matters in this department, 
and inquire how you go on to the northward. \ Have you 
got married ? If you have, please to present my compliments to Mrs. Hamilton ; if not, to Miss Schuyler, and to 
the General and family in either case. 
I beg my compliments to General Washington's family, 
to General Knox and his family, and all other of my acquaintances. 

I shall be exceedingly obliged to you if you will communicate to me, with great freedom, every thing worthy of 
note that is said or respects this department. 

While the important question of a successor to Gates 
was under consideration, a project was in agitation, partly 
the result of discontent with the feeble measures of congress, but principally induced by the apprehensions which 
the defeat at Camden had produced, for the appointment 
of " a Supreme Dictator and Vice Dictators in each state, 
with all the powers conferred by the Roman people." 

The difficulty of supplying the armies, and the necessity 
of some general concert, had led to the determination of 
holding a convention at Hartford, to be composed of the 
five New-England states and the state of New-York ; by 
which latter state, Judge Hobart, Egbert Benson, then attorney general, and General Schuyler,were selected as commissioners. It was, for a time, contemplated by the legislature, to give them instructions " to propose that a dictator 
should be appointed, for which a majority in the more popular branch were believed to be favourable." " This mad project," as Hamilton designated it, was communicated to him 
by General Schuyler, in a letter of the sixteenth of Septemtember, 1780. As soon as Hamilton heard of it, it met 
with his instant disapprobation, and he discouraged it in 
the most earnest manner. General Schuyler, upon w T hom 
this duty would have been imposed, relinquished his purpose 
of attending at Hartford, where the consultations were confined to the consideration of measures for supplying the 
army, which is stated to have resulted in the project of a 
national impost. Thus do we observe Hamilton, while 
urging the establishment of an efficient government, con


HAMILTON. - 317 

fining his views to the distribution of its powers in various 
well-defined departments, securing to each its necessary 
action and reciprocal dependence, the whole emanating 
from, and resting upon, a free and deliberate popular will. 
This project of a dictator was regarded by him as " a 
temporary effusion," but as a strong example of the readiness with which " the human passions flow from one extreme to the other." It had a decisive influence on his 
determination to endeavour to give such stability to government as would protect the people from the danger 
which sudden emergencies might produce, of conferring 
extraordinary powers on its head, and of rendering necessary and palatable, expedients which would lead from temporary to permanent usurpations.* 

About the time of General Greene's departure for the 
south, a plan of an attack upon the British troops, then on 
Staten Island, was in contemplation, which had originated 
with Hamilton, and in which it was arranged that La Fayette was to command. In a letter from him to Colonel 
Hamilton, calculations of the means necessary to ensure 
success are presented, and at the same time a project of a 
different nature is adverted to, in which Hamilton was to 
have a share. After some consideration, it was determined 
that the intended attempt on Staten Island should be a feint, 
and that while the British forces were drawn off into NewJersey, a descent should be made upon New-York. Hamilton, tired of inactivity, and anxious to signalize himself, 
became intent on obtaining a separate command, in which 
he hoped to succeed, aided by the influence of the Marquis. 
In order to give a more full exposition of his wishes, he addressed to General Washington the following letter. 

* This scheme of a dictator, never ripened into a deliberate and extensive 
plan. It was strongly opposed by Governor Clinton, to whose exertions, on 
this occasion, great respect is due. 


HAMILTON TO WASHINGTON. 

November 22d, 1780. 
DEAR SIR, 

Some time last fall, when I spoke to your excellency about 
going to the southward, I explained to you candidly my 
feelings with respect to military reputation, and how much 
it was my object to act a conspicuous part in some enterprise, that might perhaps raise my character as a soldier 
above mediocrity. You were so good as to say, you would 
be glad to furnish me with an occasion. When the expedition to Staten Island was afoot, a favourable one seemed 
to offer. There was a battalion without a field officer, the 
command of which, I thought, as it was accidental, might 
be given to me without inconvenience. I made an application for it through the Marquis, who informed me of your 
refusal on two principles, one, that the giving me a whole 
battalion might be a subject of dissatisfaction ; the other, 
that if any accident should happen to me in the present state 
of your family, you would be embarrassed for the necessary assistance. 

The project. you now have in contemplation affords another opportunity. I have p. variety of reasons, that press 
me to desire ardently to have it in my power to improve it. 
I take the liberty to observe, that the command may now 
be proportioned to my rank, and that the second objection 
ceases to operate, as during the period of establishing our 
winter quarters, there will be a suspension of material business ; besides which, my peculiar situation will, in any case, 
call me away from the army in a few days, and Mr. Harrison may be expected back early next month. My command may consist of one hundred and fifty or two hundred 
men, composed of fifty men of Major Gibbes' corps, fifty 
from Colonel Meigs' regiment, and fifty or an hundred more 
from the light infantry, Major Gibbes to be my major. 
The hundred men from here may move on Friday morning 

towards , which will strengthen the appearances for 

Staten Island, to form a junction on the other side of the 
Passaic; 

I suggest this mode, to avoid the complaints that might 
arise from composing my party wholly of the light infantry, 
which might give umbrage to the officers of that corps, who 
on this plan can have no just subject for it. 

The primary idea may be, if circumstances permit, to attempt with my detachment Byard's Hill. Should we arrive early enough to undertake it, I should prefer It to any 
thing else, both for the brilliancy of the attempt in itself, and 
the decisive consequences of which its success would be productive. If we arrive too late to make this eligible, (as 
there is reason to apprehend,) my corps may form the van 
of one of the other attacks, and Byard's Hill will be a pretext for my being employed in the affair, on a supposition of 
my knowing the ground, Which is partly true. I flatter 
myself, also, that my military character stands so well in 
the army, as to reconcile the officers in general to the measure. All circumstances considered, I venture to say any 
exceptions which might be taken, would be unreasonable. 

I take this method of making the request to avoid the 
embarrassment of a personal explanation. I shall only add, 
that however much I have the matter at heart, I wish your 
excellency entirely to consult your own inclination, and not 
from a disposition to oblige me, to do any thing that may be 
disagreeable to you. It will, nevertheless, make me singularly happy if your wishes correspond with mine. 

This negotiation was entrusted to La Fayette, whose desire to advance the views of his friend, are thus strongly 
expressed in the following letters. 
LA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON. 

Paramus, November 28, 1780. 
DEAR HAMILTON, 

Here I arrived last night, and am going to set out for 
Philadelphia. Gouvion goes straight to New- Windsor, and 
by him I write to the General. I speak of Hand and Smith, 
whom I recommend, and add, If, however, you was to 
ca'st your eye on a man who, I think, would suit better than 
any other in the world, Hamilton is, I confess, the officer 
whom I would like best to see in my *****. Then I go 
on with the idea, that at equal advantages, you deserve from 
him the preference ; that your advantages are the greatest ; 
I speak of a co-operation ; of your being in the family ; and 
conclude, that on every public and private account, I advise 
him to take you. 

I know the General's friendship and gratitude for you, 
my dear Hamilton ; both are greater than you perhaps imagine. I am sure he needs only to be told that something 
will suit you, and when he thinks he can do it, he certainly 
will. Before this campaign I was your friend, and very 
intimate friend, agreeable to the ideas of the world ; since 
my second voyage, my sentiment has increased to such a 
point, the world knows nothing about. To show both, from 
want and from scorn of expressions, I shall only tell you 
adieu. 

Yours, 

LA FAYETTE. 

LA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON. 

Philadelphia, December 9th, 1780. 
DEAR HAMILTON, 

On my arrival at Paramus, I wrote a letter to the General, which Colonel Gouvion was to deliver to himself at 
New- Windsor; so that more expedition had been made than 
you had thought. But the General having unfortunately 
altered his mind, and taken the road to Morristown, another 
misfortune threw Hand in his way, and remembering your 
advices on the occasion, he hastened to make him the proposition, and in consequence of it wrote his letter to congress. From Paramus I went myself to the Lots, and from 
thence to Morristown, where I met the General, and knowing that my letter could not reach him under some days, I 
became regardless of your wishes, and made a verbal application in my own name, and about the same time that had 
been settled between us. I can't express to you, my dear 
friend, how sorry and disappointed I felt, when I knew from 
him, the General, that (greatly in consequence of your advice,) he had settled the whole matter with Hand, and written for him to congress. I confess, I became warmer on 
the occasion than you would perhaps have wished me to 
be, and I wanted the General to allow my sending an express, who would have overtaken the letter, as it was in the 
hands of General St. Clair ; but the General did not think 
it to be a convenient measure, and, I confess, I may have 
been a little blinded on its propriety. I took care not to 
compromise you in this affair, when the General expressed 
a desire to serve you, and in a manner you would have been 
satisfied with. Now for the voyage to France. 

Congress seem resolved that an Envoy be sent in the way 
you wish, and this was yesterday determined in the house. 
Next Monday the gentleman will be elected. I have already 
spoken to many members ; I know of a number of voices 
that will be for you. This day and that of to-morrow will 
be by me employed in paying visits. As soon as the business is fixed upon, I shall send you an express; I think 
you ought to hold yourself in readiness, and in case you are 
called for, come with all possible speed ; for you must go 
immediately, that you may have returned before the beginning of operations. If you go, my dear sir, I shall give you 
all public or private knowledge about Europe I am possess

322 THE LIFE OV 

ed of. Besides many private letters, that may introduce 
you to my friends, I intend giving you the key of the cabinet, as well as of the societies which influence them. In a 
word, my good friend, any thing in my power shall be entirely yours. 

The earnest desire, evinced by this letter, that Hamilton 
should proceed to the Court of France, was a common sentiment among the foreign officers, with whom he was the 
medium of communication, and who anticipated, with the 
most sanguine hopes, the benefits of his appointment. 

During the progress of these interesting occurrences, 
Hamilton formed an engagement with the second daughter 
of General Schuyler, to whom he was married on the fourteenth of December, 1780, at the residence of her father in 
Albany, and thus became permanently established in the 
state of New- York. 


CHAPTER XIII, 

[1781.] 

THE privations endured by the army had, at the commencement of this year, produced a general and serious 
discontent, which first showed itself in a mutiny of the 
Pennsylvania line, stationed at Morristown. Disregarding 
the efforts of their officers, and insensible even to the popularity of their commander, General Wayne, they abandoned their quarters, and marched to the vicinity of Trenton, 
determined to exact relief from the civil authorities, who 
were obliged to comply with their demands. Within a 
short time after, a similar spirit manifested itself in a part 
of the Jersey line ; on the intelligence of which General 
Washington wrote* to congress, stating his determination 
"to quiet them by force," and Hamilton, by his instructions, directed Colonel Barber " to compel them to unconditional submission," by whose prompt and vigorous measures they were restored to obedience. 

The mutineers were invited, by every inducement that Sir 
Henry Clinton could offer, to join him ; but the soldiers, with 
indignant patriotism, rejected the temptation, and seized 
and delivered up his emissaries, who were executed on the 
succeeding day. Congress, cherishing this patriotic feeling, on the representation of Washington, sent them three 
month's pay in specie. This small aid, though inadequate 
to their wants, restored them to the belief that the poverty, 
and not the remissness of the government, had produced 
their sufferings. 

On the sixteenth of January, Colonel Hamilton, whose 

* January 23, 1781. 



1 11 U LIFE OF 

correspondence with General Schuyler became frequent, 
wrote to him, informing him of these events, and declining 
a very liberal offer of pecuniary aid. On the twenty-fifth 
he received the following reply : 

DEAR SIR, 

Yesterday I received your favour of the sixteenth instant. It affords me pleasure to learn that the Pennsylvania line is reduced to order ; but we, in this quarter, are 
on the point of experiencing a similar commotion. The 
two regiments threaten to march to head quarters, unless 
some money is paid them ; the certificates for the depreciation expedited, and in future to be supplied with provisions. 

Yesterday about three thousand bushels of wheat, six 
hundred pound's worth of beef, and three or four thousand 
dollars, were subscribed. I am in hopes we shall procure 
what will afford each man about ten dollars, and I have 
some hopes that this, with a little management, will render 
them tolerably quiet.* 

You cannot, my dear sir, be more happy at the connexion you have made with my family, than I am. Until the 
child of a parent has made a judicious choice, his heart is 
in continual anxiety ; but this anxiety was removed on the 
moment I discovered it was you on whom she had placed 
her affections. I am pleased with every instance of delicacy in those who are so dear to me ; and I think I read 
your soul on the occasion you mention. I shall, therefore, 

* Governor Trambull stated that the Connecticut soldiers, whose terms of 
enlistment had expired, had repaired, in large numbers, to the seaports, in order to engage themselves in privateering ; that an embargo had been laid for 
the purpose of filling their battalion; and unless Massachusetts and RhodeIsland acted in concert, her soldiers would repair to their ports with the same 
intent ; and therefore Connecticut requested those states to lay and continue 
embargoes for the same purpose. 
only entreat you to consider me as one who wishes, in 
every way, to promote your happiness ; and. I shall never 
give or lend but with a view to such ends. Entreat the 
General and his lady to accept my best wishes. Do not 
forget to remember me to Harrison and Tilghman. 
Adieu, dear sir, 

Most affectionately, 
Yours, &c. 

PlI. SCHUYLER. 

Col. Hamilton. ' . 

In the preceding year, Hamilton, seeing the constant 
danger of the dissolution of the army for want of supplies, 
projected a plan for that purpose, which he anxiously pressed upon congress. The recent occurrences had increased 
his solicitude to have it brought forward, and he again recalled the attention of General Schuyler to this subject, in 
reference to which he received a letter of the fifth of February, 1781. 

" The reward refused by the Pennsylvania line, evinces 
a becoming sense of propriety and gallantry. What might 
not our soldiery be brought to, if properly fed, paid, and 
clothed ? 

" The plan you mention for supplying the armies in America, I should be exceedingly happy to see attempted ; but 
I fear congress will not venture on it, although they should 
be convinced of its eligibility. In the course of the last year, 
I proposed it repeatedly to individual members, who generally approved, and once or twice took occasion to mention 
it in congress. 

" I am persuaded, if it was adopted, that a saving, at present almost inconceivable, would be induced, and an order 
and economy in the public expenditures, whilst it would 
reconcile the minds of men to bear the public burthens with 
alacrity, would effectually eradicate the fears which too generally prevail, that we shall sink under the enormous weight 
of our expenses. I have been a committee of the senate to 
prepare a letter to congress. It will go by this conveyance. 
I shall not detail the subject of it, as a copy of it is directed 
to be sent to the General. I have written for some refuse 
clothing for the Indians. Permit me to entreat your interposition, to procure some carriages for the transportation of them. Very affectionately, and very proudly, 
" Your obedient, humble servant, 

"PH. SCHUYLER." 

Colonel Hamilton. 

These instances of insubordination hastened the departure of the special envoy, whom congress had chosen to 
proceed to France. The interesting letter of Colonel Laurens to Hamilton of the eighteenth December, 1779, will be 
recollected ; in which the appointment of the latter, as secretary to the minister at Versailles, is mentioned as having 
been strongly urged by him. Within a short time after its 
date, intelligence was received, that his father, Henry Laurens, who had been appointed a commissioner to negotiate 
a treaty with the United Provinces, had been captured on 
his voyage, and was immured in the Tower. 

This wanton act of severity had excited no less sensation in Europe than in America, and brought out, in a 
bolder light, the character of this distinguished personage, 
recently the President of the American Congress, now a 
prisoner of state. 

The appointment of an envoy had been deferred until the 
latter part of the preceding year. The necessity of a loan, 
which had been so strongly urged by Hamilton, had led him 
to advise another visit to France by La Fayette, whose influence had been increased by a recent change in the ministry, and the idea was entertained, that Hamilton might be 
associated with him, in this interesting mission. But the 
prospect of active service in the south, had greater charms 
for the Marquis, and it was determined, that a member of 
Washington's family should be appointed in his stead. 

The choice was between the two friends, Laurens and 
Hamilton. The idea of the mission having originated with 
Hamilton, induced Laurens to defer to him an appointment, 
which the dull prospects of the army, his sense of the importance of an energetic negotiation, and the high distinction, rendered an object of desire. On the other hand, the 
news of the capture of his father, would naturally inspire 
his son with a wish to seize this opportunity of obtaining his 
release. Hamilton immediately relinquished his pretensions ; but the warmth of Laurens' friendship triumphed 
over his filial feelings, and he urged the consent of Hamilton, with an avowal, that he would prefer confiding to him 
the fate of his father. A scene of generous contention ensued, mutually honourable, and characteristic. Hamilton 
prevailed ; and on the eleventh of December, Laurens, 
having signified his assent to congress, was unanimously 
elected. 

The importance of giving a correct view of the state of 
affairs at this juncture, suggested to Hamilton the idea of a 
special letter of instructions, in addition to that which had 
been given to the envoy by congress, being addressed to him 
by General Washington, which, in the opinion of La Fayette, it was supposed would add additional weight to his 
representations. This important duty was delegated to 
Hamilton by Washington, and will be read with interest, as 
containing a full exposition of the resources and situation of 
the country at that critical juncture. 

WASHINGTON TO LAURENS. 

"In compliance with your request, I shall commit to 
writing the result of our conferences on the present state of 
American affairs ; in which I have given you my opinion 
with that freedom and explicitness, which the objects of 



328 



THE LIFE OF 



your commission, my entire confidence in you, and the exigency of our affairs demand. 

" 1st. To me it appears evident, that, considering the diffused population of these states, the consequent difficulty of 
drawing together their resources, the composition and temper of a part of their inhabitants, the want of a sufficient 
stock of national wealth, as a basis for revenue, and the almost total extinction of commerce, the efforts that we have 
been compelled to make for carrying on the war, have exceeded the natural abilities of this country, and, by degrees, 
brought us to a crisis that makes the most efficacious and 
immediate succour from abroad indispensable to our safety. 

" 2d. That notwithstanding, from the confusion inseparable from a revolution ; from our having governments to 
frame, and every species of civil and military institutions to 
create ; from that inexperience in affairs necessarily incident to a nation in its commencement, some errors may 
have been committed in the administration of our finances, 
to which a part of our embarrassments may be attributed ; 
yet they are principally to be ascribed to an essential defect of means, the want of a sufficient stock of wealth, as 
mentioned in the first article, which want, continuing to 
operate, will make it impossible, by any interior exertions, 
to extricate ourselves from those embarrassments, restore 
the public credit, and furnish the requisite funds for canying on the war. 

" 3d. That experience has demonstrated it to be impossible long to support a paper credit without funds for its redemption ; that the depreciation of our currency \vas in 
the main a necessary effect of the want of those funds ; 
and that its restoration is impossible for the same reason, 
to which the general diffidence which has taken place 
among the people is an additional, and, in the present state 
of things, an insuperable obstacle. 

" 4th. That the mode which for want of money has been 
substituted for supplying the army, by assessing a portion 
of the productions of the earth, has hitherto been found to be 
ineffectual ; has frequently left the army to experience the 
most calamitous distress, and from its novelty and incompatibility with ancient habits is regarded by the people as 
burthensome and oppressive ; has excited serious discontents, and in some states there appear alarming symptoms 
of opposition. That this mode has, besides, many particular inconveniences, which contribute to make it inadequate 
to our exigencies, and ineligible but as an auxiliary. 

" 5th. That the resource of domestic loans is inconsiderable ; .because there are, properly speaking, few moneyed 
men in this country, and the few there are, can employ 
their money to more advantage otherwise ; besides which, 
the instability of our currency, and the want of funds, have 
impaired the public credit. That from the best estimates 
of the annual expense of the war, and the annual revenues 
which these states are capable of producing, there is a large 
balance to be made up by public credit. 

" 6th. That the patience of the army, from an almost uninterrupted series of complicated distress, is now nearly 
exhausted ; their discontents are matured to an extremity 
which has recently had the most disagreeable consequences, and demonstrates the absolute necessity of speedy relief. You are too well acquainted with all their sufferings, 
for want of clothing, for want of subsistence, for want of 
pay. 

" 7th. That the people begin to be dissatisfied with the 
present system for the support of the war ; and there is 
cause to apprehend that evils actually felt in the prosecution of it, may weaken those sentiments which, began it, 
founded, not on immediate sufferings, but on a speculative 
apprehension of evils to arise in future from the deprivation of our liberties. There is danger that a commercial 
and free people, little accustomed to heavy burdens, presaed by impositions of a new and odious kind, may not make 
a proper allowance for the necessity of the conjuncture, 
and may imagine they have only exchanged one tyranny 
for another. 

" 8th. That from all the foregoing considerations results, 
first, the absolute necessity of an immediate, ample, and 
efficacious succour of money, considerable enough to be a 
foundation for permanent arrangements of finance ; to restore the public credit, and give new life and activity to 
our future operations. Secondly, the vast importance of a 
decided effort of the allied arms upon this country the ensuing campaign, to give a fatal blow to the power of the 
enemy, and secure the great objects of the war, the liberty and independence of these states. Without the first, we 
may make a feeble and expiring effort the next campaign, 
which would, in all probability, be the period of our opposition. With it, we should be in a condition to continue 
the war as long as the obstinacy of the enemy might require. The first is essential to the last : both combined, 
would at once bring the contest to a glorious issue ; put 
the objects of the alliance out of the reach of contingencies ; crown the obligations which America already feels 
to the magnanimity and generosity of her allies, and perpetuate the union by those ties of gratitude and affection, 
as well as mutual advantage, which alone can render it solid and indissoluble. 

" 9th. That next to a loan of money, a constant naval superiority on these coasts, is the object which most interests 
us. This would instantly reduce the enemy to a difficult 
defensive, and by depriving them of all prospect of extending their acquisitions, would take away the motives for 
prosecuting the war. Indeed, it is not easy to conceive, 
how they could subsist a large force in this country, if we 
had the command of the seas to interrupt the regular transmission of supplies from Europe. This superiority (with 
an aid of money) would enable us to convert the operations 
of the war into a vigorous offensive. I say nothing of the 
advantages to our trade, nor how infinitely it would facilitate our supplies. In short, it seems to be a deciding point. 
It appears, too, to be the interest of our allies, abstracted from the immediate benefits to this country, to transfer 
the whole naval war to America. The number of ports 
friendly to them and hostile to the British ; the materials 
this country affords for repairing the disabled ships ; the 
large quantities of provisions towards the subsistence of 
the fleet ; are circumstances which would give a palpable 
advantage to our allies in a naval contest in these seas. 

" That notwithstanding the embarrassments under which 
we labour, and the inquietudes prevailing among the people, there is still a fund of inclination and resources in this 
country, equal to great and continued exertions ; provided 
we have it in our power to stop the progress of disgust, by 
changing the present system, by restoring public credit, 
and by giving activity to our measures ; of all which, a 
powerful succour of money might be the basis. The people are dissatisfied ; but it is with the feeble and oppressive 
mode of conducting the war, not with the war itself. They 
are not unwilling to contribute to its support, but they are 
unwilling to do it in a way that renders private property 
precarious, a necessary consequence of the fluctuation of 
the national currency, and of the inability of government 
to perform its engagements coercively made. A large majority are still firmly attached to its independence ; abhor a 
re-union with Great Britain ; and are affectionate to the 
alliance with France : but this disposition cannot supply the 
place of the means essential in war, nor can we rely on its 
continuance amid the perplexities, oppressions, and misfortunes that attend the want of them. 

" That no nation will have it more in its power to repay 
what it may borrow than this. Our debts are small ; the 
immense tracts of unlocated lands ; the variety and fertility of soils ; the advantages of every kind which we possess 
for commerce, insure to this country a rapid progress in 
population and prosperity, and a certainty, its independence being established, of reducing, in a short term of years, 
the comparatively inconsiderable debts we may have occasion to contract. 

" If the foregoing observations will be of any use to you, 
I shall be happy. I wish you a safe and pleasant voyage, 
the full accomplishment of your mission, and a speedy return ; - being, with sentiments of perfect friendship, regard, 
and affection, dear sir, 

" Your obedient servant, 

" G. W."* 

Colonel Laurens sailed from the United States in the 
Alliance frigate, on the sixteenth of February, accompanied 
by Major Jackson, an officer of distinguished gallantry, 
whose important services during the mission, called forth 
his repeated and warmest acknowledgements. 

Hamilton had now been in the family of the commanderin-chief near four years, and the extent of his services has 
been partly shown. This connexion, under circumstances 
of such interest, terminated within a few days after the departure of Laurens. It will be seen, that it was the desire 

It will be observed, by a comparison of this document with that inserted 
in the diplomatic correspondence, that there is a difference in the disposition of 
the parts of these instructions, and that the copy given to Laurens was fuller. 
The difference is not, however, important. The above is copied from the first 
draft, in Hamilton's autograph, with the exception of the four closing lines, 
which are added in the handwriting of Washington. Colonel Hamilton, also, 
a short time after, drew up a general view of the classification of crimes, and 
the apportionment of punishments, to be adopted in the army ; condemning 
the arbitrary punishments which a defective system had produced, and also 
making a very important suggestion as to the terms and forms of discharges 
to be granted to the soldiers, both as a reward of merit, and a prevention oi 
desertion, 
of both parties that the breach which had occurred should 
be concealed ; but their relations were too conspicuous to 
admit of it, and when it became known, the circumstances 
were variously related, and the facts distorted. 

The erroneous statements which have been made on this 
subject, render necessary the publication of parts of a letter to General Schuyler, written by Hamilton, with the 
minutest accuracy, within two days after the occurrence, 
as a vindication of his conduct, in this, one of the most trying moments of his early life. 

Head Quarters, New- Windsor, February 18th, 1781. 
MY DEAR SIR, 

Since I had the pleasure of writing you last, an unexpected change has taken place in my situation. I am no 
longer a member of the General's family. This information will surprise you, and the manner of the change will 
surprise you more. Two days ago, the General and I 
passed each other on the stairs ; he told me he wanted 
to speak to me, I answered that I would wait upon him 
immediately. I went below, and delivered Mr. Tilghman 
a letter to be sent to the commissary, containing an order 
of a pressing and interesting nature. 

Returning to the General, I was stopped on the way by 
the Marquis de La Fayette, and we conversed together 
about a minute on a matter of business. He can testify 
how impatient I was to get back, and that I left him in a 
manner which, but for our intimacy, would have been more 
than abrupt. Instead of finding the General, as is usual, in 
his room, I met him at the head of the stairs, where accosting me in an angry tone, " Colonel Hamilton, (said he,) 
you have kept me waiting at the head of the stairs these 
ten minutes ; I must tell you, sir, you treat me with disrespect." I replied, without petulancy, but with decision, 
" I ain not conscious of it, sir, but since you have thought 
it necessary to tell me so, we part." " Very well, sir, (said 
he,) if it be your choice," or something to this effect, and we 
separated. I sincerely believe my absence, which gave so 
much umbrage, did not last two minutes. 

In less than an hour after, Tilghman came to me in the 
General's name, assuring me of his great confidence in my 
abilities, integrity, usefulness, &c., and of his desire, in a 
candid conversation, to heal a difference which could not 
have happened but in a moment of passion. I requested 
Mr. Tilghman to tell him, 1st. That I had taken my resolution in a manner not to be revoked. 2d. That as a conversation could serve no other purpose than to produce explanations, mutually disagreeable, though I certainly would 
not refuse an interview, if he desired it, yet I would be happy, if he would permit me to decline it. 3d. That though 
determined to leave the family, the same principles which 
had kept me so long in it, would continue to direct my conduct towards him when out of it. 4th. That, however, I 
did not wish to distress him, or the public business, by quitting him before he could derive other assistance by the return of some of the gentlemen who were absent. 5th. And 
that in the mean time, it depended on him, to let our behaviour to each other be the same as if nothing had happened. He consented to decline the conversation, and thanked 
me for my offer of continuing my aid in the manner I had 
mentioned. 

I have given you so particular a detail of our difference, 
from the desire I have to justify myself in your opinion. 
Perhaps you may think I was precipitate in rejecting the 
overture made by the General to an accommodation. I 
assure you, my dear sir, it was not the effect of resentment ; 
it was the deliberate result of maxims I had long formed 
for the government of my own conduct. 

I always disliked the office of an aid-de-camp, as having 
in it a kind of personal dependence. I refused to serve in 
this capacity with two Major Generals, at an early period 
of the war. Infected, however, with the enthusiasm of the 
times, an idea of the General's character overcame my 
scruples, and induced me to accept his invitation to enter 
into his family * * *. I(. has been often with great difficulty that I have prevailed upon myself not to renounce it ; 
but while, from motives of public utility, I was doing violence to my feelings, I was always determined, if there 
should ever happen a breach between us, never to consent 
to an accommodation. I was persuaded, that when once 
that nice barrier, which marked the boundaries of what we 
owed to each other, should be thrown down, it might be 
propped again, but could never be restored. 

The General is a very honest man ; his competitors 
have slender abilities, and less integrity. His popularity 
has often been essential to the safety of America, and is 
still of great importance to it. These considerations have 
influenced my past conduct respecting him, and will influence my future ; I think it is necessary he should be 
supported. 

His estimation in your mind, whatever maybe its amount, 
I am persuaded has been formed on principles, which a 
circumstance like this cannot materially affect ; but if I 
thought it could diminish your friendship for him, I should 
almost forego the motives that urge me to justify myself to 
you. I wish what I have said to make no other impression, than to satisfy you I have not been in the wrong. It 
is also said in confidence, as a public knowledge of the 
breach would, in many ways, have an ill effect. It will, 
probably, be the policy of both sides to conceal it, and cover the separation with some plausible pretext. I am importuned by such of my friends as are privy to the affair, to 
listen to a reconciliation ; but my resolution is unalterable. 

As I cannot think of quitting the army during the war, I 
have a project of re-entering into the artillery, by taking 



THE LIFE OF 

Lieutenant Colonel Forrest's place, who is desirous of retiring on half-pay. I have not, however, made up my mind 
upon this head, as I should be obliged to come in the 
youngest lieutenant colonel instead of the eldest, which 
I ought to have been by natural succession, had I remained 
in the corps; and, at the same time, to resume studies relative to the profession, which to avoid inferiority, must be 
laborious. 

If a handsome command in the campaign in the light infantry should offer itself, I shall balance between this and 
the artillery. My situation in the latter would be more 
solid and permanent ; but as I ^hope the war will not last 
long enough to make it progressive, this consideration has 
the less force. A command for the campaign, would leave 
me the winter to prosecute studies relative to my future 
career in life * * *. I have written to you on this subject 
with all the freedom and confidence to which you have a 
right, and with an assurance of the interest you take in all 
that concerns me. 

Very sincerely and affectionately, 
I am, dear sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

A. HAMILTON. 

While giving this representation of an event attended 
with circumstances of so much delicacy, it is gratifying to 
remark, that an incident, which, in other individuals, might 
have tended to lessen our respect, either for one or both of 
the parties, serves only to add to our higher estimation of 
each. , 

Washington, to whom all the world was offering incense, 
betrayed into the indulgence of a momentary error of temper, makes an advance to conciliation with the friend whose 
feelings he had injured ; while Hamilton, with a high sense 
of character, and a strong self-reliance, relinquishes a situation, the object of ambition to many a gallant soldier, and 
of which the marked confidence of Washington had increased the importance, to re-enter the line of the army, 
with a doubtful prospect of employment, and possibly the 
object of hostility to the wounded pride of its chief, and 
that chief the man whom his country adored. 

But the result of his decision demonstrated its wisdom. 
Losing none of the confidence and respect of Washington, 
he continued, though unconnected with him by any immediate military relation, to aid him with his counsel on various occasions, until they are seen again, drawn together by 
mutual regard to the public interests, to the closest and 
most intimate connexion, which terminated only with their 
lives. 

From the moment Hamilton's separation from the family 
of Washington was known, such was his standing in the 
army, that the occurrence was generally regretted. Letters were addressed to him, expressive ,of the warmest attachment, which, though felt by many, was by none more 
strongly shown, than by the officers of France, who evinced 
the deepest interest in his welfare. His high place in the 
confidence of the commander, gave him an influence in 
rendering those kindnesses which the situation of foreigners 
peculiarly required ; and his readiness, on all occasions, to 
promote their wishes, led them to regret his leaving head 
quarters, as an event by which they had lost a friend, on 
whose affection they could repose every reliance. 

Considerations of mere gratitude or interest were not 
alone in recommending him to their regard. In the situation of the country, few of its young soldiers had enjoyed 
those advantages, which enabled them to enter into the 
gayeties of French manners, and to give zest to a society, 
of which the usages were so unlike those then prevailing in 
America. His command of their language, a natural turn 
for pleasantry, a happy facility in adapting himself to the 



338 THE LIF OF 

character of his associates, a freedom from those prejudices above which persons of the most distinguished merit 
do not always rise, and his warmth of heart, and romantic 
temper, rendered him a welcome inmate to their convivialities, and gave him the first place among the American officers in their affections. 

La Fayette, his early, his constant, his illustrious friend, 
as he had been privy to many of the most confidential incidents of Washington's life, and was aware of the importance of Hamilton's services, seemed most to have regretted 
it, and with the same warmth which he had shown in endeavouring to promote Hamilton's wishes on former occasions, now sought to produce a reconciliation ; but, as he 
says, " when, after having explained the delay privately, he 
expressed to each of them his own feelings, he found each 
disposed to believe the other was not sorry for the separation. It did not, however, go farther than leaving the family ; the advice of Hamilton has since, in several circumstances, been friendly asked by the commander-in-chief." 

The following letters addressed to him, a short time after 
this event, are indicative of the feelings which were entertained towards him. 

LA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON. 

Elk, April 10th, 1781. 

Where is, for the present, my dear Hamilton ? This 
question is not a mere affair of curiosity. It is not even 
wholly owing to the tender sentiments of my friendship. 
But motives, both of a public and private nature, conspire 
in making me wish that your wo be not accomplished. 
Perhaps you are at head quarters, perhaps at Albany ; at 
all events, I'll tell you my history. 

Had the French fleet come in, Arnold was ours. The 
more certain it was, the greater my disappointment has 
been ; at last it has become necessary for them to return 
to Rhode-Island. I think they have exerted themselves for 
the common good, and this has been a comfort in our misfortune. Having luckily arrived at Elk by water, which 
at first I had no right to expect, I have received the General's letter. If you are at head quarters, you will have 
seen my correspondence with the General ; if not, I tell you 
that I am ordered to the southern army, and the General 
thinks that the army under his immediate command will 
remain inactive. After a march of forty days, we will arrive at a time when the heat of the season will put an end 
to operations. This detachment is so circumstanced, as to 
make it very inconvenient for officers and men to proceed. 
Before we arrive, we shall perhaps be reduced to five or 
six hundred men. 

There will be no light infantry formed, no attack 
against New- York, none of those things which had flattered my mind. 

If a corps is sent to the southward by land, it ought to 
have been the Jersey line, because if we weaken ourselves, 
New- York will be out of the question. 

Monsieur Destouches will, I think, propose to the General to send to Philadelphia 1'Eveille, and all the frigates ; 
these, with the frigates now at Philadelphia, would carry 
fifteen hundred men to whatever part of the continent the 
General would think proper. We could then go to Morristown, there to form a new corps of light infantry upon 
the principles at first intended, and embarking in the first 
days of May, we could be at Wilmington, Georgetown, or 
any where else, sooner than we can now be by land. 

I would have the battalions composed of six companies ; 
colonels employed, Webb, Sprout, Huntington, Olney, 
Hull, Barber, Gimat, Laurens ; Majors Willet, Fish, 

Gibbes, Inspector Smith, , and another ; Brigadier 

General Huntington and Scamell, and a good corps of artillery under ******. My dear friend, you would be more 
important at head quarters ; but if you don't stay there, 
you know what you have promised to me. Adieu. Write 
me often and long letters. It is probable I will be in the 
southern wilderness until the end of the war, far from head 
quarters, from the French army, from my correspondence 
with France ; but the whole good I could have operated, in 
this last instance, must have taken place by this time. My 
best respects and affectionate compliments wait on Mrs. 
Hamilton. 

Most friendly, yours, 

LA FAYETTE. 

On the eighteenth, (April,) he writes him from the Susquehanna : 

" DEAR HAMILTON, 

" You are so sensible a fellow, that you can certainly explain to me what is the matter that New-York is given up ; 
that our letters to France go for nothing ; that while the 
French are coming, I am going. This last matter gives 
great uneasiness to the Minister of France. All this is not 
comprehensible to me, who having been long from head 
quarters, have lost the course of intelligence. 

" Have you left the family, my dear sir ? I suppose so ; 
but from love to the General, for whom you know my affection, I ardently wish it was not the case ; many, many 
reasons conspire to this desire of mine. But if you do leave 
it, and if I go to exile, come and partake it with me. 

" Yours, 

"1. f." 

The approaching period of service, and the hopes which 
began to be indulged of an active campaign, inspired Hamilton with a strong desire to obtain a situation in which 
he might seize the first opportunity to increase his reputation. The letters of his friends, and especially those received from the Marquis, quickened his wishes, and with a determination to continue in the service until the independence of the country was secured, he now resolved to renew 
his application for a separate command, which had failed 
in the preceding autumn ; and with this view addressed the 
following letter to the commander-in-chief. 

SIR, 

I imagine your excellency has been informed, that in 
consequence of the resolution of congress for granting commissions to aid-de-camps appointed under the former establishment, I have obtained one of lieutenant colonel in the 
army of the United States, bearing rank since the first of 
March, 1777. 

It is become necessary to me to apply to your excellency, 
to know in what manner you foresee you will be able to 
employ me in the ensuing campaign. I am ready to enter 
into activity whenever you think proper ; though I am not 
anxious to do it till the army takes the field, as before that 
period I perceive no object. 

Unconnected as I am with any regiment, I can have no 
other command than in a light corps, and I flatter myself 
my pretensions to this are good. 

Your excellency knows I have been in actual service 
since the beginning of '76. I began in the line, and had I 
continued there, I ought, in justice, to have been more advanced in rank than I now am. I believe my conduct in 
the different capacities in which I have acted, has appeared 
to the officers of the army in general such as to merit their 
confidence and esteem ; and I cannot suppose them to be 
so ungenerous as not to see me with pleasure put into a 
situation still to exercise the disposition I have always had, 
of being useful to the United States. I mention these things 
only to show that I do not apprehend the same difficulties 
can exist in my case, (which is peculiar,) that have opposed 
the appointment to commands of some other officers, not 
belonging to what is called the line. 

Though the light infantry is chiefly formed, yet being 
detached to the southward, I take it for granted there will 
be a van guard by detachment formed for this army. 
I have the honour to be, very respectfully, 

Your excellency's most obedient servant, 

A. HAMILTON. 
De Peyster's Point, April 27, 1731. 

The following reply was immediately given. 

New- Windsor, April 27th, 1781. 
DEAR SIR, 

Your letter of this date has not a little embarrassed me. 
You must remember the ferment in the Pennsylvania line 
the last campaign, occasioned by the appointment of Major 
McPherson, and you know the uneasiness which at this 
moment exists among the eastern officers, on account of 
the commands conferred upon Colonel Gimat and Major 
Galvan, although it was the result of absolute necessity. 

Should circumstances admit of the formation of another 
advanced corps, of which I see very little prospect from 
present appearances, it can be but small, and must be 
composed almost entirely of eastern troops ; and to add to 
the discontents of the officers of those lines, by the farther 
appointment of an officer of your rank to the command of 
it, or in it, would, I am certain, involve me in a difficulty 
of a very disagreeable and delicate nature, and might, perhaps, lead to consequences more serious than it is easy to 
imagine. While I adhere firmly to the right of making 
such appointments as you request, I am, at the same time, 
obliged to reflect, that it will not do to push that right too 
far, more especially in a service like ours, and at a time so 
critical as the present. 
I am convinced, that no officer can, with justice, dispute 
your merit or abilities. The opposition heretofore made 
had not been for the want of those qualifications in the 
gentlemen who are, and have been, the objects of discontent. The officers of the line contend, without having reference to particular persons, that it is a hardship and reflection upon them, to introduce brevet officers into commands, (of some permanency,) in which there are more opportunities of distinguishing themselves, than in the line of 
the army at large, and with the men they have had the 
trouble to discipline and to prepare for the field. My principal concern arises from an apprehension that you will impute my refusal of your request to other motives than those 
I have expressed, but I beg you to be assured, I am only 
influenced by the reasons which I have mentioned. 
I am, dear sir, 

Your obedient and humble servant, 

GEO. WASHINGTON. 

Hamilton, deeming his case one which ought to be distinguished from those which Washington had adduced as precedents, wrote him a farther letter, on the second of May. 

SIR, 

I am extremely sorry to have embarrassed you by my 
late application, and that you should think there are insuperable obstacles to a compliance with it. Having renounced my expectations. I have no other inducement for 
troubling your excellency with a second letter, than to obviate the appearance of having desired a thing inconsistent 
with the good of the service, while I was acquainted with 
the circumstances that made it so. 

I was too interested a spectator of what happened in the 
case of Major McPherson, not to have remarked, and not 
to recollect, all the circumstances. The opposition turned, 



344 THE LIFE OP 

\ 

ostensibly, on his being a brevet officer, yet having a command in a corps formed entirely from one line ; the propriety of his being employed in a detachment from the army at large, so far as I remember, was not disputed. In 
delicacy to Major McPherson, no personal objections were 
formally made, but in reality they existed and contributed 
to the discontent. It was thought a peculiar hardship, that 
a gentleman who had, for a long time, fought against us, 
and had not taken part with us till a late period, and when 
our affairs had assumed a more prosperous aspect, should 
be preferred in one of the most honorary commands of the 
service. Your excellency must be convinced, that I mention this in no other view than to show the sentiments of 
the officers at the time, and the whole grounds of the opposition. My esteem for Major McPherson, and other reasons, make it impossible I can have a different intention. 

I know less of the motives of dissatisfaction in the cases 
of Colonel Gimat and Major Galvan ; but I have understood, that it is founded on their being appointed in the light 
corps for two successive campaigns. 

It would be uncandid in me not to acknowledge, that I 
believe a disposition to exclude brevet officers in general 
from command, has a great share in the opposition, in every 
instance, and that so far it affects my case. But, at the same 
time, it appeans to me, this principle alone can never be productive of more than momentary murmurs, where it is not 
seconded by some plausible pretext. I also am convinced, 
that the Pennsylvania officers, for their own sakes, repented 
the rash steps they had taken, and, on cool reflection, were 
happy in an opportunity to relinquish their menaces of quitting a service to which they were attached by habit, inclination, and interest, as well as by patriotism. I believe, too, 
we shall never have a similar instance in the army, unless 
the practice should be carried to excess. Major Galvan, I 
am told, will probably be relieved. Colonel Gimat will be 
then the only brevet officer remaining in command. Your 
excellency is the best judge of the proper limits; and there 
can be no doubt, that the rights of particular officers ought 
to give place to the general good and tranquillity of the service. 

I cannot forbear repeating, that my case is peculiar, and 
dissimilar to all the former ; it is distinguished by the circumstances I have before intimated, my early entrance 
into the service, my having made the campaign of '76, 
the most disagreeable of the war, at the head of a company 
of artillery, and having been entitled, in that corps, to a 
rank, equal in degree, more ancient in date, than I now possess, my having made all the subsequent campaigns in 
the family of the commander-in-chief, in a constant course 
of important and laborious service. These are my pretensions, at this advanced period of the war, to being employed 
in the only way which my situation admits ; and I imagine 
they would have their weight in the minds of the officers in 
general. I only urge them a second time, as reasons which 
will not suffer me to view the matter in the same light with 
your excellency, or to regard as impracticable my appointment in a light corps, should there be one formed. I entreat they may be understood in this sense only. I am incapable of wishing to obtain any object by importunity. 

I assure your excellency, that I am too well persuaded of 
your candour, to attribute your refusal to any other cause 
than an apprehension of inconveniences that may attend the 
appointment. 

I have the honour to be, with perfect respect, sir, 

Your most obedient and humble servant, 

A. HAMILTON. 

P. S. I have used the term brevet in the sense your excellency appears to have understood it, as signifying, in general, all officers not attached to any established corps. Congress, however, seem to have made a distinction ; they give 
only a kind of warrant to those whom they designate as 
brevet officers ; mine is a regular commission. 

DC Peystcr's Point, May 2d, 1781. 

Within a short time after this correspondence closed, a 
letter was received from La Fayette, dated Richmond, 
May 23, 1781. 

MY DEAR HAMILTON, 

I have been long complaining that I had nothing to do ; 
and want of employment was an objection I had to my 
going to the southward. But for the present, my dear 
friend, my complaint is quite of an opposite nature ; and I 
have so many arrangements to make, so many difficulties 
to combat, so many enemies to deal with, that I am just 
that much of a general as will make me an historian of misfortunes, and nail my name upon the ruins of what good 
soldiers are pleased to call the army in Virginia. 

There is an age past since I heard from you. I acknowledge that, on my part, I have not written so often as I 
ought to have done ; but you will excuse this silence in 
favour of my very embarrassing circumstances. However 
remote you may be from your former post of aid-de-camp 
to the commander-jn-chief, I am sure you are nevertheless 
acquainted with every transaction at head quarters. My 
letters have served to your information, and I shall consequently abstain from repetitions. 

Our forced march saved Richmond. Philips w r as going 
down, and thus far I am very happy. Philips' return, his 
landing at Brendon, south side of James river, and the unmolested joining of Lord Cornwallis through North Carolina, made me apprehensive of the storm that was gathering. I advanced towards Petersburg, and intended to have 
established a communication upon James and Appamatox 
rivers. Had Philips marched to Halifax, I was determined 
to follow him, and should have risked every thing rather 
to omit making a diversion in favour of Greene. But that 
army took possession of Petersburg, and obliged me to 
stick to the side of the river, whence reinforcements are 
expected. Both armies have formed their junction of between four and five thousand men. We have no continentals ; their infantry is near five to one; their cavalry ten to 
one. Our militia are not numerous, without arms, and are 
not used to war. Government wants energy ; and there 
is nothing to enforce the laws. General Greene has directed me to take command in this state, and I must tell 
you, by the way, his letter is very polite and affectionate. 
It then became my duty to arrange the departments, which 
1 found in the greatest confusion and relaxation ; nothing 
can be obtained, and yet expenses are enormous. The Baron, and the few new levies we could collect, are ordered 
to South Carolina. I am glad he goes, as the hatred of the 
Virginians to him was pretty hurtful to the service. Is it 
not strange that General Wayne's detachment cannot be 
heard of? They are to go to Carolina ; but should I have 
them for a few days, I am at liberty to keep them. This 
permission I will improve so far as to receive one blow, 
that, being beat, I may at least be beat with some decency. 
There are accounts that Lord Cornwallis is very strong, 
others make him very weak. In this country there is no 
getting good intelligence. I request you will write me, if 
you approve of my conduct. The command of the waters, 
the superiority in cavalry, and the great disproportion of 
forces, gave the enemy such advantages that I durst not 
venture out, and listen to my fondness for enterprise ; to 
speak truth, I was afraid of myself as much as of the enemy. Independence has rendered me the more cautious, as 
I know my own warmth ; but if the Pennsylvanians come, 
Lord Cornwallis shall pay something for his victory. 
I wish a reinforcement of light infantry, to recruit the 
battalions, or a detachment under General Huntington was 
sent to me. I wish Laurens or Sheldon were immediately 
despatched with some horse. Come here, my dear friend, 
and command our artillery in Virginia. I want your advices and your exertions. If you grant my request, you 
will vastly oblige your friend, 

LA FAYETTE.

Having completed the details of circumstances of a personal nature, we now return to events of more general interest. 

The suggestions which had been made by Hamilton to 
Mr. Duane, in the preceding summer, although they led to 
no immediate measures, were presented by the latter to the 
consideration of his friends in congress, and became the 
subject of much serious reflection. The diminished importance which that body felt would result from the proposed 
transfer of their direct patronage, by the abolition of the 
various subsidiary boards, to executive departments, and 
the vanity of individuals who had long been most active in 
the committees, all concurred to delay the measure ; but 
the good sense of congress at last prevailed. The new 
board of treasury, with all its complicated branches, was 
found wholly incompetent to its objects, and a committee of 
congress, which had been appointed to devise a system for 
the arrangement of " the civil executive departments," rer 
ported a plan for the establishment of a secretary of foreign 
affairs, which was followed by a farther report, recommending* the appointment of a superintendent of finance, 
a secretary of war, and of the marine ; and in the course 
of the year, Robert R. Livingston was chosen to the department of state, Robert Morris superintendent of finance, Ge^ 

'February, 1781. 
neral McDougal secretary of the marine, and General Lincoln secretary at war.* 

The pressure of the exigencies, and more enlightened 
counsels, which had induced congress to part with such an 
essential portion of their authority, in the creation of these 
departments, influenced them, at the same time, to adopt 
another measure, which, had it been carried into effect, 
would have at once restored the public credit, secured resources for the discharge of the debt, and established a permanent basis for a general and adequate system of finance. 
It was a motion, by Dr. Witherspoon, that the United 
States should be empowered to superintend the commercial 
regulations of every state, so that none might take place 
that should be partial, or contrary to the common interest ; 
and that they should be vested with the exclusive right of 
laying duties on all imported articles; no restriction to be 
valid, and no such duty to be laid, but with the consent of 
nine states, with provisions to secure uniformity. The enlarged views embraced in this resolution were not sanctioned ; but another measure of great moment was recommended, that the states should confer on congress the 
power of levying an impost of five per cent, on imported 
articles, to be applied to the discharge of the debts incurred 
for supporting the war, and to continue until they were discharged. 

* In a letter from Samuel Adams, of the 9th December, 1783, he says, 
" Power will follow the possession of money, even when it is known that it 
is not the possessor's property; so fascinating are riches in the eyes 'of mankind. Were our financier, I wap going to say, even an angel from heaven, I 
hope he will never have so much influence, as to gain the ascendency over 
congress, which the first lord of the treasury has long had over the parliament 
of Britain, long enough to-efiect the ruin of that nation. These are the fears 
which I expressed in congress, when the department was first instituted. I 
was told, that the breath of congress could annihilate the financier ; but I replied, that the time might come, and if they were not careful, it certainly 
would, when even congress would not dare to blow that breath : whether 
these fears are the mere creatures of the imagination, you will judge." 
On the thirtieth of July, 1777, an adjourned convention 
of delegates from several states was held at Springfield, 
which proposed the abolition of a limitation of prices ; the 
gradual "drawing in" of the paper money; and its being 
funded at an interest of six per cent., and a system of taxation as a mean to this object. This subject was resumed by 
a convention which assembled at Hartford, in October, 1779, 
and which adjourned to meet in Philadelphia in the following 
January, when resolutions were adopted, recommending 
that Virginia should appoint commissioners to convene at 
Hartford in the ensuing autumn. The deliberations of this 
convention produced an early attention to this subject in 
congress ; and in March, 1780, a motion was made by Mr. 
Burke, of North Carolina, " that the stales be requested to 
pass laws, enabling congress to levy an impost of one per 
cent, on all exports and imports, as a fund for sinking the 
emissions for carrying on the present war ; to continue until a sum equal to the whole of the said emissions shall be 
collected," which was lost. 

Nine commissioners assembled at Hartford, in pursuance 
of their adjournment, among whom were Judge Hobart 
and Egbert Benson of New- York. Upon much deliberation, a paper was addressed to congress, which, after touching upon several military matters, recommends, in the sixth 
article of their proceedings, that an estimate be made of all 
the interest due on loan office certificates, and on all other 
debts incurred by continental purchasing officers ; that 
taxes should be imposed by congress on certain specific articles ; or duties on imports, which the states should authorize them to levy and collect. This authority only to take 
effect with the concurrence of all the states not in possession of the enemy ; the proceeds to be appropriated to the 
payment of the interest of the debt. A return of the white 
and black inhabitants was also recommended, and a continental judicature, of three persons, to try offences against 
the laws of congress, was suggested. This letter was read 
in congress, on the twelfth of December, 1 780, and in February following, Egbert Benson was appointed procurator.* 

The important proposal of a national impost, which became the leading subject of controversy during many years, 
that on which the whole system of public credit depended, 
and which may be considered as the most prominent in 
the train of events that led to the adoption of the federal 
constitution, was resisted by the jealousy of several of the 
commercial states, who imagined, that by entrusting congress with the control of their customs, they were parting 
with every essential attribute of sovereignty. 

Nothing seemed left to relieve the finances of the country, but the adoption of some measure by which a new 
" mass of credit" could be created, and the depreciated paper replaced by a currency of fixed value, adequately sustained. A recent resolution! of congress, passed with but 
one dissenting voice, " to pay all the debts which had been 
liquidated in specie value, or which had been, or should be, 
made payable in specie or its equivalent, actually in specie 
or its equivalent," and a recommendation to the states to 
amend their laws, making the bills of credit emitted under 
the authority of congress a legal tender, so that they should 
not be a tender in any other manner than at their current 
value, compared with gold and silver, gave evidence of a 
sound state of public opinion. 

Encouraged by these indications, Hamilton resumed his 

* Among the proposals to invigorate the confederation, was one made on 
the sixteenth March, 1781, that under a construction of the thirteenth article 
of the confederation, it should be so amended, " that if any state refused to observe all the articles of the confederation, congress should be empowered to 
authorize the land and naval forces of the United States to compel such state 
to fulfil its federal engagements, and also to make restraint on its merchandise." 

t March sixteenth, 1781. 
plan of a national bank, of which the first suggestion was 
made by him to Robert Morris. 

The Bank of Pennsylvania, which had been established 
in June, though partial in its objects, having been a bank 
merely of deposit, not of issue, had given congress such 
aid as predisposed them to the adoption of a more extensive system. 

The character of the individual who had been elected superintendent of finance, encouraged Hamilton to hope for 
the attainment of his project ; and with this view, on the 
thirtieth of April, 1781, he addressed an elaborate letter to 
Mr. Robert Morris, the fruits of his leisure, since he had been 
relieved from the duties of aid-de-camp, discussing at large 
the causes of the depreciation, and indicating the means of 
raising the value of the currency, and at the same time enclosing a charter for a bank to be incorporated by congress. 

This plan was prefaced by the following observations : 

April 30th, 1781. 

I was among the first who were convinced that an administration by single men was essential to the proper 
management of the affairs of this country. I am persuaded 
it is the only resource we have to extricate ourselves from 
the distresses which threaten the subversion of our cause. 
It is palpable that the people have lost all confidence in our 
public councils, and it is a fact, of which I dare say you are 
as well apprized as myself, that our friends in Europe are 
in the same disposition. I have been in a situation that 
has enabled me to obtain a better idea of this than most 
others, and I venture to assert, that the court of France 
will never give half the succours to this country while congress hold the reins of administration in their own hands, 
which they would grant if these were entrusted to individuals of established reputation, and conspicuous for probity, 
abilities, and fortune. 
With respect to ourselves, there is so manifest and rooted 
a diffidence of the government, that if we could be assured 
the future measures of congress would be dictated by the 
most perfect wisdom and public spirit, there would be stiH 
a necessity for a change in the forms of our administration, 
to give a new spring and current to the passions and hopes 
of the people. To me it appears evident, that an executive 
ministry, composed of men wjth the qualifications I have 
described, would speedily restore the credit of government 
abroad and at home ; would induce our allies to great exertions in our behalf; would inspire confidence in moneyed 
men in Europe, as well as in America, to lend us those 
sums of which it may be demonstrated we stand in need, 
from the disproportion of our national wealth to the expenses of the war. 

I hope, sir, you will not consider it a compliment, when 
I assure you that I heard, with the greatest satisfaction, of 
your nomination to the department of finance. 

In a letter of mine last summer to Mr. Duane, urging, 
among other things, the plan of an executive ministry, I 
mentioned you as the person who ought to fill that department. I know of no other in America who unites so many 
advantages ; and, of course, every impediment to your acceptance is to me a subject of chagrin. I flatter myself, 
congress will not preclude the public from your services, by 
an obstinate refusal of reasonable conditions ; and as one 
deeply interested in the event, I am happy in believing you 
will not easUy be discouraged from undertaking an office, 
by which you may render America and the world no less a 
servipe than the establishment of American independence. 
.'Tis by introducing order into our finances, by restoring 
public credit, not by gaining battles, that we are finally to 
attain our object. 'Tis by putting ourselves in a condition 
to continue the war, not by temporary, violent, and unnatural efforts to bring it to a decisive issue, that we shall in 



354 



THE LIFE OF 



reality bring it to a speedy and successful one. In the 
frankness of truth, I believe, sir, you are the man best capable of performing this great work. 

In expectation that all difficulties will be removed, and 
that you will ultimately act on terms you approve, I take 
the liberty to submit to you some ideas, relative to the objects of your department. I pretend not to be an able 
financier. It is a part of administration which has been 
least in my way, and of course has least occupied my inquiries and reflections ; neither have I had leisure or materials 
to make accurate calculations. I have been obliged to depend on memory for important facts, for want of the authorities from which they are drawn. 

With all these disadvantages, my plan must necessarily 
be crude and defective ; but it may be a basis for something 
more perfect, or if it contains any hints that may be of use 
to you, the trouble I have taken myself, or may give you, 
will not be misapplied. At any rate, the confidence I have 
in your judgement, assures me that you will receive with 
pleasure communications of this sort. If they contain any 
thing useful, they will promote your views, and the public 
benefit ; if not , the only evil is the trouble of reading them ; 
and the best informed will frequently derive lights even 
from the reveries of projectors and quacks. There is scarcely 
any plan so bad as not to have something good in it. I trust 
mine to your candour, with this apology, you will at least 
do justice to my intention. 

With these preliminary remarks, he proceeds to the inquiry as to " what ought to be done in the finances of the 
United States ?" First, to estimate its capacity for revenue, and the proportion between its abilities and its wants, 
by examining the proportion the revenues other countries 
have borne to their wealth, and applying the rule to America. Second, by comparing the result of that rule with the 
product of taxes in those states which have been most earnest in taxation. 

The result obtained, by an examination applied to Great 
Britain, France, and the United Provinces was, that the revenue is one fourth of the circulating cash in commercial 
countries, so far as this is a just representative of its labour 
and commodities. 

He then states the current cash of America, previous to 
the war, to have been about thirty millions of dollars, of 
which one eighth was specie ; and that the proper revenue, 
at that time, was seven and a half million of dollars. But 
as the system of taxation was carried to an extreme in those 
countries, that the rule is inapplicable in its full extent to 
the United States ; though a much larger amount than might 
be expected, could be levied during the war, without burthening the poorer classes, from the greater equality of fortunes, and a more equal division of the public burthens. 
Making the necessary qualifications, he arrives at the result, that the present revenue was one fifth less than it had 
been before the war. Having adverted to the causes of the 
diminished circulation, which he considers as principally 
artificial, he comes to the conclusion, allowing for the diminution of foreign trade, and the loss of territory, that the 
states have a nett revenue of six millions of dollars ; a result which is nearly confirmed by a detailed examination of 
the previous product of the taxes, of which Massachusetts 
was supposed to have raised one fifth. 

Taking this as the amount of revenue, he next proceeds 
to ascertain, by general rules, the military capacity of the 
country, which although it had at times risen to thirty thousand men, might be estimated at twenty thousand. The 
expenses incident to the support of which force, with the 
necessary civil expenditures, rendering the amount of the 
annual charges of the countiy less than eleven million of 
dollars, left a deficit of four and a half millions to be supplied 
by credit, foreign or domestic. He then examines the prospect from foreign loans, which taking into view the political and financial embarrassments of France, he supposes 
may justify an expectation of a loan annually of eight or ten 
million of livres, which would only meet a third of the national wants. 

From Spain, after remarking on her cold and passive 
policy, in pursuance of which the bills drawn on her, though 
not rejected, had not been paid, he expects nothing. 
" Their method of prosecuting the war, can scarcely be resolved into Spanish supineness, but seems to have a more 
corrupt original. A bigotted prince, governed by a greedy 
confessor, is a character on which little dependence can be 
placed," 

Holland, as a government, stands in need of all its credit 
for its own uses. But from the Dutch capitalists much 
might be expected, though not on the faith of the United 
States, by the establishment of a system such as he is about 
to propose. The prospects of internal loans to government, both from the want of confidence, and the more advantageous terms of traffic in which individual wealth could 
be employed, he rates very low. 

"To surmount these obstacles," he observes, "and give 
individuals ability and inclination to lend, a plan might be 
devised which, by incorporating their means together, and 
uniting them with those of the public, will, on the foundation of that incorporation and union, erect a mass of credit 
that will supply the defect of moneyed capital, and answer 
all the purposes of cash. A plan which will not only advance the interest of the lenders, secure the independence 
of their country, and in its progress have the most beneficial influence upon its future commerce, but be a source of 
national strength and wealth. I mean," he says, " the institution of a national bank. This I regard, in some shape 
or other, as an expedient essential to our safety and suecess, unless by a happy turn of European affairs, the war 
should speedily terminate, in a manner upon which it would 
be unwise to reckon. There is no other that can give to 
government that extensive and systematic credit, which the 
defect of our revenues makes indispensably necessary to 
its operations. The longer it is delayed, the more difficult 
it becomes. Our affairs grow every day more relaxed and 
more involved. Public credit hastens to a more irretrievable 
catastrophe. The means for executing the plan are exhausted in partial and temporary efforts. The loan now making 
in Massachusetts, would have gone a great way in establishing the funds on which the bank must stand. 

" I am aware of all the objections that have been made to 
public banks, and that they are not without enlightened and 
respectable opponents. But all that has been said against 
them only tends to prove, that like all other good things, 
they are subject to abuse, and when abused, become pernicious. The precious metals, by similar arguments, may 
be proved to be injurious. If is certain that the monies 
of South America have had great influence in banishing 
industry from Spain, and sinking it in real wealth and importance. Great power, commerce, and riches, or, in other 
words* great national prosperity, may, in like manner, be 
denominated evils ; for they lead to insolence, an inordinate ambition, a vicious luxury, licentiousness of morals, 
and all those vices which corrupt a government, enslave the 
state, and precipitate the ruin of a nation. But no wise 
statesman will reject the good, from an apprehension of the 
ill. The truth is, in human affairs, there is no good, pure 
and unmixed. Every advantage has two sides ; and wisdom consists in availing ourselves of the good, and guarding, as much as possible, against the bad. 

"The tendency of a national bank is to increase public and 
private credit. The former gives power to the state, for 
the protection of its rights and interests, and the latter facilitates and extends the operations of commerce among in 
dividuals. 

" Industry is increased, commodities are multiplied, agriculture and manufactures flourish, and herein consist the 
true wealth and prosperity of a state. 

" Most commercial nations have found it necessary to institute banks ; and they have proved to be the happiest engines that ever were invented for advancing trade. Venice, 
Genoa, Hamburgh, Holland, and England, are examples of 
their utility. They owe their riches, commerce, and the 
figure they have made at different periods, in a great degree, to this source. Great Britain is indebted for the immense efforts she has been able to make in so many illustrious and successful wars, essentially to that vast fabric of 
credit, raised on this foundation. Tis by this alone, she 
now menaces our independence. She has indeed abused 
the advantage, and now stands on a precipice. Her example should both persuade and warn us. 'Tis in republics, where banks are most easily established and supported, 
and where they are least liable to abuse. Our situation 
will not expose us to frequent wars, and the public will 
have no temptation to overstrain its credit. 

"In my opinion, we ought not to hesitate, because we have 
no other resource. The long and expensive wars of King 
William had drained England of its specie ; its commerce 
began to droop for want of a proper medium ; its taxes 
were unproductive, and its revenues declined. The administration wisely had recourse to the institution of a bank, 
and it retrieved the national difficulties. We are in the 
same, and still greater want, of a sufficient medium. We 
have little specie ; the paper we have is of small value, and 
rapidly declining to less. We are immersed in a war for 
our existence as a nation, for our liberty and happiness as 
a people. We have no revenues, nor no credit. A bank, 
if practicable, is the only thing that can give us either the 



* HAMILTON. 359 

one or the other. Besides these great and cardinal motives to such an institution, and the advantages we should 
enjoy from it in common with other nations, our situation, 
relatively to Europe and to the West Indies, would give us 
some peculiar advantages. 

" Nothing is more common than for men to pass from the 
abuse of a good thing to the disuse of it. Some persons, 
disgusted by the depreciation of the money, are chimerical 
enough to imagine it would be beneficial to abolish all paper, and annihilate the whole of what is now in circulation, 
and depend altogether upon specie, both for commerce and 
finance. The scheme is altogether visionary, and in the attempt would be fatal. We have not a competent stock 
of specie in this country, either to answer the purpose of 
circulation in trade, or to serve as a basis for revenue. 
The whole amount of what we have, I am persuaded, does 
not exceed six millions of dollars, one-fifth of the circulating 
medium before the war. To suppose this would be sufficient for the operations of commerce, would be to suppose 
that our domestic and foreign commerce were both reduced 
four-fifths ; a supposition that carries absurdity on the face 
of it. It follows, that if our paper money were destroyed, 
a great part of the transactions of traffic must be carried on 
by barter ; a mode inconvenient, partial, confined ; destructive both of commerce and industry. With the addition of 
the paper we now have, this evil exists in too great a degree." 

Having shown that if all the specie could be drawn into 
the treasury annually, the consequence of such a measure, 
which never was effected in any country, would be a complete stagnation of business ; and that a recourse to taxes 
in kind, would prove wholly inefficacious, he proceeds to 
observe, 

" The error of those who would explode paper money 
altogether, originates in not making proper distinctions. 
Our paper was, in its nature, liable to depreciation, because 



360 

it had no funds for its support, and was not upheld by private credit. The emissions under the resolution of March, 
1780, have partly the former advantage, but are destitute 
of the latter, which is equally essential. No paper credit 
can be substantial or durable, which has not funds, and 
which does not unite immediately the interest and influence 
of the moneyed men, in its establishment and preservation. 
A credit begun on this basis will, in process of time, greatly 
exceed its funds ; but this requires time, and a well settled 
Opinion in its favour. 'Tis IN A NATIONAL BANK ALONE THAT 

WE CAN FIND THE INGREDIENTS TO CONSTITUTE A WHOLESOME, SOLID, AND BENEFICIAL PAPER CREDIT." 

The length to which these extracts have extended does 
not warrant the publication more at large of this elaborate 
document. A mere outline of the plan, consisting of twenty articles, is all that will now be given. 

The capital of the bank was to consist of a stock of three 
millions of dollars, divided into thirty thousand shares, to 
be exempted from all taxes and impositions. 

The subscription, according to the respective amounts, 
to be in proportionate quantities of specie, personal, and 
landed securities; the object being to secure the largest 
possible amount of specie. The bank to have all legal 
corporate immunities, and the stock to be protected from 
attachment, making each member of the incorporation liable, by suit, to the extent of his stock. 

The privilege of subscribing for one half of the capital 
stock, to be reserved to the United States, to the particular states, or to foreigners, and the .United States to become conjointly responsible with the private proprietors, 
for all the transactions of the bank, which was to be authorized to issue notes, with and without interest, a part only 
payable in America, the residue in Europe. The aggregate 
of the notes not to exceed the amount of the bank stock ; 
with a power to lend at an interest not to exceed eight per 



' V: HAMILTON. 361 

cent., and to borrow to the amount of one half of its stock, 
to purchase estates, by principal or by annuities, to have 
the privilege of coining, to the amount of one half of its 
stock, (the quantity of alloy, &c. to be determined by congress,) and to have, also, the power of discounting foreign 
bills of exchange, to receive deposits of plate or money, 
which deposits were to be exempt from taxation, to have 
the right of contracting with the French government, for 
the supply of its fleets and armies in America, and to contract with congress for the supply of their armies, with 
a condition to lend the United States, on a certain unalienable fund of one hundred and ten thousand four hundred 
pounds per annum, the sum of twelve hundred thousand 
pounds, at an interest of eight per cent., payable in twenty 
years, or sooner, at the option of congress, and a similar 
rate to govern all future loans ; for which fund the United 
States, and the individual states, to be severally pledged. 

The bank to become responsible for the redemption of 
all the paper ; the old, at forty for one, in parts of one third, 
at the end of every ten years, with interest at five per 
cent. ; the new, as specie, in six years, so as to fulfil the 
previous engagements of congress ; for which responsibility, adequate funds, payable to the bank, equal to the discharge of the whole paper currency in thirty years, bearing an interest of two per cent., were to be established. 

The bank notes to be received in payment of all public 
customs and taxes, at an equivalent with gold and silver, 
with power to dissolve itself at pleasure, having made 
effectual provision for the payment of its debts. Its stock 
to be transferable. To be chartered for thirty years, and 
no other bank, public or private, to be permitted during 
that period. Three offices to be established, one in each 
of the states of Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, 
to facilitate the circulation and payment of the bank notes ; 
the whole to be managed by twelve general directors, eight 
to be chosen by the private proprietors, and four by congress ; the minister of finance having the privilege of inspecting all their proceedings. 

A full examination of the principles of the proposed institution would exceed the proper limits of this work, but 
a few desultory observations on some of the features of this 
plan, may not be misplaced. 

The introduction of landed security, as a part of the capital stock, is the provision which, in a merely commercial 
view, might perhaps have been deemed most objectionable. 
But it is to be remembered, that commercial convenience 
was merely an incidental consideration. The primary object was similar to that of the bank of England ; after absorbing the previous issues, to obtain a monopoly of the circulation, and by that means to secure a safe and uniform 
currency. 

But had the sole purpose of Colonel Hamilton been the 
granting facilities to trade, it is by no means obvious that 
his plan would have been less effective. 

It is true, that the country would not furnish an adequate 
amount of specie, or of equivalent available personal securities to fill the stock ; and that for this reason, the deficiency was sought to be supplied by landed security. But 
this landed security, though less readily convertible than 
the government debt of England, which forms the basis of 
its bank, might be pledged for an amount of cash of relative value, and there would still exist the use of the lands, 
and the use of the value of its representative. 

That the landed security was not convertible to meet the 
immediate wants of the bank, would be less objectionable, 
in the minds of those who entertain the opinion, not without 
strong reasons, that the capital of a bank should remain a 
permanent vested fund, upon which to base a credit, not a 
fund to be appropriated to its current uses. 

It is possible that this provision might have diminished 
the number of merely moneyed subscribers ; but as this plan 
was to go into operation, at a time when the prevailing distrust of paper securities would dispose individuals, amidst a 
choice of evils, to prefer an institution which would furnish 
this additional support, to a capital of which the specie component was the most alluring ingredient, this disadvantage 
would have been more than compensated. 

The power of coining money, was introduced merely to 
enable the bank to convert its plate into specie ; but it was 
a power which, under proper checks, might have been extended with advantage. 

The privilege of contracting with the French government, for the supply of its armies, was highly desirable 
from this consideration, that the greater part of the specie 
was derived from the expenditures of France, and passing 
through the bank, would have increased its credit and efficiency, while the great profits to be derived from the contracts, would have offered large inducements to subscribers. 

The article which rendered the bank responsible for the 
redemption of the existing paper, had in view the importance of relieving the country from a fluctuating medium, 
which infected all credit. The amount of the annuity to 
be secured by congress to the bank, was not fixed, from 
the difficulty of estimating the whole amount of the government issues; a difficulty which was increased by this 
circumstance, that this plan proposed to embrace all the 
State emissions, as essential to every efficient scheme of 
finance, a fact of high interest, in reference to the great 
question of the " Assumption," which threatened an insuperable obstacle to the fiscal system of the present government. 

The permission to the bank to dissolve or sell at pleasure, was introduced to encourage men to adventure in it, 



364 THE LIFE OV 

from a confidence, that when once engaged, the profits 
would induce them to continue. 

In reply to the inquiry, where funds are to be procured, 
in the present impotent state of the federal government, 
Colonel Hamilton says, " I answer, there are ample means, 
and they must be had. Congress must deal plainly with 
their constituents ; they must tell them that power without 
revenue, is a bubble ; that unless they give them substantial resources of the latter, they will not have enough of 
the former either to prosecute the war, or to maintain the 
union in peace ; that in short, they must, in justice to the 
public, and to their own honour, renounce the vain attempt of carrying on the war without either, a perseverance in which can only deceive the people, and betray 
their safety. They must demand an instant, positive, and 
perpetual investiture of an impost on trade ; a land tax 
and a poll tax to be collected by their own agents. This 
act to become a part of the confederation. It has ever 
been my opinion, that congress ought to have complete sovereignty in all but the mere municipal law of each state, 
and 1 wish to see a CONVENTION OF ALL THE STATES, with 
full power to alter and amend, finally and irrevocably, the 
present futile and senseless confederation." 
' After stating the plan of the bank, " these," he says, " as 
has already been observed, are only intended as outlines. 
The form of administration for the bank, and all other matters, may be easily determined. If the leading principles 
are once approved, we shall find good models in the different European banks, which we can accommodate to our circumstances. Great care, in particular, should be employed 
to guard against counterfeits ; and, I think, methods may 
be devised that will be effectual. 

" I see nothing to prevent the practicability of a plan of 
this kind, but a distrust of the final success of the war, which 
may make men afraid to risk any considerable part of their 
fortunes in the public funds ; but without being an enthusiast, I will venture to assert, that with such a resource as 
is here proposed, the loss of our independence is impossible. 
All we have to fear is, that the want of money may disband 
the army, or so perplex and enfeeble our operations, as to 
create in the people a general disgust and alarm, which may 
make them clamour for peace on any terms. But if a judicious administration of our finances, assisted by a bank, 
takes place, and the ancient security of property is restored, 
no convulsion is to be apprehended ; our opposition will 
soon assume an aspect of system and vigour, that will relieve and encourage the people, and put an end to the hopes 
of the enemy. 'Tis evident, they have it not in their power to subdue us by force of arms ; in all these states they 
have not more than fifteen thousand effective troops, nor is 
it possible for them much to augment this number. The 
East and West Indies demand reinforcements. In all the 
islands they have not, at this time, above five thousand men ; 
a force not more than equal to the proper garrisoning of 
Jamaica alone, and which, the moment they lose a maritime 
superiority in those seas, will leave them much cause to fear 
for their possessions. They will probably send out fifteen 
hundred or two thousand men to recruit their regiments 
already here, but this is the utmost they can do. 

"Our allies have five thousand men at Rhode-Island, 
which in the worst event that can happen, will be recruited to eight, to co-operate with us on a defensive plan. 
Should our army amount to no more than fifteen thousand 
men, the combined forces, though not equal to the expulsion 
of the enemy, will be equal to the purpose of compelling 
them to renounce their offensive, and content themselves 
with maintaining one or two capital points. This is on the 
supposition, that the public have the means of putting their 
troops in activity. By stopping the progress of their conquests, and reducing them to an unmeaning and disgraceful defensive, we destroy the national expectation of success, from which the ministry draw their resources. They 
are in a situation, where the want of splendid successes is 
ruin. They have carried taxation nearly to its extreme 
boundary ; they have mortgaged all their funds ; they have 
a large unfunded debt, besides the enormous mass which is 
funded. This must necessarily create apprehensions in 
their most sanguine partizans, and if these are not counteracted by flattering events, from time to time, they cannot 
much longer continue the delusion. Indeed, in that case, I 
suppose they must themselves despair. The game we play, 
is a sure game, if we play it with skill. I have calculated, 
in the preceding observations, on the most disadvantageous 
side ; many events may turn up in the course of the summer, 
to make even the present campaign decisive." 

On the twenty-sixth of May, the following reply was received from the Superintendent of Finance. 

ROBERT MORRIS TO COLONEL HAMILTON. 
SIR, 

It is some time since I received your performance, dated 
the thirtieth Apnjl last. I have read it with that attention 
which it greatly deserves, and finding many points of it to 
coincide with my own opinions on the subject, it naturally 
strengthened that confidence which every man ought to 
possess, to a certain degree, in his own judgement. You 
will very soon see the plan of a bank published, and subscriptions opened for its establishment, having already met 
with the approbation of congress. It only remains for individuals to do their part, and a foundation will be laid for 
the anticipation of. taxes and funds, by a paper credit that 
cannot depreciate. The capital proposed, falls far short of 
your idea, and, indeed, far short of what it ought to be ; but 
the capital may afterwards be increased to almost anv 
amount. To propose a larger sum in the outset, and fail 
in the attempt to raise it, might prove fatal ; to begin with 
what is clearly in our power to accomplish, and on that beginning to establish the credit that will inevitably command 
the future increase of capital, seems the most certain road 
to success. I have thought much about interweaving a 
land security with the capital of this bank, but am apprehensive it would convey to the public mind an idea of paper 
being circulated on that credit ; and that the bank, of consequence, must fail in its payments in case of any considerable run on it, and we must expect that its ruin will be 
attempted by external and internal foes. I have, therefore, 
left that point to the future deliberations of the directors of 
this bank, to whom, in due time, I shall communicate your 
address. I esteem myself much your debtor for this piece, 
not merely on account of the personal respect you have 
been pleased to express, but also on account of your good 
intentions ; and for these, and the pains you have taken, I 
not only think, but on all proper occasions shall say, the 
public are also indebted to you. 

My office is new, and I am young in the execution of it. 
Communications from men of genius and abilities will always 
be acceptable, and yours will ever command the attention of 
Sir, your obedient, humble servant, 

ROBT. MORRIS. 

Col. Alex. Hamilton, of the Artillery. 

The plan referred to in the preceding letter was submitted to congress on the seventeenth, adopted on the twentysixth*, and published, with an address from Mr. Morris, on 
the twenty-eighth of May, 1781. 

* The votes on this question, give an important indication of the views of 
congress, at that clay, on this " constructive power." Of the eleven states present, eight, viz. New-Hampshire, Rhode-Island, Connecticut, New-Jersey, 
Maryland, Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia, were in favour. 
Massachusetts was against it, with one vote from Pennsylvania. Of the four 
members from Virginia, James Madison was alone in the negative. 



* 


The capital was four hundred thousand dollars, in shares 
of four hundred dollars each, payable in gold or silver. 
Its notes were made payable on demand, and receivable 
for taxes : a power was given to enlarge the capital : the 
superintendent of finance was authorized to inspect the 
books ; and on the last day of the year, an ordinance passed, incorporating it under the name of the Bank of North 
America. 

Great as was the merit of Mr. Morris in the suggestion 
of this plan, he acquired a still stronger title to applause for 
the skill, energy, and judgement, with which it was carried 
into execution. 

His principal reliance for a supply of coin, was founded 
upon an engagement of the Governor General of Havannah to remit to the United States four hundred thousand 
dollars in specie, to be repaid by annual shipments of flour, 
which were to be guarantied by France, but which engagement was not fulfilled. 

It has been stated that the whole specie capital of this 
bank, when it commenced its operations, did not exceed 
forty thousand dollars ; and such was the apprehension of 
this small resource being exhausted, that persons were employed, during the earlier part of its existence, to follow 
those who had demanded specie and obtain it from them, 
at any price, so as to return it into the coffers of the bank. 

This institution, nevertheless, soon obtained extensive 
confidence ; ministered largely to the wants of government ; 
and after its utility had been fully tested in furnishing a medium of exchange throughout the states, as safe and more 
convenient than the precious metals ; relief in the payment 
of the public burthens ; increased facilities to the internal 
and external commerce of the country ; the state of Pennsylvania, by which it also had been incorporated, under the 
delusion of popular prejudice repealed its charter, on the 
extraordinary ground of the dangerous influence of foreign 
capital on the free institutions of the country ; forgetting, 
that without such capital, that freedom, and those institutions, would probably not have been established : but the 
returning good sense of the state renewed the charter the 
ensuing year. 

O v 

The project for a convention of the states, which Hamilton first proposed in his letter to Mr. Duane, seems not to 
have met with much countenance in congress ; but the exposition which he .had given of the defects of the existing 
government, enforced by the embarrassments with which 
that body found themselves perpetually clogged, rendered 
an enlargement of the powers of the confederation a subject of frequent and anxious deliberation. 

Aware of the impediments which public opinion would 
interpose to the successful attainment of this great object, 
Hamilton commenced, at this time, a series of numbers, 
under the title of " The CONTINENTALIST." 

The earlier essays were published in July and August, 
1781. They were then suspended until after the surrender of York Town, when they were resumed, at intervals, 
and continued during a part of the succeeding year. Many 
of them are lost, but a sufficient number remain to show 
the design of the publication. The first part was devoted to 
an examination of the defects of the existing league, and to 
an exposure of the groundless jealousy of power to which he 
attributed the hostility of the people to an enlargement of the 
authority of the federal government. Several of the essays 
on this branch of the subject, cannot be found. The succeeding 
numbers are occupied with a brief enumeration of the powers with which the government ought to be clothed. Of 
these, the principal were, first, the power of regulating 
trade ;. comprehending a right of granting bounties and 
premiums, by way of .encouragement ; of imposing duties 
of every kind, as well for revenue as regulation ; of appointing all officers of the customs, and of laying embargoes in extraordinary emergencies. Second, a moderate 
land tax, at a specific rate, to be granted to the federal government in perpetuity, and to be levied, (if congress think 
proper,) by their own collectors. Third, a moderate capitation tax. Fourth, the disposal of all unlocated land, for 
the benefit of the United States. Fifth, a certain proportion of the product of all the mines existing in the United 
States ; and sixth, the appointment of all the land and naval officers by congress. 

Much space is allotted, to show the necessity of conferring on the general government specific funds, under their 
exclusive control, as a basis upon which he proposed to 
build up a system of public credit, and the same reasons 
are recapitulated at large, which are contained in the elaborate letter to Mr. Morris ; one consideration is worthy of 
remark, notwithstanding the zeal with which the establishment of permanent funds is advocated, both in this, 
and all his other financial papers, there will be observed 
the most scrupulous care to introduce provisions in every 
scheme of finance, of which he was the author, to operate 
as a check upon the proneness of governments to incur 
debts, and insure their discharge, as fast as might be consistent with public convenience. 

The necessity of conferring the power of regulating 
trade, in its fullest sense, both by bounties and prohibitions, 
is clearly and strongly stated ; and the consequences of conflicting state tariffs, distinctly portrayed. But while this essential attribute of national sovereignty is claimed, a similar discretion is evinced, as to the extent to which this power should 
be exercised. " Easy duties on commerce " are contended 
for, in order to lighten the charges on production ; and 
while the necessity is shown of granting to the federal government adequate funds, the policy of its relying on a compound of permanent and occasional supplies is exhibited. 
" The federal government," he says, " should neither be independent, nor too much dependent. It should neither be 
raised above responsibility or control, nor should it want 
the means of maintaining its own weight, authority, dignity, and credit. To this end, permanent funds are indispensable ; but they ought to be of such a nature, and so 
moderate in their amount, as never to be inconvenient." 

The collection of the national revenues, by officers appointed by congress, is shown to be essential to the success 
of the system, and is urged from the farther consideration, 
that their appointment, and also that of all military officers, 
of every rank, would be the means of creating, in the interior of each state, a mass of influence in favour of the federal government. " The great danger," he says, has been 
shown to be, " that it will not have power enough to defend itself, and preserve the union; not that it will ever become formidable to the general liberty. A mere regard to 
the interests of the confederacy will never be a principle 
sufficiently active to curb the ambition and intrigues of different members. Force cannot effect it. 

"A contest of arms will seldom be between the common 
sovereign and a single refractory member, but between distinct combinations of the several parts against each other; 
a sympathy of situations, will be apt to produce associates 
to the disobedient. The application of force is always disagreeable ; the issue uncertain. It will be wiser to obviate 
the necessity of it, by interesting such a number of individuals in each state in support of the federal government, as 
will be a counterpoise to the ambition of others, and will 
make it difficult for them to unite the people in opposition 
to the just and necessary measures of the union. There is 
something noble and magnificent in the perspective of a 
great FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC, closely linked in the pursuit of 
a common interest, tranquil and prosperous at home, respectable abroad ; there is something proportionably diminutive and contemptible, in the prospect of a number of 
petty states, with the appearance only of union, jarring, 
jealous, and perverse, without any determined direction, 
fluctuating and unhappy at home, weak and insignificant by their dissensions in the eyes of other nations. Happy America, if those to whom thou hast entrusted the 
guardianship of thy infancy, know how to provide for thy 
future repose, but miserable and undone, if their negligence 
or ignorance permits the spirit of discord to erect her banners on the ruins of thy tranquillity 1" 

Such were the sentiments of a man, whose views have 
been so much, and so designedly misrepresented ; whose 
strong solicitude- for the liberties of America, saw in the 
constitutional strength of each department of government, 
the only security against usurpation ; who sought to connect with every grant of power, its appropriate check ; and 
who having advised every precaution for the public safety, 
which the most prudent foresight could suggest, believed 
that a generous confidence on the part of the people, was 
as essential to tliejr happiness, as an honest administration 
by their rulers. 
CHAPTER XIV. 

[1781,] 

THE urgent representations made to congress by the. 
French minister, M. de la Luzerne, of the reluctance of 
the French court to extend their aids beyond what had already been granted, the intimation that the state of Europe might possibly lead France to an arrangement, which, 
as the best terms that could be obtained for the United 
States, would be founded on the principle of uti possidetis, 
and the difficulties which Colonel Laurens had encountered 
in his mission, all concurred to prompt an attempt upon 
New-York, which had been abandoned in the previous autumn, and which the letters of La Fayette show, was now 
in contemplation. General Washington, early in this year, 
(but at what precise time we are unable to state,) proceeded to Newport, for the . purpose of concerting measures 
with General Rochambeau, in which journey, it would appear, from the following note, without date, that .notwithstanding their recent difference, he was attended by Colonel Hamilton, which is also of importance to show, that 
the difference which had taken place, had produced no diminution of respect in the breast of the General. 

DEAR HAMILTON, 

I shall be obliged to you for the answer to the address, 
as soon as it is convenient to you. If we do not ride to 
the Point to see the fleet pass out, J am to have a conference with Count de Rochambeau, and the engineer, directly after breakfast, at which I wish you to be present. 
I am, sincerely and affectionately, yours, 

GEO. WASHINGTON. 

Half.past , A.M.

THE LIFE OP 



This interview having taken place, Washington returned 
to the army, and immediately ordered them from their quarters, with directions to encamp at Peekskill, whence they 
moved down the eastern banks of the Hudson, waiting the 
junction of the French forces, which soon after marched. 

The advance having arrived, on the sixth of July an expedition was pushed forward, under General Lincoln, in 
the hope of surprising the enemy's works at King's Bridge. 
After an unimportant skirmish, the detachment returned to 
the main body, then at Dobbs' Ferry, a position on the Hudson, a little more than twenty miles from New-York, where 
the American army crossed in the disastrous retreat of 1776. 

Hamilton, who had proceeded to Albany, after his return 
from Newport, anxious to take part in the interesting operations which were about to occur, finding his application 
for a command unattended to, determined to bring the question to a definitive issue. The following extract from a letter written to Mrs. Hamilton, gives the course of this affair, 

Camp, near Dobbs' Ferry, July 10th, 1781. 

" The day before yesterday I arrived here, but for want 
of an opportunity could not write any sooner ; indeed, I 
know of none now. Finding, w r hen I came here, that nothing was said on the subject of a command, I wrote the 
General a letter, and enclosed him my commission. This 
morning Tilghman came to me in his name, pressed me to 
retain my commission, with an assurance that he would endeavour, by all means, to give me a command, nearly such 
as I could have desired in the present circumstances of the 
army. Though I know you would be happy to hear I had 
rejected this proposal, it is a pleasure my reputation would 
not permit me to afford you. I consented to retain my 
commission, and accept the command. I quarter, at present, 
by a very polite and warm invitation, with General Lincoln, 
and experience from the officers of both armies every mark 
of esteem." 
It was at this post that Washington first received the intelligence that the squadron of De Grasse was approaching the coast of Virginia. A council of war was held, to 
which Hamilton was invited by General Washington. The 
plan of a southern campaign was then discussed, and though 
reluctant to relinquish the attempt on New-York, so long 
entertained, it was determined, for the most cogent reasons, 
to make a forced march on Lord Cornwallis. 

It became of the utmost importance to conceal this purpose. The idea was thrown out, that the French fleet was 
expected at Shrewsbury, and that the army was to march 
and join it there ; and, to complete the deception, lines for 
an encampment were marked out on the Jersey side, ovens 
constructed, and a body of men advanced, as if to take a 
position for the combined forces. At this particular crisis, 
Washington felt the full value of his exertions in obtaining 
secret intelligence. A communication was constantly kept 
up with New-York, and it was soon ascertained that the 
deception was complete. The extent of the imposition on 
Sir Henry Clinton has always been a subject of surprise, 
but a stratagem which was adopted by Washington, and 
which fully succeeded, will serve to explain it. There was 
an individual in New-Jersey, who at one time held a considerable rank in the militia, and who had been employed 
by Washington to gain intelligence. In this service he had 
proved himself shrewd, observing, and alert ; and the information he had given, at the commencement of his career, had been of much importance. Some time prior to 
this period, General Washington had discovered this man 
to be a traitor, and that, under cover of serving the American cause, he was in fact in the pay of Sir Henry Clinton. 
He determined to take advantage of this discovery, and 
under the pretence of employing him to get farther advices, 
Washington sent for him to head quarters, where he threw 
in his way a map, prepared for the purpose, marked with

the pretended .route of the army to Shrewsbury, and with 
plans of the land and naval attack upon New-York. Anxious to confirm his. impressions by. every possible means, 
this same individual sought an interview with Colonel Hamilton, and under semblance of a zeal for the American interests, inquired of him the destination of the army. Hamilton, confident that a disclosure by him of the actual intentions of the commander-m-chief,. would be the most certaih means of deceiving him, as it could not be supposed 
that he .would communicate such an important and confidential 'secret, at once replied, "we are going to Virginia." 
The spy, thus completely duped, ha'stened with his information to the enemy, and communicated it to Sir Henry Clinton, who was in vain prompted by others to suspect the real 
designs of the Americans, and replied to every importunity, 
that he had information of a kind, and from a source, that 
could not be disputed. 

The intelligence of De Grasse's approach, had been communicated to General Washington by the Superintendent 
of Finance, who immediately on the receipt of it, proceeded 
express to head quarters. The probability of Cornwallis' 
capture, now became strong. But a great obstacle existed : 
it was the utter incapacity of moving the army for want 
of funds. Robert Morris, on this occasion, rendered one of 
those great services to his country, which no other individual could have performed ; he assumed the responsibility of moving the army. Washington, aware of the embarrassed finances, inquired where were his means? He 
replied, that he did not himself know, but that he would find 
them. He immediately returned to Philadelphia, secured 
all the water craft on the Delaware, provided supplies on 
the route of the army, and while Washington was collecting 
a force to protect West Point, raised a large portion of the 
necessary funds on his personal responsibility. 
. Hamilton, in the mean time, had attained his wishes ; and 
on the sixteenth of August, lie writes, " I wrote you by 
the last post, in which I informed you that I had taken command of my corps. Major Fish is with me. I prize him 
both as a friend and an officer." And a few days after, he 
thus announces to his wife his departure for the south : 
" In my last letter, I informed you that there was a greater 
prospect of activity now, than there had been heretofore. 
I did this to prepare your mind for an event which, I am 
sure, will give you pain. I begged your father, at the same 
time, to intimate to you by degrees the probability of its 
taking place. I used this method to prevent a surprise, 
which might be too severe to you. A part of the army, my 
dear girl, is going to Virginia, and I must, of necessity, be 
separated at a much greater distance from my beloved wife. 
I cannot announce the fatal necessity, without feeling every 
thing that a fond husband can feel. I am unhappy ; I 
am unhappy beyond expression. I am unhappy, because I 
am to be so remote from you ; because I am to hear from 
you less frequently than I am accustomed to do. I am 
miserable, because I know you will be so ; I am wretched 
at the idea of flying so far from you, without a single hour's 
interview, to tell you all my pains and all my love. But I 
cannot ask permission to visit you. It might be thought 
improper to leave my corps at such a time, and upon such 
an occasion. I must go without seeing you, I must go 
without embracing you : alas ! I must go. But let no 
idea, other than of the distance we shall be asunder, disquiet 
you. Though I said the prospects of activity will be greater, I said it to give your expectations a different turn, and 
prepare you for something disagreeable. It is ten to one 
that our views will be disappointed, by Cornwallis retiring 
to South Carolina by land. At all events, our operations 
will be over by the latter end of October, and I will fly to 
my home. Don't mention I am going to Virginia." 

The allied armies moved on the twenty-second of August,

and having taken a circuitous route to keep up the deception, reached Philadelphia on the second of September, 
Generals Washington and Rochambeau then proceeded to 
an interview with De Grasse ; and General Lincoln, commanding the Americans, and Baron De Viomenil the French, 
moved OB to the head of Elk, which they reached on the sixth 
of September, From this place, Hamilton again writes, 
" Yesterday, my lovely wife, I wrote to you enclosing you 
a letter in one to your father, to the care of Mr. Morris. 
To-morrow the post sets out, and to-morrow we embark 
for York Town. I cannot refuse myself the pleasure of 
writing you a few lines. Constantly uppermost in my 
thoughts and affections, I am happy only when my moments 
are devoted to some office that respects you. I would give 
the world to be able to tell you all I feel, and all I wish, but 
consult your own heart, and you will know mine. What 
a world will soon be between us ! To support the idea, all 
my fortitude is insufficient. What must be the case with 
you, who have the most female of female hearts ? I sink 
at the perspective of your distress, and I look to heaven to 
be your guardian and supporter. Circumstances which 
have just come to my knowledge, assure me that our operations will be expeditious, as well as our success certain. 
Early in November, as I promised you, we shall certainly 
meet. Cheer yourself with this idea, and \vith the assurance of never more being separated. Every day confirms 
me in the intention of renouncing public life, and devoting 
myself wholly to you. Let others waste their time and their 
tranquillity in a vain pursuit of power and glory ; be it 
my object to be happy in a quiet retreat, with my better 
angel." Again he writes from Annapolis, " How chequered is human life ? how precarious is happiness ? 
how easily do we often part with it for a shadow ? These 
are the reflections that frequently intrude themselves upon 
me, with a painful application. I am going to do my duty. 
Our operations will be so conducted, as to economize the 
lives of men. Exert your fortitude, and rely upon heaven." 

These repeated expressions of attachment, are but the 
gentler declarations of the strong feelings which animated 
his breast, always full of tenderness to every object of his 
regard. It is apparent from his -correspondence at this 
time, that he entertained a fixed purpose, should the opportunity offer, of establishing his military character on still 
higher ground, and winning a meed of fame, connected 
with the last great event in his country's early glory, and 
that he foresaw, with a deep foreboding of danger, the 
high enterprise to which his ambition pledged him. 

The transports which had been furnished by Barras, in 
the absence of De Grasse, reached the harbour between 
James Town and Williamsburg, on the twenty-second of 
September, with the advance of the Americans, where 
they disembarked, the residue soon following. The whole 
body moved forward, and on the twenty-eighth arrived 
within two miles of the enemy's works at York Town; 
Hamilton commanding a corps of light infantry, which was 
attached to the division of La Fayette, who had joined with 
the remains of the little army of Virginia. 

The selection of this position by Lord Cornwallis, under 
the circumstances in which he was placed, can by no means 
be regarded as exhibiting a want of military skill. Had 
the British General pursued his own wishes, he would have 
returned to the command of the army in South Carolina; 
but this would have been a violation of his orders from Sir 
Henry Clinton, who, apprehensive for his own safety, had 
directed a portion of the forces in Virginia to return to NewYork. It had, also, been a favourite object with the British ministry, to establish a permanent and central post, 
whence their naval enterprises could be more successfully 
conducted. Portsmouth, at first, attracted the attention of 
the British General, but was found wholly unsuited to his 
purpose. He next had in view the establishment of his 
army at Point Comfort, but greater objections existed to 
it, and York Town remained the only choice. 

This small village, lying on the south side of the noble 
stream whence it derives its name, is situated on the beautiful peninsula, formed by the York and the James, in their 
approach to the Chesapeake. 

Gloucester, which is on the north and opposite side of 
the York, projects so far into the river, that the distance 
between the headlands little exceeds a mile. 

Here Cornwallis, intercepted in his retreat to the interior by La Fayette, who after a series of masterly movements, had completely kept him at bay, deterred, also, 
by the violent heats of the season, and cut off by De Grasse 
from all hopes of succour by sea, had concentrated his 
army, to the number of seven thousand men. 

On the west and northwest, his post was protected by an 
inlet from the river, a morass, and a deep ravine. On the 
high banks of the river to the north, batteries were erected, which co-operating with those on the Gloucester side, 
controlled the river pass, which was narrowed by vessels 
sunk in the channel, and was also commanded by several 
ships of war stationed in the offing. The south and southwest, the most accessible points, were covered by an extensive line of field fortifications, which his army were engaged in throwing up, when the Americans landed. 

On their approach, a show of opposition was made on 
their left, but a few pieces being advanced by Viomenil, 
the enemy receded. On the twenty-ninth of September, 
the Americans took their ground in front and on the left of 
their works, and kept up a light and scattering fusilade. 
The enemy, apprehensive they would get between their 
outworks and the town, evacuated the greater part of them 
on the following day, and they were occupied by the American light infantry, supported by their allies. During the 
ensuing days, the besiegers were engaged in throwing up 
redoubts, which was effected with great intrepidity, under 
a heavy cannonade. 

On the sixth of October, the army moved forward, and 
opened their first parallel, within six hundred yards of the 
enemy, under cover by day light. Hamilton now moved 
his corps of light infantry into the works, and planted their 
standards on the top of the line of the parallel. On the 
ninth and tenth, six heavy batteries, three French and three 
American, opened a heavy fire on the British, which dismounted some of their guns, injured their embrasures, and 
compelled them to shelter their cannon behind the merlons. 
This was followed by an almost entire suspension of the 
fire, and the loss of their heaviest vessel, the Charon, a 
forty-four gun frigate, by a hot shot from the French battery, which burnt to the water's edge, presenting, in a serene 
night, a magnificent and melancholy spectacle. 

On the evening of the eleventh, the second parallel was 
opened by Steuben's division, which was carried on within 
three hundred and sixty yards of the enemy's batteries, 
with amazing rapidity during the night ; while their shot 
and shells kept up a continual and dazzling blaze, and was 
completed on the succeeding day. 

It now became necessary to obtain possession of two detached redoubts, which were advanced on the left of the 
enemy, within three hundred yards in their front, which 
enfiladed the whole line of the American entrenchments, 
and were supposed to command the communication between York and Gloucester. The heavy and incessant fire 
which had been poured in upon them, it was bejieved, had 
rendered them practicable, and it was determined to carry 
them by assault. The work on the extreme left to be 
forced by the American light infantry, comprising a part of 
La Fayette's division ; that on the right, by a detachment of 



THE LIFE OF 

French grenadiers and chasseurs, commanded by De Viomenil. 

This was the opportunity for which Hamilton had so 
long, so eagerly hoped, of signalizing himself by some act 
of distinguished prowess. But he was on the point of 
losing it. The fourteenth of October was his tour of duty, 
but from a supposed precedence due to that part of the 
light infantry which had made the Virginian campaign, 
Washington had determined to give the attack to Colonel 
Barber. 

The moment Hamilton learned this arrangement, he left 
Major Fish, proceeded immediately to the General's quarters and remonstrated with him, claiming the right of the 
attack, as the officer on duty. His appeal was successful, 
and Hamilton returned in the highest spirits, exclaiming to 
Fish, " We have it ! we have it !" The disposition was then 
made to advance in two columns. The right composed of 
Gimat's battalion, and Hamilton's, under Major Fish. The 
left, under Laurens, with a small body of picked men, who 
was directed to take them in reverse. 

The redoubt, on the right, was to be attacked by a body 
of grenadiers, under Count Deux Fonts and Colonel 
L'Estrade, supported by the regiment of Gatinois : a disposition intended to prevent any jealousy between the armies, and to excite their emulation. 

The signal of attack was a shell from the American battery, with a corresponding one from the French. 

As soon as the first shell reached its zenith, that from the 
French battery also ascended. Hamilton then gave the 
order to advance at the point of the bayonet, pushed forward, 
and before the rest of the corps had ascended the abatis, 
mounted over it, stood for a moment on the parapet, with 
three of his soldiers, encouraging the others to follow, and 
sprung into the ditch. Fish followed. Gimat, receiving a 
wound from the first sentinel as they were unmasking, was 
compelled to retire. The American infantry, animated by 
the address and example of their leader, pressed on, with 
muskets unloaded and fixed bayonets. They soon reached 
the counterscarp, under a heavy and constant fire from the 
redoubt, and surmounting the abatis, ditch, and palisades, 
mounted the parapet, and leaped into the work. 

Hamilton, who had pressed forward, followed by the 
van guard under Mansfield, was, for a short time, lost sight 
of, and it was feared he had fallen : but he soon re-appeared, formed the troops in the redoubt, and as soon as it surrendered gave the command to Major Fish. 

The impetuosity of the attack carried all before it, and 
within nine minutes from the time the abatis was passed, 
the work was gained. " Not a gun," says La Fayette, " was 
fired. The ardour of the troops did not give time for the 
sappers to derange the abatis ; and owing to the conduct 
of the commander, and bravery of the men, the redoubt 
was stormed with uncommon rapidity."* " Few cases," 
says Washington, " have exhibited greater proofs of intrepidity, coolness, and firmness, than were shown on this occasion." 

Colonel Barber's battalion, the first in the supporting column/'arrived at the moment the advance were getting over 
the works, and executed their orders with the utmost alacrity, (the Colonel being slightly wounded,) while the rest 
of the division, under Muhlenburg and Hagen, advanced 
with admirable firmness, and formed their columns with 
perfect silence and order, under the fire of the enemy. 

The gallantry of the storm was not less distinguished 
than the humanity of the victors. In the midst of the 
works, as soon as Hamilton saw the enemy driven back, 



* " Colonel Hamilton, whose well-known talents and gallantry were most 
conspicuous. Our obligations to him, to Colonel Gimat, and Colonel Laurens, and to each and all the officers and men, are beyond expression." 



384 THE 1,1 1 i; OF 

he ordered his men to halt, and excepting in the charge at 
the onset, not a man was injured. An incident occurred 
as soon as they entered the redoubt, to which Hamilton refers in his report. " Incapable of imitating examples of 
barbarity, and forgetting recent provocations, the soldiery 
spared every man who ceased to fight." . 

Colonel Scammel, of the light infantry, while reconnoitering, a few days before, was surprised by a party of 
horse, and after he was taken was wantonly wounded, of 
which wound he died. When Colonel Campbell, who 
commanded the redoubt, advanced to surrender, a captain* 
who had served under Scammel, seized a bayonet, and 
drew back with the intent of plunging it into his breast, 
when Hamilton turned it aside, and Campbell; exclaiming, 
" I place myself under your protection," was made prisoner 
by Laurens.* 

* Doctor Gordon, whose statements are often erroneous, says, in speaking of this affair, " The light infantry of the Americans were command ed by Marquis La Fayette, and the service was allotted to a select corps. 
The Marquis said to General Washington, ' The troops should retaliate on 
the British for the cruelties they have practised.' The General answered, 
1 You have full command, and may. order as you please.' The Marquis ordered the party to remember New-London, and to retaliate by putting the 
men in the redoubt to the sword, after having carried it. ********* 
Lieutenant Colonel Laurens personally took the commanding officer. ' The 
Colonel's humanity and that of the Americans, so overcame their resentments 
that they spared the British. When bringing them off, as prisoners, they said 
among themselves, 'Why, how is this? We were ordered] to put them to 
death.' Being asked by others why they had not done it, they answered, ' We 
could not, when they begged so hard upon their knees for their lives.'" To 
this shameful fabrication, the attention of Colonel Hamilton was drawn. It is 
thus refuted : 

To the Editor of the Evening Post. 

New- York, August 10, 1802. 

SIR, 

Finding that a story, long since propagated, under circumstances wliich it 
was expected would soon consign it to oblivion, (and by which I have been 
The redoubt on the right was also taken, but with less 
celerity, the Americans having the work in their possession, and being regularly formed, while their allies were 
yet engaged in removing the abatis. 

The fate of the enemy was now decided. The second 
parallel was continued during the night, the two redoubts 
enveloped, and a line of communication opened with the 
first before break of day. As a last effort, a sortie was 
made, towards day-light of the sixteenth, which proved unsuccessful. 

Cornwallis, who knew the weakness of his defences, 
and had pla*. ^d his only hopes on succour from New- York, 
resolved to make a uv^peyate attempt to cross to Gloucester, intending to escape by land to New- York. Boats were 
prepared, and a part of the troops embarked;, when a violent storm arose, which drove the boats down the rivei, r^ 
prevented the completion of his bold design. New batteries 
were now finished by the Americans; the whole works 
were mounted, and a heavy and irresistible cannonade encomplimented at the expense of Generals Washington and La Fayette,) hag 
of late been revived, and has acquired a degree of importance by being repeated in different publications, as well in Europe as America, it becomes a duty to 
counteract its currency and influence by an explicit disavowal. 

The story imports in substance, that General La Fayette, with the approbation or connivance of General Washington, ordered me, as the officer who 
was to command the attack on a British redoubt, in the course of the siege of 
York Town, to put to death all those of the enemy who should happen to be 
taken in the redoubt, and that through motives of humanity I forbore to execute 
the order. 

Positively and unequivocally I declare, that no such nor similar order, nor 
any intimation nor hint resembling it, was ever by me received, or understood 
to have been given. 

It is needless to enter into an explanation of some occurrences on the occasion alluded to, which may be conjectured to have given rise to the calumny. 
It is enough to say, that they were entirely disconnected with any act of either 
of the Generals who have been accused. 

With esteem I am, sir, your most obedient servant, 

A. HAMILTON. sued. On the morning of the seventeenth, while the light 
infantry were in the trenches, the chamade was beat, and 
propositions for surrender made. It is related by Colonel 
Fish, that when the sealed packet addressed to Washington, which was delivered to La Fayette, came in, the General was riding along the line. He had passed Hamilton, 
and as soon as he had read the despatch, sent for him, and 
asked his opinion as to the terms. After a short time, a 
suspension of hostilities was agreed to, and the enemy capitulated ; Laurens, at the surrender, representing the American army, both as an honour due to his distinguished merits, and to remind the British king, that h^, Whose father 
was a prisoner in the Tower, held iirnis hands the fate of 
the commander of his privies'.* 

Congratulations n w poured in upon Washington, and 
Xjjxm his allies, from every quarter of the country ; the public bodies vicing with each other, in an emulation of gratitude. A vote of thanks was rapturously passed by congress, a marble column was ordered to be erected at York 
Town, in commemoration of the event, and special honours 
were conferred on both commanders. 

While receiving the warmest expressions of admiration 
from the whole army, Hamilton, thus modestly, in a letter 
written to soothe the anxiety of his wife, adverts to what 
had passed. " Two nights ago,f my Eliza, my duty and my 
honour obliged me to take a step in which your happiness 
was too much risked. I commanded an attack upon one 
of the enemy's redoubts ; we carried it in an instant, and 
with little loss. You will see the particulars in the Philadelphia papers. There will be, certainly, nothing more of 
this kind ; all the rest will be by approach ; and if there 
should be another occasion, it will not fall to my turn to 
execute it." 

* Cornwallis was, it is believed, at this time Constable of the Tower, 
f October 16th. 
Washington, anxious to push his advantages, solicited 
De Grasse to co-operate in the relief of Wilmington and 
Charleston. The former object was at first assented to ; 
but the French admiral conceiving it his duty to return to 
the West Indies, changed his views. The plan was abandoned, and after having completed the arrangements for 
the disposal of the captured army, while the French remained in Virginia, the Americans returned to the north, 
and were cantoned, in the latter part of November, in 
New-Jersey and in New- York. 

Washington, having concerted measures for the next 
campaign in a personal interview with congress, revisited 
Mount Vernon, loaded with laurels, and crowned with glory, while Hamilton returned on furlough to his home. 

Gratifying as had been the result of this campaign, which 
sealed the national independence, and proud as were his 
reflections in reviewing the long series of services he had 
rendered his country, and in being connected so conspicuously with an event which may be regarded as the closing 
scene of the revolution, yet those reflections were not unmingled with others of a deeply painful character. Though, 
with every uncorrupted mind, he deplored the miseries of 
war,* yet long service had confirmed in his bosom a fondness for military life. As an eloquent friend has well remarked, " his early education was in the camp ; there his 
earliest and most cordial friendships were formed ; there 
he became enamoured of glory, and was admitted to her 

* Iu a letter to a friend, written after the close of the campaign of 1776, ha 
observes : " Your sentiments respecting war are perfectly just I don't wonder 
at your antipathy to it. Every fine feeling of a delicate mind revolts from the 
idea of shedding human blood, and multiplying the common evils of life by 
the artificial methods incident to that state. Were it not for the evident necessity, and in defence of all that is valuable in society, I could never be reconciled to a military character, and shall rejoice when the restoration of 
peace, on the basis of freedom and independence, shall put it in my power to 
renounce it" 



388 THE HFE OF 

embrace."* This life was now soon to end, and those 
friendships, so warmly cherished, could be cultivated only 
at intervals. 

Knowing also that the army was not a favourite of congress, he could not but survey, for the last time, with pain, 
the war-worn faces of those faithful men, who, while winning the liberties of their country, had won for her such imperishable renown, requited, as he felt they were to be, by 
the grossest ingratitude. 

Of his immediate companions in the family of Washington, with two he had already parted. Early in the year, 
Meade, who had recently married, retired from the service, 
and except by his gallantry in rushing to the aid of Steuben, 
and repulsing the advances of Arnold from his native state, 
was no longer known as a public man. 

The " Old Secretary," Harrison, as he was familiarly called, left the army the previous spring, having been appointed, by the state of Maryland, Chief Justice of its Supreme 
Court ; which situation he filled until the adoption of the 
Federal Constitution, when such was Washington's estimate 
of the claims of this meritorious individual upon his country, 
that he nominated him a Judge of the Supreme Court of 
the United States, immediately after its organization, which 
he declined.f 

* Fisher Ames. 

t The following letter, written by Colonel Harrison to Hamilton, as a vindication of his motives for leaving the army, may not be deemed inappropriate, 
as an act of justice to an early friend. 

"New-Windsor, , 1781. 

"I came here, my dear Hamilton, on Friday night to bid adieu to the General, to you, and to my other friends as a military man, and regretted much that 
I had not the happiness of seeing you. To-morrow I am obliged to depart, 
and it is possible our separation may be forever. But be this as it may, it can 
only be with respect to our persons, for as to affection, mine for you will continue to my latest breath. This event will probably surprise you, but from 
your knowledge of me, I rely you will conclude at the instant, that no light 
Tilghman, McIIenry, and Laurens remained in the service. 

The first, whose social virtues were only equalled by his 
military daring, continued with the com mander-in-chief until his resignation, from whom he received the warmest acknowledgements of gratitude. He then established himself 
in Baltimore, where he died in seventeen hundred and eighty-six. 

McHenry, whom Hamilton described " as sensible, judicious, well informed, of an intrepidity never questioned, and 
of a temper, which though firm in the support of principles, 
was full of moderation and amenity," returned to Maryland, 
where he exercised a salutary influence in the councils of 
that state, filled a seat in congress a short time, and closed 
his public life as Secretary at War. 

But the individual who held the first place in Hamilton's 

considerations would have taken me from the army ; and, I think, I might 
safely have rested the matter here. However, as the friendship between us, 
gives you a claim to something more, and as I am not indifferent about character, and shall be anxious to have the esteem of all who are good and virtuously great, I shall detail to you, my friend, the more substantial reasons which 
have led to my present conduct. I go from the army, then, because I have 
found, on examination, that my little fortune, earned by an honest and hard 
industry, was becoming embarrassed ; to attend to the education of my children ; to provide, if possible, for the payment of a considerable sum of money, 
with which I stand charged in the partition of my father's estate ; to save a 
house which I had begun, and without instant attention would be ruined ; and 
because the state of Maryland, in a flattering manner, have been pleased to 
appoint me to a place, very respectable in its. nature, corresponding with my 
former, and interesting to my whole future life and support : they have appointed me to the chair of the Supreme Court. These, my friend, are the motives to my present resolution. My own feelings are satisfied on the occasion, 
though I cannot but regret parting with the most valuable acquaintances I 
have, and I hope they will justify me most fully to you, my Hamilton, espepecially when you consider the time I have been in the service, and the compensation I have received * * *. Adieu. 

" Yours, in haste, most affectionately, 

"R.OBT. H. HARRISON-." 
affections was Laurens,with whom he now parted, not again 
to meet. 

This heroic soldier joined the army in the beginning of 
seventeen hundred and seventy-seven ; distinguished himself at Brandywine, and at Germantown only retired after 
an impetuous, though unadvised attempt upon Chew's house, 
from which Hamilton endeavoured to dissuade him, after 
having received a severe wound, and having left two-thirds 
of his men upon the field. 

At Monmouth, where every member of Washington's staff 
contended not only for their country, but for the honour of 
their chief, he was conspicuous in leading the soldiers to the 
charge, and rallying them on the retreat. At Rhode-Island, 
he commanded a regiment of infantry, and received the especial thanks of Sullivan for his order and gallantry. 

He was incessantly employed in various operations while 
at the south. At the siege of Savannah, he gave a singular 
instance of his high-wrought feelings. After the defeat, he 
stood lost in abstraction, with his arms wide extended, in 
the midst of a heavy fire, and replied to a remonstrance on 
his rashness, " My honour does not permit me to survive the 
disgrace of this day ;" and was only recalled to his duty, by 
a peremptory order to cover the retreat. At Charleston, 
he sallied from the town, and frequently repulsed the besiegers, and was again wounded. Having twice received 
the thanks of congress, he returned, after the surrender at 
York Town, to Carolina, where hearing of the approach of 
a party of the enemy, he arose from his sick bed, threw 
himself at the head of his corps, and fell in a trifling skirmish near the banks of the Combahee. A short time before 
his death, he writes to Hamilton, complaining " that the enemy's system was perfectly defensive, and rendered the campaign insipid. Many of our sanguine citizens have flattered themselves with the idea of a prompt evacuation of 
Charleston. I wish the garrison would either withdraw or 
fight us. Adieu, my dear friend. While circumstances 
place so great a distance between us, I entreat you not to 
withdraw the consolation of your letters. You know the 
unalterable sentiments of your affectionate Laurens." 

Of all the youthful soldiers of the revolution, there is not 
one upon whose story the recollections of his contemporaries 
have more fondly dwelt. His distinguished place in the 
affections of Washington, and the repeated public honours 
proffered to him by congress, his numerous and varied services, his address in negotiation, his gallantry in battle, his 
exalted zeal, and his lofty spirit, elevated him so far above 
his fellow-soldiers, that at his name every youthful aspiration of ambition was kindled. 

But Laurens was not alone a gallant soldier, a distinguished patriot, a skilful diplomatist. To these he added all the 
endearing and social affections, all the attractions of a noble 
nature, all the graces of a refined and cultivated intellect, 
and an address which possessed an irresistable, an endless 
charm. 

Qualities which in other men might have offended by 
their contrast, in him only served to give richness of character, and create variety of interest. His intrepid spirit 
was coupled with a self-distrust, a confiding weakness of 
temper, which awakened in his friends surprise and love. 
While to others his heart was all kindness and benevolence, 
he was unjust only to himself; and while the world saw 
him graced with every virtue, he was still aspiring to some 
higher excellence, an ideal perfection, which is denied to 
our nature, and exists only in the warm conceptions of a 
mind deeply tinged with romance. Nothing can more fully 
express this inward struggle for superior excellence, than 
his letter to Hamilton, and the latter's elegant rebuke, that 
" he refined on the refinements of sensibility." 

With a bosom not less alive to the most generous emotions, but with a mind of a firmer texture, Hamilton reproved, in the noble spirit of his friend, an excess of that delicacy which he himself cherished. 

In the intercourse of these martial youths, there was a 
deep fondness of friendship, which approached the tenderness of feminine attachment. On the annunciation of his 
sad fate, Hamilton writes to La Fayette, " Poor Laurens ! 
he has fallen a sacrifice to his ardour, in a 1 rifling skirmish 
in South Carolina. You know how truly I loved him, and 
will judge how much I regret him." 

This simple tribute of affection, conveyed a deeper meaning than is expressed ; for while his country deplored the 
untimely fate of this their favourite youth, cut off in the career of honour, his friend knew the deep wound he had received at an early period of his life, and that there was that 
upon his memory which made the latest moment the most 
desired of his existence. 


CHATTER XV. 

[1732.J 

,-2
AT the close of the year, Hamilton, as has been previously 
mentioned, returned to Albany. 

There, amidst a circle of friends, to whom his social virtues more endeared him than the lustre of his reputation, 
he, whose lot from infancy had been cast among strangers, 
enjoyed all the happiness of finding in General Schuyler 
and his family a second parent, and new relatives. 

In this hospitable abode he remained until the ensuing 
spring, mingling cheerfully with the small society of a place, 
where a simplicity of manners then prevailed, almost patriarchal; and strengthening the intimacy he had already 
formed with Schuyler, who saw, with pride, the developement of the powers of his mind, and with whom his life 
was a continued scene of uninterrupted regard, harmony, 
and confidence, j 

Although no definitive opinion could be formed in the 
course of the winter, as to the conclusion of a treaty, and 
the measures of congress, prompted by the zealous exhortations of General Washington, indicated a determination 
to prepare for a vigorous prosecution of the war, which the 
proceedings of the English parliament, at the beginning of 
its session evinced no disposition to discontinue, yet the 
advices received by Colonel Hamilton from the Marquis 
De La Fayette, who was in close conference with the American negotiators, and lending all his influence to promote 
their views, and from the Viscount De Noailles, of the temper of the continental powers, with the situation of the British army in the northern states, gave little reason to expect an active campaign in that quarter. 

VOL. i. 50 . 
The birth of a son imposed on him new obligations; and, 
influenced by these considerations, he determined to prepare himself for the duties of private life. He selected the 
profession of the law, a pursuit which was justly deemed 
the most honourable in the country, and in which had been 
formed the largest number of its most conspicuous characters. 

On the first intimation of this purpose, his friends, unwilling to lose his services to the public, strongly urged 
him to defer his purpose. The idea of his being appointed 
a commissioner to conclude a peace, w r as suggested to him, 
and the slow advances of the legal profession, in an impoverished and inactive community were depicted, to deter him 
from making what was then deemed a sacrifice. 

But his ideas of personal independence, induced him to 
decline the most generous offers of aid from Schuyler, and 
to the dark professional prospects which were held up, he 
replied, with a modest, but confident expression of his reliance on the certainties of perseverance, f 

With these views, he proceeded to Philadelphia, and, although his sole resources were in himself, addressed the following letters to General Washington, strongly illustrative 
of the pride and disinterestedness of his character. 

HAMILTON TO WASHINGTON. 
SIR, 

I need not observe to your excellency, that respect for 
the opinion of congress will not permit me to be indifferent 
to the impressions they may receive of my conduct. On 
this principle, though I do not think the subject of the enclosed letter of sufficient importance to request an official 
communication of it, yet I should be happy it might in some 
way be known to the members of that honourable body. 
Should they hereafter learn, that though retained on the 
list of their officers, I am not in the execution of the duties 
of my station, I wish them to be sensible, that it is not a diminished zeal which induces me voluntarily to withdraw 
my services, but that I only refrain from intruding them, 
when circumstances seem to have made them either not necessary, or not desired ; and that I shall not receive emoluments, without performing the conditions to which they 
were annexed. I also wish them to be apprized, upon 
what footing my future continuance in the army is placed, 
that they may judge how far it is expedient to permit it. I 
therefore take the liberty to request the favour of your excellency to impart the knowledge of my situation, in such 
manner as you think most convenient. 
I have the honour to be, 

With perfect respect, 
Your excellency's 

Most obedient and humble servant. 

HAMILTON TO WASHINGTON. 
SIR, 

Your excellency will, I am persuaded, readily admit the 
force of this sentiment, that though it is the duty of a good 
citizen to devote his services to the public, when it has occasion for them, he cannot, with propriety or delicacy to 
himself, obtrude them, when it either has, or appears to 
have, none. 

The difficulties I experienced last campaign in obtaining 
a command, will not suffer me to make any farther application on that head. 

As I have many reasons to consider my being employed 
hereafter in a precarious light, the bare possibility of rendering an equivalent, will not justify to my scruples, the receiving any future emoluments from my commission. I therefore renounce, from this time, all claim to the compensations 
attached to my military station during the war, or after it. 
But I have motives which will not permit me to resolve on 



396 THE MFE OF 

a total resignation. I sincerely hope a prosperous train of 
affairs may continue to make rt no inconvenience to decline 
the services of persons, whose zeal in worse times was found 
not altogether useless ; but as the most promising appearances are often reversed by unforeseen disasters, and as unfortunate events may again make the same zeal of some 
value, I am unwilling to put it out of my power to renew 
my exertions in the common cause, in the line in which I 
have hitherto acted. 

I shall, accordingly, retain my rank, while I am permitted to do it ; and take this opportunity to declare, that I shall 
be at all times ready to obey the call of the public, in any 
capacity, civil or military, (consistent with what I owe to 
myself,) in which there may be a prospect of my contributing to the final attainment of the object for which I embarked in the service. I have the honour to be, 
Very respectfully, 

Your excellency's 

Most obedient servant, 

A. HAMILTON. 

Philadelphia, March 1, 1782. 

While at Philadelphia, he received a letter relating to the 
same subject, from his friend Colonel Meade, to which the 
following is a reply. 



Philadelphia, March, 178?. 

An half hour since brought me the pleasure of your letter of December last. It went to Albany and came from 
thence to this place. I heartily felicitate you on the birth 
of your daughter. I can well conceive your happiness upon 
that occasion, by that which I feel on a similar one. 

Indeed, the sensations of a tender father of the child of a 
beloved mother, can only be conceived by those who have 
experienced them. 

Your heart, my Meade, is peculiarly formed for enjoyments of this kind. You have every right to be a happy 
husband, a happy father. You have every prospect of being so. I hope your felicity may never be interrupted. 

You cannot imagine how entirely domestic I am growing. I lose all taste for the pursuits of ambition. I sigh 
for nothing but the company of my wife and my baby. The 
ties of duty alone, or imagined duty, keep me from renouncing public life altogether. It is, however, probable, I may 
not be any longer actively engaged in it. 

I have explained to you the difficulties which I met with 
in obtaining a command last campaign. I thought it incompatible with the delicacy due* to myself to make any 
application this campaign. I have expressed this sentiment in a letter to the General, and, retaining my rank only, 
have relinquished the emoluments of my commission, declaring myself, notwithstanding, ready at all times to obey 
the calls of the public. I do not expect to hear any of 
these, unless the state of our affairs should change for the 
worse, and lest, by any unforeseen accident that should 
happen, I choose to keep myself in a situation again to contribute my aid. This prevents a total resignation. 

You were right in supposing I neglected to prepare what 
I promised you. at Philadelphia. The truth is, I was in 
such a hurry to get home, that I could think of nothing else. 
As I set out to-morrow morning for Albany, I cannot, 
from this place, send you the matter you wish. 

Imagine, my dear Meade, what pleasure it must give 
Eliza and myself to know that Mrs. Meade interests herself 
in us. Without a personal acquaintance, we have been 
long attached to her. My visit at Mr. Fitzhugh's confirmed 
my partiality. Betsey is so fond of your family, that she 
proposes to form a match between her boy and your girl, 
provided you will engage to make the latter as amiable as 
her mother. 

Truly, my dear Meade, I often regret that fortune has 
cast our residence at such a distance from each other. It 
would be a serious addition to my happiness if we lived 
where I could see you every day ; but fate has determined 
it otherwise. I am a little hurried, and can only request, 
in addition, that you will present me most affectionately to 
Mrs. Meade, and believe me to be, with the warmest and 
most unalterable friendship, 

Yours, 

A. HAMILTON. 

Having completed his business at Philadelphia, he returned to Albany ; took a house in the vicinity of General Schuyler, to which he invited, as an inmate, his friend Colonel 
Troup, who had previously studied the law, and with his 
aid commenced to prepare himself for the practice of it. 

To this dull pursuit, so foreign to all his previous habits, 
such was his control of the powers of his intellect, that he 
devoted himself with the most unremitting labour. His 
retentive memory was tasked to its utmost. His habit 
was to read while walking to and fro, and so incessant were 
his labours, that his intimates would smile at the idea, that 
while prosecuting this study, with the same diligence, he 
might almost have inarched from one end to the other of 
the confederacy. At the ensuing July term of the supreme 
court, he obtained a licence to practise. 

Such was the knowledge he acquired during this short 
period of four months, " that he composed a Manual on the 
Practice of the Law," which, says Troup, " served as an 
instructive grammar to future students, and became the 
ground-work of subsequent enlarged practical treatises."* 

* There are gentlemen, now living, who copied this manual as their guide. 
In the preceding autumn congress had recommended to 
the several states to levy a separate tax for continental requisitions, and had invested the Superintendent of Finance 
with the power of appointing an officer in each state to receive these taxes ; an idea not improbably suggested by 
Hamilton's letter of September, 1780, intimating the importance of appointing in each state a " continental superintendent." While engaged in the prosecution of his legal 
studies, he received the following letter from Robert Morris. 

ROBERT MORRIS TO HAMILTON. 

Office of Finance, Philadelphia, May 2d, 1782. 
" SIR, 

" Mr. Charles Stuart, late commissary general of issues, 
has informed me that you are disposed to quit the military 
line, for the purpose of entering into civil life. He, at the 
same time, induced me to believe that you would accept the 
office of receiver of the continental taxes in the state of NewYork. The intention of this letter is to offer you that appointment. The duties of the office will appear, in a great 
degree, from the publications made by me on this subject. 
In addition, it will be necessary that you correspond with 
me frequently, and give accurate accounts of whatever 
may be passing in your state, which it may be necessary 
for this office to be acquainted with. For the trouble of 
executing it, I shall allow a fourth per cent, on the monies 
you receive. The amount of the quota called for from 
New-York for the current year is, as you know, three hundred and seventy-three thousand five hundred and ninetyeight dollars. 

" I make no professions of my confidence and esteem, because I hope none are necessary ; but if they are, my wish 
that you would accept the offer I make, is the strongest 
evidence I can give of them." 

Hamilton made the following reply. " I had this day the 
honour of receiving your letter of the second instant, and 
am much obliged by the mark of your confidence which it 
contains, and to Colonel Stuart for his friendly intentions 
upon the occasion. 

" My military situation has indeed become so negative, 
that I have no motives to continue in it, and if my services 
could be of importance to .the public in any civil line, I 
should cheerfully obey its command. But the plan which 
I have marked out for myself is the profession of the law, 
and I am now engaged in a course of studies for that purpose. 
Time is so precious to me, that I could not put myself in 
the way of any interruptions, unless for an object of consequence to the public or to myself. The present is not of 
this nature. Such are the circumstances of this state, that 
the benefit arising from the office you propose, would not, 
during the war, yearly exceed one hundred pounds ; for 
unfortunately, I am persuaded, it will not pay annually into 
the continental treasury forty thousand pounds ; and on a 
peace establishment this will not be, for some time to come, 
more than doubled. You will perceive that an engagement of this kind does not correspond with my views, and 
does not afford a sufficient inducement to relinquish them. 

" I am not the less sensible to the obliging motives which 
dictated the offer, and it will be an additional one to the 
respect and esteem with which I have the honour to be, 
very truly, sir, 

" Your most obedient and humble servant." 

On the fourth of June Mr. Morris wrote to him, acknowledging the receipt of this letter, and stating, " I am much 
obliged by the friendly sentiments you express for me, 
which, be assured, I shall retain a grateful sense of. I see 
with you, that the office I had the pleasure of offering, will 
not be equal to what your own abilities will gain in the profession of the law ; but I did intend that the whole sum should 
have been paid, although the whole quota of the taxes had 
not been collected by the state ; consequently, the object 
is greater than you supposed, and the business might probably be effected without more attention than you could spare 
from your studies. If so, I should still be happy in your 
acceptance, and will leave the matter open until I have an 
opportunity of hearing from you upon the subject." 
To which Hamilton gave the following answer : 

HAMILTON TO MORRIS. 

SIR, 

* * * * The explanation which you give of your intention, in your late offer, makes it an object that will compensate fully for the time that it will deduct from my other 
occupations. In accepting it, I have only one scruple, 
arising from a doubt whether the service I can render in 
the present state of things, will be an equivalent for the 
compensation. The whole system, (if it may be so called,) 
of taxation in this state, is radically vicious, burthensome 
to the people, and unproductive to government. As the 
matter now stands, there seems to be little for a continental receiver to do. The whole business appears to be 
thrown into the hands of the county treasurers ; nor do I 
find that there is any appropriation made of any part of the 
taxes collected for continental purposes, or any provision 
to authorize payment to the officer you appoint. This, 
however, must be made. There is only one way in which 
I c*an imagine a prospect of being materially useful ; that 
is, in seconding your applications to the state. In popular assemblies much may sometimes be brought about by 
personal discussions, by entering into details, and combating objections as they rise. If it should, at any time, be 
thought advisable by you to empower me to act in this capacity, I shall be happy to do every thing that depends 
upon me to effectuate your views. I flatter myself, to you, 
sir, I need not profess that I suggest this, not from a desire 
to augment the importance of office, but to advance the 
public interest. 

It is of primary moment to me, as soon as possible to 
take my station in the law, and on this consideration I am 
pressing to qualify myself for admission the next term, 
which will be the latter end of July. After this, should you 
think an interview necessary, I will wait upon you in Philadelphia. In the mean time, I shall be happy to receive your 
instructions, and shall direct my attention more particularly 
to acquiring whatever information may be useful to my future operations. I have read your publications at different 
times, but as I have not the papers containing them in my 
possession, it will be necessary that their contents should 
be comprised in your instructions. A meeting of the legislature is summoned early in the next month, at which, if I 
previously receive your orders, it may be possible to put 
matters in train. I am truly indebted to you, sir, for the 
disposition you have manifested upon this occasion, and I 
shall only add an assurance of my endeavours to justify your 
confidence. 

ALEX. HAMILTON. 

On the second of July following, Mr. Morris writes, enclosing the warrant of appointment and instructions, to 
which he adds the following observations : "It gives me 
singular pleasure, to find that you have yourself pointed out 
one of the principal objects of your appointment. You will 
find that it is specified in the enclosure. I must request 
you to exert your talents, in forwarding with your legislature the views of congress. Your former situation in the 
army, the present situation of that very army, your connexions in the state, your perfect knowledge of men and 
measures, and the abilities with which heaven has blessed 
you, will give you a fine opportunity to forward the public 
service, by convincing the legislature of the necessity of copious supplies, and by convincing all who have claims on 
the justice of congress, that those claims exist only by that 
hard necessity which arises from the negligence of the 
states. When to this you shall superadd the conviction, 
that what remains of the war being a war of finance, solid 
arrangements of finance must necessarily terminate favourably, not only to our hopes, but even to our wishes. Then, 
sir, the governments will be disposed to lay, and the people 
to bear those burthens which are necessary ; and then the 
utility of your office, and of the officer, will be as manifest 
to others as at present to me." 

On the receipt of this communication, Hamilton wrote 
the following letter, 

HAMILTON TO ROBERT MORRIS. 

"I shall to-morrow morning commence a journey to 
Poughkeepsie, where the legislature are assembled, and I 
will endeavour, by every step in my power, to second your 
views, though I am sorry to add, without very sanguine expectations. I think it probable the legislature will do something, but whatever momentary effort they make, till the 
entire change of their present system, very little will be 
done. To effect this, mountains of prejudice and particular interest are to be levelled. For my own part, considering the late serious misfortune to our ally, the spirit of 
reformation, of wisdom, and of unanimity, which seems to 
have succeeded to that of blunder, perverseness, and dissension in the British government, and the universal reluctance of these states to do what is right, I cannot help viewing our situation as critical, and I feel it the duty of every 
citizen to exert his faculties to the utmost to support the 
measures, especially those solid arrangements of finance, 
on which our safety depends. 

" It is not in the spirit of compliment, but of sincerity, I 
assure you, that the opinion I entertain of him who presides 
in the department, was not one of the smallest motives to 
my acceptance of the office, nor will that esteem and confidence which makes me -now sensibly feel the obliging expressions of your letter, fail to have a great share in influencing my future exertions." 

On his arrival at Poughkeepsie, Hamilton addressed a 
letter, on the sixteenth July, to Governor Clinton, apprizing 
him of his appointment, and requesting the legislature to 
vest in him the necessary authority ; stating that it was " a 
part of his duty, to explain to the legislature, from time to 
time, the views of the Superintendent of Finance, in pursuance of the orders of congress, that they may be the better 
enabled to judge of the measures most proper to be adopted for an effectual co-operation, and asking his excellency 
to impart his request, to have the honour of a conference 
withra committee of the two houses." 

This body had been convened, in an extra session, at the 
express instance of a committee of congress, and was opened with a forcible message from the Governor, urging the 
importance of a revisal of the tax laws, and calling upon 
the legislature to denounce the attempts of the British government to make separate treaties with the states, as a 
measure inevitably to be attended with ruin and infamy, 
and pressing the importance of the most strenuous exertions to expel the enemy from their territory, to which an 
answer, prepared by General Schuyler, who was the leader 
in the senate, responded in the strongest terms. On the 
twentieth July, the senate adopted a series of resolutions, 
declaring their opinion, " that the present system of these 
states exposes the cause to a precarious issue ; that the 
radical source of most of the embarrassments is the want 
of sufficient power in congress to effectuate that ready and 
perfect co-operation of the different states, on which their 
immediate safety and future happiness depends ; that experience had demonstrated the confederation to be defective in several essential points, particularly in not vesting 
the federal government, either with a power of providing 
revenue for itself, or with ascertained and productive funds, 
secured by a sanction so solemn and general, as would inspire the fullest confidence in them, and make them a substantial basis of credit ; and that it is essential to the common welfare, that there should be, as soon as possible, a 
conference of the whole states on the subject, and that it 
would be advisable, for this purpose, to propose to congress 
to recommend, and to each state to adopt, the measure of 
assembling a general convention of the states, specially authorized to revise and amend the confederation, reserving 
a right to the respective legislatures to ratify their determinations." 

These resolutions, in which the hand of Hamilton so distinctly appears, were adopted unanimously,* and within 
two days after, a joint committee of both houses was, at his 
instance, appointed to report, at the next session, a system 
for establishing such funds, within the state, as were best 
suited to answer its purposes -and those of the United 
States, and for the more effectual collection of taxes, at 
the head of which was General Schuyler, through whose 
influence Hamilton was, on the same day, elected a Delegate to congress. 

It is interesting, in the progress of this work, to remark, 
that to him who had so long laboured to impress on others 

* July 22d, 1782. 
the importance of a new organization of the government, 
and who had so large a share in its formation, adoption, 
and exposition, is to be attributed, with the aid of Schuyler, the first action of the state of New-York, towards this 
primary object.* In a letter to Mr. Morris, of this date, 
Hamilton thus speaks of the result of his exertions : 

HAMILTON TO ROBERT MORRIS. 

" Poughkecpsie, July 22, 1782. 
" SIR, 

. " Agreeable to my letter to you from Albany, I came to 
this place, and had an interview with a committee of the 
legislature, in which I urged the several matters contained 
in your instructions. I strongly represented the necessity 
of solid arrangements of finance, and by way of argument, 
pointed out all the defects of the present system. I found 
every man convinced that something was wrong, but few 
that were willing to recognise the mischief when defined, 
and consent to the proper remedy. The quantum of taxes 
already imposed is so great, as to make it useless to impose 
any others to a considerable amount ; a bill has, however, 
passed both houses, payable in specie, bank notes, or your 
notes, for eighteen thousand pounds. 

"It is at present appropriated to your order, but I doubt 
whether some subsequent arrangement will not take place 
for a different appropriation. The commander-in-chief has 
applied for a quantity of forage, which the legislature is devising the means of furnishing, and I fear it will finish by 
diverting the eighteen thousand pounds to that purpose. I 
have, hitherto, been able to prevent this ; but as it is of 
indispensable importance to me to leave this place immediately, to prepare for an examination, for which I have 
pledged myself the ensuing term, which is at hand, it is 

* It is believed to be the first proceeding of any state on this subject. 
possible, after I have left it, contrary ideas will prevail. 
Efforts have been made to introduce a species of negotiable 
certificates, which I have strenuously opposed. It has not 
yet taken place, but I am not clear how the matter will 
terminate. Should the bill for the eighteen thousand 
pounds go out, in its present form, I cannot hope that it 
will produce in the treasury above half the sum, such are 
the vices of our present mode of collection. A bill has 
also passed the assembly, for collecting arrearages of taxes, 
payable in specie, bank notes, your notes, old continental 
emissions at one hundred and twenty-eight for one, and a 
species of certificates issued by the state, for the purchase 
of horses. This is now before the senate ; the arrearages 
are very large. 

" Both houses have unanimously passed a set of resolutions, to be transmitted to congress and the several states, 
proposing a convention of the states, to enlarge the powers 
of congress, and vest them with funds. I think this a very 
eligible step, though I doubt of the concurrence of the other 
states ; but I am certain without it, they never will be 
brought to co-operate in any reasonable or effectual plan. 
Urge reforms or exertions, and the answer constantly is, 
what avails it for one state to make them, without the consent of the others ? It is in vain to expose the futility of this 
reasoning. It is founded on all those passions which have 
the strongest influence on the human mind. 

" The legislature have also appointed, at my instance, a 
committee to devise, in its recess, a more effectual system 
of taxation, and to communicate with me on this subject. 
A good deal will depend on the success of this attempt. 
Convinced of the absurdity of multiplying taxes in the present mode, when in effect the payment is voluntary, and 
the money received exhausted in the collection, I have laboured chiefly to instil the necessity of a change in the 
plan, and though not so rapidly as the exigency of public 
affairs requires, truth seems to be making some progress. 

" There is no other appropriation to the use of congress 
than of the eighteen thousand pounds. 

"I shall, as soon as possible, give you a full and just view 
of the situation and temper of this state. This cannot be 
till after my intended examination ; that over, I shall lay 
myself out in every way that can promote your views, and 
the public good. I am informed, you have an appointment 
to make of a commissioner of accounts for this state. Permit me to suggest the expediency of choosing a citizen of 
the state, a man who, to the qualifications requisite for the 
execution of the office, adds an influence in its affairs. I 
need not particularize the reasons for this suggestion. In 
my next I will also take the liberty to mention some characters. I omitted mentioning, that the two houses have 
also passed a bill, authorizing congress to adjust the quotas 
of the states, on equitable principles, agreeable to your recommendation." 

After the adjournment of the legislature, and his admission to the bar, Hamilton devoted himself assiduously to the 
duties which the urgent solicitations of Mr. Morris earnestly pressed. 

The pictures which are given in his letters of this period 
are of the most gloomy cast. Double sets of officers, 
with conflicting powers and duties, clogging their respective operations ; taxes, far beyond the ability of the people, to be collected through a medium reduced to the lowest point, and almost consumed in the process of collection ; 
while a general system of connivance and fraud prevailed in many of the subordinate departments, which furnished the strongest inducements to check the inquiries, 
and prevent the adoption of the suggestions of an officer, 
whose office itself was an object of the most jealous repugnance,* 

To overcome these difficulties was an herculean task ; 
but he engaged in it with all his characteristic patience of 
investigation. Though the evils were too extensive, and 
laid too deep to be reached by any other means than a total 
change of system, yet he hoped, by scrutinizing the whole 
train of abuses, such data might be obtained as would enable the office of finance to apply efficient remedies, and gradually to infuse such opinions as would convince the state 
of its errors, and induce a radical change of policy. 

During the interval of the appointment and meeting of the 
committee, he was constantly engaged in extensive correspondences throughout the state ; in circulars to the county 
treasurers, to ascertain the receipts and expenses of collection ; in communications with the army contractors, Messrs. 
Duer and Sands, to learn the amount of expenditures and 
the quantity of specie, and to promote the circulation and 
increase the value of the notes of the financier and of the 
bank, and in devising means to defer and lighten the demands on the general treasury. 

While thus employed in fulfilling the calls of the financier, he used the estimate which he obtained, (the incompleteness of which he laments,) as a basis for digesting a 
new plan of state taxation, which he proposed to submit to 
the legislature. 

The rule adopted in the confederation, after much angry 
discussion, for fixing the quota of each state, had proved a 
source of great delay and controversy. The valuation of 
land which it prescribed, had been found impracticable, and 
congress had been compelled to adhere to the original system of requisitions, on the basis of the population, as com

twenty-ninth of August, 1782, a committee of inquiry, appointed by congress, 
questioned his reasons for appointing continental receivers. puted m seventeen hundred and seventy-five. Each state 
took advantage of the inaccuracy of this enumeration, and 
found a ready excuse for the deficiency of their supplies in 
the incorrectness of the estimate. 

To avoid this difficulty, and at the same time to extend 
the system of taxation as far as was possible, in order to meet 
the demands of the public, Hamilton framed anelaborate bill, 
in which, agreeably to a resolution of congress of the preceding February, and to the report of the financier, he proposed 
to abolish the method which existed, of taxing by arbitrary 
quotas and assessments, a source of the greatest injustice 
and inequality, and substituting for it a system of specific 
taxation on lands, distinguished by their character, as meadow or arable ; on salt by the bushel ; on tobacco by the 
pound ; on carriages ; plate ; on licenses of various kinds ; 
on menial servants ; on houses ; and a rate of specific duties on imports. 

The bill embraces a very minute and systematic scheme 
to render the assessment and collection easy and secure ; and 
with a view to prevent the confusion and neglect which had 
resulted from the proceeds of the taxes being thrown into 
a general mass, he suggested the appropriation of them to 
various objects ; that upon land, to the support of the internal government ; on carriages, to the judicial establishment ; 
the house tax to congress, for supplementary funds ; the 
salt, license, and tobacco tax, for constituting a loan office, 
which seems to have been connected with the incorporation 
of a bank, of which a portion of the income was to be secured to that office.* The surplus of these taxes, and all

which contemplated one state bank to control the currency ; the general 
banking to be conducted by private bankers. It is not in Hamilton's handwriting, and some features of the plan render it probable that it was a project

ply the Federal treasury. A plan of a lottery was also at 
this time devised by him, containing many ingenious suggestions, and evincing singular care to prevent frauds, from 
which a considerable sum was hoped to be derived in aid 
of the finances ; a mode of taxation which had been proposed by a committee of congress in seventeen hundred and 
eighty ; but which the enlightened sentiment of the present 
age has ceased to approve. 

Having obtained a license as an attorney in July, he, 
notwithstanding his public duties, continued to prosecute 
his legal studies, in order to prepare for admission to the 
bar as a counsellor, at the ensuing October term of the Supreme Court. A letter to his friend Meade, shows his views 
on this subject, and gives a* pleasing exhibition of his domestic feelings. 

HAMILTON TO MEADE. 

Albany, August 27tli, 1782. 

I thank you, my dear Meade, for your letter of the first 
of this month, which you will perceive has travelled much 
faster than has been usual with our letters. Our correspondence hitherto has been unfortunate, nor in fact can 
either of us compliment himself on his punctuality ; but you 
were right in concluding, that however indolence or accident may interrupt our intercourse, nothing will interrupt 
our friendship. Mine for you is built on the solid basis of 
a full conviction that you deserve it, and that it is reciprocal, and it is the more firmly fixed, because you have few 
competitors. Experience is a continued comment on the 
worthlessness of the human race, and the few exceptions 
we find, have the greater right to be valued in proportion as 
they are rare. I know few men estimable, fewer amiable, and when I meet with one of the last description, it is 
not in my power to withhold my affection. 

You reproach me with not having said enough about our 
little stranger. When I wrote last, I was not sufficiently 
acquainted with him to give you his character. I may now 
assure you, that your daughter, when she sees him, will not 
consult you about the choice, or will only do it in respect 
to the rules of decorum. He is truly a very fine young gentleman, the most agreeable in his conversation and manners 
of any I ever knew, nor less remarkable for his intelligence 
and sweetness of temper. You are not to imagine, by my 
beginning with his mental qualifications, that he is defective in personal. It is agreed, on all hands, that he is handsome ; his features are good, his eye is not only sprightly 
and expressive, but it is full of benignity. His attitude, in 
sitting is, by connoisseurs, esteemed graceful, and he has a 
method of waving his hand that announces the future orator. He stands, however, rather awkwardly, and as his 
legs have not all the delicate slimness of his father's, it is 
feared he may never excel as much in dancing, which is 
probably the only accomplishment in which he will not be 
a model. If he has any fault in manners, he laughs too 
much. He has now passed his seventh month. 

I am glad to find your prospect of being settled approaches. I am sure you will realize all the happiness you 
promise yourself with your amiable partner. I wish fortune 
had not cast our lots at such a distance. Mrs. Meade, you, 
Betsey, and myself, would make a most affectionate and 
most happy partie quarre. 

As to myself, I shall sit down in New-York, when it 
opens, and the period we are told approaches. No man 
looks forward to a peace with more pleasure than I do, 
though no man would sacrifice less to it than myself, if I 
were not convinced the people sigh for peace. I have been 
studying the law for some months, and have lately been 
licensed as an attorney. I wish to prepare myself by October for examination as a counsellor, but some public avocations may possibly prevent me. 
I had. almost forgotten to tell you, that I have been pretty 
unanimously elected by the legislature of this state, a member of congress, to begin to serve in November. I do not 
hope to reform the state, although I shall endeavour to do 
all the good I can. 

Suffer Betsey and me to present our love to Mrs. Meade. 
She has a sisterly affection for you. My respects, if you 
please, to Mr. and Mrs. Fitzhugh. God bless you. 

A. HAMILTON. 

The committee of the legislature, of which he speaks in 
his letter to Mr. Morris, met on the fifteenth of September, 
and notwithstanding his labour in devising a system of taxation, such were his doubts of the tone of the public, that in 
a letter written to Mr. Morris on the evening prior to their 
meeting, he says, " I am at a loss to know whether I ought 
to press the establishment of permanent funds or not, though 
unless I receive your instructions, following my own apprehensions of what are probably your views, I shall dwell 
upon this article." 

On the fifth of October, he writes as follows: "In my 
last I informed you that the committee appointed by the 
legislature on the subject of taxation were together. 

" In spite of my efforts, they have parted without doing 
any thing decisive. They have, indeed, agreed on several 
matters, and those of importance, but they have not reduced them to the form of a report, which, in fact, leaves 
every thing afloat, to be governed by the impressions of the 
moment, when the legislature meet. 

" The points agreed upon are these : that there shall 
be an actual valuation of land, and a tax of so much on the 
pound. The great diversity in the quality of land, would 
not suffer them to listen to an estimated valuation, or to a 
tax by the quantity, agreeable to the idea in your late report to congress, that there shall be also a tariff of all personal property, to be also taxed at so much on the pound. 

" That there shall be a specific tax on carriages, clocks, 
watches, and other similar articles of luxury : That money 
at usury shall be taxed at a fixed rate in the pound, excluding that which is loaned to the public : That houses in 
all towns shall be taxed at a certain proportion of the annual rent : That there shall be a poll tax on all single men 
from fifteen upwards ; and that the collection of the taxes 
should be advertised to the lowest bidder, at a fixed rate 
per cent., barring all subordinate expenses. 

"Among other things which were rejected, I pressed 
hard for an excise on distilled liquors, but all that could be 
carried in this article was a license on taverns. 

" The committee were pretty generally of opinion, that 
the system of funding, for payment of old debts, and for 
procuring farther credit was wise and indispensable ; but a 
majority thought it would be unwise in one state to contribute in this way alone. 

" Nothing was decided on the question of taxes, which 
the state was able to pay ; those who went farthest did not 
exceed seventy thousand pounds, of which fifty were for 
the use of the United States." 

An interesting correspondence continued between Morris and Hamilton, in which the various measures for propping up the credit of the financier, and introducing his notes 
into extensive circulation, as a common currency, are discussed. In one of these, Hamilton speaks of an address of 
the public creditors in Albany to those of the whole United 
States, as having originated with himself, and containing 
ideas which ought to prevail. 

The suspension of interest on the loan office certificates 
issued at an early stage of the revolution, had produced 
great distress and discontent among the holders, the greater 
number of whom resided in Philadelphia. After frequent 
consultation, a numerous meeting was convened in that 
city, and strong resolutions adopted, urging upon congress 
the necessity of granting them immediate relief. On the 
appearance of this document, Hamilton conceived the idea 
that a powerful influence might be exercised upon the measures of congress by the co-operation of the creditors in 
other states, and with this view a meeting was held at Albany, where General Schuyler presided, at which was proposed a convention of county delegates at Poughkeepsie, 
and a state delegation to a general convention at Philadelphia, from which he hoped incipient steps might be taken 
for the adoption of his favourite measure, a re-organization of the general government. These resolutions were 
accompanied by the following address, urging the establishment of permanent funds. 

" TO THE PUBLIC CREDITORS OF THE STATE OF 
NEW-YORK." 

The appellation by which we have chosen to address you, 
indicates at once the broad and equitable basis upon which 
we wish to unite the influence and efforts of those who are 
creditors of the public, to obtain that justice, which the necessities of many, and the rights of all demand. Whatever distinctions may characterize the different classes of 
creditors, either of the United States, or of this state, 
whatever may be their different degrees of merit as patriots, or their comparative claims upon the gratitude or 
generosity of their country, in one circumstance they all 
agree, they have an equal claim upon the justice and 
plighted faith of the public. 

Alarmed by the successive violations of public engagements, and by that recent and distressing one, the withholding the interest hitherto paid by bills on France, upon 
the monies loaned previous to first March, 1778, the public 
creditors in this city have thought it necessary to follow 
the example of those of the city of Philadelphia, and to 
convene and consult upon the measures proper to be taken 
for their own security. They will not dwell upon the 
measure alluded to, farther than to observe, that its weight 
is most oppressively felt by those whose zeal in the cause 
and confidence in their country have been most conspicuous ; who in times of danger, have demonstrated their 
concern for the common safety, by voluntary deposits, in 
some instances of the whole, in others of a large part of 
their fortunes in the public funds ; and who now, many of 
them at least, feel themselves reduced from affluence to 
indigence, from circumstances of ease and plenty, to 
penury and unaffected distress. 

They cannot but add, that there are others, not less meritorious, who have perhaps experienced even a worse fate ; 
those who, having made subsequent loans, have long since 
seen the payment of interest cease, and those who, when 
the distresses of the army have had no resource but in the 
patriotism of individuals, have cheerfully parted with the 
fruits of their industry, scarcely reserving a sufficiency for 
the subsistence of their own families, without any compensation since, besides the consciousness of having been the 
benefactors of their country. 

We entertain not so injurious an idea as to imagine, that 
levity or contempt of the obligations of national faith, or 
of the dictates of policy, have influenced those infringements of the public engagements, which have too often 
happened. We have been sensible of the necessity which 
has, in some cases, produced them ; but we apprehend it 
to have resulted, not from the want of ability or means, 
but from the want of a proper system for the beneficial 
application of them. And we conceive it our duty to acquiesce in that necessity, only so far as there appears to 
be an unavoidable sacrifice to the urgent calls of particular 
conjunctions, followed by effectual endeavours to prevent 
a continuance or return of the same necessity, or to make 
satisfaction in some other way. 

Few states have been without their vicissitudes, in which 
the strict obligations of good faith have been obliged to 
bend to momentary necessities ; but the example of all 
wise and happy ones, combine with reason and justice to 
establish this truth, that no time ought to be lost in providing the means of repairing those breaches, and making 
compensation for the sufferers. 

Unfortunately for us, and for every citizen of the United 
States, (for the calamity directly or in its consequences is 
general,) the same policy has been too long delayed in this 
country ; the only expedient in our power for effecting the 
object, being still unattempted. We need no arguments to 
convince us, that it is not possible for these states, by any 
exertions they can make, to pay off at once the principal 
of the public debts, and furnish the supplies for the current demands of the war, and for the support of civil government. We even think it as manifest as experience 
and calculation can make it, that our abilities fall greatly 
short even of the two latter objects. This, in an infant 
country, will not surprise those who know that nations 
the most opulent, and in all the vigour of maturity, are 
compelled to have recourse to large loans in time of war, 
to satisfy the public exigencies. 

The quota of the present year has been fixed at eight 
millions of dollars, which we are to consider as the sum 
requisite for the annual expenditure .; and those accustomed 
to computations of such a nature, will be convinced that 
to make this sum suffice, requires economy and good management. Have we a prospect of raising one third of 
this sum within the states? Those who have attended to 
the publications of the receipts on the continental account, 
will easily answer the question for themselves. If this 



418 TUB LIFE OF 

must be in the negative, the inquiry then becomes, what 
means have we to supply the deficiency? 

Admit that there are defects in the system of taxation 
in almost every state, and that more judgement and equality in the manner of laying them, more energy and economy in the collection, would be more productive to the revenue, and less burthensome to the people, still we cannot 
imagine that the reformation of these defects would augment the product of the taxes in any proportion to the deficiency. 

It is plain, therefore, that the principal part of the balance must be procured upon credit ; nor is it less plain, 
that this must chiefly be from individuals at home and 
abroad. We are assured, that the situation of our allies 
will not permit them to make us governmental loans, in 
any proportion to our wants, and without this assurance, 
we might have inferred it, from a consideration of the immense land and naval establishments which they are 
obliged to support in the prosecution of the war, on their 
own part. 

It may be asked, if such are the necessities of the public, how are they to spare any part of their funds for the 
payment of old debts? The answer is easy, those necessities can only be supplied by a sound and healthy state 
of public credit, and there is only one way to effect the 
restoration of this credit, the putting the old debts in a 
course of redemption, or at least securing the punctual payment of the interest, by substantial funds, permanently 
pledged for that purpose. 

It cannot be expected, that individuals in this country 
will hereafter lend to the public, unless they perceive a disposition to do justice to its creditors. If, without providing 
for those who have already risked their fortunes, securities 
should be held out to invite future creditors, a suspicion of 
their faithful application would deter every prudent man. 
There must be a good opinion of public faith, before there 
can be a confidence in public securities ; and this opinion 
can only be created by unequivocal demonstrations of a 
disposition to do justice; nor will any thing amount to a 
proof of this, short of the measure on which we insist. In 
common life, no credit would be given to any man who departed from these principles, and the same rule is not less 
applicable to nations. 

If individuals among ourselves would not have the necessary confidence, it were chimerical to expect it from 
foreigners. Such of them as, having been already adventurers in our funds, are holders of public certificates, would 
have little encouragement to adventure farther. 

No presumptions of the speedy termination of the war, 
will invalidate the force of these reflections. Not only the 
grounds of them are vague and uncertain, and it would be 
the extremity of folly to abandon an indispensable resource 
for continuing the war, because there was a possibility of 
its being ended. But the fullest assurance of the event, 
would not take away this irresistible argument, that public 
justice, and its inseparable companion, public credit, are 
alike essential to the prosperity of a nation in peace and 
war. 

We scruple not to assert, that these states might, with 
ease to themselves, provide the means requisite to fund the 
debts already incurred, and to procure farther loans. A 
moderate sum would be sufficient. It is an expedient 
which we conceive besides calculated to lighten the burthens of the people, and to increase then* ability to bear 
them. The more we can procure on credit, the less we 
. need exhaust ourselves in immediate taxation ; and the public creditors themselves will be enabled to bear a large 
share of the future burthen, which will, of course, diminish 
the contributions of others. We might expatiate on the 
influence of public credit over private industry, and on its 
tendency in that way to multiply the riches of the community, and we might add, that the wheels of circulation and 
commerce, now clogged by the want of an adequate medium, would derive new motion and vivacity from the increase of that medium, by rendering the public securities a 
valuable negotiable property. We have indulged in these 
reflections to show that patriotism, not less than necessity, 
interest, and safety, prompt us to an emphatical appeal to the 
justice and honour of our country. 

What will be the condition of individuals, if a disregard 
to the sanctity of public obligations should become the spirit of the public councils ? We indeed should be the immediate victims, but who can answer when his turn might 
come ? It is true, those who are not already embarked, 
may avoid hereafter becoming volunteers in their own ruin, 
but can they guard against the pressing calls of necessity, 
enforced by legislative coertions ? Should we see a renewal of the distresses of the army, for want of subsistence, 
must not the inhabitants of this state again feel the weight 
of compulsory laws, and unless justice be done to the present creditors, what hope can they have of recompense ? 
What, in short, will be the security of private property, if 
the powers of government may be employed to take it from 
us, and no provision hereafter made to render satisfaction ? 

A purity of faith has ever been the more peculiar attribute of republics, the very being of which depends on virtue in all, and a Sacred regard to justice in those to whom 
the administration of affairs is entrusted. A contrary disposition in these states, would be as novel as pernicious ; 
and we flatter ourselves, we never shall suffer such a stigma to be fixed upon our national character, especially on 
our first emerging into political existence. 

The propriety of introducing at large such a document, 
may, perhaps, be questioned ; but, when it is remembered, 



HAMILTON. 42 1 

that the fate of the American union depended on the fulfilment of its engagements ; with what difficulty its discordant members were induced to co-operate ; and when we 
view Hamilton as the great instrument in producing this 
result ; the knowledge of every circumstance which can 
throw light on the state of public opinion ; of every obstacle which was encountered ; and of every effort which was 
made ; becomes essential in enabling us to judge of the nature and extent of his services. 

There is another view, which has a deep and touching 
interest. Amidst the glare of war, the civil sufferers of the 
revolution have been little regarded ; and the individuals who nerved the arm of the country with their wealth ; 
who parted with the fruits of their industry ; who were reduced from affluence to indigence ; who had none of the 
quickening incentives of ambition to sustain them ; whose 
intelligence disclosed to them all the hazards they incurred ; 
and who leaned solely on an elevated and self-denying 
patriotism, were often remembered only to be stigmatized. 
They are brought before us here in person with all their 
unrequited wrongs ; standing before the altar of public 
faith ; claiming the fulfilment of its pledges for the sacrifices they had made ; in the midst of them is seen Hamilton, pleading in their behalf for that justice which, though 
long delayed, it was reserved to his hand to administer. 

Most of the letters which passed, at this time, between 
the subject of this memoir and the Superintendent of Finance are lost, and it is the more to be regretted, as, from 
the manner in which they are referred to, they appear to 
have contained full views of the many difficult questions 
which arose, connected with the restoration of public credit. 

From those which remain, we may infer, how early ripened were Hamilton's financial opinions, and may form a 
partial judgement of the extraordinary difficulties, labours, 
and capacity of Robert Morris, whose luminous views of 



422 THE LIFE OF HAMILTON. 

the interests of the country, are only less remarkable than 
the energy, firmness, and resource, with which he seemed 
to have borne on his shoulders its tottering fortunes. 

As the session of congress approached, Colonel Hamilton urged the necessity of a successor being appointed ; 
and on the last day of October relinquished his office of 
continental receiver, to commence the new and more important career which was opening before him. 




Continental troops have been detained at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, I 
concluded you would not disapprove of a measure 
calculated to strengthen you, though but for a small 
time, and have ventured to adopt it, on that presumption. 
</p><p>
Being informed, by <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a>, that General 
Winds, with seven hundred Jersey militia, was at 
King's Ferry, with intention to cross to <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>, I 
prevailed upon him to relinquish that idea, and send 
off an immediate order for them to march towards 
Red Bank. 
</p><p>
It is possible, however, unless your Excellency sup 
ports this order by an application from yourself, he 
may march his men home instead of to the place he 
has been directed to repair to. Neither Lee's [nor] Jackson's regiments, nor the detachments belonging 
to <a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel='colleague'>General McDougall</a>'s division, have yet marched. 
I have pressed their being sent, and an order has 
been despatched for their instantly proceeding. 
</p><p>
Colonel Hughes is pressing some fresh horses for 
me. The moment they are ready, I shall recross the 
river in order to fall in with the troops on the other 
side, and make all the haste I can to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, to get 
the three brigades there sent forward. 
</p><p>
Will your Excellency permit me to observe, that I 
have some doubts, under present circumstances and 
appearances, of the propriety of leaving the regiments 
proposed to be left in this quarter? But if my 
doubts on this subject were stronger than they are, I 
am forbid, by the sense of Council, from interfering 
in this matter. I have the honor to be, with the 
warmest esteem and respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

P. S. General Poor's brigade is just arrived here. 
They will proceed to join you with all expedition. 
So strongly am I impressed with the importance of 
endeavouring to crush Mr. Howe, that I am apt to 
think it would be advisable to draw off all the Continental troops. Had this been determined on, General 
Warner's sixteen hundred militia might have been 
left here.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I arrived here yesterday, at noon, and waited upon 
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a> immediately, on the business of my 
mission ; but was sorry to find his ideas did not correspond with yours for drawing off the number of 
troops you directed. I used every argument in my 
power to convince him of the propriety of the measure ; but he was inflexible in the opinion, that two 
brigades, at least, of Continental troops should remain 
in and near this place. His reasons were, that the 
intelligence of Sir Henry Clinton's having gone to 
join Burgoyne was not sufficiently authenticated to 
put it out of doubt ; that there was, therefore, a possibility of his returning up the river, which might ex 
pose the finest arsenal in America (as he calls the 
one here) to destruction, should this place be left so 
bare of troops as I proposed ; and that the want of 
conveniences, and the difficulty of the roads, would 
make it impossible to remove the artillery and stores 
here for a considerable time ; that the New England 
States would be left open to the depredations and 
ravages of the enemy; that it would put it out of 
his power to enterprise any thing against <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, which, he thinks, might be done in the winter, 
and which he considers it of importance to under 
take. 
</p><p>
The force of the reasons did by no means strike 
me, and I did every thing in my power to show 
they were unsubstantial; but all I could effect, was 
to have one brigade despatched, in addition to those 
already marched. I found myself infinitely embarrassed, and was at a loss how to act. I felt the importance of strengthening you as much as possible ; 
but, on the other hand, I found insuperable inconveniences in acting diametrically opposite to the 
opinion of a gentleman, whose successes have raised 
him into the highest importance. <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a> has 
won the entire confidence of the Eastern States. If 
disposed to do it, by addressing himself to the prejudices of the people, he would find no difficulty to 
render a measure odious, which, it might be said 
with plausibility enough to be believed, was calculated to expose them to unnecessary danger, notwithstanding their exertions during the campaign had 
given them the fullest title to repose and security. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a> has influence and interest elsewhere ; 
he might use it, if he pleased, to discredit the measure there also. On the whole, it appeared to me 
dangerous to insist on sending more troops from 
hence, while <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a> appeared so warmly op 
posed to it. Should any accident or inconvenience 
happen in consequence of it, there would be too fair a pretext for censure ; and many people are too w^ell 
disposed to lay hold of it. At any rate, it might be 
considered as using him ill, to take a step so contrary to his judgment^ in a case of this nature. 
</p><p>
These considerations, and others which I shall be 
more explicit in, when I have the pleasure of seeing 
you, determined me not to insist upon sending either 
of the other brigades remaining here. I am afraid 
what I have done may not meet with your approbation, as not being, perhaps, fully warranted by 
your instructions ; but I ventured to do what I 
thought right, hoping that, at least, the goodness of 
my intention will excuse the error of my judgment. 
</p><p>
I was induced to this relaxation the more readily, 
as I had directed to be sent on two thousand militia, 
which were not expected by you, and a thousand 
Continental troops out of those proposed to be left 
with <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a>, which I have written to him, 
since I found how matters were circumstanced here. 
to forward to you with all despatch. I did this for 
several reasons; because your reinforcement would 
be more expeditious from that place than from this; 
because two thousand Continental troops at <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> 
will not be wanted, in the present circumstances, 
especially as it was really necessary to have a body 
of Continental troops at this place for the security 
of the valuable stores here ; and I should not, if I 
had my wish, think it expedient to draw off more 
than two of the three brigades now here. This being 
the case, one of the ends you proposed to be answered by leaving the ten regiments with General 
Putnam, will be equally answered by the troops here ; 
I mean that of covering and satisfying the Eastern 
States ; and one thousand Continental troops, in addition to the militia collected and that may be collected there, will be sufficient in the Highlands for 
covering the country down that way, and carrying 
on the works necessary to be raised for the defence 
of the river. 
</p><p>
The troops gone, and going, to reenforce you, are 
near five thousand, rank and file, Continental troops, 
and twenty-five hundred Massachusetts and New Hampshire militia. These, and the seven hundred Jersey 
militia, will be a larger reinforcement than you expected, though not quite an equal number of Continental troops, nor exactly in the way directed. <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague met'>General Lincoln</a> tells me the militia are very excellent; 
and though their times will be out by the last of 
this month, you will be able, if you think proper, to 
order the troops still remaining here, to join you by 
the time their term of service expires. 
</p><p>
I cannot forbear being uneasy lest my conduct 
should prove displeasing to you; but I have done what, considering all circumstances, appeared to me 
most eligible and prudent. I have the honor to be. 
with great esteem and respect,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I arrived here last night from <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>. Having 
given <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a> a little time to recollect himself, 
I renewed my remonstrances on the necessity and 
propriety of sending you more than one brigade of 
the three he had detained with him, and finally prevailed upon him to give orders for Glover's, in addition to Patterson's brigade, to march this way. As 
it was thought conducive to expedition to send the 
troops by water, as far as it could be done, I pro 
cured all the vessels that could be had at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> fit 
for the purpose, but could not get more than sufficient to take in Patterson's brigade. It was embarked the 7th instant, and I expected would have been 
here before this, but the wind has been contrary, 
though they must, in all probability, be here to-day. 
General Glover's brigade marched at the same time 
on the east side of the river, the road being much 
better there than on this side. I am this moment 
informed that one sloop, with a part of Patterson's, 
is arrived, and that the others are in sight. They 
will immediately proceed by water to King's Ferry, 
and thence take the shortest route to you. 
</p><p>
I am pained, beyond expression, to inform your Excellency that, on my arrival here, I find every thing 
has been neglected and deranged by <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a>, 
and that the two brigades, Poor's and Learned's, still 
remained here and on the other side the river at 
<a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a>. Colonel Warner's militia, I am told, have 
been drawn to <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>, to aid in an expedition 
against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, which, it seems, is at this time the 
hobby-horse with <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a>. Not the least attention has been paid to my order, in your name, fora detachment of one thousand men from the troops 
hitherto stationed at that post. Every thing is sacrificed to the whim of taking <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
</p><p>
The two brigades of Poor and Learned, it appears, 
would not march for want of money and necessaries, 
several of the regiments having received no pay for 
six or eight months past. There has been a high 
mutiny among the former on this account, in which a 
Captain killed a man, and was shot himself by his 
comrade. These difficulties, for want of proper management, have stopped the troops from proceeding. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a> has been the only man who has 
done any thing towards removing them ; but, for want 
of <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a>'s cooperation., has not been able 
to effect it. He has only been able to prevail with 
Learned's brigade to agree to march to Goshen, in 
hopes, by getting them once on the go, to get them 
to continue their march. On coming here, I immediately sent for Colonel Bayley, who now commands 
Learned's brigade ; and have gotten him to engage 
for carrying the brigade on to head-quarters as fast 
as possible. This he expects to effect by means of 
live or six thousand dollars, which <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a> 
was kind enough to borrow for me, and which Colonel 
Bayley thinks will keep the men in good humor till 
they join you. They marched this morning towards 
Goshen. 
</p><p>
I shall, as soon as possible, see General Poor, and 
do every thing in my power to get him along. I 
hope I shall be able to succeed. 
</p><p>
The plan I before laid having been totally deranged, a new one has become necessary. It is now 
too late to send Warner's militia. By the time they 
get to you, their term of service would be out. The 
motive for sending them, which was to give you a 
speedy reenforcement, has, by the past delay, been 
superseded. By <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a>'s advice, I have 
sent an order, in the most emphatical terms, to General 
Putnam, immediately to despatch all the Continental 
troops under him to your assistance ; and to detain 
the militia instead of them. 
</p><p>
My opinion is, that the only present use for troops 
in this quarter is to protect the country from the 
depredations of little plundering parties, and for carrying on the works necessary for the defence of the 
river. Nothing more ought to be thought of. It is 
only wasting time, and misapplying men, to employ 
them in a fancied parade against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>; for in 
this it will undoubtedly terminate. <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> is no 
object, if it could be taken ; and, to take it, would 
require more men than could be spared from more 
substantial purposes. <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a>'s ideas coincide with mine. He thinks that there is no need of 
more Continental troops here than a few to give a 
spur to the militia in working upon the fortifications. 
In pursuance of this, I have given the directions be 
fore mentioned ; if <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a> attends to them, 
the troops under him may be with you nearly as 
early as any of the others (though he has unluckily 
marched them down to Tarrytown), and General Glover's brigade, when it gets up, will be more than sufficient to answer the purposes of this post. 
</p><p>
If your Excellency agrees with me in opinion, it 
will be well to send instant directions to <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a> to pursue the objects I have mentioned; for I 
doubt whether he will attend to any thing I shall 
say, notwithstanding it comes in the shape of a positive order. I fear, unless you interpose, the works 
here will go on so feebly, for want of men, that they 
will not be completed in time ; whereas, it appears to 
me of the utmost importance they should be pushed 
with the utmost vigor. <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a> will do 
every thing in his power. I wish <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a> 
was recalled from the command of this post, and <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a> would accept it. The blunders and ca 
prices of the former are endless. 
</p><p>
Believe me, Sir, nobody can be more impressed 
with the importance of forwarding the reinforcements 
coming to you, with all speed, nor could anybody 
have endeavoured more to promote it than I have 
done ; but the ignorance of some, and the design of 
others, have been almost insuperable obstacles. I am 
very unwell; but I shall not spare myself to get 
things immediately in a proper train; and, for that 
purpose, intend, unless I receive other orders from yon, 
to continue with the troops in the progress of their 
march. As soon as I get General Poor's brigade in 
march, I shall proceed to <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a> at <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>. I have the honor to be, with much regard and 
respect,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have been detained here these two days by a 
fever, and violent rheumatic pains throughout my 
body. This has prevented my being active in person 
for promoting the purposes of my errand; but I have 
taken every other method in my power, in which 
<a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a> has obligingly given me all the aid 
he could. In answer to my pressing application to 
General Poor, for the immediate marching of his brigade, I was told they were under an operation for 
the itch, which made it impossible for them to proceed till the effects of it were over. By a letter, 
however, of yesterday, General Poor informed me he 
would certainly march this morning. I must do him the justice to say, he appears solicitous to join you ; 
and that I believe the past delay is not owing to 
any fault of his, but is wholly chargeable on General 
Putnam. Indeed, Sir, I owe it to the service to say, 
that every part of this gentleman's conduct is marked 
with blunders and negligence, and gives general disgnst. 
Parsons's brigade will join you, I hope, in five or six 
days from this. Learned's may do the same. Poor's 
will, I am persuaded, make all the haste they can for 
the future ; and Glover's may be expected at <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a> 
to-night, whence they will be pushed forward, as fast 
as I can have any influence to make them go. But, I 
am sorry to say, the disposition for marching, in the 
officers and men in general, of these troops, does not 
keep pace with my wishes, or the exigency of the 
occasion. They have Unfortunately imbibed an idea 
that they have done their part of the business of the 
campaign, and are now entitled to repose. This, and 
the want of pay, make them averse to a long march 
at this advanced season. 
</p><p>
A letter from you to <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a>, of the 9th, 
fell just now into my hands. As it might possibly 
contain something useful to me, I took the liberty of 
opening it, and, after reading it, immediately des 
patched it to him. If he has paid any attention to 
my last letters to him, things will be in a right train 
for executing the order in yours ; but whether he has 
or not, is a matter of doubt. In a letter from him, 
just now received by <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a>, he appears to 
have been, on the 10th instant, at King Street, at 
the White Plains. I have had no answer to my last 
applications. 
</p><p>
The enemy appear to have stripped <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
very bare. The people there (that is, the Tories) are 
in a very great fright. This adds to my anxiety 
that the reinforcements from this quarter to you are 
not in greater forwardness and more considerable. 
</p><p>
I have written to <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a>, informing him of 
the accounts of the situation of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> with respect to troops, and the probability of the force gone to Howe being greater than was at first expected, to 
try if this will not extort from him a further reenforcement. I do not, however, expect much from 
him, as he pretends to have in view an expedition 
against <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, to be undertaken in the winter; 
and he knows that, under the sanction of this idea, 
calculated to catch the Eastern people, he may, with 
out censure, retain the troops. And as I shall be 
under a necessity of speaking plainly to your Excellency when I have the pleasure of seeing you, I 
shall not hesitate to say, I doubt whether you would 
have had a man from the Northern army if the 
whole could have been kept at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> with any decency. Perhaps you will think me blainable in not 
having exercised the powers you gave me, and givena positive order. Perhaps I have been so ; but, deliberately weighing all circumstances, I did not, and 
do not, think it advisable to do it, I have the honor 
to be, with unfeigned esteem and regard,

Sm,

I arrived at this place last night, and, unfortunately, find myself unable to proceed any further. Imagining I had got the better of my complaints, which 
confined me at <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a>'s, and anxious to be about, attending to the march of the troops, the day 
before yesterday I crossed the ferry, in order to fall 
in with General Glover's brigade, which was on its 
march from <a href='/results.php?city=poughkeepsie' rel='city'>Poughkeepsie</a> to <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a>. I did not. 
however, see it myself, but received a letter from 
Colonel Shepherd, who commands the brigade, in 
forming me he would be, last night, at <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a>, and 
this night at King's Ferry. Wagons, &c., are provided on the other side for his accommodation, so 
that there need be no delay, but what is voluntary ; 
and, I believe, Colonel Shepherd is as well disposed 
as could be wished to hasten his march. General 
Poor's brigade crossed the ferry the day before yesterday. Tw 7 o York regiments, Cortlandt's and Livings 
ton's, are with them; they were unwilling to be sepa 
rated from the brigade, and the brigade from them. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a> was unwilling to keep them with 
him, and, if he had consented to do it, the regiments 
to replace them would not join you within six days 
as soon as these. 
</p><p>
The troops now remaining with <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a> 
will amount to about the number you intended, 
though they are not exactly the same. He has detached Colonel Charles Webb's regiment to you. He 
says the troops with him are not in a condition to 
march, being destitute of shoes, stockings, and other 
necessaries ; but, I believe, the true reasons of his 
being unwilling to pursue the mode pointed out by 
you were, his aversion to the York troops, and his 
desire to retain General Parsons with him. I am, 
with much respect and esteem,

SIR, 
</p><p>
We have halted the troops at this place. The enemy, by our last reports, were four miles from this 
(that is, their rear), and had passed the road which 
turns off towards South Amboy, which determines 
their route towards Shrewsbury. Our reason for halting is the extreme distress of the troops for want 
of provisions. <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague'>General Wayne</a>'s detachment is almost 
starving, and seem both unwilling and unable to march 
further, till they are supplied. If we do not receive 
an immediate supply, the whole purpose of our detachment must be frustrated. 
</p><p>
This morning we missed doing any thing from a 
deficiency of intelligence. On my arrival at Crauberry yester-evening, I proceeded, by desire of the 
Marquis, immediately to <a href='/results.php?city=hightstown' rel='city'>Hightstown</a> and Allentown, 
to take measures for cooperating with the different 
parts of the detachment, and to find what was doing 
to procure intelligence. I found every precaution was 
neglected no horse was near the enemy, or could be 
heard of till late in the morning; so that, before we 
could send out parties and get the necessary information, they were in full march; and, as they have 
marched pretty expeditionary, we should not be able 
to come up with them during the march of the day, 
if we did not suffer the impediment we do on the 
score of provisions. We are entirely at a loss where 
the army is, which is no inconsiderable check to our enterprise. If the army is wholly out of supporting 
distance, we risk the total loss of the detachment in 
making an attack. 
</p><p>
If the army will countenance us, we may do some 
thing clever. We feel our personal honor, as well as 
the honor of the army and the good of the service 
interested, and are heartily desirous to attempt what 
ever the disposition of our men will second, and prudence authorize. It is evident the enemy wish to 
avoid, not to engage us. 
</p><p>
Desertions, I imagine, have been pretty consider 
able to-day. I have seen eight or ten deserters, and 
have heard of many more. We have had some little 
skirmishing by detached parties. One attacked their 
rear-guard with a degree of success, killed a few, and 
took seven prisoners. I am, with great respect and 
regard, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=alh" rel="me">ALEXANDER HAMILTON</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. The Marquis and General Dickinson send 
their compliments. My writing renders theirs unnecessary. 
</p><p>
An officer just comes in, who informs me that he 
left the enemy's rear five miles off, still in march, 
about half an hour ago. To ascertain still more fully 
their route, I have ordered a fresh party on their 
left, towards the head of their column. They have 
three brigades in rear of their baggage.

</p><p>
The result of what I have seen and heard concerning the enemy is, that they have encamped with 
their van a little beyond Monmouth Court-House, and 
their rear at Manalapan's River, about seven miles 
from this place. Their march to-day has been very 
judiciously conducted, their baggage in front and 
their flying army in the rear, with a rear-guard of 
one thousand men, about four hundred pas from 
the main body. To attack them in this situation, 
without being supported by the whole army, would 
be folly in the extreme. If it should be thought 
advisable to give the necessary support, the army 
can move to some position near the enemy's left 
flank, which would put them in a very awkward 
situation, with so respectable a body in their rear ; 
and it would put it out of their power to turn either 
flank, should they be so disposed. Their left is 
strongly posted, and I am told their right also. By 
some accounts, one part of his army lies on the road 
leading from the Monmouth road to South Amboy. 
It is not improbable that South Amboy may be the 
object. 
</p><p>
I had written thus far when your letter to the Marquis arrived. This puts the matter on a totally 
different footing. The detachment will march tomorrow morning, at three o clock, to <a href='/results.php?city=englishtown' rel='city'>Englishtown</a>. I

SIR, 
</p><p>
Inclosed I transmit your Excellency a letter from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague met'>Count D Estaing</a>. He has had the river sounded, and 
finds he cannot enter. He will sail for Rhode Island 
to-morrow evening ; in the mean time, he is making 
demonstrations to deceive the enemy, and beget an 
opinion that he intends to operate in this quarter. 
He would sail immediately, but he waits the arrival, 
or to hear, of a frigate which carried M. Gerard to 
Delaware, and which he appointed to meet him at 
Sandy Hook, so that he fears his sudden and unexpected departure, before she arrives, might cause her 
to be lost. He will not, however, wait longer than 
till to-morrow evening. We have agreed that five 
cannon, fired briskly, shall be a signal of his arrival 
by day, and the same number, with five sky-rockets,a signal by night. 
</p><p>
In communicating this to <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a>, the Count 
wishes not a moment may be lost, and that he may 
be directed to have persons stationed on the coast, 
and intermediate expresses to facilitate the communication between them. Pilots will be a material article. He begs every thing may be forwarded as much 
as possible, and as many troops collected as may be. 
He would be glad if a detachment could march from 
your army, or could be sent by water, for which purpose he would send covering ships and some vessels 
he has taken by way of transports ; but he cannot 
think of losing so much time as seems necessary. If 
the water scheme could shorten it, it would be a 
happy circumstance. He recommends it to your attention, and that you would take measures, if the end 
can be better answered in this way, and meet him with information of the part he may have to act to 
execute the plan. I perceive he can with difficulty 
debark four thousand troops, but he will try to do it. 
I am, Sir,

being myself the bearer of these particulars ; the end 
may be answered by letter. Mr. Neville is anxious 
to get on. I have just heard of despatches arrived 
from you ; I don t know but they may contain some 
thing new, which may make the Count wish a good 
conveyance to return an answer. My stay till to 
morrow morning may answer that end. I shall not 
delay coming forward.

SIR, 
</p><p>
I wrote to your Excellency, the evening of the 
20th, by Major Neville. I remained in the neighbourhood of Black Point till the afternoon following. 
The Count had received his expected despatches from 
Congress, and was to sail, as I mentioned before, the 
first fair wind. At Brunswick, yesterday, Mr. Caldwell joined me. He was immediately from the Point, 
and brought intelligence that the fleet got under 
way yesterday morning. The wind, unfortunately, 
has been much against them, which is so much the 
more to be regretted, as they are rather in want of 
water. I need not suggest to your Excellency that 
an essential part of the Rhode Island plan is, to take 
every possible measure to watch the enemy's motions, and to establish the expresses from place to 
place, to give the Count instant information of any 
movement among their fleet. This will enable him to be in time to intercept them, should they attempt 
to evacuate <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> while he is at Rhode Island, 
and will, in general, facilitate the intercourse and co 
operation between him and your Excellency. 
</p><p>
I have nothing new to communicate, besides what 
was sent by Major Neville, and what I now send. 
All the ideas interchanged between the Count and 
myself were such as were familiar before I left 
head-quarters. He was to go to Rhode Island, and, 
in conjunction with <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a>, endeavour to 
possess himself of the enemy's ships and troops there, 
if; on his arrival, he had good reason to think it 
could be effected without further assistance. If not, 
he will be glad of a reenforcement from you in the 
most expeditious manner possible. What manner you 
think will be most expeditious, you will adopt; and, 
if his aid may be useful, he will afford it as soon as 
he is informed of it. 
</p><p>
This being the case, my immediate presence at 
head-quarters is the less necessary, as to this business ; and I hope your Excellency will indulge me, 
if I do not make all the despatch back which a case 
of emergency would require, though I do not mean 
to delay more than a moderate attention to my frail 
constitution may make not improper.

DEAR SIR,

I duly received your letter of the 14th, and shall 
not fail, in conjunction with <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague'>General St. Clair</a>, to 
attend to the military object of it. I am much obliged to your Excellency for the communication of your southern advis. The enemy are still in the dark 
about their fleet and army gone that way, as we gather from the Commissioners. They pretend to 
have little European news, though a vessel arrived 
two or three days since from England, after ten 
weeks passage. We send you some late <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
papers. The Commission has been several days at an 
end. The enemy, as was supposed, had no idea of 
treating on national ground. We are now in private 
conversation, and so far not without hopes that the 
liberation of our prisoners will be effected on admissible terms. Two or three days more will probably put 
an end to the interview. <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague'>General St. Clair</a> and Colonel Carrington beg their respects may be presented 
to your Excellency. I have the honor to be, very 
respectfully and affectionately,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have seen the enemy. Those in view I calculate 
at about three thousand. There may be, and probably are, enough others out of sight. They have 
sent all their horse to the other side, except about 
fifty or sixty. Their baggage, it is agreed on all 
hands, has also been sent across, and their wounded. 
It is not ascertained that any of their infantry have 
passed to the other side. There are four or five 
hundred on the opposite point, but it is uncertain 
whether they are those who went from this side, or 
those who wore on Staten Island. I rather suppose 
the former. 
</p><p>
Different conjectures may be made. The present 
movement may be calculated to draw us down, and 
betray us into an action. They may have desisted 
from their intention of passing till night, for fear of 
our falling upon their rear. I believe this is the 
case, for, as they have but few boats, it would certainly be a delicate manoeuvre to cross in our face. 
</p><p>
We are taking measures to watch their motions 
to-night as closely as possible. An incessant, but 
very light skirmishing; very few boats, not more 
than enough to carry three or four hundred men 
at a time. It is likely more will come down this 
evening I have the honor to be

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I cannot forbear confessing, that I am astonished and alarmed 
beyond measure, to find that all his Excellency's views have been 
hitherto frustrated, and that no single step of those I mentioned 
to you has been taken to afford him the aid he absolutely stands 
in need of, and by delaying which, the cause of America is put 
to the utmost conceivable hard. 
</p><p>
I so fully explained to you the General's situation, that I could 
not entertain a doubt you would make it the first object of your attention to reenforce him with that speed the exigency of affairs 
demanded ; but, I am sorry to say, he will have too much reason 
to think other objects, in comparison with that insignificant, have 
been uppermost. I speak freely and emphatically, because I 
tremble at the consequences of the delay that has happened. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>General Clinton</a>'s reinforcement is probably by this time with 
Mr. Howe. This will give him a decisive superiority over our army. What may be the issue of such a state of things, I leave 
to the feelings of every friend to his country, capable of foreseeing consequences. My expressions may perhaps have more 
warmth than is altogether proper; but they proceed from the 
overflowing of my heart, in a matter where I conceive this Continent essentially interested. I wrote to you from <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, and desired you would send a thousand Continental troops of those first 
proposed to be left with you. This, I understand, has not been 
done. How the noncompliance can be answered to General 
<a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>, you can best determine. 
</p><p>
I now, Sir, in the most explicit terms, by his Excellency's 
authority, give it as a positive order from him, that all the Continental troops under your command may be immediately marched 
to King's Ferry, there to cross the river, and hasten to reenforce 
the army under him. 
</p><p>
The Massachusetts militia are to be detained instead of them, 
until the troops coming from the northward arrive. When they 
do, they will replace, as far as I am instructed, the troops you 
shall send away in consequence of this requisition. The General's idea of keeping troops this way does not extend farther than 
covering the country from any little irruptions of small parties, 
and carrying on the works necessary for the security of the 
river. As to attacking <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, that he thinks ought to be 
out of the question at present. If men could be spared from the 
other really necessary objects, he would have no objections to at 
tempting a diversion by way of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, but nothing farther. 
</p><p>
As the times of the Massachusetts and New Hampshire militia 
will soon expire, it will be proper to call in time for a reenforcement from Connecticut. <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a> will do all in his 
power, to promote objects in which the State lie commands in i&gt; 
so immediately concerned. Generals Glover's and Patterson's brigades are on their way down. The number of Continental troops 
necessary for this post will be furnished out of them. 
</p><p>
I cannot but have the fullest confidence you will use your utmost exertions to execute the business of this letter ; and I am, 
with great respect, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, 
</p><p>
