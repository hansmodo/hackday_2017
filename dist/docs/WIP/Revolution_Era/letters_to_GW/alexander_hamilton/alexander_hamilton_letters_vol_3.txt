</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I imagine your Excellency has been informed that, 
in consequence of the resolution of Congress for 
granting commissions to Aids-de-camp appointed under the former establishment, I have obtained one of 
Lieutenant-Colonel in the army of the United States, 
bearing rank since the 1st of March <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>. 
</p><p>
It is become necessary to me to apply to your 
Excellency to know in what manner j'-ou foresee you 
will be able to employ me in the ensuing campaign. 
I am ready to enter into activity whenever you 
think proper, though I am not anxious to do it till 
the army take the field, as, before that period, I perceive no object. Unconnected as I am with any regiment, I can have no other command than in a 
light corps, and I flatter myself my pretensions to 
this are good. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency knows I have been in actual service since the beginning of <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. I began in the 
line; and had I continued there, I ought, in justice, to 
have been more advanced in rank than I now am. 
I believe my conduct, in the different capacities in 
which I have acted, has appeared to the officers of 
the army in general such as to merit their confidence 
and esteem; and I cannot suppose them to be so ungenerous as not to see me with pleasure put into a 
situation still to exercise the disposition I have always had of being useful to the United States. 
</p><p>
I mention these things only to show that I do not 
apprehend the same difficulties can exist in my case 
(which is peculiar), that have opposed the appointment to commands, of some other officers not belono-ing to what is called the line. Though the light 
infantry is chiefly formed, yet being detached to the 
southward, I take it for granted there will be a vanguard by detachment formed for this army. I have 
the honor to be, very respectfully, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I am extremely sorry to have embarrassed you 
by my late application, and that you should think 
there are insuperable obstacles to a compliance with 
it. Having renounced my expectations, I have no 
other inducement for troubling your Excellency with 
a second letter, than to obviate the appearance of 
having desired a thing inconsistent with the good of 
the service, while I was acquainted with the circumstances which made it so. 
</p><p>
I was too interested a spectator of what happened 
in the case of Major Macpherson, not to have remarked and not to recollect all the circumstances. 
The opposition turned ostensibly on his being a Brevet Officer, yet having a command in a corps formed 
entirely from one line. The propriety of his being 
employed in a detachment from the army at large, 
so far as I remember, was not disputed. In delicacy 
to Major Macpherson, no personal objections were formally made ; but in reality they existed, and contributed to the discontent. It was thought a peculiar 
hardship, that a gentleman who had for a long time 
fought against us, and had not taken part with us 
till a late period, and when our affairs had assumed 
a more prosperous aspect, should he preferred in one 
of the most honorary commands of the service. Your 
Excellency must be convinced that I mention this in 
no other view than to show the sentiments of the 
officers at the time, and the whole grounds of the 
opposition. My esteem for Major Macpherson, and 
other reasons, make it impossible I can have a different intention. 
</p><p>
I know less of the motives of dissatisfaction in the 
cases of Colonel Gimat and Major Gal van; but I have 
understood that it is founded on their being appointed in the light corps for two successive campaigns. 
</p><p>
It would be uncandid in me not to acknowledge 
that I believe a disposition to exclude Brevet Officers, in general, from command, has a great share in 
the opposition in every instance, and that, so far, it 
affects my case. But, at the same time, it appears 
to me, this principle, alone, can never be productive 
of more than momentary murmurs, when it is not 
seconded by some plausible pretext. I also am convinced that the Pennsvlvania officers, for their own 
sakes, repented the rash steps the} had taken, and, 
on cool reflection, were happy in an opportunity 
to relinquish their menaces of quitting a service to 
which they were attached by habit, inclination, and 
interest, as well as by patriotism. I believe, too, we 
shall never have a similar instance in the army, unless the practice should be carried to excess. Major Galvan, I am told, will probably be relieved. Colonel Gimat will then be the only Brevet Officer remaining 
in command. Your Excellency is the best judge of the proper limits ; and there can be no doubt that 
the rights of particular officers ought to give place 
to the general good and tranquillity of the service. 
</p><p>
I cannot forbear repeating that my case is peculiar, and dissimilar to all the former. It is distinguished by the circumstances I have before intimated. My early entrance into the service ; my 
Laying made the campaign of <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>, the most disagreeable of the war, at the head of a company of 
artillery, and having been entitled, in that corps, to 
a rank equal in degree, more ancient in date, than I 
now possess ; my having made all the subsequent campaigns in the family of the Commander-in-chief, in a 
constant course of laborious and important service; â€” 
these are my pretensions, at this advanced period of 
the war, to being employed in the only way which 
my situation admits ; and I imagine they would have 
been weighty in the minds of the officers in general. 
I only urge them, a second time, as reasons which 
will not suffer me to view the matter in the same 
light with your Excellency, or to regard as impracticable my appointment in a light corps, should there 
be one formed. I entreat they may be understood 
in this sense only. I am incapable of wishing to 
obtain any object by importunity. 
</p><p>
I assure your Excellency that I am too well persuaded of your candor, to attribute your refusal to 
any other cause than an apprehension of inconveniences that may attend the appointment. I have the 
honor to be, with perfect respect, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=alh" rel="me">Alexander Hamilton</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I have used the term Brevet in the sense 
your Excellency appears to have understood it, as signifying, in general, all officers not attached to any 
established corps. Congress seem, however, to have 
made a distinction ; they only give a kind of warrant to those whom they designate as Brevet Officers. 
Mine is a regular commission.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I need not observe to your Excellency, that respect for the opinion of Congress will not permit me 
to be indifferent to the impressions they may receive 
of my conduct. On this principle, though I do not 
think the subject of the inclosed letter of sufficient 
importance to request an official communication of it. 
yet I should be happy it might in some way be 
known to the members of that honorable body. 
</p><p>
Should they hereafter learn that, though retained on the list of their officers, I am not in the execution of 
the duties of my station, I wish them to be sensible that it is not a diminution of zeal which induces me 
voluntarily to withdraw my services, but that I only refrain from intruding them, when circumstances seem 
to have made them either not necessary or not desired, and that I shall not receive emoluments without performing the conditions to which they were 
annexed. I also wish them to be apprised upon what 
footing my future continuance in the army is placed, 
that they may judge how far it is expedient to permit it. I therefore take the liberty to request the 
favor of your Excellency to impart the knowledge of 
my situation in such manner as you think most convenient. I have the honor to be, with perfect respect, your Excellency's 
</p><p>

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will, I am persuaded, readily admit the force of this sentiment, that though it is the 
duty of a good citizen to devote his services to the 
public, when it has occasion for them, he cannot, 
with propriety or delicacy to himself, obtrude them, 
when it either has, or appears to have, none. The 
difficulties I experienced last campaign in obtaining a command, will not suffer me to make any further 
application on that head. 
</p><p>
As I have many reasons to consider my being employed hereafter in a precarious light, the bare possibility of rendering an equivalent will not justify to 
my scruples the receiving any future emoluments 
from my commission. I therefore renounce, from this 
time, all claim to the compensations attached to my 
military station during the war, or after it. But I 
have motives which will not permit me to resolve on 
a total resignation. I sincerely hope a prosperous 
train of affairs may continue to make it no inconvenience to decline the services of persons whose zeal, 
in worse times, was found not altogether useless; but, 
as the most promising appearances are often reversed 
by unforeseen disasters, and as unfortunate events 
may again make the same zeal of some value, I am 
unwilling to put it out of my power to renew my 
exertions in the common cause in the line in which 
I have hitherto acted. I shall accordingly retain my 
rank while I am permitted to do it, and take this 
opportunity to declare, that I shall be at all times 
[ready] to obey the call of the public, in any capacity, civil or military (consistent with what I owe to 
myself), in which there may be a prospect of my 
contributing to the final attainment of the object for 
which I embarked in the service. I have the honor 
to be, very respectfully.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Some time last fall, when I spoke to your Excellency about going to the southward, I explained to 
you candidly my feelings with respect to military 
reputation, and how much it was my object to act a 
conspicuous part in some enterprise that might perhaps raise my character as a soldier above mediocrity. You were so good as to say you would be 
glad to furnish me with an occasion. When the expedition to Staten Island was on foot, a favorable 
one seemed to offer. There was a battalion without 
a Field-Officer, the command of which I thought, as 
it was accidental, might be given to me without inconvenience. I made an application for it through 
the Marquis, who informed me of your refusal, on two 
principles ; one, that giving me a whole battalion 
might be a subject of dissatisfaction ; the other, that, 
if an accident should happen to me in the present 
state of your family, you would be embarrassed for 
the necessary assistance. 
</p><p>
The project you now have in contemplation, affords 
another opportunity. I have a variety of reasons 
that press me to desire ardently to have it in my 
power to improve it. I take the liberty to observe 
that the command may now be proportioned to my 
rank, and that the second objection ceases to operate, 
as, during the period of establishing our winter-quarters, there will be a suspension of material business; 
besides which, my peculiar situation will, in any case, 
call me away from the army in a few days, and Mr. 
Harrison may be expected back early next month. 
</p><p>
My command may consist of an hundred and fifty 
or two hundred men, composed of fifty men of Major 
Gibbs's corps, fifty from Colonel Meigs's regiment, 
and fifty or an hundred more from the light infantry; Major Gibbs to be my Major. The hundred 
men from here may move on Friday morning towards 
, which will strengthen the appearances for 
Staten Island, to form a junction on the other side 
of the Passaic. 
</p><p>
I suggest this mode to avoid the complaints that 
might arise from composing my party wholly of the 
light infantry, which might give umbrage to the officers of that corps, who, on this plan, can have no 
just subject for it. 
</p><p>
The primary idea may be, if circumstances permit, to attempt, with my detachment, Bayard's Hill. 
Should we arrive early enough to undertake it, I 
should prefer it to any thing else, both for the brilliancy of the attempt, in itself, and the decisive consequences of which its success would be productive. 
If we arrive too late to make this eligible (as there 
is reason to apprehend), my corps may form the van 
of one of the other attacks; and Bayard's Hill will 
be a pretext for my being employed in the affair, on 
a supposition of my knowing the ground; which is 
partly true. 
</p><p>
I flatter myself, also, that my military character 
stands so well in the army as to reconcile the officers in general to the measure. All circumstances 
considered, I venture to say, any exception which 
might be taken would he unreasonable. 
</p><p>
I take this method of making the request, to avoid 
the embarrassment of a personal explanation. I shall 
only add, that, however much I have the matter at 
heart, I wish your Excellency entirely to consult your 
own inclination, and not, from a disposition to oblige 
me, to do any thing that may be disagreeable to you. 
It will, nevertheless, make me peculiarly happy if 
your wishes correspond with mine. I have the honor 
to be, very sincerely and respectfully.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
Flattering myself that your knowledge of me will 
induce you to receive the observations I make, as 
dictated by a regard to the public good, I take the 
liberty to suggest to you my ideas on some matters 
of delicacy and importance. I view the present juncture as a very interesting one. I need not observe 
how far the temper and situation of the army may 
make it so. The state of our finances was perhaps 
never more critical. I am under injunctions, which 
will not permit me to disclose some facts that would 
at once demonstrate this position; but I think it probable you will be possessed of them through another 
channel. It is, however, certain that there has scarcely 
been a period of the revolution which called more for from the State of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, on the 25th of November, <a href='/results.php?year=1782'>1782</a>. 
wisdom and decision in Congress. Unfortunately for 
us, we are a body not governed by reason or foresight, but by circumstances. It is probable we shall 
not take the proper measures; and, if we do not, a 
few months may open an embarrassing scene. This 
will be the case, whether we have peace or a continuance of the war. 
</p><p>
If the war continues, it would seem that the army 
must, in June, subsist itself to defend the country. If 
peace should take place, it will subsist itself to procure justice to itself. It appears to be a prevailing 
opinion in the army, that the disposition to recompense their services will cease with the necessity for 
them ; and that, if they once lay down their arms, 
they part with the means of obtaining justice. It is 
to be lamented that appearances afford too much 
ground for their distrust. 
</p><p>
It becomes a serious inquiry, What is the true line 
of policy ? The claims of the army, urged with moderation, but with firmness, may operate on those 
weak minds which are influenced by their apprehensions more than by their judgments, so as to produce 
a concurrence in the measures which the exigencies 
of affairs demand. They may add weight to the applications of Congress to the several States. So far 
a useful turn may be given to them. But the difficulty will be to keep a complaining and suffering 
army within the bounds of moderation. 
</p><p>
This your Excellency's influence must effect. In 
order to it, it will be advisable not to discountenance 
their endeavour to procure redress, but rather, by the 
intervention of confidential and prudent persons, to 
take the direction of them. This, however, must not 
appear; it is of moment to the public tranquillity 
that your Excellency should preserve the confidence of the army without losing that of the people. This 
will enable you, in case of extremity, to guide the 
torrent, and to bring order, perhaps even good, out 
of confusion. It is a part that requires address, but 
it is one which your own situation as well as the 
welfare of the community points out. 
</p><p>
I will not conceal from your Excellency a truth, 
which it is necessary you should know. An idea is 
propagated in the army, that delicacy, carried to an 
extreme, prevents your espousing its interests with 
sufficient warmth. The falsehood of this opinion no 
one can be better acquainted with than myself; but 
it is not the less mischievous for being false. Its 
tendency is to impair that influence which you may 
exert with advantage, should any commotions unhappily ensue, to moderate the pretensions of the army, 
and make their conduct correspond with their duty. 
</p><p>
The great desideratum at present is the establishment of general funds, which alone can do justice to 
the creditors of the United States (of whom the array 
forms the most meritorious class), restore public credit, and supply the future wants of Government. 
This is the object of all men of sense ; in this the 
influence of the army, properly directed, may cooperate. 
</p><p>
The intimations I have thrown out will suffice to 
give your Excellency a proper conception of my sentiments. You will judge of their reasonableness or 
fallacy ; but I persuade myself you will do justice to 
my motives. I have the honor to be, with great respect. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=alh" rel="me">Alexander Hamilton</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. <a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='colleague'>General Knox</a> has the confidence of the army, and is a man of sense. I think he may be 
safely made use of Situated as I am, your Excellency will feel the confidential nature of these observations.
