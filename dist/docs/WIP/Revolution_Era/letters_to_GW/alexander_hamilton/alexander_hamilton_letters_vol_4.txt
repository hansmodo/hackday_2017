</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I am duly honored with your Excellency's letters 
of the 4th and 12th instant. It is much to be regretted, though not to be wondered at, that steps of 
so inflammable a tendency have been taken in the 
army. Your Excellency, in my opinion, has acted 
wisely. The best way is ever, not to attempt to 
stem the torrent, but to direct it. I am happy to 
find you coincide in opinion with me on the conduct 
proper to be observed by yourself I am persuaded, 
more and more, it is that which is most consistent 
with your own reputation and the public welfare. 
</p><p>
Our affairs wear a most serious aspect, as well foreign as domestic. Before this gets to hand, your 
Excellency will probably have seen the Provisional 
Articles between Great Britain and these States. 
</p><p>
It might, at first appearance, be concluded that they 
will be the prelude to a general peace. But there 
are strong reasons to doubt the truth of such a conclusion. Obstacles may arise from different quarters; 
from the demands of Spain and Holland; from the 
hope in France of greater acquisitions in the East; 
perhaps still more probably from the insincerity and 
duplicity of Lord Shelburne, whose politics, founded 
in the peculiarity of his situation, as well as in the 
character of the man, may w^ell be suspected of insidiousness. I am really apprehensive, if peace does 
not take place, that the negotiations will tend to sow 
distrusts among the allies, and weaken the force of 
the Common League. We have, I fear, men among 
us, and men in trust, who have a hankering after 
British connection. We have others, whose confidence 
in France savors of credulity. The intrigues of the 
former, and the incautiousness of the Latter, may be 
both, though in different degrees, injurious to American interests, and make it difficult for prudent men 
to steer a proper course. 
</p><p>
There are delicate circumstances with respect to the 
late foreign transactions, which I am not at liberty to 
reveal, but which, joined to our internal weaknesses, 
disorders, follies and prejudices, make this country 
stand upon precarious ground. Some use may be 
made of these ideas, to induce moderation in the 
army. An opinion that the country does not stand 
upon a secure footing, will operate upon the patriot> 
ism of the officers against hazarding any domestic 
commotions. 
</p><p>
While I make these observations, I cannot forbear adding that, if no excesses take place, I shall not be 
sorry that ill humors have appeared. I shall not regret imjjortimit?/, if temperate, from the army. 
</p><p>
There are good intentions in the majority of Congress, but there is not sufficient wisdom or decision. There are dangerous prejudices, in the particular States, opposed to those measures which alone 
can give stability and prosperity to the Union. There 
is a fatal opposition to Continental views. Necessity 
alone can work a reform. But how produce this necessity; how apply it; how keep it within salutary 
bounds ? I fear we have been contending for a shadow. 
</p><p>
The affair of accounts I considered as having been 
put on a satisfactory footing. The particular States 
have been required to settle till the 1st of August, 
<a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>; and the Superintendent of Finance has been 
directed to take measures for settling since that period. I shall immediately see him on the subject. 
We have had eight and a half States in favor of 
a commutation of half-pay for an average of ten 
years' purchase; that is, five years full pay, instead 
of half-pay for life, which, on a calculation of annuities, is nearly an equivalent. I hope this will now 
shortly take place. We have made considerable progress in a plan, to be recommended to the several 
States, for funding all the public debts, including 
those of the army; which is certainly the only way 
to restore further credit, and enable us to continue 
the war by borrowing abroad, if it should be necessary to continue it. 
</p><p>
I omitted mentioning to your Excellency, that, from 
European intelligence, there is great reason to believe, at all events, peace or war, <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> will be 
vacated in the spring. It will be a pity if any domestic disturbances should change the plans of the 
British Court. I have the honor to be, with the 
greatest respect and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=alh" rel="me">Alexander Hamilton</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. Your Excellency mentions, that it has been 
surmised the plan in agitation was formed in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> ; that combinations have been talked of between the public creditors and the army ; and that 
members of Congress had encouraged the idea. This 
is partly true. I have myself urged on Congress the 
propriety of uniting the influence of the public creditors, and the army as a part of them, to prevail 
upon the States to enter into their views. I have 
expressed the same sentiments out of doors. Several 
other members have done the same. The meaning, 
however, of all this, was simply that Congress should 
adopt such a plan as would embrace the relief of all the public creditors, including the army, in order that 
the personal influence of some, the connections of 
others, and a sense of justice to the army, as well as 
the apprehension of ill consequences, might form a 
mass of influence on each State in favor of the measures of Congress. In this view, as I mentioned to 
your Excellency in a former letter, I thought the 
discontents of the army might he turned to a good 
account. I am still of opinion, that their earnest, 
but respectful applications for redress will have a 
good effect. 
</p><p>
As to any combination of force, it could only be 
productive of the horrors of a civil war, might end 
in the ruin of the country, and would certainly end 
in the ruin of the army.

</p><p>
Sir, 
I wrote to your Excellency a day or two ago by 
express. Since that, a Committee, appointed on the 
communications from you, have had a meeting, and 
find themselves embarrassed. They have requested 
me to communicate our embarrassments to you in 
confidence, and to ask your private opinion. The army, by their resolutions, express an expectation that 
Congress will not disband them previous to a settlement of accounts, and the establishment of funds. 
Congress may resolve upon the first, but the General opinion is that they cannot constitutionally declare 
the second. They have no right by the Confederation to demand funds ; they can only recommend ; and 
to determine that the army shall be continued in service till the States grant them, would be to determine 
that the whole present army shall be a standing army during peace, unless the States comply with the 
requisitions for funds. This, it is supposed, would 
excite the alarms and jealousies of the States, and 
increase rather than lessen the opposition to the funding scheme. 
</p><p>
It is also observed, that the longer the army is 
kept together the more the payment of past dues is 
procrastinated, the abilities of the States being exhausted for their immediate support, and a new debt 
every day incurred. It is further suggested, that 
there is danger in keeping the army together in a 
state of inactivity, and that a separation of the several lines would facilitate the settlement of accounts, 
diminish present expense, and avoid the danger of 
union. It is added, that the officers of each line, 
being on the spot, might, by their own solicitations, 
and those of their friends, forward the adoption of 
funds in the different States. 
</p><p>
A proposition will be transmitted to you by Colonel Bland, in the form of a resolution to be adopted 
by Congress, framed upon the principles of the foregoing reasoning. Another proposition is contained in 
the following resolution ; — 
</p><p>
" That the Commander-in-chief be informed, it is the 
intention of Congress to effect the settlement of the 
accounts of the respective lines, previous to their reduction ; and that Congress are doing, and will continue to do, every thing in their power towards procuring satisfactory securities for what shall be found 
due on such settlement." 
</p><p>
The scope of this, your Excellency will perceive 
without comment. I am to request you will favor me with your sentiments on both the propositions, and, 
in general, with your ideas of what had best be done 
with reference to the expectation expressed by the 
officers; taking into view the situation of Congress. 
On one side, the army expect they will not be disbanded till accounts are settled, and funds established. 
On the other hand, they have no constitutional power 
of doing any thing more than to recommend funds ; 
and are persuaded that these will meet with mountains of prejudice in some of the States. 
</p><p>
A considerable progress has been made in a plan 
for funding the public debts ; and it is to be hoped 
it will ere long go forth to the States, with every 
argument that can give it success. I have the honor 
to be, with sincere respect. 
</p><p>

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
The inclosed I write more in a public than in a 
private capacity. Here I write as a citizen zealous 
for the true happiness of this country; as a soldier, 
who feels what is due to an army which has suffered 
every thing, and done much for the safety of America. 
</p><p>
I sincerely wish ingratitude was not so natural to 
the human heart as it is. I sincerely wish there 
were no seeds of it in those who direct the counsels 
of the United States. But while I urge the army 
to moderation, and advise your Excellency to take 
the direction of their discontents, and endeavour to 
confine them within the bounds of duty, I cannot, as 
an honest man, conceal from you, that I am afraid 
their distrust has too much foundation. Republican 
jealousy has in it a principle of hostility to an arm}', 
whatever be their merits, whatever be their claims to 
the gratitude of the community. It acknowledges 
their services with unwillingness, and rewards them 
with reluctance. I see this temper, though smothered 
with great care, involuntarily breaking out upon too 
many occasions. I often feel a mortification, which 
it would be impolitic to express, that sets my passions at variance with my reason. Too many, I perceive, if they could do it with safety or color, would 
be glad to elude the just pretensions of the army. I 
hope this is not the prevailing disposition. 
</p><p>
But, supposing the country ungrateful, what can 
the army do? It must submit to its hard fate. To 
seek redress by its arms, would end in its ruin. The 
army would moulder by its own weight, and for want 
of the means of keeping together; the soldiery would 
abandon their officers ; there would be no chance of 
success, without having recourse to means that would 
reverse our revolution. I make these observations, 
not that I imagine your Excellency can want motives 
to continue your influence in the path of moderation, 
but merely to show why I cannot myself enter into 
the views of coercion, which some gentlemen entertain ; for, I confess, could force avail, I should almost wish to see it employed. I have an indifferent 
opinion of the honesty of this country, and ill forebodings as to its future system. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will perceive I have written with 
sensations of chagrin, and will make allowance for 
coloring ; but the general picture is too true. God 
send us all more wisdom! I am, very sincerely and 
respectfully, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received your Excellency's letters of the 
31st of March, and 4th of April ; the last, to-day. The 
one to Colonel Bland, as member of the Committee, 
has been read in Committee confidentially, and gave 
great satisfaction. The idea of not attempting to separate the army before the settlement of accounts, 
corresponds with my proposition. That of endeavouring to let them have some pay, has also appeared to 
me indispensable. The expectations of the army, as 
represented by your Excellency, are moderation itself 
To-morrow we confer with the Superintendent of Finance on the subject of money. There will be difficulty ; but not, we hope, insurmountable. 
</p><p>
I thank your Excellency for the hints you are so obliging as to give me in your private letter. I do 
not wonder at the suspicions that have been infused ; 
</p><p>
n or should I be surprised to hear that I have been 
pointed out as one of the persons concerned in playing the game described. But foots must speak for 
themselves. The gentlemen, who "were here from the army, <a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel='colleague'>General McDougall</a>, who is still here, will be 
able to give a true account of those who have supported the just claims of the army, and of those who have endeavoured to elude them. 
</p><p>
There are two classes of men, Sir, in Congress, of 
very different views ; one attached to State, the other 
to Continental politics. The last have been strenuous 
advocates for funding the public debt upon solid securities ', the former have given every opposition in 
their power, and have only been dragged into the 
measures, which are now near being adopted, by the 
clamors of the army and other public creditors. 
The advocates for Continental funds have blended the 
interests of the army with other creditors, from a conviction that no funds, for partial purposes, will go 
through those States to whose citizens the United 
States are largely indebted ; or, if they should be 
carried through, from impressions of the moment, 
would have the necessary stability ; for the influence 
of those unprovided for would always militate against 
a provision for others, in exclusion of them. It is in 
vain to tell men, who have parted with a large part 
of their property on the public faith, that the services of the army are entitled to a preference. They 
would reason from their interest and their feelings. These would tell them, that they had as great a title 
as any other class of the community to public justice ; and that, while this was denied to them, it would be unreasonable to make them bear their part of the 
burden for the benefit of others. This is the way they would reason ; and as their influence in some of the 
States was considerable; they M'onlcl have been able to prevent any partial provision. 
</p><p>
But the question was not merely how to do justice 
to the creditors, hut how to restore public credit. 
Taxation in this country, it was found, could not supply a sixth part of the public necessities. The loans 
in Europe were far short of the balance, and the prospect every day diminishing; the Court of France telling us, in plain terms, she could not even do as 
much as she had done ; individuals in Holland, and 
everywhere else, refusing to part with their money, 
on the precarious tenure of the mere faith of this 
country, without any pledge for the payment either 
of principal or interest. 
</p><p>
In this situation, what was to be done ? It was 
essential to our cause that vigorous efforts should be 
made to restore public credit ; it was necessary to 
combine all the motives to this end, that could operate upon different descriptions of persons in the different States. The necessity and discontents of the 
army presented themselves as a powerful engine. 
</p><p>
But, Sir, these gentlemen would be puzzled to support their insinuations by a single fact. It was, indeed, proposed to appropriate the intended impost 
on trade to the army debt, and, what was extraordinary, by gentlemen who had expressed their dislike 
to the principle of the fund. I acknowledge I was 
one that opposed this ; for the reasons already assigned, and for these additional ones. That was the 
fund on which we most counted. To obtain further 
loans in Europe, it was necessary we should have a 
fund sufficient to pay the interest of what had been 
borrowed and what was to be borrowed. The truth 
was, these people, in this instance, wanted to play off 
the army against the funding system. 
As to <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague'>Mr. Morris</a>, I will give your Excellency a 
true explanation of his conduct. He had been, for 
some time, pressing Congress to endeavour to obtain 
funds, and had found a great backwardness in the 
business. He found the taxes unproductive in the 
different States ; he found the loans in Europe making a very slow progress ; he found himself pressed, 
on all hands, for supplies ; he found himself, in short, 
reduced to this alternative, either of making engagements which he could not fulfil, or declaring his resignation in case funds were not established by a 
given time. 
</p><p>
Had he followed the first course, the bubble must 
soon have burst ; he must have sacrificed his credit 
and his character ; and public credit, already in a 
ruined condition, must have lost its last support. He 
wisely judged it better to resign. This might increase 
the embarrassments of the moment, but the necessity 
of the case, it was to be hoped, would produce the 
proper measures ; and he might then resume the direction of the machine with advantage and success. 
He also had some hope that his resignation would 
prove a stimulus to Congress. 
</p><p>
He was, however, ill-advised in the publication of 
his letter of resignation. This was an imprudent 
step, and has given .a handle to his personal enemies, 
who, by playing upon the passions of others, have 
drawn some well-meaning men into the cry against 
him. But <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague'>Mr. Morris</a> certainly deserves a great deal 
from his country. I believe no man in this country, 
but himself, could have kept the money machine a-going during the period he has been in office. From 
every thing that appears, his administration has been 
upright, as well as able. 
</p><p>
The truth is, the old leaven of <a href='/results.php?tla=sid' rel='colleague'>Deane</a> and Lee is, 
at this day, working against <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague'>Mr. Morris</a>. He happened, in that dispute, to have been on the side of 
<a href='/results.php?tla=sid' rel='colleague'>Deane</a>, and certain men can never forgive him. A 
man, whom I once esteemed, and whom I will rather 
suppose duped than wicked, is the second actor in 
this business. 
</p><p>
The matter, with respect to the army, which has 
occasioned most altercation in Congress, and most dissatisfaction in the army, has been the half-pay. The 
opinions on this head have been two. One party was 
for referring the several lines to their States, to make 
commutation as they should think proper; the other, 
for making the commutation by Congress, and funding 
it on Continental security. I was of this last opinion, 
and so were all those who will be represented as 
having made use of the army as puppets. Our principal reasons were, — first, by referring the lines to 
their respective States, those who were opposed to 
the half-pay would have taken advantage of the officers' necessities to make the commutation far short 
of an equivalent ; secondly, the inequality which would 
have arisen in the different States, when the officers 
came to compare (as has happened in other cases), 
would have been a new source of discontent; thirdly, 
such a reference was a continuance of the old wretched State system, by which the ties between Congress 
and the army have been nearly dissolved, by which 
the resources of the States have been diverted from 
the common treasury, and wasted ; a system which 
your Excellency has often justly reprobated. 
</p><p>
I have gone into the details, to give you a just 
idea of the parties in Congress. I assure you, upon 
my honor. Sir, I have given you a candid state of 
facts, to the best of my judgment. The men against 
whom the suspicions you mention must be directed. 
are, in general, the most sensible, the most liberal, 
the most independent, and the most respectable, characters in our body, as well as the most unequivocal 
friends to the army. In a word, they are the men 
who think Continentally. I have the honor to be, with 
sincere respect and esteem. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=alh" rel="me">Alexander Hamilton</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. I am Chairman of a Committee for Peace 
Arrangements. We shall ask your Excellency's opinion at large, on a proper military peace establishment. I will just hint to your Excellency that our 
prejudices will make us wish to keep up as few 
troops as possible. 
</p><p>
We this moment learn an officer is arrived from Sir Guy Carleton, with despatches; probably, official accounts of peace.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
There are two resolutions passed, relative to the 
restoration of the British prisoners, and to making 
arrangements for the surrender of the posts in the 
possession of the British troops ; the first of which is 
to be transacted by you in conjunction with the Secretary of War, the latter by yourself alone. I will 
explain to you some doubts which have arisen in 
Congress, with regard to the true construction of the 
provisional treaty, which may be of use to you in 
transacting the business above mentioned. 
</p><p>
The sixth article declares that there shall be no future confiscation, &c., after the ratification of the treaty in America ; and the seventh article makes the 
surrender of prisoners, evacuation of posts, cessation of hostilities, &c., to depend on that event, to wit, the ratification of the treaty in America. Now the doubt 
is, whether the treaty means the provisional treaty already concluded, or the definitive treaty to he concluded. The last construction is most agreeable to the 
letter of the provisional articles ; the former, most 
agreeable to the usual practice of nations; for hostilities commonly cease on the ratification of the preliminary treaty. There is a great diversity of opinion in Congress. It will be, in my opinion, advisable, at the same time that we do not communicate 
our doubts to the British, to extract their sense of the matter from them. 
</p><p>
This may be done by asking them at what period 
they are willing to stipulate the surrender of posts, 
at the same time that they are asked in what manner it will be most convenient to them to receive 
the prisoners. 
</p><p>
If they postpone the evacuation 'of the different 
posts to the definitive treaty, we shall then be justified in doing the same with respect to prisoners. The 
question will then arise, whether, on principles of 
humanity, economy, and liberality, we ought not to 
restore the prisoners at all events, without delay. 
Much may be said on both sides. I doubt the expedience of a total restoration of prisoners, until they 
are willing to fix the epochs at which they will take 
leave of us. It will add considerably to their strength; 
and accidents, though improbable, may happen. I confess, however, I am not clear in my opinion. I have 
the honor to be. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=alh" rel="me">Alexander Hamilton</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. The provisional or preliminary treaty is ratified by us, for the greater caution.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Major Fairly is just setting out on a visit to you; 
I believe, on some business relating to the <a href='/results.php?city=cincinnati' rel='city'>Cincinnati</a>. 
The Society of this State met some short time since, 
and took into consideration the proposed alterations 
in the original frame of the Institution. Some were 
strenuous for adhering to the old Constitution, a few 
for adopting the new, and many for a middle line. 
This disagreement of opinion, and the consideration 
that the different State Societies pursuing different 
courses, some adopting the alterations entire, others rejecting them in the same way, others adopting in 
part and rejecting in part, might beget confusion and 
defeat good purposes, — induced a proposal, which was 
unanimously agreed to, that a Committee should be 
appointed to prepare and lay before the Society a 
circular letter, expressive of the sense of the Society 
on the different alterations proposed, and recommending the giving powers to a general meeting of the 
<a href='/results.php?city=cincinnati' rel='city'>Cincinnati</a> to make such alterations as might be thought 
advisable, to obviate objections and promote the interests of the Society. I believe there will be no difficulty in agreeing to change the present mode of continuing the Society; but it appears to be the wish of 
our members, that some other mode may be defined 
and substituted, and that it might not be left to the 
uncertainty of legislative provision. We object, too, 
to putting the funds under legislative direction. Indeed, it appears to us, the Legislatures will not, at 
present, be inclined to give us any sanction. 
</p><p>
I am of the Committee, and I cannot but flatter 
myself that, when the object is better digested and 
more fully explained, it will meet your approbation. 
</p><p>
The poor Baron is still soliciting Congress, and has 
every prospect of indigence before him. He has his 
imprudences ; but, upon the whole, he has rendered 
valuable services ; and his merits, and the reputation 
of the country, alike demand that he should not be 
left to suffer want. If there could be any mode by 
which your influence could be employed in his favor, 
by writing to your friends in Congress, or otherwise, 
the Baron and his friends would be under great obligations to you. I have the honor to be, with sincere 
esteem.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
In my passage through the Jerseys, and since my 
arrival here, I have taken particular pains to discover 
the public sentiment; and I am more and more convinced that this is the critical opportunity for establishing the prosperity of this country on a solid 
foundation. I have conversed with men of information, not only of this city, but from different parts of 
the State ; and they agree that there has been an 
astonishing revolution for the better in the minds of 
the people. 
</p><p>
The prevailing apprehension among thinking men 
is, that the Convention, from the fear of shocking the 
popular opinion, will not go far enough. They seem 
to be convinced, that a strong, well-mounted Government, will better suit the popular palate, than one of 
a different complexion. Men in office are, indeed, 
taking all possible pains to give an unfavorable impression of the Convention ; but the current seems to 
be moving strongly the other way. A plain, but sensible man, in a conversation I had with him yesterday, expressed himself nearly in this manner ; — The 
people begin to be convinced that "their excellent 
form of Government," as they have been used to call 
it, will not answer their purpose, and that they must 
substitute something not very remote from that which 
they have lately quitted. 
</p><p>
These appearances, though they will not warrant 
a conclusion that the people are yet ripe for such a 
plan as I advocate, yet serve to prove that there is 
no reason to despair of their adopting one equally 
energetic, if the Convention should think proper to 
propose it. They serve to prove, that we ought not 
to allow too much weight to objections drawn from 
the supposed repugnance of the people to an efficient 
Constitution. I confess, I am more and more inclined 
to believe, that former habits of thinking are regaining their influence with more rapidity than is generally imagined. 
</p><p>
Not having compared ideas with you. Sir, I cannot 
judge how far our sentiments agree ; but, as I persuade myself, the genuineness of my representations 
will receive credit with you. My anxiety for the 
event of the deliberations of the Convention, induces 
me to make this communication of what appears to 
be the tendency of the public mind. I own to you, 
Sir, that I am seriously and deeply distressed at the 
aspect of the counsels, which prevailed when I left 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. I fear that we shall let slip the golden 
opportunity of rescuing the American Empire from 
disunion, anarchy, and misery. No motley or feeble 
measure can answer the end, or will finally receive 
the public support. Decision is true wisdom, and 
will not be less reputable to the Convention, than 
salutary to the community. 
</p><p>
I shall of necessity remain here ten or twelve days. 
If I have reason to believe that my attendance at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> will not be mere waste of time, I shall, 
after that period, rejoin the Convention.

I am much obliged to your Excellency for the explicit manner in which you contradict the insinuations 
mentioned in my last letter. The only use I shall 
make of your answer, will he to put it into the hands 
of a few friends. 
</p><p>
The Constitution proposed has, in this State, warm 
friends and warm enemies. The first impressions 
every where are in its favor; but the artillery of its 
opponents makes some impression. The event cannot 
yet be foreseen. The inclosed is the first number of 
a series of papers to be written in its defence. 
</p><p>
I send you also, at the request of the <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron De Steuben</a>, a printed pamphlet, containing the grounds of 
an application lately made to Congress. He tells me 
there is some reference to you, the object of which he 
does not himself seem clearly to understand; but imagines it may be in your power to be of service to 
him. There are public considerations that induce me 
to be somewhat anxious for his success. He is fortified with materials which, in Europe, could not fail to 
establish the belief of the contract he alleges. The 
documents of service he possesses are of a nature to 
convey an exalted idea of them. The compensations 
he has received, though considerable, if compared 
with those which have been received by American 
officers, will, according to European ideas, be very 
scanty in application to a stranger who is acknowledged to have rendered essential services. Our reputation abroad is not, at present, too high. To dismiss an old soldier, empty and hungry, to seek the 
bounty of those on whom he has no claims, and to complain of unkind returns and violated engagements, 
will certainly not tend to raise it. I confess, too, 
there is something in my feelings which would incline 
me, in this case, to go farther than might be strictly 
necessary, rather than drive a man, at the Baron's 
time of life, who has been a faithful servant, to extremities. And this is unavoidable, if he does not 
succeed in his present attempt. What he asks would, 
all calculations made, terminate in this, — an allowance 
of his five hundred and fifty guineas a year. He 
only wishes a recognition of the contract. He knows 
that, until affairs mend, no money can be produced. 
I do not know how far it may be in your power 
to do him any good ; but I shall be mistaken if the 
considerations I have mentioned do not appear to 
your Excellency to have some weight. I remain, 
with great respect and esteem, 
</p><p>

Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor of receiving your letter of the 
10th instant, by the last post. It is certainly very 
possible, that motives different from the one avowed, 
may have produced a certain communication ; and in 
matters of such a nature, it is not only allowable, 
but the dictate of prudence, to receive suggestions 
with peculiar caution. 
</p><p>
A British packet arrived yesterday. The accounts 
she brings are all of a warlike aspect. I have extracted from an English paper the inclosed decree of 
the National Assembly of France, which, though of a 
qualified tenor, looks pretty directly towards the 
eventual supporting of Spain. The English papers 
hold it up as a decisive indication of a disposition to 
do so. And it is said, in some of the letters which 
have been received, that positive orders have been 
sent to Lord Howe to fight, if he can find an opportunity. The papers announce a second fleet of fifteen 
sail of the line, ready to rendezvous at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, 
to be under the command of Admiral Hood; their 
destination unknown. It is also mentioned, that the 
Dutch fleet had returned to the Texel, the Duke of 
Leeds having previously made a journey for an interview with the Dutch Admiral. This very mysterious circumstance is wholly unexplained. 
</p><p>
A certain gentleman, who called on me to-day, informed me that a packet had sailed the 16th of August for <a href='/results.php?city=quebec' rel='city'>Quebec</a>, in which went passenger General Clarke. He added, that the rumor in England was, 
that Sir Guy Carleton was to return in her. He 
made no other communication. 
</p><p>
The inclosed letter came to hand this day. I have 
had no opportunity of making any inquiry concerning the person recommended in it. If I can obtain 
any additional lights, they shall be made known without delay. The object suggested in your letter, as 
preparatory to the meeting of the Legislature, shall 
engage my particular attention. The papers of the 
Departments of State and the Treasury, and of the 
Commissioners for settling Accounts, are on their way 
to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. On the 20th, I propose, with my 
family, to set out for the same place. I have the 
honor to be, with the highest respect and truest attachment. Sir, 
</p><p>

Sir, 
</p><p>
I have duly received the private letter which you 
did me the honor to write me, of the 4th instant. 
</p><p>
It is to be lamented that our system is such as 
still to leave the public peace of the Union at the 
mercy of each State Government. This is not only 
the case as it regards direct interferences, but as it 
regards the inability of the National Government, in 
many particulars, to take those direct measures for 
carrying into execution its views and engagements, 
which exigencies require. For example, a party comes 
from a county of Virginia into Pennsylvania, and 
wantonly murders some friendly Indians. The National Government, instead of having power to apprehend the murderers and bring them to justice, is 
obliged to make a representation to that of Pennsylvania ; that of Pennsylvania, again, is to make a requisition of that of Virginia. And whether the murderers shall be brought to justice at all, must depend 
upon the particular policy, and energy, and good disposition of two State Governments, and the efficacy 
of the provisions of their respective laws. And the 
security of other States, and the money of all, are at 
the discretion of one. These things require a remedy; 
but when it will come, God knows. 
</p><p>
From present appearances, a pretty general Indian 
war is not a little to be apprehended. But there is 
now nothing for it, but to encounter it with vigor; 
and thus far in my department the provisions are 
adequate. I have the honor to remain, with the truest and most respectful attachment, Sir, 
Your obedient servant,

I have received a letter from the Minister of 
France, of which the inclosed is a copy. Having 
full authority from you in relation to payments to 
France, and there being funds out of which that which 
will constitute the succour requested may with propriety be made, and being fully persuaded that, in

with a ready acquiescence in what is desired, I have 
not hesitated to answer the Minister that the sum he 
asks is at his command.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I am happy to be able, at length, to send you 
answers to the objections which were communicated 
in your letter of the 29th of July.
</p><p>
They have unavoidably been drawn in haste, too 
much so to do perfect justice to the subject, and 
have been copied just as they flowed from my heart 
and pen, without revision or correction. You will 
observe, that here and there some severity appears. 
I have not fortitude enough always to bear, with 
calmness, calumnies, which necessarily include me as 
a principal agent in the measures censured, of the falsehood of which I have the most unqualified consciousness. I trust that I shall always be able to 
bear, as I ought, imputations of errors of judgment ; 
but I acknowledge that I cannot be entirely patient 
under charges which impeach the integrity of my 
public motives or conduct. I feel that I merit them 
ill no degree; and expressions of indignation sometimes 
escape me, in spite of every effort to suppress them. 
I rely on your goodness for the proper allowances. 
</p><p>
With high respect, and the most affectionate attachment, I have the honor to be. Sir, &c., 
</p><p>

Treasury Department [<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city origin'>Philadelphia</a>], 	<a rel='day origin' value='19'>19</a> <a rel="month origin" value="11">November</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1792' rel="origin">1792</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have carefully reflected on the application of Mr. Ternant, for an additional supply of money for the 
use of the Colony of St. Domingo, on account of the 
debt due to France, which I regard more and more 
as presenting a subject extremely delicate and embarrassing. Two questions arise; first, as to the ability of the United States to furnish the money, which 
is stated at about three hundred and twenty-six thousand dollars, in addition to the sum remaining of the 
four hundred thousand dollars some time since promised; secondly, as to the propriety of doing it, on 
political considerations. 
</p><p>
With regard to ability, I feel little doubt that it 
will be in the power of the Treasury to furnish the 
sum. Yet, circumstanced as we are, with the possibility of more extensive demands than at present exist, 
for exigencies of a very serious nature, I think it 
would not be desirable to be bound by a positive 
stipulation for the entire amount. 
</p><p>
With regard to the propriety of the measure on 
political considerations, more serious difficulties occur. 
The late suspension of the King, which is officially 
communicated, and the subsequent abolition of royalty 
by the Convention, which the newspapers announce 
with every appearance of authenticity, essentially 
change, for the moment, the condition of France. 
</p><p>
If a restoration of the King should take place, I 
am of opinion that no payment, which might be made 
in the interval, would be deemed regular or obligatory. The admission of it to our credit would consequently be considered as matter of discretion, according to the opinion entertained of its merit and utility. 
A payment to the newly constituted power, as a reimbursement in course, or in any manner which 
would subject it to be used in support of the change, 
would doubtless be rejected. 
</p><p>
An advance, however, to supply the urgent necessities of a part of the French empire, struggling under the misfortune of an insurrection, of the nature 
of that which has for some time distressed, and now 
exposes to the danger of total ruin by famine, the 
Colony of St. Domingo, is of a different complexion. 
Succours, furnished in such a situation, under due 
limitations, would be so clearly an act of humanity 
and friendship, of such evident utility to the French 
empire, that no future Government could refuse to 
allow a credit for them, without a disregard of moderation and equity. But the claim for such credit 
would not be of a nature to be regularly and of 
course valid; consequently would be liable to be disputed. 
</p><p>
The condition in which the Colony has lately placed 
itself, by espousing the last change which has been 
made in France, operates as a serious difficulty in the 
case, and may be made a ground of objection to any 
aid which may be given them. There is even a 
question, whether there be now any organ of the 
French nation, which can regularly ask the succour; 
whether the commission to Mr. Ternant be not virtually superseded. It is also an objection (in the 
view of regularity and validity) to the supply asked, 
that the decree of the National Assembly, on which 
it is founded, contemplated a negotiation between the 
Executive power in France, and our Minister there. 
The channel has not been pursued, and no substitute 
has been provided. The business wants organization, 
in every sense. 
</p><p>
From these premises I deduce, — that nothing can 
be done without risk to the United States ; that, therefore, as little as possible ought to be done ; that whatever may be done, should be cautiously restricted to 
the idea of preserving the Colony from destruction and famine; that, in all communications on the subject, care should be taken to put it on this footing, and 
even to avoid the explicit recognition of any regular 
authority in any person. Under these cautions and 
restrictions, but not otherwise, I beg leave to submit 
it as my opinion that succours ought to be granted, 
notwithstanding the degree of risk which will attend 
it; that they should be effected by occasional advances, without previous stipulation, and with only a 
general assurance that the United States, disposed to 
contribute by friendly offices to the preservation of 
an important portion of the French Empire, and to 
that of French citizens from the calamity of famine, 
will endeavour, from time to time, as far as circumstances will permit, to afford means of sustenance. 
</p><p>
According to a statement of M. de la Forest, the 
provisions desired to be shipped in the course of November would amount to eighty-three thousand eight 
hundred dollars, including the total supply of fish 
and oil. Towards this he computes the application 
of fifty thousand dollars out of the remainder of the 
four hundred thousand dollars heretofore promised, 
which would leave a deficiency of thirty-three thousand eight hundred dollars. This sum, or, in round 
numbers, forty thousand, can be engaged to be furnished ; and in December, if no future circumstances 
forbid, a further sum can be engaged to be supplied, 
payable at a future short period. It will be proper 
that the most precise measures should be taken to 
ascertain, from time to time, the investment of the 
moneys supplied, in purchasing and forwarding provisions from this country to the Colony in question. 
It has been heretofore understood that the balance of 
the sum, some time since stipulated, was to be furnished ; which, accordingly, has been and is doing. 
Engagements for supplies have been entered into 
upon the basis of that stipulation; and payments to 
as great, if not a greater amount, are becoming due, 
in which the citizens of the United States are materially interested. 
</p><p>
The caution, which is deemed necessary, has reference not only to the safety of the United States in 
a pecuniary respect, but to the consideration of avoiding a dangerous commitment, which may even prove 
a source of misunderstanding between this country 
and the future Government of the French nation. 
From all that is hitherto known, there is no ground 
to conclude that the governing power, by the last 
advices, will be of long duration. I have the honor 
to be, with the highest respect and truest attachment, 
Sir, &c.,
