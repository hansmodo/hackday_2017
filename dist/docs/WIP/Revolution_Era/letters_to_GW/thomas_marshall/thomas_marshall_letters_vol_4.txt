Dear General, 
</p><p>
The nature of the subject upon which I do myself 
the honor to address you, will, I hope, be admitted as 
an excuse for the trouble of reading this letter. The 
political situation of this western country appears to 
me to be something critical, and therefore I have undertaken, though reluctantly, to give you a state of 
facts preceding our present situation, so far as they 
have fallen within my knowledge. 
</p><p>
In the spring of <a href='/results.php?year=1787'>1787</a>, General Wilkinson went to 
<a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a> with a cargo of tobacco, &c., and was 
requested by the Governor of that place to give his 
sentiments freely, in writing, respecting the political 
interest of Spain, and the Americans of the United 
States inhabiting the western waters. This he did in 
an essay, as he calls it, contained in about fifteen or 
twenty sheets of paper. I saw the Governor's letter 
to him, acknowledging the receipt of it, and informing him that he would lay it before the King of 
Spain. A copy of this essay he produced, and read 
in our late Convention held for the district ; and, as 
well as my memory (which I acknowledge is not 
very accurate) serves me, the substance of it is as 
follows. 
</p><p>
He urges our natural right of following the current of rivers, flowing through our country into the 
sea. He states the extent of our country, the richness of our soil, abounding in choice productions proper for foreign markets, to which we have no means 
of conveying them, should the Mississippi be shut up 
against us. He states the advantages Spain might 
derive from allowing us the free use of that river. 
He goes on to show the rapid population of this 
country, and the eagerness with which every individual looks forward to that navigation. He states 
the general abhorrence with which the people of the 
western waters received the intelligence, that Congress was about to sacrifice their dearest interest by 
ceding to Spain the navigation of the Mississippi for 
twenty-five or thirty years, and represents it as a fact, 
that they are on the point of separating themselves 
totally from the Union on that account. He addresses 
himself to their fears by a pompous display of our 
force, and urges that, should Spain be so blind to 
her true interest as to refuse us an amicable participation in the navigation of that river, and thereby 
force us into violent measures, " Great Britain stands 
with her arms extended ready to receive us," and assist our efforts for the accomplishment of that object; 
and quotes a conversation he had a few years ago 
with a member of the British Parliament to that effect. 
</p><p>
He states the facility with which their Province of Louisiana might be invaded by the united forces of the British and Americans, by means of the river 
PJinois, and the practicability of proceeding from thence to their Province of New Mexico, it not being more than twenty days. Britain, he says, will, in 
that case, aim at the possession of Louisiana and New 
Orleans for herself, and leave the freedom of the navigation to America; and urges, pretty forcibly, the 
great danger the Spanish interest in North America 
would be in from the British power, should that nation possess herself of the mouth of the Mississippi, 
and thereby hold the two grand portals of North 
America, that river and the St. Lawrence; and concludes with an apology for the freedom with which 
he has treated the subject, and adds that it has, at 
their own particular request, been drawn from a man 
"whose head may err, but whose heart cannot deceive." 
</p><p>
This essay has, I am told, been laid before the 
Court of Madrid ; and, as a violent separation from 
the United States seems to be laid down as the 
groundwork upon which every other consequence depends, I think, probably, has produced instructions 
from that Court to the Spanish resident at Congress, 
if the western country should declare itself separate 
from the Union, to avail himself of that event. I 
found this conjecture upon Mr. Brown's confidential 
letters from Congress to his friends in this district. 
Some of those letters I have seen. He mentions 
that, in a private conversation which he had with 
Don Gardocjui, he was informed that so long as this 
country remained a part of the Union, we had nothing 
to expect from Spain ; but, were we to declare ourselves separate from, and independent of the United 
States, he was authorized to treat with us respecting 
commerce and the navigation of the Mississippi. Mr. Brown having returned from Congress, was called upon, 
in conversation, in November last, to give such information respecting our affairs in Congress as might be 
proper for us to know. He told me that he did not 
think himself at liberty to mention what past in private conversation between himself and Don Gardoqui 
respecting us. But this much, in general, he would 
venture to inform us, that, provided we were united 
in our counsels, every thing we could wish for was 
within our reach, â€” meaning, as it appeared fully to 
me, that if we would assume government, and declare 
separate from the Union, Spain would give us every 
indulgence we could ask for. 
</p><p>
About this time arrived from Canada the famous 
Dr. (now Colonel) Connolly. His ostensible business was to inquire after, and repossess himself of, 
some lands lie formerly held at the Falls of the Ohio ; 
but I believe that his real business was to sound 
the disposition of the leading men of this district respecting this Spanish business. He knew that both 
Colonel Shuter and myself had given it all the opposition in the Convention we were able to do; and, 
before he left the district, paid us a visit, though 
neither of us had the honor of the least acquaintance with him. He was introduced by Colonel John 
Campbell, formerly a prisoner taken by the Indians, 
and confined in Canada, who previously informed us 
of the proposition he was about to make. He (Connolly) presently entered upon his subject; urged the 
great importance the navigation of the Mississippi 
must be of to the inhabitants of the western waters ; 
showed the absolute necessity of our possessing it ; 
and concluded with assurances that, were we disposed 
to assert our right respecting that navigation, Lord 
Dorchester was cordially disposed to give us powerful assistance ; that his Lordship had, I think he said, 
four thousand British troops in Canada, besides two 
regiments at Detroit, and could furnish us with arms, 
ammunition, clothing, and money ; that, with this assistance, we might possess ourselves of <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a>, 
fortify the Balize at the mouth of the river, and 
keep possession, in spite of the utmost efforts of 
Spain, to the contrary. He made very confident professions of Lord Dorchester's wishes to cultivate the 
most friendly intercourse with the people of this 
country, and of his own desire to become serviceable 
to us ; and with so much seeming sincerity, that, had 
I not before been acquainted with his character as a man of intrigue and artful address, I should, in all 
probability, have given him my confidence. 
</p><p>
I told him that the minds of the people of this 
country were thoroughly prejudiced against the British, not only from circumstances attending the late 
war, but from a persuasion that the Indians were 
at this time stimulated by them against us ; and that, 
so long as those savages continued to commit such 
horrid cruelties on our defenceless frontiers, and were 
received as friends and allies by the British at Detroit, it would be impossible for them to be convinced of the sincerity of Lord Dorchester's offers, let his 
professions be ever so strong ; and that, if his Lordship would have us believe him really disposed to be 
our friend, he must begin by showing his disapprobation of the ravages of the Indians. He admitted the 
justice of my observations, and said he had urged the 
same to his Lordship before he left Canada. He denied that the Indians are stimulated against us by 
the British, and says that Lord Dorchester observed 
that the Indians are free and independent nations, 
and have a right to make peace and war as they 
think fit, and that he could not with propriety interfere. He promised, however, on his return to Canada, 
to repeat his arguments to his Lordship on the subject, and hopes, he says, to succeed. At taking his 
leave, he begged very politely the favor of our correspondence. We both promised him, provided he 
would begin it, and devise a means of carrying it 
on. He did not tell me that he was authorized by 
Lord Dorchester to make us these offers in his name, 
nor did I ask him ; but General Scott informs me 
that he told him that his Lordship had authorized 
him to use his name in this business. 
</p><p>
It appears plain to me that the offers of Lord DorChester, as well as those of Spain, are founded on a 
supposition that it is a fact that we are about to separate from the Union ; else, why are those offers not 
made to Congress ? We shall, I fear, never be safe 
from the machinations of our enemies, as well internal as external, until we have a separate State, and 
are admitted into the Union as a federal member. I 
have the honor to be, with the most respectful esteem 
and regard.

Dear General, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letter, dated the 27th of March 
last, came safe to hand, and I have the honor to assure you that I will observe the contents of it with 
all the care and attention in my power. The part I 
took in the business I had the honor to inform you 
of, has deprived me of the confidence of all those 
gentlemen concerned. It is however scarcely possible, that a matter of that extensive importance can 
be conducted to any dangerous crisis, without my discovering something of it, time enough to give you 
the necessary information. In the mean time, my vigilance shall not sleep. 
</p><p>
Should your Excellency find it necessary to honor 
me with your commands, they will find a safe conveyance by being sent under cover to my son, John 
Marshall, in Richmond, to whom I shall write for 
that purpose. 
</p><p>
Permit me. Sir, to express my extreme happiness 
on account of your Excellency's acceptance of the 
Presidency of the United States ; an event the more 
to be rejoiced at, as it bids fair, at this critical time, 
for the reconcilement of all parties. It strongly impresses on my mind the truth of what w^as prophetically said from the pulpit, on the commencement of 
the former French war, " that <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> had sent 
you into the world to be the salvation of America." 
May God bless and prosper you ! is the prayer of 
him, who has the honor to be, with the most respectful regard, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have taken the liberty to inclose to you a Kentucky paper, wherein is published an extract from 
one of Mr. Brown's letters respecting the Spanish 
business. My reason for doing this is, that you may 
judge how far it confirms a representation I formerly 
had the honor to make to you on that subject. The 
part I then publicly took in this affair, has entirely 
excluded me from any knowledge of his subsequent 
communications to his confidential friends. 
</p><p>
You will discover, by the paper I send you, to 
what lengths matters have been carried. Every thing 
relative to this matter, on the part of Mr. Brown, 
has, by his friends and coadjutors, been denied or 
concealed, which has produced a necessity for the inclosed publication. I shall only take the liberty of 
adding, that a great majority of the people of this 
district appear to be well disposed to the Government 
of the United States, though they have, through the 
influence and industry of his confidential friends, again 
elected Mr. Brown to Congress ; and that our official 
and influential characters having taken the oath to 
support the General Government, together with the 
position the Continental troops have taken, in my 
opinion leaves us little to fear, at present, from the 
machinations of any Spanish party. 
</p><p>
That God may bless and preserve you, and that 
the United States may long continue to enjoy the 
happiness of your government and protection, is the 
most fervent prayer of one, -who has the honor to 
be, with the most respectful esteem and sincerity, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=tom" rel="me">Thomas Marshall</a>.
