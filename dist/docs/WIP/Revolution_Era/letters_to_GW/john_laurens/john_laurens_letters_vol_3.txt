</p><p>
My dear General, 
</p><p>
Upon my arrival here, I found that our Minister 
Plenipotentiary had received the instructions, &c., 
transmitted to him, and commenced the negotiation 
with which we were charged; and that he had received the following communication from the Count de Vergennes. 
</p><p>
" It is impossible for his Majesty to favor a loan 
in this kingdom, because it would prejudice those 
which he has occasion to make himself for the support of the war ; but his Majesty, to give the United 
States a signal proof of his friendship, grants them 
under the title of a donation, six millions of livres 
tournois. As the American army is in want of arms, 
clothing, &c., <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague'>Mr. Franklin</a> will be so good as to give 
a note of those articles; they will be procured of 
the best quality, and at the most reasonable price. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a> will be authorized to give drafts 
for the remaining sum; but the drafts must be at 
long sight, in order to facilitate the payments from 
the Royal Treasury. The Courts of Petersburg and 
Vienna have offered their mediation. The King has answered, that it would be personally agreeable to 
him, but that he could not as yet accept it, because 
he has allies whose concurrence is necessary. Mr. 
Franklin is requested to communicate the overture 
and answer to Congress, and to engage them to send 
their instructions to their Plenipotentiaries. It is supposed the Congress will accept the mediation with 
eagerness." 
</p><p>
After my first interview with the Count de Vergennes, I presented to him a Memorial/'' in which I 
transcribed the principal part of the letter your Excellency delivered to me ,at New Windsor, and represented the insufficiency of the succour proposed by his 
Majesty. I have since given in an extract of the 
estimate of the Board of War, accompanied with a 
letter, urging the necessity of despatch in furnishing 
those essential supplies. My personal solicitations 
have not been wanting to induce a prompt and favorable answer; but M. de Maurepas and the Count de Vergennes both inform me, that nothing can be 
determined until the return of M, de Castries, who 
is expected the day after to-morrow; that the matter 
must be deliberated, and they will consider what can 
be done. M. Necker will be consulted to-day. 
</p><p>
M. de Vergennes complains very much of the excessive demands of Congress, and seems to entertain 
an idea that they wish to throw too much of the 
burden of the war on their ally. He says that the 
exertions and expense with which France supports 
the war in different parts of the world, fully employ 
her means ; that her public credit has its limits, to 
surpass which would be fatal to it. 
</p><p>
Upon the whole, my expectations are very moderate. The naval dispositions were made before my 
arrival; five ships of the line for the East Indies 
with troops ; twenty, commanded by De Grasse, for 
the West Indies, twelve of which are to proceed to 
America. They will probably arrive on our coast in 
July. We have no news yet of their departure. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will see that I have written in a 
great hurry. In my next, I hope to be able to give 
you more particular intelligence of our affairs. In 
the mean time, I take the liberty of troubling you to 
present my respects to Mrs. Washington, my love to 
the family and the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>, the want 
of whose letters is a great disadvantage to me. My 
only hope of obtaining additional succour is founded 
on the exalted opinion which the Ministers have of 
your Excellency, and every thing which comes from 
you. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect 
and most tender attachment, &c., 
</p><p>

</p><p>
My dear General, 
</p><p>
Not to trouble your Excellency with a detail of 
writings, conferences, attendances, and imiDortunities, 
I pass at once to the result, as communicated to me 
by the Count de Vergennes. It is his most Christian 
Majesty's determination to guarantee a loan of ten 
millions of livres, to be opened in Holland, in favor 
of the United States, in addition to the gratuitous 
gift of six millions granted before my arrival, and 
four millions appropriated for the payment of bills of 
exchange drawn by Congress. The value of the clothing, ordnance, and military stores, of which articles 
I have delivered an estimate, reduced in proportion 
to the quantities already obtained and forwarded by 
<a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague'>Dr. Franklin</a>, is to be deducted from the six millions. 
</p><p>
The distance of the manufacturing towns from the 
sea, renders it impossible to procure the woollen cloths 
at a short notice. The Marine department, which 
the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> imagined, from the similarity of uniforms, might be able to give us some assistance, has no reserve stores of this kind. The different regiments in the land service proidde their own 
clothing; so that there will be unavoidable difficulties 
and delays in procuring the quantity demanded. 
</p><p>
I am using my utmost efforts to prevail upon the 
Ministers to advance the ten millions from the treasury of France, and avail themselves of the proposed 
loan in Holland, for replacing the sum. This arrangement, it appears to me, can be attended with no possible inconvenience to the finances of France, and I 
need not add to your Excellency how invaluable this 
gain of time will be to America. I shall likewise 
endeavour to negotiate the ordnance and other military effects that may be supplied from the King's 
arsenal, on credit, to economize as much as possible 
the six millions. The Marquis de Castries has promised to make immediate arrangements for forwarding 
the supplies, and has renewed his assurances that a 
naval superiority will exist on the American coast 
the ensuing campaign. But there are not those dispositions made for maintaining it, that the success of 
the common cause demands ; and I am sorry to inform 
your Excellency, that the Ministry do not seem to 
approve of the siege of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> as an operation 
for the ensuing campaign. What may be the effect 
of farther and more particular conferences on the subject, I cannot determine. 
</p><p>
Inclosed your Excellency will receive extracts of 
letters intercepted in a packet bound from Falmouth 
to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. They were communicated to me by 
the Marquis de Castries, but do not appear to have 
made that impression on him and the rest of the 
Ministry which was reasonably to be expected. 
</p><p>
It mortifies me much, not to be able to announce 
to your Excellency the day of my departure from 
this country. It is impossible to express the impatience which I feel to return to my military functions, 
and to have opportunities of proving to your Excellency that I am unalterably, with the profoundest 
veneration and most tender attachment, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's faithful aid, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jol" rel="me">John Laurens</a>. 
</p><p>
P. 8. I must trouble your Excellency to present 
my respects to Mrs. Washington, my love to the 
<a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>, <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague met friend'>Colonel Hamilton</a>, and the rest

</p><p>
Dear General, 
</p><p>
I have written a letter of this date to Congress, 
inclosing one to me from Mr, Moses Young, my 
father's secretary, by which it appears that our Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Versailles had 
not, so late as the 28th of September, received official notice of the resolve of Congress for exchanging 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>. 
</p><p>
I likewise inclosed a letter from General Cornwallis, in which he assures me that all his influence will 
he exerted to effect an exchange between him and 
my father, provided I transmit to him an official paper, authorizing it on the part of Congress. I claim 
your Excellency's promise to interest yourself in a 
business, in which I feel so many powerful public 
and private motives. Your Excellency's friendship 
becomes the more necessary, as I am informed that 
the exchange of Cornwallis has been represented in 
Congress as impolitic, at the present juncture, on account of his talents and influence. TJie former can 
excite no apprehension in my mind, while the American army continues under its present auspices. With 
regard to the latter, which some allege would extend 
to securing a reenforcement and a continuance of 
the war, it appears to me that the credit of no 
one individual would tempt the British Ministry, at 
the present period, to carry their views beyond a 
vigorous effort for the recovery of Georgia and South 
Carolina. This appears to me to be the best plan 
they can propose to themselves, and in the execution 
of it they must employ all their means, let who will command their army. Their most sanguine hopes 
cannot lead them beyond a truce or a treaty upon 
the footing of uti possidetis, they retaining the two 
States above mentioned. As this object will require 
all the military exertions they can possibly make, 
and the aid of every political intrigue, I do not think one General Officer would bring out a larger reenforcement than another. 
</p><p>
These being my sentiments, I apply with confidence 
to your Excellency, and beg leave to solicit, in the 
most earnest terms, your friendly attention to my 
father's circumstances. The continuance of a loathsome imprisonment, in which he is excluded from the 
converse or correspondence of his friends, and labors 
under every illiberal restriction that his mean-spirited, 
tyrannical persecutors can invent, may, at his advanced age, prove fatal. Considering the perseverance 
of the British Ministry in their absurd pretensions, it 
is probable that an exchange would be more readily 
effected under your immediate authority than by the 
intervention of Congress ; and perhaps there are other 
officers, besides Cornwallis, whom the British would be 
glad to receive in exchange for my father. 
</p><p>
I entreat your Excellency's pardon for troubling 
you with this tedious epistle; but my distress for a 
parent, whom I love almost to adoration, and your 
Excellency's goodness, will form an excuse for me. 
I beg your Excellency will accept the sincere and 
repeated assurances of veneration and attachment with 
which I am invariably, dear General, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, '

My dear General, 
</p><p>
I am much obliged to you for honoring my bill in favor of <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a>. It includes the whole sum 
expended, on your account, in France. The plan, 
which brought me to this country, was urged with 
all the zeal which the subject inspired, both in our 
Privy Council and Assembly ; but the single voice 
of reason was drowned by the bowlings of a triple-headed monster, in which prejudice, avarice, and pusillanimity were united. It was some degree of consolation to me, however, to perceive that truth and 
philosophy had gained some ground ; the suffrages in 
favor of the measure being twice as numerous as on 
a former occasion. Some hopes have been lately 
given me from Georgia; but I fear, when the question is put, we shall be outvoted there with as much 
disparity as we have been in this country. 
</p><p>
The reports of the prompt evacuation of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> 
I always thought groundless, and should have much 
sooner inferred the probability of such an event from 
the language of the debates in the British Parliament than from the conduct and arrangements of 
General Leslie. The late disaster of the Count de Grasse, in the West Indies, makes me more incredulous on the subject than ever. General Leslie confines himself to the most circumspect defensive conduct, which he is not likely to change, as he recently 
detached the nineteenth and thirtieth regiments to 
Jamaica. This renders the campaign perfectly inactive here, and, above all, insipid to the light troops, 
which I at present command. 
</p><p>
I presume your Excellency has not yet determined 
your plan for the ensuing campaign, and that it must 
depend on the cooperation of our allies. I earnestly 
desire to be where any active plans are likely to be 
executed, and to be near your Excellency on all occasions in which my services can be acceptable. The 
pursuit of an object which, I confess, is a favorite 
one with me, because I always regarded the interests 
of this country and those of the Union as intimately 
connected with it, has detached me more than once 
from your family; but those sentiments of veneration 
and attachment with which your Excellency has inspired me, keep me always near you, with the sincerest and most zealous wishes for a continuance of 
your happiness and glory. Give me leave to say 
that I am ever, my dear General, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's faithful Aid,

Dear General, 
</p><p>
The approaching session of the Georgia Legislature, 
and the encouragement given me by Governor Howley, who has a decisive influence in the counsels of 
that country, induce me to remain in this quarter for 
the purpose of taking new measures on the subject 
of our black levies. The arrival of Colonel Baylor, 
whose seniority entitles him to the command of the 
light troops, affords me ample leisure for pursuing 
the business in person ; and I shall do it, with all 
the tenacity of a man making a last effort on so interesting an occasion. 
</p><p>
The sterility of the present campaign affords nothing worthy to be detailed to your Excellency. Our 
operations have been confined to inconsiderable skirmishes, and some little partisan strokes on our part, 
which were brilliant, and served to amuse us in default of better employment. 
</p><p>
My last letter was closed and despatched a moment 
before Mr. Leslie's letter arrived, to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>General Greene</a>, 
to feel his pulse on the subject of an armistice, and 
administer every political opiate that could be contrived. The General's answer was obvious. Since that, 
peace has been the prevailing topic in <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> ; 
the terms of it founded in conjecture, and framed by 
the interests and passions of different individuals. The 
wisdom and virtue of Congress have no doubt given 
the proper repulse to the sounders, who have approached them. It is more and more to be lamented, 
that the French force, under <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague'>Count Rochambeau</a>, has 
not been applied to assist in opening the trenches 
before <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, and that the idea of an evacuation 
of that post has been so successfully propagated. 
The expulsion or capture of the British garrison 
there, would infinitely abridge negotiation. I renew 
my wishes for a continuance of your Excellency's 
happiness and prosperity; and am. ever, dear General, 
</p><p>
Your faithful aid, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jol" rel="me">John Laurens</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. My letter will be delivered to your Excellency by Mr. Lovell, of the partisan legion. He is 
an officer of merit, and as such I take the liberty 
of presenting him to your Excellency.

</p><p>
With the triumph of a republican, and the more 
tender emotions of one who sincerely loves his General, I congratulate your Excellency on your late providential escape.'-' I congratulate my country, whose 
safety is so intimately united with j'ours, and who 
may regard this miraculous rescue of her champion 
as an assurance that Heaven approves her choice of 
a defender, and is propitious to her cause. In fact, 
all the ascendency that could be given by virtue, 
genius, and valor, would only have furnished a deplorable example of unfortunate merit, if, by the 
Divine interposition, you had not prevailed over the 
most impenetrable perfidy that has yet disgraced 
mankind. This happy event must inspire every virtuous citizen of America with new confidence, and 
transfix her enemies with awful terror. Andre has, 
I suppose, paid the forfeit which public justice demanded ; example will derive new force from his 
conspicuous character. Arnold must undergo a punishment incomparably more severe, in the permanent, 
increasing, torment of a mental hell. 
</p><p>
I am waiting in anxious expectation of an answer 
from Captain Wallop, a man of great interest and 
credit among the British, who was indulged with a 
limited parole to negotiate my exchange by composition. Sir Henry Clinton's late sanguine expectation 
of success may have suspended business of this kind, 
and produced some delay j but I still derive great 
hopes from that quarter. I need not inform your 
Excellency how I have languished in so long a separation from you, and how anxious I am to assure 
you, in person, of the veneration and attachment of 
your faithful Aid.

My dear General, 
</p><p>
Upon my arrival here the 25th ultimio, I found 
that men and money were still wanting to fit the 
Alliance frigate for sea. I immediately insisted on 
the necessity of an impress, and of having recourse 
to extraordinary means for the necessary supply of 
money. The head of the Navy Board, who is at the 
same time a leading member in the House of Representatives, gave me such positive assurances on both 
points, as tempted me to employ the interval of preparation in my visit to Newport. But, as I was returning, I was met with a letter informing me that 
the motion for an impress had been rejected. To 
add to our difficulties, the terror of an impress had 
cleared the port of seamen, and deprived us of the 
little succour we derived from the ships' rendezvous. 
</p><p>
In these circumstances, I was reduced to the necessity of soliciting <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a> for authority to engage such volunteers from the Continental recruits 
of this place, and soldiers of the invalid corps, as 
might be qualified for the sea-service. I applied to 
Governor Hancock for similar authority with respect to a corps of State troops -which garrison the Castle. 
I addressed myself to the principal merchants, and 
tried every expedient that could be thought of As 
Governor Hancock could not act but with the authority of the General Court, I yesterday presented a 
memorial, and obtained permission to enlist twenty 
volunteers from the Castle guard. <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a>, 
whose zeal in the service of his country is indefatigable, has condescendingly undertaken to use his personal influence in engaging the men, and has gone 
down to the Castle with a sum of specie, allowed by 
the General Court for that purpose ; if he is successful, we shall be able to go to sea with confidence. 
These men are the more necessary to us, as they are 
natives, and persons upon whose attachment we can 
depend, as a counterbalance to a number of British 
prisoners, who were admitted on board when the 
ship first began to be manned. 
</p><p>
I am, at all events, determined to insist on Barry's 
sailing with the first wind. I have admitted as many 
passengers as could be accommodated, on condition 
of their serving as volunteer marines. They will 
likewise be an additional security against the suspected part of our crew. 
</p><p>
1th. Captain Barry says that our ship is but barely manned. However, I am determined to embark 
to-day, and expect he will sail in the course of the 
week, wind and weather permitting. 
</p><p>
I have only time to entreat your Excellency to 
present my respects to Mrs. Washington; and accept 
the assurances of attachment with wliich I am unalterably yours,
