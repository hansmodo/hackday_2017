SIR, 
</p><p>
I had the honor of writing to your Excellency from 
<a href='/results.php?city=lebanon' rel='city'>Lebanon</a> the 23d instant. The day following, at three o'clock in the afternoon, I arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>. As 
soon as I had delivered to <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> your Excellency's despatches and instructions, I set out for 
this place with Colonel Wall, and an ample number 
of pilots, whom <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> had provided and 
put under his command. Colonel Wall is a man of 
character and property, perfectly acquainted with the 
coast, &c. Those under him are experienced pilots, 
and men of responsibility. We arrived here at nine o'clock this morning, having been detained till that 
time in procuring a party of militia, and making arrangements both for securing such boats as we shall 
want for our own immediate use, and such as, with 
out this precaution, might be employed in communicating intelligence to the enemy. 
</p><p>
We have agreed with four whaleboat privateers, 
belonging to Connecticut, manned with enterprising, 
experienced mariners, and pressed four belonging to 
this State. We have given them to understand that 
the frigate, lying at Connecticut River, is to push 
out of the Sound, and that we are to meet her with 
hands to enable her to go round and join the French 
fleet, for which purpose their boats are necessary. 
The number that we have is amply sufficient for our business, and now we are in readiness. Two sentinels will be posted, in an advantageous place, whose 
business will be to attend to whatever signals may 
be given from the seaboard ; besides which, Colonel 
Wall, the master pilots, and myself, will alternately 
hold watch, arid keep our attention awake. Till last 
night, twelve o clock, unfavorable winds have prevailed. If the gale, which we have at present, does 
not prove inconstant, it will not be long before we 
are called upon. Our situation commands a view of 
the several entrances to <a href='/results.php?city=newport' rel='city'>Newport</a>; and Block Island 
is directly opposite to us, so that nothing can pass 
to or from <a href='/results.php?city=newport' rel='city'>Newport</a> unnoticed. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> estimates the enemy's land force 
here at seven thousand. The state of their shipping, 
he informs me, is as follows ; in the east channel 
(or that between Seconet Point and Rhode Island), 
two galleys and one small frigate ; in the west channel (or that between <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> Neck and Connanicut 
Island), two small frigates ; in the middle, or main 
channel, two frigates ; at <a href='/results.php?city=newport' rel='city'>Newport</a>, two or three frigates. As <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> will probably write to 
your Excellency, I forbear descending to farther particulars. He has been indefatigable, and nothing on 
his part will be wanting. I have the honor to be, 
with the greatest respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I am just returned from a fruitless pursuit of the 
French squadron. <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> will inform your Excellency of the fatal determination of the Count's 
officers in a Council of War, as well as of the several 
remonstrances, and final solemn protest, made by the 
American Generals. The Admiral's ship being dismantled, fore and aft, at the moment he had overtaken 
the British fleet, and was promising himself an important victory, another ship of the line being in 
like manner dismantled, and a seventy-four gun ship 
being separated from the squadron, all the effects 
of a most dreadful storm which suddenly arose, were 
regarded as sufficient reasons, added to the expectation of Admiral Byron's arrival, for abandoning the 
American troops in the midst of a very important expedition, and reducing them to the necessity of making a desperate attack or a precipitate retreat. 
</p><p>
The honor of the French nation, the honor of the 
Admiral, the safety of his fleet, and a regard for the 
new alliance, required a different conduct ; but the 
Count's hands were tied. The cabal of marine officers, who wish his destruction because he was introduced from the land service into their corps, left 
him, it is said, no choice. I cannot, however, but be 
of opinion, that a solemn protest might, by affording a justification for his acting in direct contradiction to 
the unanimous voice of his officers, have induced him to remain here. lie might have been furnished, at 
this place, with all the means of refitting which he 
can expect at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. lie might have been as well 
secured against a superior force ; and, in case he had 
chosen to fight, he would have been in better condition in still water, with dismantled vessels, where 
every one knows that, with springs upon his cables, 
he might fight his artillery as well as if he had 
masts and sails ; whereas, at sea, in case of a separation from his fleet, the Languedoc may fall a prey 
to a vessel of half her force. 
As I find that I am detaining the express, and I 
am sure <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> will have written your Excellency more fully than my present hurry and con 
fusion of ideas, for want of sleep, will permit me to 
do, I must entreat your Excellency's excuse for closing my letter abruptly. I have the honor to be, with 
the greatest respect, 
</p><p>

SIR, 
</p><p>
I had the honor of writing to your Excellency previous to the action of the 29th. My letter was committed to the care of Major Gibbs, and he destroyed 
it as soon as the engagement commenced, to guard 
against accidents. As your Excellency has already 
received minute accounts of the transactions of that 
day from those who saw them in a more collective 
view than the nature of my command afforded me. 
any further relation is rendered unnecessary. I shall 
confine myself, therefore, to congratulating your Excellency on the happy termination of an expedition, 
which at one period was threatened with the most 
tragical catastrophe. The advantages gained in the 
affair of Portsmouth, and the brilliant retreat which 
succeeded it, by doing honor to the American arms, 
consoled us in some degree for the loss of our grand 
object. 
</p><p>
The movements which your Excellency has observed at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, the arrival of seventy sail of vessels 
in the road of <a href='/results.php?city=newport' rel='city'>Newport</a>, the appearance of twenty 
sail off <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, are circumstances which keep us in 
suspense with respect to the enemy's intentions. <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> has requested that I would remain in 
this quarter till they can be interpreted. In the mean 
time, he agrees with me, that if the enemy mean to 
act offensively here, a few days % preparation will be 
required. I have thought it incumbent on me. as 
part of the commission with which your Excellency 
honored me, to wait on <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague'>Count D Estaing</a>, and ask if 
he has any despatches for head-quarters. It will be 
my greatest happiness if I can be useful in explaining the causes of mutual jealousy and uneasiness 
which have existed between the officers of the allied 
powers here, and be any ways instrumental in restoring that harmony which the common interest re 
quires. 
</p><p>
I foretold, to the Marquis, the influence which the 
Count's departure from the road of <a href='/results.php?city=newport' rel='city'>Newport</a> would 
probably have upon the minds of the people, and the 
danger of its reviving those absurd prejudices which 
we inherited from the British nation. Unhappily the 
mischief has become more extensive by the unguarded expressions of some men of rank, who listened to 
their chagrin rather than good policy. Reflection, 
however, begins to induce a more cautious behaviour, 
and I am in hopes that the confidence of the people 
in our new allies will be restored. 
</p><p>
The Count's sensibility was much wounded by the 
manner in which the protest was delivered to him. 
In a letter to <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> he declares, that this 
paper imposed on the Commander of the King's 
squadron the painful but necessary law of profound 
silence ; that he had taken occasion, however, relatively to some other business, to acquaint him, that, if 
the Council of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> accepted his offer (which was 
to repair to Rhode Island at the head of his land 
troops, and receive <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a>'s orders), he 
would promise the most implicit obedience on the 
part of his troops, and set them the example of it ; 
that the extreme sensibility, which composed the 
French national character, in every thing that relates 
to their honor, required that the French Commander-in-chief should, by his sentiments for the American 
General, and by a conspicuous measure, announce that 
French delicacy could not be wounded in a moment 
of passion, which arose from disappointment, felt alike 
by both parties. In a postscript he requested that 
the Marquis de la Fayette may explain matters between them. The expressions of the Count's letter 
are rather obscure; but, by discovering an inclination 
to make great personal sacrifices, it is, in my opinion,a foundation for restoring harmony and a good understanding. <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a>'s answer, I hope, will 
improve it. I have the honor to be, with the greatest attachment and respect, 
</p><p>

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I should have done myself the honor of writing to 
you earlier, "but postponed my intention in hopes of 
obtaining satisfactory intelligence of the force and 
designs of the enemy in this quarter. Although my 
expectations are far from being answered, I must en 
treat your Excellency's acceptance of what I have 
been able to collect on those subjects, lest the expected siege prolong my silence beyond the proper 
bounds. 
</p><p>
The day before yesterday, we had certain intelligence of the arrival of forty-five sail at North Edisto. 
A debarkation immediately commenced on Shnmons's Island; and an advanced corps, it is said, of five 
hundred, proceeded the following day to John's Is 
land. The Vigilant and two galleys are at Port 
Royal. Private accounts say that General Prevost is 
left to command at <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>; that his troops consist 
of the Hessians and Loyalists that were there before, 
reenforced by a corps of blacks and a detachment of 
savages. It is generally reported that Sir Henry 
Clinton commands the present expedition. It appears 
to me to be the British policy to transfer the theatre of the war to this vulnerable part of the Continent ; and, should their Commander-in-chief be here. 
I hope you will do him the honor to meet him. 
The command of your winter-quarters might very 
well be left to a Major-General, and the appearance 
of your Excellency, in person, would produce such 
effects as would decide the American contest. The 
Carolinians, as usual, have been superior to foresight 
and precaution. The delay of the enemy produced 
no other effect than to increase their supineness, and 
finally to introduce a disbelief of the enemy's intentions. But they begin to be roused. 
</p><p>
My father desires his most respectful compliments 
to your Excellency and Mrs. Washington. He has 
been detained here by M. Durumain's having taken 
French leave. This gentleman, who commanded the 
French frigate in this harbour, engaged to accommodate my father with a passage to France, but previously undertook a cruise in company with our American frigates. As soon, however, as he had passed 
the bar, he made the best of his way for Europe. 
A brace of two-deckers and a frigate are constantly 
standing off-and-on our harbour; but my father is 
determined, at all hards, to prosecute his voyage, 
and fulfil his engagements to the public. 
</p><p>
I preferred a hasty letter to a total silence ; your Excellency will be so indulgent as to excuse me for 
it, and assure Mrs. Washington of my respects. I 
have the honor to be, with the greatest veneration 
and attachment, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's faithful Aid,

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The enemy's present disposition of his force, and 
all his late operations, indicate a design to attack 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> by a siege in form. To complete the in 
vestiture, he must introduce his ships of war into the harbour. That it is his intention, appears from his 
fixing buoys on the bar, barricading his ships waists, 
and anchoring them in a station where they may 
embrace the first favorable spring tides to enter. 
His transports and store-ships have removed from 
Edisto up Stono River, where they lie contiguous to 
Wappoo Cut, which is the water communication from 
thence to Ashley River. At a point of the main 
land, formed by the issuing of the former into the 
latter, he raised, in the course of a night, the 11th 
instant, a battery of six embrasures. This situation, 
naturally advantageous, he will probably render very 
strong, and establish in it his deposit of military 
stores and provisions. He then may either force a 
passage over Ashley River, or turn it by a circuitous 
march, fortify a camp on the Neck, and open his 
trenches. The best communication between his magazines and camp will be across Ashley River, from a 
bluff, marked Bull, in your large map. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will have learnt that the Commodore and all his officers renounce the idea of defending the passage of the bar ; they declare it impracti 
cable for the frigates to lie in a proper position for 
that purpose. The Government has neglected to pro 
vide floating batteries, which might have been stationed there j so that it has been agreed, as the next 
best plan, to form a line of battle, in such a manner 
as to make a cross-fire with Fort Moultrie ; a shoal, 
called the Middle Grounds, being on the right of the 
ships, and the fort advanced of the left. As it would 
be the enemy's policy, with a leading wind and tide, 
to pass the fire of the fort, and run aboard of our ships, the Commodore is contriving an obstruction, 
which he thinks will check their progress, and allow 
time for the full effect of our fire. 
</p><p>
The impracticability of defending the bar, in the 
first instance, appears to me a great diminution of 
our means of defence. We must not only have a 
greater number of shipping below, and consequently 
withdraw them from flanking the enemy's approaches 
on the Neck, but are subject to the chances of a 
combat, which, in the other case, were out of the 
question. The Commodore has destroyed one set of 
the enemy's buoys 5 and I hope he will cut away 
such as may have been since put down, and order 
the galleys to give all possible annoyance to the 
enemy's ships in the act of entering. 
</p><p>
The attention of the Engineers has been distracted 
by different demonstrations on the part of the enemy, and they have not perfected the line across 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> Neck. Henceforward I hope they will 
confine themselves solely to completing it, and then 
proceed to the construction of some interior inclosed 
works, to prolong the defence. 
</p><p>
As the enemy is determined to proceed by regular approaches, all his operations are submitted to calculation, and he can determine, with mathematical precision, that with such and such means, in a given 
time, he will accomplish his end. Our safety, then, 
must depend upon the seasonable arrival of such reenforcements as will oblige him to raise the siege. 
The Virginia line is much more remote than we 
could have thought it would have been, at this moment. Your Excellency, in person, might rescue us 
all. Virginia and North Carolina would follow you. 
The glory of foiling the enemy in his last great effort, and terminating the war, ought to be reserved 
for you. Whatever fortune attends us, I shall, to my 
latest moments, feel that veneration and attachment, 
which I always had for your Excellency; and I beg 
leave to continue to subscribe myself, 
</p><p>
Your faithful Aid, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jol" rel="me">JOHN LAURENS</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I entreat your Excellency's pardon for transmitting the annexed letter, in its present imperfect 
state. It was a sketch, which I intended to have 
put in better form, if time had permitted.

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
When I last had the honor of writing to your Excellency, the enemy had not extended their operations beyond their place of arms on Wappoo Neck. 
On the 29th ultimo they crossed Ashley River, in 
force, one mile above the ferry. The next day they 
advanced to Gibbes's, a convenient landing, about two 
miles from town, having previously -collected a number of boats at the opposite shore, for the purpose of 
crossing their heavy artillery and stores. My battalion of light infantry, posted there to prevent a surprise or too sudden approach of the enemy, was 
ordered not to engage seriously, but skirmish with 
advanced parties, retiring slowly and orderly towards 
town, as there was no object in maintaining any advanced post, and the advantages of a serious affair 
were all on the side of the enemy. 
</p><p>
On the night of the 1st instant, the enemy broke 
ground, and have been working slowly ever since. I 
scarcely know how to denominate what they have 
executed hitherto. It consists of several redoubts, 
with a covered communication from right to left, 
which is still unfinished. Their nearest work is an 
inclosed battery on their left, at about the distance 
of six hundred yards, which indus me to believe, 
that they intend the line in question for a first parallel, although some parts of it are rather too remote. 
Our shells and shot have disquieted them, and interrupted their operations; but <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a>, sensible 
of the value of these articles in a siege, economizes 
them as much as possible. Fatigue parties are constantly employed in improving our works. The whole 
front of our lines, within the abatis, is armed with 
wolf-traps. All this affords an excellent defence 
against storm, but must finally yield to a perseverance in regular approaches, which appears to be Clinton's present plan, unless we can work under his fire 
as fast as he can, and afford time for the arrival of 
your Excellency. 
</p><p>
Our obstructions in Cooper River are completed ; 
which gives a prospect of our maintaining a communication with the country, and hitherto prevents 
the accomplishment of the investiture. Since the 
arrival of General Woodford, <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a> will 
have it in his power to execute his plan of establishing the necessary posts for this purpose, on the eastern shore of the river. Colonel Malmedy is to take 
command of the troops destined for that service. 
</p><p>
The enemy's squadron of seven armed ships, three of which are two-deckers, and two transports, availed 
itself of a brisk southern breeze to pass Fort Moultrie yesterday afternoon. The Admiral's ship led the 
van, and escaped without apparent injury; the frigate which followed her. had her fore topmast carried 
away ; a large transport, in the rear of the whole, 
ran aground, and, after receiving some shot from Sullivan's Island, was fired and abandoned by her crew. 
The remainder are now anchored near the ruins of 
Fort Johnson, out of the reach of our cannon. 
</p><p>
My notice of the present opportunity was so sudden, that I have not been able to make atonement 
for my last hurried letter. Helving upon your Excellency's goodness, I have preferred writing, at any 
rate, to total silence, and losing an occasion of repeating the assurances of attachment and veneration, 
with which I have the honor to be, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's faithful Aid, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jol" rel="me">JOHN LAURENS</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I beg to be respectfully presented to Mrs. 
<a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>. The reason above mentioned makes me 
trouble your Excellency to present my love to the 
family, as I shall not be able to write to any of 
them.
