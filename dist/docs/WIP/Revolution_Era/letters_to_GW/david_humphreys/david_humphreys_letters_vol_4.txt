</p><p>
My dear General, 
</p><p>
I did not trouble you with a letter from <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>, 
because our public despatch to the Secretary at War, 
would inform you of our proceedings to that time. 
Besides, the oppressive nature of the intolerable heat, 
and the exertion we were obliged to make to get 
forward on our journey, occasioned such a relaxation 
and consequent sickness, as rendered me almost incapable of writing. We are all now well. 
</p><p>
After a fatiguing journey through the deep sands which prevail from <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> to <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a>, we reached 
the latter on the evening of the 17th instant. We 
intended to remain there one day, to make arrangements with the Executive for the negotiation, and to 
take measures for forwarding our stores, which were 
expected at <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a>, by water, in a few days. But, 
upon receiving information from Messrs. <a href='/results.php?tla=anp' rel='met colleague'>Pickens</a> and 
Osborne, that the Indians were growing very impatient to return to their homes, and that they could not 
possibly be detained but a few days longer, we recommenced our journey that evening. The next day, 
the iron axle-tree of our carriage broke, at a great 
distance from any house, which accident occasioned 
the loss of the whole day. Being determined to arrive at the Rock Landing the following evening, according to our last letter to Mr. McGillivray, <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='co-worker met'>General Lincoln</a> and myself took two of the carriagehorses, wdth a guide, and proceeded twenty-five miles 
that night. Yesterday we reached this place at dark, 
after having travelled a long distance before we 
reached the Ogechee, and from the Ogechee to the 
Oconee (between thirty and forty miles), through a 
dreary wilderness, in which there was not a single 
house. Mr. Griffin, with ^Mr. Few and Colonel Franks, 
were to come on as soon as the carriage could be 
mended, for which arrangements were made before 
we left them. 
</p><p>
We announced our arrival, and readiness to proceed 
to business, to McGillivray, last night. He is about 
three miles on the other side of the Oconee, with all 
the Indians, and we have not yet seen him. It is 
but justice to say, that from every thing which we 
have yet learned, the former Commissioners have conducted themselves, with respect to the present negotiations, in a very commendable manner. The Executive have resolved to give his every aid and facility in 
the business. We have not been here long enough to 
be assured of the prospects of success, or to know the 
difficulties that may occur. All we can say is, that 
we shall act with all the zeal and perseverance to 
promote the public service, which may be in our 
power. It is a favorable circumstance, that the present Commission is certainly very acceptable to the 
whole State, unless a few land-jobbers be accepted. 
It is also pretty well ascertained, that McGillivray is 
desirous of peace ; and his word is a law to the 
Creeks. With my best respects to Mrs. Washington, 
love to the children, and compliments to the gentlemen of the family, I have the honor to be, my dear 
General, 
</p><p>
With the purest attachment, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=dah" rel="me">David Humphreys</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. The number of Indians, I believe, does not 
amount to more than two thousand, notwithstanding 
the exaggerated accounts we had received.

</p><p>
My dear General, 
</p><p>
Finding an opportunity to <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a>, I could not 
excuse myself from giving you the progress of our 
negotiation since my last. 
</p><p>
On Monday last (that is to say, the day after the 
arrival of <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='co-worker met'>General Lincoln</a> and myself), a Deputation 
from all the Creeks of the Tuccasee, the Hallowing, 
and the Tallassee Kings, waited upon us, to congratulate us on our arrival ; to express^ in general terms, 
their desire of peace ; to smoke the pipe of friendship 
as a token of it; and to brush our faces with the 
white wing of reconciliation, in sign of their sincere 
intention to wipe away all past grievances. We gave 
them friendly assurances in return. They, with the 
fat King, the Euchee King, and two or three other 
great Chiefs, dined with us, and seemed well satisfied. In the afternoon, we crossed to the Indian 
camp, had an interview with McGillivray, showed him 
our full powers, and asked, in writing, for such evidence of theirs as the nature of the case would admit. Much general talk, expressive of a real desire 
to establish a permanent peace upon equitable terms, 
took place. 
</p><p>
The next day, McGillivray dined with us; and, although he got very much intoxicated, he seemed to 
retain his recollection and reason beyond what I had 
ever seen in a person when in the same condition. At 
this time I became intimate, to a certain degree, with 
him, and endeavoured to extract his real sentiments 
and feelings, in a conversation alone, confidentially. 
He declared he w^as really desirous of a peace ; that 
the local situation of the Creeks required that they 
should be connected with us rather than any other 
people ; that, however, they had certain advantages in 
their treaty with Spain, in respect to a guaranty and 
trade, which they ought not, in justice to themselves, 
to give up without an equivalent. Upon his desiring 
to know what were our intentions, especially as he 
knew from my character, and from my having been 
long in habits of intimacy with <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague'>General Washington</a>, 
that I would tell him what he might depend upon, 
I assured him, upon my honor, that our policy with 
respect to his nation was indeed founded upon honesty, magnanimity, and mutual advantages. We descended to no particulars, farther than my assuring 
him of our good opinion of his abilities, and desire to 
attach him, upon principles perfectly consistent with 
the good of his nation, to our interest. I concluded 
by intimating what, in that case, we might possibly 
consider ourselves at liberty to do for him. Mr. Griffin arrived that night. 
</p><p>
Wednesday was occupied in arranging the proposed 
draught of a treaty, and drawing up a talk to be delivered the next day. The other Commissioners desired me to go over the Oconee, and communicate 
these draughts in confidence to McGillivray. I did, 
and found him dissatisfied with the proposed boundary, and some other things. <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='co-worker met'>General Lincoln</a> had, 
in the morning, been in McGillivray's camp, and 
agreed with him that the Chiefs should receive our 
propositions at our camp ; but, finding a jealousy prevailed with some of the Indians, lest a design might 
be formed to circumvent them, on my return we 
wrote that, if it was more convenient, we would make 
our communications in their camp. This proposal 
they acquiesced in very gratefully. On Thursday, at 
eleven o'clock, we were received with more etiquette 
than ever I had before witnessed, at the great ceremony of Blade Drink. We made our communications 
in the square of the nation, and returned. 
</p><p>
Yesterday morning McGillivray wrote to us that 
the Chiefs had been in Council until late the night 
before; that they objected to some part of our talks, 
and principally to that which related to boundary; 
that it w^as, however, his decision that the matter 
should rest as it was for the present ; and that a kind 
of truce should be established until they should hear 
further from us on the part of the United States. 
111 the mean time, he signified that some presents to 
the Chiefs would be necessary. In answer, we wrote 
him, after recapitulating the substance of his letter, 
that, as the Chiefs objected to some of the articles 
proposed by us, we desired to receive from them in 
writing the only terms upon which they would enter 
into a treaty with us ; that we were as well prepared 
to treat now as we should be at any other time ; we 
did not believe that it was by any means probable 
that the United States would ever send another Commission to them; and that we were not authorized to 
make any presents whatever, unless we should conclude a treaty of peace with them. 
</p><p>
Finding, from verbal information, that a capital misconception had happened to the Indian Chiefs, with 
regard to one of the rivers marked in the boundary, 
the other Commissioner wished me to go over to the 
Creek camp, explain the mistake to McGillivray, and 
make the necessary alteration in the draught. I had 
a very long private conversation with him, and he 
appeared for himself to be much better contented tho.n 
he had hitherto been. The difficulties in regard to 
boundaries seemed to be in a great measure overcome; and an apprehension of the ill consequences of 
their breaking with Spain, together with an earnest 
solicitude to have a free, unincumbered port, were 
now apparently the great obstacles. He was very 
much agitated, very much embarrassed, and hardly 
knew what to determine upon. 
</p><p>
After I left him, he expressed to an interpreter a 
belief, that a permanent peace might take place before we parted. How that may be, probably this day 
will decide. In the afternoon, yesterday, McGillivray 
sent over John Galphin, with Galphin's father-in-law, 
the Hallowing King, to acquaint us that all the 
towns, except the Cowetas, were removed about two 
miles back, for the sake of pasture for their horses. 
Should they go off without any further discussions, 
it will be a clear indication that they prefer a connection with Spain rather than with America; and 
that they wish for war rather than for peace. 
</p><p>
I have not leisure to give you a description of 
the person and character of McGillivray. His countenance has nothing liberal and open in it; it has, 
however, sufficient marks of understanding. In short, 
he appears to have the good sense of an American, 
the shrewdness of a Scotchman, and the cunning of 
an Indian. I think he is so much addicted to debauchery, that he will not live four years. He dresses 
altogether in the Indian fashion, and is rather slovenly than otherwise. His influence is probably as 
great as we have understood it was ; and his services 
may certainly be very important, if he can be sincerely attached to our interests. I hope to have 
hereafter the honor of reporting to you the substance 
of several confidential discourses, which have occurred 
between him and me. 
</p><p>
My most affectionate regards to Mrs. Washington 
and the family. Conclude me with every sentiment 
of devotion and consideration, my dear General, 
Your most obliged friend and humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=dah" rel="me">David Humphreys</a>.  
</p><p>
P. S. The Commissioners have acted perfectly harmoniously in every measure which they have hitherto 
taken. The characters of <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='co-worker met'>General Lincoln</a> and Mr. Griffin have the greatest weight with McGillivray 
and the Creeks.

</p><p>
My dear General, 
</p><p>
Since I had the honor of writing to you yesterday, 
some things have happened, of which I conceive it 
expedient to give information by this conveyance. 
</p><p>
On the evening of the 25th, McGillivray omitted 
to comply with his positive promise, to write to us, 
or come over the river, in order to explain the objections of the Chiefs to the project of the treaty 
which we had proposed to them, and to propose alterations. Instead of removing, as he had intimated by 
Galphin, two miles back, for the sake of pasture, we 
were informed, in the forenoon yesterday, that he had 
set out on his return to the nation, without even 
deigning to send us any written or verbal message. It 
is true, he permitted an Indian trader to inform us 
(of his own motion) of this fact, and that he (McGillivray) would halt for that day, at Commissioners' 
Creek, fifteen or eighteen miles distant. 
</p><p>
McGillivray's pretences for this movement homeward 
(if rightly reported) are of the most frivolous and 
unjustifiable nature. He is said to pretend to be dissatisfied, that, in a private conversation, I had questioned the powers of himself and those present, to 
make a treaty that would be binding upon the whole 
nation. The fact is far otherwise. When he spoke 
of the invalidity of some of the treaties between 
Georgia and the Creeks, because the latter were not 
fully represented, I asked him how it was to be 
proved, that their nation was fully represented at 
this time. I lamented that the uncivilized state of 
the nation would not perhaps admit of the same evidence to legalize proceedings, - which civilized nations 
required, and inquired whether the White Lieutenant 
(a very great Chief, not present) would agree to whatever should now be done. It is farther said, by the 
Indian trader above mentioned, that McGillivray pretended I had told him that, upon making this treaty 
with us, he must entirely break with the Spanish 
Government. I told him, on the contrary, that, as far 
as I could learn from him the nature of his connection with Spain, I did not suppose the proposed treaty to be incompatible with it ; that I would not wish 
him to do any thing which should in the least injure his good faith ; but that, if a connection with us and 
with Spain w\as incompatible, it was doubtless in his 
option to decide which of the two powers he would 
be connected with. 
</p><p>
These misrepresentations are not the only reprehensible things we have seen in his conduct. He 
made a false pretext, " that the Indians were so much 
alarmed for their personal safely that they dared not 
trust themselves in our camp, and that two towns 
w^ere on the point of going home, on the same account," in order that we might go over and make 
our talk in their camp. And, indeed, he insists that, 
though we were formerly, wdien connected with Britain, styled their father and older brother, yet we 
are at present truly their younger brother. The falsehood of the pretext that the Indians were so much 
alarmed for their safety that they dared not trust 
themselves in our camp, was clearly evinced yesterday. About eleven o'clock, almost or quite all the 
principal Chiefs of the Upper and Lower towns, with 
a great number of individuals, came over to shake 
hands with us, and to assure us, in a long talk, that 
they were not at all offended with us ; that they desired peace very much ; that, though they could not conclude a  peace without McGillivray, their "beloved man, 
who was sick, yet they had inculcated upon all 
their people to abstain from all hostility and plundering, under threats of the severest punishment. In 
short, they seemed to consider a peace as mutually 
wished for, and in fact agreed upon, except in the forms. 
</p><p>
In answer, we gave them assurances that the 
United States entertained the most just and friendly 
dispositions towards them, and hoped that a treaty 
might still be concluded before we separated finally. 
We wished them to use their influence with McGillivray, that he would return and renew the negotiation. For which purpose we informed them we were 
sending one more pressing message to McGillivray, by 
<a href='/results.php?tla=anp' rel='met colleague'>General Pickens</a> and Mr. Few, who went, soon after, 
to see him accordingly. Several of the Kings dined 
with us, and remained until night, with the greatest 
possible apparent good humor, and indications of a 
sincere desire for peace. 
</p><p>
The White Bird King spoke first, in the name of 
the whole. The Tallassee King, after dinner, made a 
long, and, as well as we could understand from an 
indifferent interpretation, a pathetic oration to all the 
Kings, head men, and people, urging the necessity of 
being in strict amity with the whites, as they prized 
their existence and every thing dear to them. All 
were greatly affected, and some shed tears. The only 
great representative from the Seminoles, sent back, 
after he left us, a confirmation of the same good dispositions, by the interpreter. Upon the whole, I 
believe that no room for doubt was left in the mind 
of any one present, that, if a peace shall not be concluded, the fault will rest with McGillivray alone, who holds up, in his conversations, as it best suits 
his convenience, that he does every thing himself in 
national affairs ; or, that he can do nothing without 
humoring and consulting the Indians. It is a melancholy consideration, to reflect that a whole nation 
must sometimes perish for the sins of one man. 
</p><p>
I shall defer closing this letter until the return of 
<a href='/results.php?tla=anp' rel='met colleague'>General Pickens</a> and Mr. Few. While I feel a consciousness that our transactions will stand approved 
in the eye of reason and justice, I apprehend that 
we never can depend upon McGillivray for his firm 
attachment to the interests of the United States. 
And yet I believe he regards the interests of the 
United States just as much as he does the interests 
of the Creek nation. If I mistake not his character, 
his own importance and pecuniary emolument are the 
objects which will altogether influence his conduct. 
It was held out, in discourse, yesterday, by John Galphin, a creature of McGillivray, that a pressing invitation has just been sent from the Spaniards, accompanied by a vast quantity of ammunition, for McGillivray to come and treat with them. I fancy that 
he now wavers between Spain and America 3 for which 
reason he wishes, in all likelihood, to postpone the 
further negotiation with the latter until the spring. 
It is, however, questionable whether he has ever had 
a formal treaty with, or received a genuine commission from, the King of Spain. Probably his hopes 
have been much elevated lately, insomuch as to induce him to believe that he can obtain better terms 
for himself from the King than from us. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=anp' rel='met colleague'>General Pickens</a> and Mr. Few are just now returned, and report that they found McGillivray not 
at the distance he was said to be, but on the other 
side of the Ocmulgee. He would not give the terms 
on which the Creeks would make peace, or come 
back to renew the negotiations on the subject. He 
objected only to three articles; — being under the protection of the United States; not having a port perfectly free from duties ; and the proposed boundary. 
But his objection seemed to be of the least weight 
with himself, against the last. They fully coincide 
with me in opinion that he is determined to see 
whether he cannot obtain more advantageous terms 
from Spain than from the United States. 
</p><p>
The fact is also said by these gentlemen to be established, that a large quantity of arms and ammunition has lately arrived in the Creek nation, with a 
friendly talk from the Governor of Pensacola. McGillivray wrote us a letter in very general terms, in 
which he affected to consider our first draught of a 
treaty as our ultimatum. This was both contrary to 
his good sense, and to repeated positive assurances. 
We shall write to him by an Indian trader, today, 
very exiDlicitly ; and, after taking such forther measures to ascertain facts as may be in our power, we 
shall commence our journey through North Carolina 
to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. Thus the business seems to be terminated for the present ; though not according to our 
wishes. With sentiments of the purest respect, I 
have the honor to be, my dear General,

</p><p>
My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
I have forwarded to <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, for your information, the continuation of my proceedings until the 
present time. You will be pleased to observe, by my 
letter to him of this date, that the Court of Lisbon, 
having, from a desire of opening an official intercourse 
with the United States, made the first advances, by 
appointing a Minister Resident to repair thither, now 
finds it an unpleasant and difficult task to tread back 
the steps it has thus, as an elder nation, taken in 
respect to us. It would doubtless be desirable to 
meet those advances, if it may be done without impropriety. 
</p><p>
I do not know what particular reasons exist on the 
part of the Government of the United States (except 
those which relate to expenses), that might induce it 
to decline making an appointment, which would be 
so satisfactory to this Court. There seems to be considerable force in what the Chevalier de Pinto has 
alleged, with the intent to obviate the embarrassments, 
on account of the pecuniary provision. The proper 
and necessary expenses of a Charge des Affaires will, 
I believe, be pretty nearly the same in every respect, 
with those of a Minister Resident. Should I have 
the honor of being nominated in the latter quality, 
in return for the Chevalier de Freire, by the best 
inquiries I have been able to make, I think, as a 
single man, I may establish a household, and, with 
good economy, live decently, in such a manner as 
not to discredit myself or my nation, for the salary 
annexed to the office of Charge des Affaires. If, therefore, a change of the name should take place, I 
should expect it to be with a restriction to the salary 
of a Charge des Affaires. In case of appointment to 
either grade, according to permission of the act of 
Congress, I suppose, however, a sum not exceeding 
(nor less than) a year's salary will be granted to the 
person so appointed, for the purchase of furniture, &c. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a> well remembers what inconveniences 
resulted to him, from the want of such a provision for outfits, and how indispensably necessary it will be, under all circumstances, at the beginning. 
Here the difference between hiring a house furnished, 
or unfurnished, is much greater than in France. The 
rent of a good house, unfurnished, but beautifully 
situated, in the neighbourhood of Lisbon, is very reasonable. 
</p><p>
I would not have troubled you with these details, 
trifling in themselves, though, under certain circumstances, they may be somewhat interesting to me, had 
not the Minister of her Most Faithful Majesty seemed so much attached to the idea of continuing the 
appointment of Minister Resident to his friend, the 
Chevalier de Freire, that I am induced to imagine a 
refusal, on our part, to make an exchange in that 
grade, would not only prevent that gentleman from 
going to America at all, but perhaps any arrangement for the exchange of diplomatic characters, for 
the present. This Court having recalled its Ambassador from Rome, to succeed the Chevalier de Freire 
at London, this last-mentioned gentleman must be entirely thrown out of employment, until some vacancy 
shall happen ; and the Court may have to encounter 
either the real or pretended difficulty of not being 
able to find a character, suitable and willing to fill 
the office of a Charge des Affaires in the United 
States. A similar real or pretended difficulty, you 
may recollect, has long existed in the British Cabinet. 
</p><p>
I only beg leave farther to suggest, in case an 
appointment of any nature whatsoever should be 
made by the Executive of America to this Court, 
whether it would not be a good opportunity for you, 
as Chief Magistrate of the United States, to write a 
short letter to the Queen, in your own hand (to be 
presented at the first audience, with the public eredentials), expressive of your sense of the friendly dispositions her Majesty has manifested towards the 
United States, especially in the orders given for the 
Portuguese fleets to afford any succour to American 
vessels, and to protect them from the Algerine corsairs. 
This singular instance of attention, which has, in fact, 
been very useful to our Mediterranean trade, seems 
to merit, on our part, some particular notice. The 
Queen would probably be much flattered by your 
likewise taking occasion to express a desire of cultivating the amity and commerce, which so happily subsist between the two nations, and which (being founded 
upon principles of mutual advantage, without any interfering claims or discordant interests) promise to be 
of long and beneficial continuance. With every sentiment of affection and respect, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c.,

</p><p>
My dear General, 
</p><p>
I wrote your Excellency some time ago from <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>, and inclosed you the draft of a letter on the 
subject we talked of when I left <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>. I 
hope you have duly received it, though I shall not 
be free from anxiety until I know with certainty that 
has been the case. 
</p><p>
When I wrote that letter, I was in hopes that it 
might have been in my power, before this time, to 
give you a favorable account of the complexion of 
politics in this State. It is true we have done some 
negative good ; we have prevented an emission of 
paper money and tender acts from taking place. But 
I am sorry to say, we have done nothing in aid of 
the Federal Government. The only requisition of Congress we have complied with, is a recent one for raising troops, on account of an Indian war, as is given 
out ; but some conjecture, for other purposes. The 
Assembly has this day given me the command of a 
regiment, part to be raised in this State, and a part 
in the other New England States. I have been advised by our friends to accept it for the present ; 
which I shall accordingly do. 
</p><p>
The troubles in Massachusetts still continue. Government is prostrated in the dust. And it is much 
to be feared that there is not energy enough in that 
State to reestablish the civil powers. The leaders of 
the mob, whose fortune and measures are desperate, 
are strengthening themselves daily; and it is expected that they will soon take possession of the Continental magazine at Springfield, in which there are 
from ten to fifteen thousand stand of arms, in excellent order. 
</p><p>
A general want of compliance with the requisitions of Congress for money, seems to prognosticate 
that we are rapidly advancing to a crisis. The wheels 
of the great political machine can scarcely continue 
to move much longer, under this present embarrassment. Congress, I am told, are seriously alarmed, 
and hardly know which way to turn, or what to expect. Indeed, my dear General, nothing but a good Providence can extricate us from our present difficulties, and prevent some terrible convulsion. 
</p><p>
In case of civil discord, I have already told you it 
was seriously my opinion that you could not remain 
neuter, and that you would be obliged, in self-defence, 
to take part on one side or the other, or withdraw 
from the Continent. Your friends are of the same 
opinion; and I believe you are convinced that it is 
impossible to have more disinterested and zealous 
friends than those who have been about your person. 
I write with the more confidence, as this letter 
will be delivered by Mr. Austin and Mr. Morse, two 
young clergymen, educated at this University, who 
are travelling to the southern part of the Union, for 
the sake of acquiring knowledge of their own country. I beg leave to recommend them to your civilities; and to assure you, in offering my best respects
