SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letters of the 12th and 13th instant, to <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel=''>General Schuyler</a>, have been by him communicated to me. Considering that my letter to him 
of the 5th, the day before I left <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, was 
not delivered, and one I wrote to him whilst on the 
march to this place has miscarried, and that your 
Excellency has had no intimation of the motions and 
destination of our army, I do not wonder that you 
should have some doubts about the propriety of my 
conduct, though it gives me a very painful sensation 
to know myself, but for a moment, the subject of 
a doubt with you. I have, however, the strongest 
hopes, when your Excellency comes to be fully in 
formed of our situation and force, you will not condemn me ; and, although I am not solicitous about 
the opinion of the world, though very far from Disregarding it, I wish to hold a character with your 
Excellency something more than merely negative. 
</p><p>
Returns of the strength of my garrison were regularly transmitted to <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel=''>General Schuyler</a>, and by him, no 
doubt, to you. By them, your Excellency will see, 
that our force consisted of little more than two thou 
sand effectives. With these, I had lines and redoubts 
of more than a league in extent to defend. Judge how poorly they could have been defended by these 
numbers, had they been perfected, which they were 
very far from being. In fact, they were not defensible at all upon the <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> side, unless the enemy would have been so complaisant as to attack us 
in front of the old French lines, and take no notice 
of the flanks of them, which were both open. We 
had, last year, nine thousand men at these posts, and 
they were found barely, sufficient for the defence of 
the works. The system was a little altered this sea 
son, but not so as to make a smaller number answer, 
but to make a greater number necessary. 
</p><p>
The enemy had nearly invested us, nothing being 
wanting to complete it but their occupying a -narrow 
neck of land, betwixt the East Creek and the Lake, 
on the Mount Independence side. This, I had information, would certainly take place in the course of 
the next twenty-four hours, and had been left open so 
long only with a view to intercept any cattle that 
we might bring in from the country, and then our 
communication would have been effectually cut off. 
We could have received neither supplies of provisions 
nor reenforcements, for, depend upon it, Sir, the militia of this country cannot yet be brought on to raise a siege. 
</p><p>
But, it may be asked, why I had not called in the militia to assist in the defence of the posts. For 
this plain reason, I had not provision for them, and 
very little prospect of an effectual supply. When I 
first had notice of the approach of the enemy, there 
was no more than ten days provision in store for the 
troops then upon the ground. To have called in the 
militia, in that situation, would have been certain 
ruin. So soon as a supply arrived, although but a 
scanty one, I did call for them, and about nine hundred joined me the day before the resolution to evacuate the posts was taken. They had come out in 
such a hurry, and almost entirely without clothes, 
they did not propose to remain but a very few days 
at the utmost. The term of Learned and Wells's 
regiments, which made part of the garrison, expired 
also in two days, and the commanding officers had 
acquainted me that they could not prevail upon the 
men to remain beyond the time they were engaged 
for. Your Excellency knows, but too well, the disposition of these people on such occasions. 
</p><p>
The batteries of the enemy were ready to open in 
three different quarters, and our whole camp, on the 
<a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> side, was exposed to the fire of each ; 
and, as soon as they did open, every man I had 
must have been constantly on duty, as, from our 
weakness, of which the enemy could not be ignorant, 
I had reason, every moment, to expect an assault. 
Judge, Sir, how long we could have sustained it, or 
whether our resistance must not have been a very 
feeble one indeed, especially when you take into the 
account that a great number were mere boys, and 
that not more than a tenth part were furnished with 
bayonets. 
</p><p>
Revolving these circumstances in my mind, I was 
at no loss to determine what part I ought to take ; 
but I thought it prudent to take the sense of the 
other General Officers. A copy of the Council has 
been transmitted to your Excellency by General Schuy-ler. They were unanimously of opinion that the posts 
ought to be evacuated immediately; wisely, in my 
judgment, considering that a retreat, even with the 
loss of our cannon and stores, if it could be effected, 
would be of infinitely greater service to the country, 
and bring less disgrace upon our arms, than an army, 
although a small one, taken prisoners, with their 
cannon and stores. I was fully in sentiment with 
them, and believe I should have ordered the retreat, 
if they had been of a contrary way of thinking. 
</p><p>
But here, again, it may be asked why, when I 
found myself in the situation I have described, I did not retreat sooner, when every thing might have been 
saved. I have only to answer that, until the enemy 
sat down before the place, I believed the small garrison I had to be sufficient. The intelligence that 
Congress had received, that no serious attempt in 
that quarter was intended, as it gained credit with 
them, I never doubted, and was unwilling to be the 
occasion of- drawing off any part of your army, as 
your operations might thereby be rendered less vigorous; and I knew, too, that you could very ill spare 
them. Besides, until the case became so urgent that 
I had no alternative but the evacuation of my posts, 
or the loss of the army, it did not lie with me to 
determine upon. 
</p><p>
The retreat was begun a little before day, on the 
6th instant, unperceived by the enemy, after having 
embarked as much of the stores and provision, and 
as many of the cannon, as was possible in the course 
of one very short night ; and our march would probably have been unperceived for some time, if General Ferrnoy's house had not been set on fire. How 
that happened, I know not. I had previously given 
orders against burning any of the buildings, that our 
march might be the longer concealed ; but it served 
to the enemy as the signal of our leaving the place, 
and, in consequence, they were upon the Mount be 
fore our rear was clear of it, and fired a few times 
upon it, but without effect. 
</p><p>
Colonel Long, with his regiment, and a detachment 
from the other regiments, and the invalids with the 
hospital, were sent to Skenesborough, by water ; while 
I took the road to the same place, through Castleton, 
with the body of the army. As the enemy were at 
least four times my numbers, I had nothing for it 
but a forced march ; and I pressed it as much as 
possible, and reached Castleton that night, thirty miles 
from <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, having, on our way, fallen in with 
and dispersed a party of the enemy, from whom we 
took twenty head of cattle, three British prisoners, 
and five Canadians. 
</p><p>
The rear guard, under Colonel Warner, which, with 
those that had failed upon the march, amounted to a 
thousand, imprudently halted six miles short of Castleton, and wasted so much time in the morning, that 
they were overtaken and surprised by a strong detachment from <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, which had been sent up 
the East Bay, which runs into the country very near 
the place where he was. They sustained the attack 
with great bravery, but were finally obliged to give 
way, with the loss of about fifty killed and wounded. 
On the first of the firing, I sent orders to two regiments of militia, who had left me the night before, 
and were lodged within two miles of Colonel Warner's post, to move up to his assistance, which had 
they done, that party would have been cut off. But, 
instead of that, they made all possible haste to rejoin 
me, and at the same instant I received the account 
of the enemy's being in possession of Skenesborough, 
and having taken and destroyed every thing that 
had been sent there. 
</p><p>
I was then constrained to change my route, both that 
I might avoid the being put between two fires, and 
that I might be able to bring off Colonel Warner. I 
therefore sent him orders to retire to Rutland, where 
he would find me to cover him. A considerable part 
of his detachment joined me at that place, and he, 
with about ninety more, two days afterwards, at Man 
chester. A great many are still missing, though few, 
I believe, have fallen into the enemy's hands, as they 
did not pursue Colonel Warner but a very small distance, and, from all accounts, suffered much in the 
action. The ninth regiment followed Colonel Long 
towards Fort Ann, and were almost entirely cut off. 
I have despatched officers to Bennington and Number Four to pick up the stragglers who, I suppose, 
have taken these routes to New England; and, on the 12th instant, I joined <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel=''>General Schuyler</a>, at this place, after a very fatiguing march. 
</p><p>
Thus, Sir, I have laid before you, without the least 
reserve, every thing I can recollect respecting <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, and the retreat from thence. Happy should I 
be, if my conduct therein meets with your approbation ; and I can, with the strictest truth, affirm I was 
actuated by no motives but what sprang from a sincere regard for the public welfare. I have the honor 
to be your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
ARTHUR ST. CLAIR.
