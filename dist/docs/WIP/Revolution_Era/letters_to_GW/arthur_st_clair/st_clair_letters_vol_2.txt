DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I informed you yesterday, that an encampment of the enemy 
had been discovered at Gilliland's Creek. Last night two of their 
vessels came up to Crown Point, and this morning there are 
seven lying at that place. The rest of their fleet is probably but a little lower down, as we hear their morning guns distinctly at 
different places. They have also debarked some troops, and en 
camped upon Chimney Point. Whether they have landed at 
Crown Point, or not, my scout-boat did not discover, not daring 
to venture far enough down the lake, on account of the shipping; 
but I have sent out a scout on this side, which, I doubt not, will 
bring a just account of their situation. 
</p><p>
I cannot help repeating to you the disagreeable situation we 
are in ; nor can I see the least prospect of our being able to defend the post, unless the militia come in. And should the enemy 
protract their operations, or invest us, and content themselves 
with a simple blockade, we are infallibly ruined. 
</p><p>
I have thoughts of calling for the Berkshire militia, which are 
nearest to us, and will probably be the most alert to come to our assistance, because they are in some measure covered by this 
post; but on that I shall consult the other General Officers. This, 
however, is clear to me, that we shall be obliged to abandon this 
side, and then they will soon force the other from us; nor do I 
see that a retreat will in any shape be practicable. Every thing, 
however, shall be done that is possible to frustrate the enemy's 
designs. But what can be expected from troops ill armed, naked, 
and unaccoutred ? I shall write you again as soon as the scout 
returns ; and am, dear General, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
ARTHUR ST. CLAIR.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
About an hour ago, I received your favor of yesterday. I 
wrote you from <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> the night before we left it, to 
inform you that I intended to march to Skenesborough by the 
way of Castleton, and from thence to <a href='/results.php?city=fort edward' rel='city'>Fort Edward</a> ; but when I 
got to Castleton I found the enemy were in possession of Skenesborough, which obliged me to change my route. 
</p><p>
On the march to Castleton, we fell in with a party commanded 
by Captain Frazer, who had been collecting cattle in the country. 
These were immediately dispersed, and a few prisoners taken ; 
but, being reenforced by a strong detachment from <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, 
they attacked, in the morning, the rear-guard of our army, who 
had imprudently stopped six miles short of the main body, and 
were, I believe, rather surprised ; notwithstanding which they made a very obstinate defence, and, I have good reason to think, killed 
and wounded a great number of the enemy. As they were at 
too great a distance for me to support them, I sent orders to 
Colonel Warner, who commanded the party, in case he found 
himself too hard pressed, to retreat to Rutland, and join me. He 
is not yet come in, though I have heard that he is coming in 
with about a hundred men; and a great part of the other regiments, except Hall's, have already joined us. 
</p><p>
I am in great distress for provisions. If I can be supplied at 
Manchester, I shall proceed directly for <a href='/results.php?city=fort edward' rel='city'>Fort Edward</a>, or Sara 
toga, as circumstances may direct; if not, I shall be obliged to 
go to <a href='/results.php?city=bennington' rel='city'>Bennington</a>. I account myself very happy in effecting this 
retreat, as the loss of the army, small as it is, would have been a blow that this part of the country would have felt severely, 
and that must inevitably have happened in a very few days. 
Adieu, my dear General ; I hope to see you soon, or things in a 
better train. 
</p><p>
I am, Sir, your very humble servant, 
</p><p>
ARTHUR ST. CLAIR.

SIR, 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=aab' rel=''>Colonel Burr</a> arrived here about three o clock, from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel=''>General McDougall</a>, and brings intelligence of the surrender of the Fort upon Verplank's Point, yesterday, 
about eleven o clock, by capitulation. The garrison 
are prisoners of war, and the officers have liberty to 
wear their side-arms. 
</p><p>
I have no letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel=''>General McDougall</a>; but he 
is clearly of opinion the enemy mean to attack the 
posts (at least Fort Arnold, the carrying of which 
would open to them the navigation of the river) 
in the Highlands. <a href='/results.php?tla=aab' rel=''>Colonel Burr</a> informs me, that, 
by landing near where Fort Montgomery stood, and 
marching to the Forest of Dean, they would fall intoa clove, which runs entirely round that ridge on 
which the forts are situated, and through which a 
road might be made almost as fast as an army could 
march. By this clove <a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel=''>General McDougall</a> thinks the 
forts will be invested. Betwixt this clove and Smith's 
is a chain of hideous mountains, but through them 
are, no doubt, many passes, with which they may 
be made acquainted by the inhabitants whom they 
have debauched, and would thereby be able to give 
much annoyance to any convoys that might pass by 
Smith's, supposing it necessary to make use of that 
road. 
</p><p>
It seems to be <a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel=''>General McDougall</a>'s wish that I 
should move to <a href='/results.php?city=new windsor' rel='city'>New Windsor</a>, and he thinks that the 
occupying Butter Hill might prevent the attack upon 
Fort Arnold from the upper side. At the same time 
the state of the provision is very alarming. Not 
much above three weeks in the respective forts, and 
the militia called in; and their principal dependence 
for further supplies is upon their being transported 
across the country, from Sussex or Delaware. 
</p><p>
I think I could easily reach <a href='/results.php?city=new windsor' rel='city'>New Windsor</a>, or at 
least be so far advanced, through the clove, as to be 
out of all clanger of being intercepted. But it is necessary first to have intelligence from the river, lest 
the parts of your army on this side of it should be 
too much separated, and exposed to be beaten by 
piecemeal. This I will endeavour to procure, and act 
according to circumstances, of which I will take care 
to give your Excellency notice. Notwithstanding the 
general opinion, that the forts are the enemy's object, 
<a href='/results.php?tla=aab' rel=''>Colonel Burr</a> mentions circumstances that leave it 
still doubtful. Their troops are landed at various 
places on the east side of the river, and at Haverstraw on the west; and, after the surrender of the 
fort, their largest armed vessel, supposed to be of 
eighteen guns, and a galley, which had passed be 
fore, were seen towing down again. 
</p><p>
As the passage through the clove is somewhat dangerous for single persons, I shall send two horsemen 
back with <a href='/results.php?tla=aab' rel=''>Colonel Burr</a>, and shall, through him, communicate to <a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel=''>General McDougall</a> verbally. It may, 
perhaps, be necessary to form a march through the 
clove, in which case, I shall leave my baggage at this 
place, to be forwarded afterwards, as your Excellency 
may think proper. 
</p><p>
Our provision wagons will not be able to supply 
us, when at a greater distance, four only being al 
lowed to each brigade, and three of these broke down 
upon the road. I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I arrived at Colonel Hazen's quarters the night be 
fore last; and yesterday, with him, visited the several posts, which I found to be Rahway, Crane's Mills, 
Connecticut Farms, <a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a>, and <a href='/results.php?city=newark' rel='city'>Newark</a>. <a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=newark' rel='city'>Newark</a> are occupied by small detachments only, and guards are posted at De Hart's and Halsted Points. A small guard is also kept at the 
New Blazing Star from the post at Rahway. 
</p><p>
In this situation the troops are as compact as, I 
believe, the nature of the cantonment will allow, consistently with the objects in view; yet they are far from being so much so as could be wished. The 
distance these different places lie from one another, 
and the want of horse to communicate speedily any 
movements of the enemy, render it very easy to surprise one or other of the posts, particularly Railway, 
which is only two miles from the Sound, and lies 
five miles from hence and five miles from the Blazing Star. The small detached guard at that place 
may be very easily taken off; and then their flank, 
and even their rear, is entirely open. 
</p><p>
To cover effectually such an extent of country as 
from <a href='/results.php?city=newark' rel='city'>Newark</a> to Arnboy, in the present state of the 
ice, would require a very considerable body of troops; 
and the dispersing them in small bodies exposes them 
to many accidents, and greatly favors desertion, which, 
with much regret, I find has prevailed on these 
commands. 
</p><p>
In <a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a> I found a four days guard, consisting of one hundred men with a Field-Officer. 
This I reduced to a Captain and fifty, to be relieved 
daily, which I thought would answer every purpose 
that could be expected from the hundred, as they 
may, when on for one day only, be kept constantly 
alert, and half of them at a time patrolling during 
the night. Indeed, I believe good patrols would 
answer every purpose better than small guards; but, 
where the distance betwixt posts is considerable, they 
should be composed of horse. The guards at De 
Hart's and Halsted Points are certainly much ex 
posed, and if the enemy suffer them to remain, it 
must arise from extreme caution, or their having 
something of more importance in contemplation, for I 
cannot suppose they want information of our position. 
</p><p>
I have not yet been able to ascertain the enemy's 
number on Staten Island, or at Paulus Hook, but 
expect to-day to have pretty good accounts of the 
last, as also of the state of the ice on both the North 
and East Rivers 5 but from all that I can learn, and 
from the intelligence Colonel Hazen has received, 
their numbers on the Island amount to two thousand 
and upwards. The reinforcement, thrown in from 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, consisted of three regiments, supposed 
about seven or eight hundred men ; part of them are 
cantoned, and part encamped about the middle of the 
Island. Intelligence is, however, very difficult to be 
obtained, and is not, in my opinion, in a good train; 
the person who seems to be most depended upon 
bearing a very bad character, and known to act as 
an agent for the enemy. Indeed, it will be almost 
impossible to get it into another train, unless the intercourse betwixt the inhabitants and the Island can 
be prevented ; nor can a stop be put to the traffic 
carried on with the city, unless some other way of 
rewarding those we employ be fallen upon, than 
countenancing it in their favor. 
</p><p>
Nothing has yet presented itself to induce any 
attempt upon the enemy which should at least 
have probability in its favor. Their advanced picket 
at Mills might be taken off, but it is a trifling object, and the retreat of the party might be 
prevented. If any thing is to be done on the Island, 
it must, I believe, be by open force, which they seem 
to expect, as, from the information of a deserter, 
they are improving their works, and adding abatis, 
and keep their troops as close to them as possible. 
They are also constructing a new work with timber, 
on a hill that commands the redoubt at the watering 
place. There is, at present, an open passage to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, but it is frequently interrupted by the driving ice. 
</p><p>
Doctor Burnet expected a trusty, intelligent person 
from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> last night, and I shall see him to 
day. By him I expect the information your Excellency wishes with respect to the East River, and the 
situation of the enemy's vessels. If it favors Colonel Willett's enterprise, I shall desire him to wait upon 
your Excellency immediately. I find, by an order of 
General Tryon's of the 13th, that a number of bateaux are to be laid up at De Nuys's Ferry, at the Narrows. 
</p><p>
I suppose Colonel Hazen has informed your Excellency of the attempt the enemy intended upon the 
detachment at Rahway, on Wednesday last, which 
was prevented by Colonel Gray's having obtained 
some notice of it. I cannot help repeating that 
horse are much wanted to give any degree of security to the cantonments ; but, as one object is to 
cover and secure the inhabitants, they ought, some 
of them at least, to be furnished by the State, and 
if these were trusty, good men, acquainted with the 
country, they would make the best patrols possible. 
I believe, too, they would more effectually check the 
spirit of traffic than it will ever be done by the 
soldiery, who hold it, in some measure, a disrepu 
table employment. 
</p><p>
I wish I could give your Excellency any hint that 
might help to prevent or check the shameful desertion that prevails, and for which the troops of Pennsylvania, especially, have so little reason. It would, 
perhaps, answer a good end, whilst the ice continues 
firm, instead of detachments from the army, to send 
whole corps; the first to be taken from those lines 
where that vice has not crept in. By the time one or two commands are completed, the communication 
will probably be more difficult. 
</p><p>
I have inquired, of every person I thought could 
give me proper information, into the causes of our misfortune at <a href='/results.php?city=newark' rel='city'>Newark</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a>, and it appears to have been owing to negligence in not having the patrols out in proper time, and to their having fatigued themselves too much the night before ; 
and it is certain, that the Captain had not a single 
vidette, nor even a sentry on the stable where his 
horses were. I am not quite satisfied whether your Excellency intended a formal inquiry, or that I should 
inform myself in the manner I have done. Nothing 
further occurs at present. If any intelligence of moment arrives, it shall be immediately communicated, 
and I will detain Colonel Hazen until I hear from 
your Excellency. I have the honor to be, Sir, 
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
ARTHUR ST. CLAIR.
