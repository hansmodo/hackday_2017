DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
After the fatigue of many days, and of this in particular, I should not sit down, at eleven o clock at night, to write to a gentleman of whose goodness of heart I 
A member of the Continental Congress from Virginia. 
have less doubt than I have of yours ; but well knowing 
that you will pardon what flows from good intentions, 
I venture to say that my hopes are, you will find from 
what the Congress has already done, and from what I 
hope they will do to-morrow, that it has been a capital 
object with us to make your arduous business as easy 
to you as the nature of things will admit. The business 
immediately before us being finished, the approaching 
sickly season here, and the great importance of our 
presence in the Virginia Convention, have determined a 
recess of a month, it standing now, that the Congress 
shall meet here again on the 5th of September. The 
capital object of powder we have attended to as far as 
we could by sending you the other day six tons, and 
to-morrow we shall propose sending six or eight tons 
more, which, with the supplies you may get from Connecticut, and such further ones from here as future 
expected importations may furnish, will, I hope, enable 
you to do all that this powerful article can in good 
hands accomplish. 
</p><p>
We understand here, that batteries may be constructed at the entrance of the Bay of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, so as 
to prevent the egress and regress of any ships what 
ever. If this be a fact, would it not, Sir, be a signal stroke to secure the fleet and army in and before 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, so as to compel a surrender at discretion? 
While I write this I assure you my heart is elated 
with the contemplation of so great an event; a decisive thing that would at once end the war, and vindicate the injured liberties of America. But your 
judgment, and that of your brave associates, will 
best determine the practicability of this business. 
</p><p>
I think we have taken the most effectual measures 
to secure the friendship of the Indians all along our 
extensive frontiers, and, by what we learn of the spirit of our Convention now sitting at <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, a spirit 
prevails there very sufficient to secure us on that quarter. The particulars of their conduct I refer you to 
Mr. Frazer for, who comes fresh from thence, and who goes to the camp a soldier of fortune. You know him 
better than I do, and I am sure you will provide for him as he deserves. 
</p><p>
We are here as much in the dark about news from 
England as you are, the London ships having been 
detained long beyond the time they were expected. 
The indistinct accounts we have, tell us of great confusion all over England, and a prodigious fall of the 
stocks. I heartily wish it may be true, but if it is not 
so now, I have no doubt of its shortly being the case. 
</p><p>
I will not detain you longer from more important 
affairs, than to beg the favor of you, when your leisure 
permits, to oblige me by a line by post, to let us know 
how you go on. 
</p><p>
There is nothing I wish so much as your success, 
happiness, and safe return to your family and country, 
because I am with perfect sincerity, dear Sir, your 
affectionate friend and countryman, 
</p><p>

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Two days ago I arrived here from Virginia, which 
the late short adjournment just allowed me time to 
visit and return from. I brought two letters from 
thence for you, which come with this. Having some 
business with Colonel Mason, I travelled that road, 
and having sent to your lady to know if she had 
any commands this way, had the pleasure to learn 
that all were well at <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>. As I suppose 
it will be agreeable to you to know what is passing 
in Virginia, I have inclosed you the proceedings of 
our last Convention, with two of Purdie's Gazettes. 
</p><p>
I am greatly obliged to you for your favor of 
August the 29th, and you may be assured I shall 
pay great attention to it. When I mentioned securing  the entrance of the harbour of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, it was 
more in the way of wishing it could be done, than 
as conceiving it very practicable. However, the reasons you assign are most conclusive against the at 
tempt. I assure you, that so far as I can judge 
from the conversation of men, instead of there being 
any who think you have not done enough, the wonder seems to be, that you have done so much. I 
believe there is not a man of common sense, and 
who is void of prejudice, in the world, but greatly 
approves the discipline you have introduced into the 
camp ; since reason and experience join in proving, 
that without discipline armies are fit only for the 
contempt and slaughter of their enemies. Your 
labors are no doubt great, both of mind and body, 
but if the praise of the present and future times 
can be any compensation, you will have a plentiful 
portion of that. Of one thing you may certainly 
rest assured, that the Congress will do every thing 
iii their powder to make your most weighty business 
easy to you. I think you could not possibly have 
appointed a better man to his present office than Mr. 
Mifflin. He is a singular man, and you certainly 
will meet with the applause and support of all good 
men, by promoting and countenancing real merit and 
public virtue, in opposition to all private interests 
and partial affections. You will see, in the proceeding's of our Convention, that they have agreed to 
raise the pay of our rifle officers and men to the 
Virginia standard. It may, perhaps, encourage them 
to be told this. 
</p><p>
We have no late accounts from England ; but from 
what we have had that can be relied on, it seems 
almost certain, that our enemies there must shortly 
meet with a total overthrow. The entire failure 
of all their schemes, and the rising spirit of the 
people, strongly expressed by the remonstrance of 
the Livery of London to the King, clearly denote 
this. The ministry had their sole reliance on the 
impossibility of the Americans finding money to sup 
port an army, on the great aid their cause would 
receive from Canada, and consequent triumph of their 
forces over the liberties and rights of America. The 
reverse of all this has happened ; and very soon, now, 
our commercial resistance will begin sorely to distress the people at large. 
</p><p>
The ministerial recruiting business in England has 
entirely failed them ; the ship-builders in the royal 
yards have mutinied ; and now they are driven, as 
to their last resort, to seek for soldiers on the High 
lands of Scotland. But it seems the greatest willingness of the people there cannot supply more 
than one or two thousand men, a number rather calculated to increase their disgrace, than to give success 
to their cause. 
</p><p>
I beg your pardon for engaging your attention so 
long, and assure you that I am, with unfeigned 
esteem, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate friend and countryman, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I thank you for your obliging favor of the 13th, 
and assure you, that no man living approves the 
vigorous measures you mention, more than myself. 
Great bodies, you know, move slow, and it is as sure, 
that the most palpable and glorious events may be 
delayed, and the best causes finally lost by slow, 
timid, and indecisive counsels. We must be content, 
however, to take human nature as we find it, and 
endeavour to draw good out of evil. You will, no 
doubt, have heard the disgraceful conduct of our 
Norfolk [people], in suffering Lord Dunmore, with a 
few men, to take away their printing-press. 
</p><p>
It happened when the good men of that place were all away, and none but Tories and negroes remained behind. Virginia is much incensed; and five 
hundred men are ordered immediately down to Norfolk. I expect, by every post, to hear of the demolition of that infamous nest of Tories. 
</p><p>
By a vessel in twenty days from Quebec, which I 
believe brings us later intelligence than you had from 
thence when the last express left camp, we learn 
that the Lieutenant-Governor had twelve companies 
of Canadians in training, and that they were Generally on their guard. But the same account says, the 
Government was so suspicious of the attachment of 
its troops, that they were trusted with no more than 
four rounds of cartridges. This still gives us some 
hopes of success in that quarter. Before this reaches 
you, you will have heard of Colonel Allen's unlucky 
and unwise attempt upon Montreal ; nor have we, from 
the last accounts, much prospect of success from St. 
John s. The ministerial dependence on Canada is so 
great, that no object can be of greater importance to 
North America, than to defeat them there. It appears to me, that we must have that country with 
us this winter, cost what it will. Colonel Stephens 
writes me from Fort Pitt, that the Indians on that 
quarter came slowly in to the Commissioners, and that 
they evidently appear to be waiting the event of 
things in Canada, when they will surely, according 
to custom, join the strongest side. We have so many 
resources for powder, that I think we cannot fail 
of getting well supplied with that most necessary 
article. 
</p><p>
Remember me, if you please, to <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague friend met'>General Gates</a>, and to all my acquaintances with you. I am, with 
great esteem and sincerity, dear Sir, your affectionate and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rhl" rel="me">RICHARD HENRY LEE</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. Monday Morning. T is with infinite concern I inform you, that our good old Speaker, Peyton Randolph, Esquire, went yesterday to dine with Mr. 
Harry Hill, was taken, during the course of the dinner, with the dead palsy, and at nine o clock at night 
died without a groan. Thus has American liberty lost a powerful advocate, and human nature a sincere friend !

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
The inclosed letter, from Colonel Pendleton, came to hand two days ago, and, as it will save a good deal of unnecessary writing, I send it to yon. 
</p><p>
The proclamation, there alluded to, we have seen. 
It proclaims martial law through Virginia, and oilers 
freedom to all the slaves, calling their masters rebels, 
&c. It seems this unlucky triumph over Ilutchings, 
with his less than half-armed militia, so dispirited the 
miserable wretches in that neighbourhood, that many 
have taken an oath of Lord Dunmore's prescribing. 
</p><p>
reprobating Congress, Committees, &c. Long before 
this, Colonel Woodford, with eight hundred good men, 
must be arrived in those parts ; and I make no doubt 
has forced his Lordship on board his ships again. 
All this would have been prevented, if our troops 
could have crossed James River, in proper time ; but 
they were obstructed, and forced to march high up, 
by the men-of-war; and indeed, such is the nature 
of our water-intersected country, that a small number 
of men, provided with naval force, can harass us extremely. 
</p><p>
I have good reason to hope, that in a few weeks 
the state of things in Virginia will be greatly altered 
for the better. I thank you for your list of armed 
vessels, but at present no use can be made of them. 
I hope some of them will be fortunate enough to 
meet with prizes eastward. 
</p><p>
I had not heard of your improvements on the 
Kanawha being destroyed, and unless Mr. Lund Washington has received very accurate information on 
this head, I am inclined to doubt it; because I see, 
in the treaty lately concluded with all the Ohio In 
dians, they first inform the Commissioners of the 
Kanawha fort being burnt by some of their rash 
young men ; but they promise to punish the offenders, 
and prevent repetition of the like offence. They are 
very precise in their information, and mention only 
the fort, as well as I remember. I hope, therefore, 
that your property may yet be safe. This treaty 
with the Indians is more likely to last, as Connolly, 
with his little corps of officers, is now in close custo 
dy in Maryland, having been arrested there, as they 
were stealing through the country to Pittsburg, from whence they were to proceed to Detroit, and with the troops in those western parts, Indians, &c. ? he was 
to have done wonders. This wonderful man is now in close jail.
</p><p>
I congratulate you on the surrender of Montreal ; 
and from <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague'>General Montgomery's</a> letter, giving an account of that event, I think we have room to expect 
that Quebec is fallen before now. A Committee of 
Congress, some time since sent to Canada, have direction to raise a regiment in that country, to invite 
delegates to this Congress, and give the strongest 
assurances of protection to their civil and religions 
rights. I am glad to hear of your getting Cobble 
Hill, and I hope it will prove useful to you. We 
are told that your enemy's troops are very uneasy 
on Bunker's Hill. God grant that their uneasiness 
may increase to their ruin. No accounts yet from 
England, but ships are daily expected. I am, with 
much esteem, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate and obedient servant,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I am informed that a certain Mr. Eustace, now in 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, but some time ago with Lord Dunmore, 
is acquainted with a practice that prevailed, of taking 
letters out of the post-office in Virginia, and carrying 
them to Dunmore for his perusal, and then returning 
them to the office again. As it is of the greatest 
consequence that this nefarious practice be stopped 
immediately, I shall be exceedingly obliged to you, 
Sir, for getting Mr. Eustace to give, in writing, all 
that he knows about this business, and inclose the 
same to me at <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>. I wish to know, particularly, what post-offices the letters were taken 
from, by whom, and who carried them to Lord Dunmore. 
</p><p>
This day I set off for Virginia, where, if I can be of any service to yon, it will oblige to command me. It is more than probable that Congress will order our 
friend Gates to Canada. His great abilities and Virtue will be absolutely necessary to restore things 
there, and his recommendations will always be readily 
complied with. You will find that great powers are 
given to the commander in that distant department. 
The system for Canada, adopted since the arrival of 
the Commissioners here, will, I hope, be of essential 
service to our affairs. 
</p><p>
All good men pray most heartily for your health, 
happiness, and success, and none more than, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate friend and obedient servant,

</p><p>
MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The resolves of Congress, that you will receive by 
this messenger, you may be assured are not intended, 
by any means, to obstruct your views a single moment. 
If your judgment should incline you to think that 
the troops had better march to head-quarters as quick 
as possible, you have only to order it, and it will 
give pleasure to every good man here. The business 
of speedily reenforcing you will not be obstructed, 
but accelerated ; because they now enter the city, 
where every day's stay is thirty days injury to the 
great purpose of strengthening your hands ; and 
should the enemy destine here, something like a military collection may produce a greater resort. If you 
will indulge my conjecture, I think they cannot purpose coming here, because the water securities against 
such a plan are really formidable, and the situation 
of the land, where the water obstructions are fixed, is 
such that great delay, and probable ruin, forbids the 
enterprise, as they cannot so fix land batteries as to 
remove the strong vessels that protect the chevaiix-de-frisCy added to the numerous fire-rafts and fire-ships 
that, in a narrow water, with strong current, may destroy their fleet. 
</p><p>
Your army, Sir, feeble as it is, and the North River, are more tempting objects, because they are not 
strong, and because the defeat of the one and the acquisition of the other, would avail our enemies greatly. 
</p><p>
My wishes are, Sir, and I think they correspond 
with the true interests of America, that you should 
quickly be possessed of a strong army ; that your 
powers might be such as to gratify your wishes of 
crushing our enemies, before an addition of strength 
to them may render the business more difficult and 
uncertain. I think I well know your situation, and, 
from your excellent disposition, I know your feelings; 
and I do most ardently wish to make the former 
good, and to render the latter agreeable ; and there 
fore whenever I can know either from yourself, all 
the powers I possess shall be exerted to accomplish 
both. The troops of Maryland are now under inoculation, and so are about one thousand Virginians from 
<a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a> to Wilmington inclusive. Here, we sup 
pose, may be near one thousand of all kinds, who, 
by the new plan of encampment, will be in tents as 
quickly as the physicians can discharge them, or the 
officers collect them from this attractive scene of debauch and amusement. With every hearty wish for 
your health and prosperity, I remain, dear Sir, 
Most affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
