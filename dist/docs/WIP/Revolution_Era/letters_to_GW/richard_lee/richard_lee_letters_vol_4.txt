Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The letter that you did me the honor to write to 
me, on the 12th of June last, I did not receive until 
two days ago. I impute this to my having been 
obliged to leave the Assembly, by the ill state of my 
health, a fortnight before it was adjourned. 
</p><p>
The very great respect that I shall ever pay to 
your recommendations, would have been very sufficient to have procured my exertions in favor of <a href='/results.php?tla=tmp' rel='colleague'>Mr. Paine</a>, independent of his great public merits in our 
revolution. I have a perfect knowledge of the extraordinary effects produced by that gentleman's writings ; effects of such an important nature, as would 
render it very unworthy of these States to let him 
suffer any where ; but it would be culpable indeed, 
to permit it, under their own eye, and within their 
own limits. I had not the good fortune to be present when <a href='/results.php?tla=tmp' rel='colleague'>Mr. Paine</a>'s business was considered in the 
House of Delegates, or, most certainly, I should have 
exerted myself in his behalf I have been told, that 
a proposition in his favor miscarried, from its being 
observed that he had shown enmity to this State, by 
having written a pamphlet injurious to our claim of 
western territory. It has ever appeared to me, that 
this pamphlet was the consequence of <a href='/results.php?tla=tmp' rel='colleague'>Mr. Paine</a>'s 
being himself imposed upon ; and that it was rather 
the fault of the place than of the man. 
</p><p>
This, however, was but a trifle, when compared 
with the great and essential services that his other 
writings have done for the United States. 
</p><p>
I am, &c., &c., 
</p><p>

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have long had a letter prepared for you in answer to your last favor, which I have kept for the 
Honorable Mr. Sitgreaves to be the bearer of, as he 
proposed to visit you on his return to North Carolina; and the more especially as his stay has been 
occasioned by the necessity of seeing the very important ordinance passed for selling the western 
lands, which I wished you to have in its perfected 
state. The principal design of this letter is to introduce to you Mr. Graham and his lady, the justly 
celebrated <a href='/results.php?tla=cam' rel=''>Mrs. Macaulay Graham</a>, whose reputation in 
the learned world, and among the friends to the rights 
of human nature, is very high indeed. Her merit 
as an historian is very great, and places her as an 
author in the foremost rank of writers. I am well 
pleased to find that she, as well as all other judicious 
foreigners, think themselves, when in America, however distant from <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>, obliged to pay their 
respects to you. I believe that this has been her 
only motive for going so far south as Virginia. 
</p><p>
We are amused here with an account, that does 
not indeed come officially to us, hut however in such 
a way as to merit attention. It is a plan of the 
Emperor of Germany, which seems calculated to quiet 
his quarrel with Holland, although, perhaps, it may 
not prevent a war in Europe. He is said to have 
made a treaty with the Elector of Bavaria, by which 
he exchanges his Netherland dominions for those of 
Bavaria, and transfers, with the exchange, all his 
rights and claims upon Holland ; reserving Namur 
and Luxemburg, with a district of country around, 
as a douceur to France, for obtaining the consent of 
that Court to the exchange. The Bavarian dominions 
being much more contiguous to the Austrian than 
those of the Netherlands, must greatly increase the 
Emperor's power by a concentration of his force, 
heretofore so much divided as to render the Netherlands of no great aid in case of war. This, however, 
by increasing the Austrian power, must, of course, 
excite greatly the jealousy of Prussia in particular, 
whose King will probably risk a war rather than see 
his rival thus strengthened. Holland, in the mean 
time, will be relieved, by injurious claims being transferred from a strong to a w^eak hand, and the Emperor may find himself brought to a more equal contest by combating one, instead of three powers lately 
combined against him. What may be the issue of 
this new system, time must develop. 
</p><p>
I wish that I may be enabled by Mr. Sitgreaves 
to furnish you with the final sense of Congress upon 
the momentous business of selling the western lands, 
in doing which the first and greatest object seems to 
be the discharging effectually the great weight of 
debt, that the war has created, and which obstructs 
so effectually every arrangement for future security. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with sentiments of the sincerest respect and esteem, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant,

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to inclose to you an ordinance, 
that we have just passed in Congress, for establishing 
a temporary Government beyond the Ohio, as a measure preparatory to the sale of the lands. It seemed 
necessary, for the security of property among uninformed, and, perhaps, licentious people, as the greater 
part of those who go there are, that a strong-toned 
Government should exist, and the rights of property 
be clearly defined. Our next object is, to consider 
of a proposition made for the purchase of five or six 
millions of acres, in order to lessen the domestic debt. 
An object of much consequence this, since the extinguishment of this part of the public debt would not 
only relieve from a very heavy burden, but, by demolishing the ocean of public securities, we should 
stop that mischievous deluge of speculation that now 
hurts our morals, and extremely injures the public 
affairs. 
</p><p>
Our Gazettes continue to be filled with publications 
against the Spanish treaty, and for opening the Mississippi; some of them plausible, but generally weak and indecent. This seems to be contending for an 
object unattainable for many years, and probably never without war, not only with Spain, but most 
likely with the Bourbon alliance ; and, by such contention, exposing the Government of the United 
States to a dishonorable acquiescence under the captivity of its citizens and confiscation of their effects by Spain on the Mississippi, or entering prematurely 
into a destructive war in resentment for such doings ; at the same time discarding the friendship for the 
enmity of a powerful monarch, and thereby probably losing what we may possess, our share of a commerce 
that yields annually four or five millions of dollars for codfish only, independent of the flour, and many 
valuable articles of American production, used in Spain, and not interfering with their own aqueducts; 
to say nothing of a most lucrative contraband trade from the ocean and on the Mississippi, which a friend 
might wink at, but which a vigilant and powerful enemy will prevent. It seems to me that North 
America is going, if we are prudent, to be the entrepot between the East Indies and Spanish America. 
If to these we could join the settlement of a disputed boundary, and obtain a powerful guaranty therefor, 
surely such considerations greatly outweigh the farsought apprehension of an alliance of the Kentuckians 
with the British ; and especially when we consider, that a conduct which will procure the enmity of 
Spain, will probably force her into the open arms of Great Britain, much to our commercial and political 
injury. And, after all, if this navigation could be opened, and the benefits be such as are chimerically 
supposed, it must, in its consequences, depopulate and ruin the old States. 
</p><p>
The argument may shortly thus be stated ; â€” Spain will not agree to the navigation within her limits. 
Can we force it in twenty-five years ? If we cannot, why risk, for an unattainable object, the loss of valuable objects, and the incurring pernicious consequences ? 
A candid and impartial consideration of this subject. 
</p><p>
must, I think, determine the question without difficulty. But I beg your pardon, Sir, for writing so 
much on this question, which, I doubt not, but you have fully considered before. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with the truest respect 
and esteem, dear Sir, &c.,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I was unwilling to interrupt your attention to more 
important affairs at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, by sending there 
an acknowledgment of the letter that you were pleased to honor me with from that city, especially as 
this place afforded nothing worthy of your notice. 
</p><p>
We have the pleasure to see the first act of Congress for selling federal lands, north-west of the Ohio, 
becoming productive very fast, a large sum of public 
securities being already paid in upon the first sales ; 
and a new contract is ordered to be made with a 
company in New Jersey for the lands between the two JNIiamis, that will rid us of at least two millions more of the public debt. There is good reason to 
suppose that by the next spring we shall have reduced the domestic debt near six millions of dollars. 
And it seems clear that the lands yet to be disposed 
of, if well managed, will sink the whole thirty millions that are due. 
</p><p>
The assiduity with which the Court of London is 
soliciting that of Spain for the conclusion of a commercial treaty between those powers, renders it a signal misfortune that we have not been able to get a 
sufficient number of the States together to produce a 
conclusion of the Spanish treaty. The state of Europe, with respect to the continuance of peace, still 
hangs in doubtful balance. The finance weakness of 
France and Great Britain most strongly opposes war ; 
yet the state of things is such as renders it very 
questionable whether even that difficulty, great as it 
is, will secure the continuance of peace. 
</p><p>
It is under the strongest impressions of your goodness and candor that I venture to make the observations that follow in this letter, assuring you that I 
feel it among the first distresses that have happened 
to me in my life, that I find myself compelled, by 
irresistible conviction of mind, to doubt about the 
new system for Federal Government recommended by 
the late Convention. 
</p><p>
It is. Sir, in consequence of long reflection upon 
the nature of man and of government, that I am led 
to fear the danger that will ensue to civil liberty 
from the adoption of the new system, in its present 
form. I am fully sensible of the propriety of change 
in the present plan of Confederation ; and, although 
there may be difficulties, not inconsiderable, in procuring the adoption of such amendments to the Convention system, as will give security to the just 
rights of human nature, and better secure from injury the discordant interests of the different parts of 
this Union, yet I hope that these difficulties are not 
insurmountable, because we are- happily uninterrupted 
by external war, or by such internal discords as can 
prevent peaceable and fair discussion, in another Convention, of those objections that are fundamentally 
strong against the new Constitution, which abounds 
with useful regulations. As there is so great a part 
of the business w^ell done already, I think that such 
alterations as must give very general content, could 
not long employ another Convention, when provided 
with the sense of the different States upon those 
alterations. 
</p><p>
I am much inclined to believe that the amendments, 
generally thought to be necessary, will be found to 
be of such a nature as, though they do not oppose 
the exercise of a very competent federal powder, are 
yet such as the best theories on Government, and 
the best practice upon those theories, have found necessary ; at the same time that they are such as the 
opinions of our people have for ages been fixed on. 
It would be unnecessary for me here to enumerate 
particulars, as I expect the honor of waiting on you 
at <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>, in my way home, early in November. In the mean time, I have only to request that 
my best respects may be presented to your lady, 
and that I may be remembered to the rest of the 
good family of <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, dear Sir, with the most unfeigned respect, esteem and affection, &c.,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On the Sunday night after leaving <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>, I arrived here, where, to my surprise, I found 
that a quorum of the Senate was not assembled, and but a small majority of Representatives. 
</p><p>
On this day we went to business ; and, to my very great satisfaction, I heard a unanimous vote of the 
electing States in favor of calling you to the honorable office of President of the United States. Before 
this period, I judged it might not be acceptable to speak my sentiments to you on this subject. But 
now, I hope I may be permitted to express my ardent hope, that your inclinations may correspond with 
the united wish of America, that you should preside over those councils which you have so greatly contributed to render independent. Indeed, I am sure 
that the public happiness, which I know you have so much at heart, will be very insecure without your acceptance. 
</p><p>
The two Houses feel the necessity of proceeding to the preparation of some important business, that 
it may be in all possible forwardness against your arrival; that of securing the impost on the spring 
arrivals, seems to be the most pressing. An express goes also to <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague'>Mr. Adams</a> immediately, to inform him 
of his election to the office of Vice-President. I pray to "be remembered affectionately to your lady and 
the family at <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>. With every sentiment 
of respect, I am, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=rhl" rel="me">Richard Henry Lee</a>.
