My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Although our correspondence has been long interrupted, I hope that our friendship never will, notwithstanding the arts of wicked men, who have endeavoured to create discord and dissension among; the 
friends of America. For myself, having little but my 
good wishes to send you, it was not worth while to 
take up your attention a moment with them. The 
contents of this letter will, I am sure, require no 
apology, because you always approve that zeal which 
is employed in the public service, and has for its object the public good. 
</p><p>
The present state of our country. Sir, is such as 
to demand the most immediate and most effectual interposition to prevent the numerous resources of Virginia from becoming means, in the hands of our enemies, for subduing the liberties of North America. 
For, though the efforts of this State have been not quite so strong as its abilities warranted, yet when it 
shall be placed under the sword of a conqueror, such 
resources will be found, and such powers drawn from 
it, as will put the liberties of North America in imminent peril. My following opinion is not founded 
upon vain apprehensions, but upon good materials and 
attentive observation. 
</p><p>
Virginia, it is true, has nine times the number of 
men that now threaten its ruin; but they are dispersed, unarmed, without system, government, and 
very little probability at present of the Legislature 
assembling. The enemy's army is in the heart of the 
country, employing, with exquisite industry'-, every engine that force and fraud can move, to effect a conquest of the whole, or far greater part, immediately. 
I think. Sir, that they will succeed, if adequate prevention be not presently applied. When the enemy's 
army began to move, after the junction of their troops, 
in force much superior to the Marquis, the Assembly 
adjourned to Charlotteville, where they were never 
able to collect members sufficient to form the Legislature, before they were dispersed by five hundred of 
the enemy's light-horse, with as many light infantry 
mounted behind, as we learn from some of the flying 
Delegates. The Governor had resigned his office, but 
no successor had been appointed; and Mr. Digges, 
the Lieutenant-Governor, it seems has been made a 
prisoner, and released upon parole ; whilst there is, 
in the present state of things, little chance for a 
meeting of the Assembly to apply the feeble remedy 
which their choice of a Governor would amount to. 
Thus we remain without Government, at a time when the most wise and most vigorous administration 
of public affairs can alone save us from the ruin determined for us by the enemy. I have taken the 
liberty of communicating my thoughts on this subject 
to Mr. Lovell, in a letter, a copy of which I have 
now the honor to inclose to you, together with a letter from your brother, who agrees perfectly with me 
in sentiment ; and, I verily believe, there is not a good 
citizen, or friend to the liberty of America, in the 
State, who does not wish that the plan proposed may 
immediately be adopted. I have written in the same 
manner to Colonel Bland and Mr. Jones, our Delegates 
in Congress. 
</p><p>
It would be a thing for angels to weep over, if 
the goodly fabric of human freedom, which you have 
so well labored to rear, should, in one unlucky moment, be levelled with the dust. There is nothing I 
think more certain than that your personal call would 
bring into immediate exertion the force and the resources of this State, and its neighbouring ones, 
which, directed as they would be, will effectually disappoint and baffle the deep-laid schemes of the enemy. By seizing the fine horses on James River, 
they have mounted a gallant and most mischievous 
cavalry of five or six hundred in number. We have 
plenty of horses left, to be sure, but we are deficient 
in proper accoutrements ; though I understand that 
the Marquis is endeavouring to mount a thousand 
men as quickly as possible, to control the boundless 
ravage of the enemy's horse. Some of the dispersed 
Delegates report it as extremely probable that our 
collected stores in the north fork of James River 
have fallen into the enemy's hands, as their cavalry 
were a little above, and the main body of their army not far below, directing its course to the north fork, 
which was guarded only by seven or eight hundred 
new levies under <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron Steuben</a>. 
</p><p>
Our country is truly, Sir, in a deplorable way, 
and, if relief comes not from you, it will probably 
come not at all. I have heard it reported in this 
country, that <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague'>General Wayne</a> dislikes being commanded by the Marquis. If this should be unhappily true, 
the consequences will be obvious to you. I have the 
honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem, dear Sir, your most affectionate friend. 
</p><p>
And most obedient servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor of replying to your polite and 
agreeable letter of July the 15th, by my son Ludwell, whom I expected either to wait on you with it 
in Virginia, or to get the letter forwarded by the 
<a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>. Although I am at this time 
laboring under a severe fit of the gout, it is impossible to refrain from congratulating you, and rejoicing 
with our country on the present happy and glorious 
prospect before us. The very judicious and decisive 
step that you have taken in coming here, seems to 
put it out of the power of fortune to prevent the 
enemy in this State from falling into your hands. 
At least my mind can reach hut to two preventives â€” 
the coming of naval aid from Europe, which is hardly 
possible ; and the want of provisions for our good 
allies and ourselves, which cannot be probable. A 
proper watch will surely be kept upon marine motions in Europe, to prevent the repetition of such 
scenes as the relieving of Gibraltar. And it is inadmissible that, in this land of abundance, so disgraceful 
a thing should happen as the dispersion of a force 
collected for our salvation, for want of provisions, 
which now the country abounds with. 
</p><p>
I assure you. Sir, the Commissaries' and Quartermasters' departments in the State, so far as I have 
observed them, have in every thing been the reverse 
of right, insomuch that I have been well informed 
the fcw troops with the Marquis have frequently felt 
distress for want of provisions. At present the land 
and sea force, which may come to lean on these 
broken staffs, will probably reach to forty-five or 
fifty thousand men. We have now a good character 
at the head of our State and War Offices, and I make 
no doubt but that he will exert all his powers with 
diligence. To prevent, however, the greatest of all 
misfortunes, want of success from want of provisions, 
can we not add some methods not destructive of the 
present plans, and which may aid their efficiency? 
Suppose immediate notice were given to the possessors of good merchant mills, that they should be paid 
with specie for the flour they brought to your army and the navy, and a better price for it the sooner 
it reached. And wherever a competent person would 
undertake in a reasonable time to deliver a proper 
quantity, let his mill and wagons have protection 
from the destructive talons of impressors. Upon these 
last, let me here make one observation for all. Their 
grip generally squeezes the best citizens, and leaves 
the rest, and is always executed for the greater ease 
and profit of the impressor, so that now the people 
in general are exerting their wits to elude and hide 
their property from these characters. To prevent this 
plan from being executed with partiality, and upon 
views of job, some men having knowledge of the 
country, of honor, integrity, and diligence, should be 
employed to ride through the upper counties and see 
as much flour despatched as possible. With regard 
to the hard money, I suppose that our allies will furnish a sufficiency for their own supply, which will 
leave no great matter for us ; and this, if we are 
rightly informed here, our Congress Financier might 
furnish, since the return of <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Colonel Laurens</a> from 
France. 
</p><p>
The present mode of getting beef from the several 
circles would answer, if diligently executed. But to 
aid this, for health, as well as plenty, suppose that an 
active Justice of the Peace, first Militia Officer, and 
one of the Delegates in each county, or any two of 
the three, were immediately, by government, empowered and exhorted to proceed with diligence and take 
one half of the bacon and salt beef in possession of 
every family, and despatch it in pressed wagons, 
carts, or vessels, immediately to the army. The season now is, when persons in the country may find 
many resources beside salted meat to subsist upon. 
In short, victory must not be prevented by want of victuals, and these must be obtained at any rate. 
Although I have seen the baneful influence of these 
impresses, yet, upon this great and apparently final 
occasion, it seems admissible to extend a little under 
proper direction, not to destroy the present system. 
I mean in this exigence to aid, not to annihilate now, 
the old imperfect plan. I should suppose that if specie pay were promised, the fleet might be well furnished with vegetables from the water-bound counties. 
I assure your Excellency that I should not have 
troubled you, or roused from my present state to 
make these observations, if it were not because of my 
great anxiety lest we should fail of the happy end 
before us for want of provisions ; and upon this principle I am sure of your pardon. But now that I am 
thus engaged, permit me to make a few observations 
upon the negroes now with the enemy, in case of 
the surrender of the latter. I have been told that it 
is fixed, but whether by civil or military power, I 
know not, that the owners, or any other person, may 
have the slaves on paying five pound specie into the 
public treasury for each. It would seem that the unfortunate owners should be relieved on terms as easy 
as possible. The Admiralty has some regulations 
upon subjects taken within their Province ; but how 
they apply to this case, I see not. And I believe 
that the singular manner in which Great Britain has 
conducted this war against America, leaves no clue 
to direct us in former practice. Force, fraud, intrigue, 
theft, have all in turn been employed to delude these 
unhappy people, and to defraud their masters ! My 
brother William has lost sixty-five, among whom are 
about forty-five valuable grown slaves and useful artisans. I would say nothing in his favor from his 
many other losses, or the personal injuries that have befallen tim. from his attachment to his native country. General systems will be applied to general subjects, and I shall be content with those that you establish. I would only observe, that he is now upon 
the Continent of Europe, where he has been detained 
by the disagreeable consequences that might follow 
the committing his wife and children to the sea in 
these precarious times, and the necessity of his presence with them in a foreign land, where he is sufficiently distressed for their support ; the profits of his 
estate here having all been put into the town offices, 
and his numerous debts in England not recoverable 
at present. He has now no day in their Court, and 
no lawyer has been found that would bring suits 
for him. Perhaps it will be thought equitable, if any 
salvage is demanded, to allow absentees a reasonable 
indulgence for payment. I have the honor to be, 
with the most perfect esteem. Sir, your Excellency's 
Most affectionate and obedient servant,

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor of addressing you last, by my 
eldest son, who went to camp about four weeks ago. 
Since that, we have had the pleasure of hearing that 
your advances against York go successfully on. By 
this time, I hope his Lordship begins seriously to 
repent the Quixote part that he has been acting 
in America. Surely the rage of despotism must be 
cooled by the total defeat of those great hopes, which 
have been entertained of southern conquest; though 
really, in all the outrages of passion that history presents, we see nothing equal to the tyrannous and 
senseless rancor of the British Iving and counsels 
against America. 
</p><p>
This disposition may continue a hopeless, ruinous 
war. I see that Arnold, in the true spirit of apostasy, is burning and wasting his native country. The 
malice of that man, his wickedness, and his avarice, render him a fit instrument for such employers. His former success in this State, his restless search after 
gain, however obtained, and the general languor that 
will be found here after the present exertions are over, will most likely be persuasives with General Clinton and himself, to cause the coming of this unprincipled person, with his fifteen hundred or two 
thousand plunderers, to Virginia, when the fleet and 
army shall be gone. The learned and judicious Polybius was of opinion, that the principal inducing motive of Alexander the Great for invading Persia, was 
the little resistance that the ten thousand Grecians met with in passing through that great empire. 
Weakness, joined with the possession of property, are certainly strong temptations to ambitious, avaricious men. 
</p><p>
How best to prevent <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> from experiencing, 
in November, the same disgraceful visit that it did 
in January, your wisdom can best determine. Perhaps two strong frigates, under protection of a small 
and well-fortified garrison, at the town of York, with 
General Spotswood's and Colonel Mead's legion, made 
complete by the addition of some regular soldiers, 
might operate to discourage such attempts, with the 
force that can be prudently spared from the garrisons 
of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> ; or, if attempted, might 
be able, with militia aid, to repel the invaders. 
</p><p>
It is not easy to conceive the distress and injury 
that have been derived to this State from the number 
of piratical plunderers, that have infested the shores 
of this country since our galleys were laid down; 
and such have been the success and benefit attending 
this wicked practice, that we hear of small crews 
forming to go plundering along the shores. In the 
actual state of our affairs, it will be long before we 
can build and fit vessels to stop these pernicious and 
disgraceful practices. But I should suppose, that our 
government might have credit enough to purchase, 
from among the captured armed vessels at York, some ready-fitted, swift-sailing cruisers, for the purpose of scouring our Bay and rivers, and suppressing 
these piratical proceedings. If such a plan should 
meet your Excellency's approbation, your recommendation of it will secure its adoption. I know there 
will be difficulty in getting seamen. But, since the 
security of our country renders marine defence indispensable, and since the single difficulty of getting 
seamen is far less than getting them and building 
and fitting vessels besides, it would seem prudent to 
get the vessels, and diligently apply at the ports of 
neighbouring States for a few good seamen, less than 
a third of which description, with the rest landsmen, 
would well answer our purpose. I cannot help thinking that this method, aided by a well-conceived law 
for the speedy capital punishment of such offenders, 
would contribute to lessen greatly, if not to suppress, 
a practice extremely injurious to those who live near 
the water, and destructive to the commerce of the 
State. 
</p><p>
We are anxiously waiting for the rejoicing time to 
come, when Lord Cornwallis and his people will be 
your prisoners. I am, dear Sir, with particular esteem. 
</p><p>
Your affectionate and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
