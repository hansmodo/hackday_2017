DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 17th I received yesterday, and 
was a good deal surprised to find you had been told 
that Congress had appointed General Conway a Major-General. No such appointment has been made ; nor 
do I believe it will, while it is likely to produce the 
evil consequences you suggest. It is very true, that 
both within and without doors, there have been advocates for the measure ; and it has been affirmed that 
it would be very agreeable to the army, whose favorite Mr. Conway was asserted to be. My judgment 
on this business was not formed until I received your letter. I am very sure Congress would not take any 
step that might injure the army, or even have a tendency that way; and I verily believe they wish to 
lessen your difficulties by every means in their power, 
from an entire conviction that the purest motives of 
public good direct your actions. 
</p><p>
The business of a Board of War is so extensive, 
so important, and demanding such constant attention, 
that Congress see clearly the necessity of constituting a new Board, out of Congress, whose time shall be entirely devoted to that essential department. It 
is by some warmly proposed that this Board shall 
be filled by the three following gentlemen; Colonel 
Reed, <a href='/results.php?tla=tip' rel='colleague'>Colonel Pickering</a>, the present Adjutant-General, and Colonel Harrison, your Secretary 5 and that 
General Conway be appointed Adjutant-General, in the 
room of <a href='/results.php?tla=tip' rel='colleague'>Colonel Pickering</a>. It is my wish, and I am 
sure it is so of many others, to know your full and 
candid sentiments on this subject. For my own part, 
I cannot be satisfied with giving any opinion on the 
point until I am favored with your sentiments, which 
I shall be much obliged to you for, Sir, as soon as 
your time will permit. It has been affirmed that 
General Conway would quit the service if he were 
not made a Major-General. But I have been told, in 
confidence, that he would leave it at the end of this 
campaign, if he was appointed, unless his word of 
honor were taken to continue for any fixed time. 
And it is a question with me, whether the advocates 
for General Conway will not miss their aim, if he 
should be appointed Adjutant-General, unless he has 
the rank of Major-General also. My reason for thinking so is, that I have been informed General Conway 
desires to retire to his family, provided he can carry 
from this country home with him a rank that will 
raise him in France.* 
</p><p>
It is very certain that the public good demands a 
speedy erecting and judicious filling of the new Board 
of War ; and I sincerely wish it may be done in the 
most proper manner. I do not imagine Congress 
would appoint Colonel Harrison without first knowing whether you could spare him; nor do I think 
that so important an office as that of Adjutant-General should be touched without maturest consideration. 
</p><p>
We every moment expect the express, with an ac 
count that will enable us to congratulate you on the 
surrender of <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>, and the remains of 
his shattered army. This will be one of the Prussian 
sixes, and I augur that the other will soon cast up 
upon the Delaware. 
</p><p>
I am, with sincerest wishes for your health and 
success, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate and obedient servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have no doubt of being excused by you for not 
sooner answering your favor of the 24th last, when 
you are informed that my ill state of health has prevented me from attending, as I ought, to the important matter it contains. I gave Mr. Jones the letter, 
that he might inform Congress of such parts as it 
imported the public they should be acquainted with. 
As it appeared, by the letters of <a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='colleague'>General Mifflin</a>, that 
he objected only to serve in the Quarter-masters De 
partment, that his health was returning, and that he 
was willing to continue his aid to the public cause, 
Congress appointed him one of the Commissioners of 
the new Board, because he is competent to the right 
discharge of its duties, because that would best suit 
his valetudinary state, and as showing a just sense 
of his uniform, vigorous, and well-founded patriotism. 
I have strong hopes that, by the skill and industry 
of this new Board, and from the right execution of 
business in that important department, you will, in 
future, find great relief. 
</p><p>
General Conway has not lately been mentioned in 
Congress, nor has there been much talk of an Adjutant-General, since it is not certainly known whether 
<a href='/results.php?tla=tip' rel='colleague'>Colonel Pickering</a> will accept his new appointment. 
Mr. Fleming's character stands very fair, and, so far as I am able to judge, he would answer well in this 
Commission. You will see, in the inclosed, what Mr. 
Sergeant says of him. j <a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='colleague'>General Mifflin</a> has proposed a 
plan for the Quarter-master's Department, that appears 
judicious, and well fitted to answer the purpose of 
good service and economy at the same time. He 
would divide this department into its military and 
civil branches ; the former to be filled by a person 
well qualified to discharge its duties, and the latter 
again to be divided into Commissaries of Teams, of 
Forage, of Tents, &c., to be governed in their purchases by estimates from the Quartermaster-General, , 
who is to touch no money but a moderate and sufficient salary. 
</p><p>
It is Unfortunately too true, that our enemies pay 
little regard to good faith, or any obligations of justice and humanity, which renders the Convention of 
<a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a> a matter of great moment ; and it is also, 
as you justly observe, an affair of infinite delicacy. 
The undoubted advantage they will take, even of the 
appearance of infraction on our part, and the Ameri 
can character, which is concerned in preserving its 
faith inviolate, cover this affair with difficulties, and 
prove the disadvantage we are under in conducting 
war against an old, corrupt, and powerful people, who, 
having much credit and influence in the world, will 
venture on things that would totally ruin the reputation of young and rising communities like ours. 
</p><p>
The English, however, were not to blame in the 
business of Closter Seven. That Convention was left 
incomplete by the Commanders who made it. It was 
stipulated, particularly, that the Court of Versailles 
must ratify, and that within a certain time, which 
was not done until long after the time was elapsed, 
and before which ratification the troops of Hanover 
had returned to arms. Upon this occasion, the good 
faith of England is not impeached. 
</p><p>
It is greatly to be regretted that the situation of 
your army unfits it for vigorous action, because it is 
very obvious that the enemy's possession of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> this winter and the ensuing spring, may produce consequences extensively injurious. You well 
know, Sir, how weak and divided the people of this 
State are from various causes. Those of Delaware are 
still worse. In this condition, with the infinite arts 
of our enemies, pushed up almost to the centre of 
the above Governments, and aided by the powerful 
means of supplying the wants, fanciful and real, of 
the people, with all kinds of European goods and 
salt, it will be no great matter of surprise if we were 
to find a total revolution in Pennsylvania and Dela 
ware. Add to this, the ill condition of our finances, 
which totter upon every seeming success of the 
enemy. 
</p><p>
It is not to be supposed that, where so much is at 
stake, Great Britain will fail to make most potent 
efforts to recover her honor, and prevent her ruin. 
Upon this ground, we may expect considerable reenforcements, and early as possible in the spring. With 
an army much strengthened, General Howe may effect 
purposes dangerous to America, It happens, too, unluckily for us, that, in order to support the credit of 
our money, the several States must, of necessity, impose large and immediate taxes. This is the most 
delicate and difficult of all Government operations, 
even in old and undisturbed states. Yet it is una 
voidable, and Congress have pressingiy requested that 
it may be quickly and extensively entered upon. 
</p><p>
It was most evident, to discerning men, that the 
change in the Commissariat, at the time it was adopted, would produce most mischievous consequences, 
yet such was the rage of reformation, that no en 
deavours to prevent the evil could avail 5 and now I 
feel the most anxious solicitude, for fear the consequences may disperse our army even in face of the 
enemy. A Committee is appointed to confer with 
the Commissary-General, and to try what can be 
done to avert the evil. I wish they may be for 
tunate enough to hit upon a remedy. That there 
should be a want of flour amazes me, and proves 
great want of attention in the Commissary-General, 
because I well know that any quantity might have , 
been got in Virginia at a reasonable price. 
</p><p>
By our last despatches from the West Indies, it 
would seem as if a war between France and England 
was inevitable, unless the latter should restore all her 
captures made from the former without the limits 
prescribed by treaty, and which have been made under authority of an Act of Parliament. But the 
royal spleen against America is such, that every con 
sideration falls before the wish to subjugate this free country. Yet Mr. Bingham mentions, that the ministerial writings are calculated to rouse the national 
resentment against France. If so, it is evident they 
want to set Europe on fire, that the smoke may 
cover them from the eyes of their injured country. 
Mr. Carmichael writes that Dr. Lee was returning to 
Paris from Berlin, having finished his business success 
fully at the Prussian Court; and Mr. Bingham says 
it is certain that the King of Prussia has opened his 
ports to the United State's, and that Portugal has 
deserted the interest of England, and acceded to the 
family compact. This is all good news, and will, I 
hope, furnish employment quickly for our unprin 
cipled enemies.
</p><p>
My ill state of health will compel me to return 
home in a few days, where I shall continue ardently 
to pray for your health and success. 
</p><p>
I am, dear Sir, affectionately yours,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
The unfortunate cause, which hath prevented me 
from attending to your last favor sooner, will, I hope, 
be my excuse. The long sickness and death of my 
much-loved brother of Bellevue, has for some time 
past confined me in Virginia, and removed every other 
consideration from my mind. I now embrace the first 
good opportunity of sending you the pamphlet of 
forgeries, that I formerly mentioned. It is among the 
pitiful arts of our enemies, to endeavour at sowing 
dissension among the friends of liberty and their country. With me, such tricks can never prevail. 
</p><p>
Give me leave, dear Sir, to congratulate you on 
the happy event of our treaty with France being so 
effectually concluded. Congress have ratified it on 
their part, and ordered the ratification to be delivered 
in due form. This will be announced to the public 
immediately. The counsels of France have been governed, in this affair, by true magnanimity and sound 
policy. It was magnanimous in his Most Christian 
Majesty, not to avail himself of our situation to demand unequal and oppressive terms; and it was wise 
to leave the commerce of America open to all the 
maritime states, which will prevent their jealous} 
and enmity, and make them foes instead of friends to 
England. Great Britain has its choice now of madness or meanness. She will not war with the house 
of Bourbon and North America at the same time ; so 
that I incline to think meanness will be her choice, 
as best befitting her present state and the minds of 
her rulers. It will probably happen, that the trade of France will not now be interrupted ; and thus, by 
affording no pretext for war, the whole force of our enemies may be devoted to one last and vigorous 
campaign against us. As wise men, we ought to be 
prepared for such an event, by collecting a strong 
army, and by every other means that can discourage 
and defeat such intentions of our inveterate enemies. 
Being disappointed this campaign, must infallibly compel the acknowledgment of our independence, and 
keep the world, for some time longer, in peace. Eng 
land alone will pay, for her wickedness and folly, by 
the loss of North America. 
</p><p>
Our information is good, that very few troops can 
come here from Germany ; and private letters, as well 
as public papers, say that the plan of getting regiments by subscription, though much boasted of at 
first, has fallen very low. From the Highlands of 
North Britain some men will be obtained, and per 
haps a few from England and Ireland, but there 
seems no reason to suppose that their every exertion can add more than four or five thousand to the 
present force in North America. But this will re 
quire a very considerable strength, on our part, to 
make the event certain. An unsettled dispute between the Emperor and the King of Prussia (which 
England will undoubtedly foment) concerning the di 
vision of the estate of the late Elector of Bavaria, 
has threatened a rupture in Europe, not for our ad 
vantage, because the former of these princes being 
with us, the latter might be disposed to favor the 
views of Great Britain, to our injury. 
</p><p>
Alderman Lee writes, that there is some hope of 
this being negotiated happily. An intelligent correspondent in England writes to Alderman Lee, that it 
was uncertain whether Lord North's Bills would be 
agreed to or not, but that they were industriously 
sent over here, and circulated, to prevent our treaty 
with France from being concluded. Vain and unwise 
men ! Their means are always destructive of their 
ends. North's delusive and indecent propositions 
have accelerated an adoption of the agreement with 
France. 
</p><p>
I am much concerned to find, in Virginia, such want of method and industry in collecting and bringing forward the drafts. When I came away, there 
were all the men (amounting to forty-one or two), 
both of the former and the latter drafts, remaining 
in King George, merely for want of an officer to 
bring them away ; and I am misinformed if it is not 
the case in other counties. As far as I have been 
able to learn, it is probable that, if dexterous recruiting officers were properly furnished for the business, 
and sent out, almost all these veterans, that have 
been discharged from our nine regiments, would reenlist in a short time. I am, with sincere esteem, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rhl" rel="me">RICHARD HENRY LEE</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. Alderman Lee says, they talk of sending 
Lord Westcote and Hans Stanley here, to treat with 
us, and that they are to bring half a million of guineas to bribe the Congress. From their own corruptions, these men reason to the corruption of all others. 
</p><p>
I had almost forgot to mention, that four expresses 
were sent from St. James's, on the subject of Generals Howe and Clinton. The latter had leave to go 
home ; the Court was disgusted with the , former, and 
had recalled him, but recollecting that Clinton might 
be come away, another messenger was sent to stop 
Howe, if that should be the case. I hoped, they are 
both gone.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I hope the measures you have taken will be effectual to the purpose of reenlisting the army, because 
it is an object of great importance; and I readily 
admit the propriety of first trying those methods 
which promise fewest ill consequences. Danger will 
only arise from pressing such too far, and urging 
the experiment too long. I very much fear, Sir, that 
the knowledge of depreciation has reached the most 
uninformed, and, therefore, that every evil which can, 
will happen to us from this cause. But I am not 
without hope that such measures will be adopted as 
may, before it is too late, restore our currency to its 
proper value. 
</p><p>
It is, indeed, no easy matter to judge of the designs of the enemy. They have created to themselves a great choice of difficulties. I "believe they would 
willingly change their war of conquest to one of revenge altogether ; but revenge must be postponed to 
safety. General Clinton's army is the only hope of 
Canada, Nova Scotia, the Floridas, the West Indies, 
and, I may safely add, much so of Great Britain and 
Ireland. Whilst this is the case, although <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, in 
its present situation, is a very tempting object, I can 
not think they will undertake it. However, what 
can be attempted, may be attempted, and wisdom 
points to precaution. If it be true, and our information comes pretty direct, that Dominica has fallen, 
that Jamaica and St. Kitts are in jeopardy, and that 
Keppel has fled from the fleet of France, we may sup 
pose that our enemies can make no long stay with 
us. Distance and land-carriage distress us greatly in 
the article of bread provision- to which is added an 
artificial scarcity, created in the midst of plenty, by 
an infamous set of engrossers, who have raised the 
price of flour from four dollars a hundred to five 
and six pounds. I hope the measures we are taking 
with these gentry will make them suffer in a way 
most hurtful to them. 
</p><p>
Mr. Eustis had quitted this city before your letter 
came to hand, and as he is gone to the army, I have 
inclosed the letter in this. I am, with much esteem 
and regard, dear Sir, your most obedient and very 
humble servant,
