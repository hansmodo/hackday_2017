</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I fully intended, for several weeks past, to pay my respects in person to your Excellency, but am 
obliged to deny myself that pleasure, having been detained here much longer than I expected, and been anxious to return to Carolina. 
</p><p>
Though I have no doubt that the matter committed 
to your Excellency, by a resolve of Congress of the 
5th instant, has already engaged your attention, and 
that you will order the most proper plan for effecting so desirable a measure to be carried into execution, as soon as the more immediate object of the 
present campaign will admit, yet I cannot forbear representing, that the state of South Carolina and 
Georgia is such as demonstrates the absolute necessity of expelling the enemy from those countries, as 
speedily as possible ; and that this cannot be done 
without a considerable naval force, and a large number of regular troops. I therefore flatter myself that, 
as soon as the intended operations against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
shall be terminated, either successfully (as I hope 
they will be) or by the season's not admitting a continuance of them, or if an attack on that city should 
not be deemed expedient, your Excellency will send 
such a force to the southward. 
</p><p>
Congress have requested the Minister of France to 
use his influence to cause the plan of operations which you may form, or the measures which you may 
recommend to be undertaken by the forces of their 
most Christian and Catholic Majesties, in consequence 
of the resolve above mentioned, to be carried into 
effect. He is heartily disposed and has promised to 
do so. Should your Excellency require aid from the 
French forces in the West Indies, I have good reasons to believe it will be afforded, unless the Commanders there are expressly limited to acting in the 
islands, which I cannot conceive they are. In that 
case, I am persuaded that your application to the 
Court of France would obtain a revocation of such 
orders, and that his most Christian Majesty would 
grant any lesser forces which you may require, either 
from his kingdom or his islands. 
</p><p>
Thinking that it is thus in your power, and convinced that it is your earnest wish, to restore peace 
and safety to the two southernmost States, I hope 
those blessings will be speedily obtained. A consideration of the difficulty and delay attending the 
collecting any considerable quantity of provisions, will, 
I am sure, induce your Excellency to give timely 
notice of what measures you wish to have established 
in the Carolinas. I shall take the liberty of transmitting to your Excellency, from time to time, any 
intelligence which may appear material, and shall be 
happy to hear from you, that the prospect of complete relief to my distressed country is not far distant. I have the honor to be. 
</p><p>
With the greatest respect, &c., 
</p><p>

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I heartily congratulate your Excellency on the 
powerful aid which you have received from his Most 
Christian Majesty ; and, I doubt not, that the combined forces, under your command, will soon compel 
Lord Cornwallis to surrender himself and his whole 
army prisoners. Indeed, it seems almost impossible 
that they should escape. 
</p><p>
I wrote your Excellency about the 6th ultimo, by 
Colonel Morris, soliciting such aid as might be necessary for the recovery of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, as soon as New 
York should fall. This I did upon a presumption 
that your first attempt would be against that garrison. 
However, the season was so far advanced before Count 
de Grasse's arrival, that I apprehend, considering how 
much time the operations in Virginia must necessarily 
consume, that the attack upon <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> must be 
postponed for this year. 
</p><p>
No man can be more fully persuaded than myself of your Excellency's unremitted attention to each 
of the United States (how distant soever from you), 
and of your earnest desire to rescue every part of 
them from the enemy. I should not, therefore, offer 
to intrude upon you, when every moment of your 
time must be engaged in matters of the utmost importance, was it not from a fear (which I hope is 
groundless, and proceeding only from my anxiety for 
the country) that the French forces will be desirous 
of returning to the West Indies, when their present 
immediate object is accomplished. Should this be 
their intention, I must entreat your Excellency to endeavour to dissuade them, by the most powerful arguments, from such a measure. A siege of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, 
by the force now in Virginia, cannot fail to succeed 
in three or four weeks. While such a French fleet 
as the present is on our coast, the British fleet will 
not leave <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>; and while they remain there, 
the French have nothing to fear on account of the 
West India Islands. The recovery of the Southern 
States would probably occasion an immediate offer to 
America of the acknowledgment of her independence, 
and of an acceptable peace. 
</p><p>
On the contrary, at this juncture, when the hopes 
and expectations of our friends in the southernmost States are raised to the greatest height and our enemies here, both foreign and domestic, are struck with 
the utmost terror, and justly think every thing on 
the brink of being irrecoverably lost, a desertion of 
these States, by the force of our ally, would produce 
the worst of consequences. Many people, seeing no 
reason for such unaccountable conduct, the very reverse of what they have been led by authority to 
expect, will immediately begin to despond, and be 
induced to believe the report which, though groundless, is constantly circulated by the enemy, that these 
States will be given up to Great Britain, if the independence of the rest can be obtained. The spirits of 
the disaffected wall be revived. The inhabitants of 
the country [will continue] in a miserable condition, 
destitute of every necessary supply, not having, 
while the enemy are possessed of our seaports, and 
command our inlets, the means of procuring them ; 
and certainly, while they hold what they now have 
in these three States (though they should not be 
able to increase their possessions, which however 
they might if reenforced, as without doubt they 
would be), they will not incline to admit our independence, nor, on the other hand, will Congress give 
it up, though the war will be protracted, until these 
countries are totally recovered. But, if that event is 
not now effected, who can say when it will be, or 
when a period so favorable as the present will again 
offer ? 
</p><p>
These, and all other reasons, which may be adduced 
to influence the French Commanders to assist in an 
attack upon <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, will, I am persuaded, have 
already occurred to your Excellency. I have, therefore, only to repeat my most earnest request, that 
you will prevail upon the principal officers of our 
ally not to suffer so glorious an opportunity that now 
presents itself to slip, without laying hold of what is 
almost within their reach ; and offer my most fervent 
wishes, that all your undertakings may he crowned 
with success. I have the honor to he, with the greatest esteem and respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

Chei'aw, on <a href='/results.php?city=pedee river' rel='city origin'>Pedee River</a>, in South Carolina, <a rel='day origin' value='28'>28</a> <a rel="month origin" value="12">December</a>,  <a href='/results.php?year=1780' rel="origin">1780</a>. 
</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I received your Excellency's letter of September 
12th, about the latter end of October; and should 
ere now have transmitted to you an account of the 
several matters which you desired to know, if I could 
have obtained an authentic one ; but I have never 
been able to procure such information, even of the 
enemy's force and posts, as I conceived to be so, till 
lately. That, I communicated to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>, 
who, I doubt not, made you acquainted with it. Inclosed is a state of their strength and posts at present, and an answer to the several questions proposed 
by your letter. 
</p><p>
I presume your Excellency will receive from <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>, by this opportunity, a return of the troops 
under his command. It is therefore unnecessary for 
me to say any thing on that head. But I cannot 
avoid lamenting that they are so few, and that I do 
not see the probability of their being soon much increased. 
</p><p>
I am sorry that circumstances have not admitted 
of your detaching, to the southward, any force from 
the main army, or from the troops of his most Christian Majesty; and I fear that the effects of the enemy's possessing the two southernmost States much 
longer, will be altogether ruinous to many individuals 
(some of whom are already reduced to the greatest 
misery and distress), and injurious to the common 
cause. Several, "whose characters were much respected, have declared themselves British subjects ; many 
others will soon follow their example, unless we 
speedily receive considerable aid. The unfortunate 
affair near Camden ; the want of support ever since 
(for there has not been a Continental soldier in the 
State since that defeat, till within these three days); 
the little prospect of any; and the representation 
made by the enemy, of the inability or unwilliness 
of the other States to send any powerful aid, — have 
chagrined, and made unfavorable impressions on many, 
who were formerly our good friends. 
</p><p>
Some of the stanch inhabitants of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> have 
been lately sent to St. Augustine, and others are to 
follow. The enemy have hanged many people, who, 
from fear, or the impracticability of removing, had 
received protections or given paroles, and, from attachment to, had afterwards taken part with us. 
They have burnt a great number of houses, and turned many women, formerly of good fortune, with their 
children (whom their husbands or parents, from an unwillingness to join the enemy, had left), almost naked, 
into the woods. In short, they seem determined to 
break the spirit of every man, if they can, or to ruin 
him. Their cruelties, and the distresses of the people 
are indeed beyond description. I entreat your Excellency, therefore, seriously to consider the unhappy 
state of South Carolina and Georgia ; and I rely on 
your humanity and on your knowledge of their importance to the Union, for such speedy and effectual 
support, as may compel the enemy to evacuate every 
part of these countries. 
</p><p>
I have pressed the Governor, and several members of the Legislature of North Carolina, to raise its 
complement of Continental troops, according to the 
last requisition of Congress and the present arrangement of the army; and I am certain that Virginia 
and North Carolina mighty with proper exertions, soon 
bring five thousand such troops into the field. But 
I fear that North Carolina will persevere in her old 
plan of drafting militia for that service, and am persuaded that no other recommendation or influence 
than yours, will prevail on Virginia to relinquish the 
same system, and to raise a respectable number of 
troops for the war. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
