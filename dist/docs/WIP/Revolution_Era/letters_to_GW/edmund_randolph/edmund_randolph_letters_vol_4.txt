</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
Inclosed I return to you the papers which accompanied your favor of the 25th ultimo. It did not 
reach me until yesterday morning, when I submitted 
the whole to the Assembly. But the approach of 
the session to an end, forbids them to take up new 
business. The day after to-morrow is fixed for their 
departure, and much of what is now before them 
must be left incomplete. I am therefore desired, by 
the Speaker of the Delegates, to send the papers to 
you, and to assure you that the Assembly are fully 
sensible of your readiness to embrace every opportunity to improve the manufactures of our country. 
You know, Sir, that the Executive cannot give an 
establishment, or even aid, to M. de la Yallee, without the approbation of the Legislature. 
</p><p>
Although I was compelled, by duty, to lay before 
the Council your answer to my notification of your 
appointment to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, I was happy to find 
them concurring with me in the propriety of entreating you not to decide on a refusal immediately. 
Perhaps the obstacles now in view may he removed 
before Mayj and the nomination of a successor, if 
necessary at all, will be as effectually made some 
time hence as now. Perhaps, too (and indeed I fear 
the event), every other consideration may seem of. 
little weight, wheu compared with the crisis which 
may then hang over the United States. I hope, 
therefore, that you will excuse me for holding up 
your letter for the present, and waiting until time 
shall disclose the result of the commotions now prevailing. I have the honor to be, Sir, 
</p><p>
With the most perfect esteem and respect, &c., 
</p><p>

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
The delay which has hitherto occurred in transmitting to you the inclosed proceedings, will be ascribed, 
I hope, to its true causes; one of which will be 
found in my last letter, and the other, in the daily expectation of Mr. Ross's visit to <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>, in 
pursuance of our resolution of the 8th of December, 
<a href='/results.php?year=1785'>1785</a>. You may possibly be surprised, that a work, 
which has already expended a considerable sum of 
money, should be delineated in so few words as the 
copies now sent contain. But I beg leave to inform 
you, that we have detailed, in the execution, almost 
the whole of the resolutions. 
</p><p>
For example ; we have procured the ascertainment 
of a precise point to which the navigation is to be 
extended. Crow's Ferry being now established as 
such. We are authorized to borrow money at six 
per cent., and to extend the number of shares. Inexperienced as we were, we yet conceived that our 
duty called for an examination of the ground between <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> and Westham. The difficulties seemed greater than we at first apprehended. As soon 
as the report is prepared by a more skilful hand 
than we affect to be, it shall be forwarded to you. 
</p><p>
The old books of subscriptions are not complete, as 
I supposed when I wrote to you last. Seven shares 
are still unoccupied, of which we shall reserve the 
five which you wished for yourself It was impossible to engage any other labor than that of blacks; 
and this necessity has obliged us to bring the laborers into actual service earlier, perhaps, than we 
should have done in the present state of our imperfect knowledge of canals. But the subscribers would 
have been dissatisfied, had we not begun in the 
course of this year ; and negroes, you know. Sir, 
must be hired in January at farthest. 
</p><p>
Concerning our progress in this great business, our 
plans, and future expectations, we beg you to inquire 
of James Harris, our Manager, who will deliver this 
letter. He is a quaker, of good character as a man, 
and a mechanic, formed by nature for the management of water, when applied to mills. He has added 
nothing to his natural turn by the view of any great 
works. We therefore request, if you see no impropriety, that you would give him such a passport to 
the Potomac works, as will enable him to get a 
thorough insight into what is there projected. You 
perceive that Mr. Ross was originally intended to be 
sent to <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a> for this purpose ; but he has 
been, for a length of time, under a severe disease, 
and is not yet restored. The office of subordinate 
Manager, mentioned in one of the resolutions, does 
not exist ; it being swallowed up in that of Mr. Harris. It is not improbable that Mr. Harris may 
continue his journey to the Susquehanna Canal. If 
so, we shall thank you to furnish him with a certificate of being employed by the James River Company, in any manner which may appear most likely 
to introduce him into an acquaintance with those of 
that scheme who may be most intelligent. 
</p><p>
Thus, my dear Su, I have written to you, at the 
desire of my brethren in office, a tedious account of 
our operations. Permit me, therefore, to return to 
the contemplation of private friendship, and to assure 
you that I am always, 
</p><p>
With the greatest respect and esteem, yours, &c., 
</p><p>

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
By the inclosed act, you will readily discover that 
the Assembly are alarmed at the storms which threaten the United States. What our enemies have foretold, seems to be hastening to its accomplishment ; 
and cannot be frustrated but by an instantaneous, 
zealous, and steady union among the friends of the 
Federal Government. To you I need not press our 
present dangers. The inefficiency of Congress you 
have often felt in your official character ; the increasing languor of our associated Republics you hourly 
see ; and a dissolution would be, I know, to you a 
source of the deepest mortification. 
</p><p>
I freely, then, entreat you to accept the unanimous 
appointment of the General Assembly to the Convention at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. For the gloomy prospect still 
admits one ray of hope ; that those who began, carried on, and consummated the revolution, can yet 
rescue America from the impending ruin. 
</p><p>
I have the honor. Sir, to be, with the sincerest 
esteem and respect, yours, &c.,

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
When I had the honor of writing to you last, the amendments had, I believe, been under consideration in a Committee of the Whole, and ten were adopted, 
and the two last rejected. Upon the report being made to the House, and without a debate of any consequence, the whole twelve were ratified. They are 
now with the Senate, who were yesterday employed about them. That body will attempt to postpone them ; for a majority is unfriendly to the Government. 
But an effort will be made against this destructive measure. 
</p><p>
In the House of Delegates, it was yesterday moved to declare the remainder of the amendments, proposed 
by our Convention, essential to the rights and liberties of the people. An amendment was offered, saying that, in pursuance of the wnll of the people, as 
expressed by our Convention, the General Assembly 
ouoht to uro'e Congress to a recomideration of them. 
The amendment was carried by the Speaker giving a 
casting vote. This shows the strength of the parties; 
and that, in the House of Delegates, the anti-federal 
force has diminished much since the last year. A 
representation is to be prepared, and the inclosed 
speaks the temper which we wish to exhibit in it. 
Whether we shall succeed in our attempt to carry 
such a remonstrance through, is with me very doubtful. It will be pushed, because it seems to discountenance any future importunities for amendments, 
which, in my opinion, is now a very important point. 
I should have been sanguine in my belief of carrying the representation through, in its present form, 
if the friends would have joined the enemies of the 
Constitution, in suspending the ratification of the 
eleventh amendment, which is exceptionable to me, 
in giving a handle to say, that Congress have endeavoured to administer an opiate, by an alteration, 
which is merely plausible. 
</p><p>
The twelfth amendment does not appear to me to 
have any real effect, unless it be to excite a dispute 
between the United States and every particular State, 
as to what is delegated. It accords pretty nearly 
with what our Convention proposed; but, being once 
adopted, it may produce new matter for the cavils 
of the designing. I am, dear Sir, your 
</p><p>
Obliged and affectionate friend and servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=edr" rel="me">Edmund Randolph</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I shall do myself the honor of replying to 
your official letter, as soon as the Assembly rises.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
By the papers, which I have now the honor of returning to you, a "wish seems to be expressed that the President should recommend to Congress a digest 
of federal law, the appointment of one person only to such a service, and the selection of the author of those papers for that work. 
</p><p>
Whether, at a future day, when Congress shall appear to have neglected or slumbered over the subject, it may be expedient to rekindle their attention 
by a special recommendation, I pretend not to foresee. But, at present, it may be affirmed, that the House of Representatives possess, in the four last 
paragraphs of the notes to the Report on the Judicial System, an unequivocal suggestion of this very point. I therefore take the liberty of referring you to them. 
</p><p>
The suggestion, indeed, having come from a quarter which affects no title to the deference of that body, would undoubtedly be enforced by the solicitude of the Executive. But I have greatly erred, if 
I do not discover one characteristic of its conduct to be, not to throw any weight of personal or official character into measures, when no crisis demands it. 
If, then, the judicial system shall ever be revised, a federal code will stand prominent to view. If the judicial system shall not be revised, the federal code 
itself, as speaking more feebly to the particular interests and feelings of the House, can hardly expect 
to be more kindly treated. In the midst of the agitations, which have been or will be produced by deliberations on the war, the excise, the fisheries, the 
manufactures, the trade with Great Britain, the regulations of a mint, the militia, and many other topics of an animating cast, it will probably be asked, what 
peculiar and immediate urgency has the President remarked for inviting Congress to this abstract inquiry? 
Is there any danger of the two branches of the Legislature forgetting it, if it be important ? Especially 
as it is their direct duty to originate proposals for establishing or amending any system of laws. 
</p><p>
If, with a recommendation to this effect, another 
should be united, that a single person should execute 
the work, some uncommon sensations of surprise may 
be created. To qualify that single person, he ought 
to be accurately versed in the legislation and jurisprudence of every State. Nay, I am not certain that 
he ought not to know the very prejudices of each 
State. For it will not be enough to draw a line of 
partition between the Federal and State Governments, 
without having some regard to the temper of the 
latter. The necessary information can be contributed 
only by a number of able men, differently situated in 
the United States. These men can be found, and 
perhaps their reluctance may be overcome, and they 
may be induced to divide the Herculean task among 
them. But, even with a division of the responsibility, 
they ought to be diffident. 
</p><p>
Should it, however, be thought advisable, that the 
project should be now favored by a special communication from the President, and that a single person 
should be preferred, I certainly shall add nothing 
concerning any gentleman who may be so happy as 
to enjoy the highly-valuable endowments requisite for 
the fulfilment of the trust. But may it not be seriously apprehended, that the employment of a Judge 
in such a business, will excite a jealousy among those 
of his associates, who will not acknowledge their inferiority? Will it not warp him in all his decisions 
to those interpretations which he may have given of 
the Constitution? May he not rather lean in his 
judgments more to what he recollects to have been 
his intention in drawing a law, than obey the settled 
rules of construction? And who can say, let him be 
a Judge or Tvliat he will, that the glossary or comment, which he alone shall furnish, may not, insensibly, and contrary to his own honest mind, be tinctured with party views? 
</p><p>
Upon the whole, although I believe that the digest, 
will sooner or later be attempted, yet am I sure that 
the Legislature will not cordially patronize it, until 
its necessity shall be more obvious. I intended to 
have waited on you personally with this letter j but 
having been detained in Court during the whole 
week, I was unable to do so. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be. Sir, with a sincere, and 
affectionate attachment and respect, &c., 
</p><p>

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have revolved, with great attention, the matter 
of the letter which you yesterday did me the honor 
of confiding to my perusal. Convulsed as we are, I 
cannot but believe that there is scarcely a man in 
the Government, whom party will not, sooner or later, 
destine for an attack. A communication, therefore 
which seems even to be tinctured with particular objects, will naturally excite caution. I hope, however, 
that I shall not be understood to insinuate the most 
distant suspicion of that affectionate attachment which 
is professed ; for I am truly persuaded of it. I mean 
no more than that kind of caution which would prevent you from heartily acceding to, or rejecting, propositions so delicate in themselves. 
</p><p>
What is due to the French nation up to the close 
of <a href='/results.php?year=1792'>1792</a>, ought, if practicable, to be paid to the existing authorities of France. This can never be questioned as to its validity or propriety, let the shape 
of their Government be what it will ; nor can it give 
just umbrage to any member of the hostile Confederacy. But, as this sum is probably far below the wishes of the French Minister, it will be asked 
whether the large advance of three million tournois can be made ; and, if it can, ought it to be made ? 
</p><p>
You informed me, Sir, that the ability of the treasury to accomplish this, depended upon the success 
of a bill now on its passage through the Legislature. 
Of course the United States are not yet in a capacity of advancing, unless the other advice be followed, 
of scrutinizing the Treasury Department, and thence 
discovering funds ; or of instituting a new loan. The 
former is in a train of being executed, and could not 
now be quickened. Should the Executive at this moment originate a similar investigation, it might look 
like something more than a neutrality between the 
parties. Possibly, at a future day, when the result of 
the Congressional inquiry shall be known, if it should 
not be satisfactory to you, you may deem it expedient to impart the nature of the information referred 
to in the letter to the Secretary of the Treasury. In 
the mean time, While Congress are still in motion on 
the subject of finance, I presume that the proposed 
alternative of a loan must be suspended. 
</p><p>
Let me next suppose, that money adequate to the 
advance was now in hand. Even the situation of 
France, with respect to other powers, is serious and 
important. A voluntary payment of what is not yet 
due, carries with it causes of jealousy. On the opposite side, threatened famine will, if not attempted 
to be averted, rouse the zealous partisans of French 
politics in America. Perhaps, too, it may deserve 
consideration, how far the opportunity of forming a 
close connection with the French republic may be 
lost or weakened by refusing to gratify it, and how 
far it may spread a favorable impression of the Federal Administration throughout the United States. 
Again ; should the advance be approved, the allied 
nations can well be told, if they remonstrate, that the 
danger of a famine was a leading motive. Should it 
be disapproved, the French will be conscious that they 
have no right to demand it, and that money cannot 
be furnished in republics at will, or in the same profusion as in monarchies. Upon the whole, I should be 
inclined to the advance, if it was easily within our 
reach. But I see no reason, nor a state of things 
sufficiently ripe, for deciding the question at this moment. 
</p><p>
I take the liberty, therefore, of suggesting, whether Mr. Ternaut may not be informed that the balance, 
up to the end of <a href='/results.php?year=1792'>1792</a>, shall be paid, and that a definitive' answer, as to the residue of the requisition, 
will be given as soon as the fiscal arrangements of Congress shall be finished. Then, and not till then, will you be possessed of the facts, necessary in such 
a case ; then, and not till then, will you be able to avoid the appearance of sheltering one officer, or of countenancing his adversary. Mr. Ternant cannot but 
acquiesce in the fitness of the measure ; and it will be seen, by the gentleman who wrote the letter, that while you will not precipitate yourself into the steps 
recommended, you have marked out, in your own mind, a day, reasonably distant, for again calling the subject into view. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c.,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I do myself the honor of presenting to you some of those views, which the very delicate affair of the 
removal affords, and the result of a provisional inquiry which I set on foot. 
</p><p>
1. The charges have come in an ambiguous form, 
half private, half public \ and it must be uncertain, 
until the arrival of the new Minister from France, to 
what extent those charges are to be pressed. To 
seize so imperfect an opportunity for dismission, might 
argue an eagerness to get rid of the officer ; and, 
before such a stroke is given to the reputation of 
any man, ought he not to be heard ? 
</p><p>
2. I understand, however, that a middle ground 
has been recommended ; by exchanging the gentleman in question for another diplomatic resident. At 
first sight, this expedient has the advantage of being 
conciliatory, although, even in this particular, it may 
possibly fail. But what will be the reason given out 
to the world for such an alteration ? I here take it 
for granted, that if, on any such occasion, the Cabinet 
can conceal the genuine motive, on this it will be 
notorious. It will be known in France, and throughout the United States, that the disgust of the French 
Ministry at the hostility of our officer's politics was 
the leading cause of the decisive step. The people 
of the United States will immediately say, that he 
is not only protected in his misconduct, but that a 
partiality is discovered for his ideas on government, 
against which they are eminently inveterate, from 
their real sympathy with the revolution of France. 
Again; it will be difficult to satisfy the people of 
France, that it was consistent with an affectionate 
regard for their welfare, to send a Minister thus prejudiced against them, whom they assert to be "dangerous from his talents," to the Court of London, 
which has now probably become an avowed enemy 
to them. 
</p><p>
3. I doubt, therefore, exceedingly, whether any determination ought yet to be made ; especially as, during the recess of the Senate, you may remove, if you 
think proper. But I can scarcely doubt on the impropriety of the substitute proposed, considered relatively to the present time, although after circumstances may perhaps require these sentiments to be 
revised. 
</p><p>
4. Supposing the ultimate possibility of a dismission, I have labored, provisionally, to bring about the 
other arrangement. But I find this to be impracticable ; the one gentleman being immovable in the 
resolution which he expressed to you the other day, 
and the other gentleman being very explicit, that it 
is absolutely inadmissible, in his mind, to enter into 
the Administration under either of the aspects contemplated, or, indeed, under any other.

the files of the office.

your confidence, and to be assured that, let the consequence be what it may, in this office no consideration of party shall ever influence me. Nothing shall 
relax my attention or warp my probity; and it shall 
be my unremitted study to become an accurate master of this new and important business. At the commencement of my duties, I have thought it advisable to write to the Secretaries of the Treasury and 
of War, and to the President of the Bank of the 
United States, the letters of which the inclosed are

Sir,

I have examined all <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague'>Mr. Morris</a>'s ministerial correspondence ; and, after the impression which I had received from others, whom I supposed to be conversant 
with it, I am really astonished to find so little of what is exceptionable, and so much of what the most 
violent would call patriotic. The parts to be withheld, will probably be of these denominations ; — 1, what the conduct of the rulers in France, which, if returned to that country, might expose him to danger ; 3, 
the authors of some interesting information, who, if known, would be infallibly denounced. He speaks 
indeed of his Court, a phrase which he might as well have let alone. I shall do myself the honor of waiting on you in the morning ; and I write now, only to 
give you an outline of the true state of the business. I have the honor. Sir, to be, with the highest respect.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I conclude, from what you observed yesterday, that, 
in the nomination of an Envoy Extraordinary to London, you prefer some statement more special than is 
customary in nominations. I beg leave, therefore, to 
present to you a short review of the subject, that 
you may determine whether the occurrences in the 
Legislature are ripe for such a statement. 
</p><p>
I believe that I was among the first, if not the 
first, who suggested this mission to your consideration, and I am still its advocate. I was induced to 
think favorably of the measure, — 1. Because the representations made by our Minister in Ordinary, seemed to rest on the British files among the business, 
which, if ever entered upon, would be entered upon 
at extreme leisure. 2. Because the recent accumulation of injuries called for pointed notice. 3. Because the merchants and insurers would suspect an 
inattention in Government, if their interests were left 
to the routine and delays of common affairs, and 
would, on the other hand, be highly gratified by the 
movement. 4. Because the British nation, without 
whose affections the British Minister can do nothing 
of importance in war, ought to be retained, by the 
strongest demonstrations, in the persuasion that we 
mean peaceable negotiation, rather than war. And 
5. Because a distinguished character, sent fresh from 
the feelings of the United States, would with more 
confidence assert, and with more certainty impress. 
</p><p>
I confess that two remarks, which came from yourself, had for some time employed my thoughts. 
These related to the sensations which might be excited in <a href='/results.php?tla=ccp' rel=''>Mr. Pinckney</a>, and to those which may be 
excited in the people of our country. To wound unnecessarily a valuable and meritorious officer, as <a href='/results.php?tla=ccp' rel=''>Mr. Pinckney</a> is, may be affirmed to be a public mischief But this will not be the case, I hope. He 
will admit, that on great occasions, such missions are 
often instituted; that they are never interpreted by 
the diplomatic world as a disparagement of the Minister Resident ; and that a step of so much eclat will 
rouse the British Court from their profound slumber 
over our various applications. He may, moreover, receive such declarations of continuing confidence, as to 
calm little possible inquietudes. 
</p><p>
The same kind of considerations will satisfy the 
animadversions of our citizens. For if a man, the 
most conspicuous for talents and character, were now 
the stationary representative of the United States at 
London, the efficacy of a solemn and special mission 
may still, upon the foregoing principles, be easily 
conceived. And yet, the difference between one grade 
and another is not so powerful as of itself to secure 
a difference of reception to our demands. The Envoy 
will be impotent, if he is to carry with him only the 
language of rhetoric or of menaces, without the power of revenge. To fulfil the purpose of his creation, he 
must show that the United States can and will vindicate their rights. But measures of this kind depend on Congress alone, and from them we have the 
embargo alone. They are employed in discussions 
leading to these objects. To nominate an Envoy immediately, or until you see the nature and extent of 
the preparations, may perhaps be to nominate a useless officer; and if, by such a nomination, it is proposed to give a direction to the views and deliberations of Congress, may it not be better to send a 
message to them, urging them to adopt the preparatory steps, than to run the risk of appointing a gentleman, who, if our state of imbecility is to remain, 
cannot, except from personal qualities, have more influence than <a href='/results.php?tla=ccp' rel=''>Mr. Pinckney</a>? It would be unusual, 
too, to expect, by an act done to the Senate in its 
Executive capacity, that its influence should extend 
to the other House in its Legislative. 
</p><p>
I believe, indeed, that to postpone the nomination, 
will be attended with two advantages. The one is, 
that after Congress shall have given nerve to our 
affairs, the propriety of the mission will no longer be 
questionable ; nor will it require those arguments, 
which, in the present state of things, will not be sufficiently apparent. The other is, that the person nominated will then be able to decide, whether he 
would choose to be the missionary, after certain acts 
of Congress. For example, it might accord with the 
opinions of some gentlemen to go, with an act of 
sequestration in their hands. 
</p><p>
Notwithstanding the suspension of the nomination, 
you may perhaps approve of mentioning, in the mean 
time, your intention eventually to the person whom 
you contemplate. I must request your instruction, 
whether I am to prepare the message to the Senate 
immediately.

I have the honor, Sir, to he, &c.,

SiR; 
</p><p>
I was honored by your private letter of the 6th instant, about half an hour ago ; and immediately delivered to Mrs. Washington the one addressed to her. 
</p><p>
Mr. Butler and Mr. Brown, of the Senate, called to learn the intelligence from Europe. I considered their title to read the despatches as being no better 
than that of other men; and I told them, verbally, only what I have told others. With the former gentleman some discussion arose how far the Senate 
might call for the papers relative to the negotiation ; but he did not, however, apply the remark to himself as an individual. I cut the matter short, by 
observing that he knew my opinion to be that the President was bound, in duty, and possessed the right, to withhold whatsoever he thought improper to be 
communicated. I could not help asking, at the same time, whether the example of Mr. Edwards, which I mentioned to you in a late letter, did not prove 
that Senators could disclose secrets as well as other folks. 
</p><p>
There is nothing so little talked of as the yellow fever. I believe that I am almost the only inquirer after it; and those to whom I address myself, seem 
to take time to recollect themselves, as if the subject was a perfect stranger to their memory. <a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='met co-worker colleague'>General Knox</a> is with me ; and we shall have ready, for the 
express of Monday, the analysis of an address to Congress. Mrs. Washington and family were well this morning. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to he, Sir, with the highest respect and affectionate attachment, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
