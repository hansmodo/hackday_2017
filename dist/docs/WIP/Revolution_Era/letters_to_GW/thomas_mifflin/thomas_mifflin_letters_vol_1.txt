DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Agreeably to your order, by <a href='/results.php?tla=jor' rel='colleague'>Colonel Reed's</a> letter, I have directed Colonel Holden to march with his three companies this evening to King's Bridge. 
</p><p>
I shall, in consequence of that order, be under the necessity of totally neglecting the Point Battery, until men are sent up to work on it; our two battalions being employed in raising part of our parapet, covering the large magazine, cutting and forming the abatis, digging wells, &c. That magazine will be prepared to receive the powder this evening. The magazine within the fort will be completed in two days. 
</p><p>
We have so many sick and on guard, that I have been obliged to give up the outworks for the pre sent. 
</p><p>
As I had no orders respecting the chevaux-de-frise, 
and as the artists appeared willing to take their own 
way, I did not presume to interfere. 
</p><p>
In future I will watch and direct their movements. 
But, as Colonel Putnam is absent with the soundings, 
and as the vessels are sent up without persons who 
are acquainted with the depth of water for which 
they were calculated, I shall be at a loss to sink 
them. The sloops which came up this morning, being small, must, in my opinion, be sunk to the west 
ward of the brigs. If Colonel Putnam had another 
destination for them, I beg to be favored with direction. where to place them. 
</p><p>
In future it will be best to send up single vessels, 
it being the most abstruse problem in hydraulics to 
determine of what size the several ports, or holes, 
would be, in vessels of different tonnage and construction, in order to their sinking at the same time. 
If one sinks before the other, we risk, as yesterday. 
</p><p>
I believe that vessels above ninety tons, without 
iron work, will answer very well. No ship will at 
tempt to pass over them, even if they were eighteen 
feet below the surface. If five or six vessels, of one 
hundred tons each, could be sent up, I shall apprehend no danger of ships of war passing them. It 
will be the most expeditious and the most frugal 
scheme. The Colossus is now at anchor, a little to 
the westward of her post. The buoy, fixed by Colonel Putnam, appears to be too distant from the shore. 
Possibly it may have been carried there by the wind 
and current. It shall be removed this night, if possible ; the brigs, this afternoon. 
</p><p>
The enemy may possibly attempt to weigh some 
of the vessels. It will, therefore, be necessary to fix 
some guns at the battery. If I can obtain no heavy 
guns, I will send down our four twelve-pounders and 
the howitzer, and fight them. I am, with zeal and 
attachment, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency s, &c.

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The inclosed I have this minute received from an 
express sent by my order to <a href='/results.php?tla=jhc' rel='colleague'>General Cadwalader</a>. 
The General, not knowing that I was here, did not 
write to me, and as I supposed the contents of importance in my movements, I took the liberty to 
open the letter, for which I must plead only the 
occasion in excuse. 
</p><p>
I came here at four o clock this afternoon. Five 
hundred men, sent from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> yesterday, crossed 
to Burlington this morning. This evening I sent 
over near three hundred more. To-morrow seven or 
eight hundred shall follow. I will cross in the morning , and endeavour to form them into regiments, and 
a brigade. They consist of many different corps, and 
want much regulation. 
</p><p>
If your Excellency has any orders for me, other than to join <a href='/results.php?tla=jhc' rel='colleague'>General Cadwalader</a> as soon as possible, 
please to favor me with such as are necessary, and I 
will punctually obey them. Pennsylvania is at length 
roused, and coming in great numbers to your Excellency's aid. Mr. Hall will return with your orders. 
I am informed that we cannot cross at Bordentown, 
nor at any place between that place and this. I 
have no doubt of effecting it here, having sent from 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> in the morning several fine boats, which 
are now here. 
</p><p>
I most heartily congratulate your Excellency on 
your late capital stroke, and wish most ardently a 
repetition. I am, with great affection and attachment, 
Your Excellency's obedient servant, 
</p><p>
