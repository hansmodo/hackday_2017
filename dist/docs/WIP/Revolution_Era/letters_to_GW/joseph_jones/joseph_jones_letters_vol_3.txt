Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
A report from the Board of War, in consequence 
of a letter of <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>'s to Congress, referred 
to the Board, respecting the promotion of Colonel Daniel Morgan to the office of Brigadier-General, now 
lies upon the table, at my request. The Board have 
stated his former services, his being first Colonel of 
our line, and the deficiency of that State at present 
in her quota of troops. If a promotion of General Officers is to take place, and to be made through the 
line of the army, Morgan has many before him ; but 
if the promotions are to be through the line of the 
State, that officer, it appears, stands first. <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> has mentioned his intention of giving Morgan 
the command of a body of light infantry; but, as the 
State has given the command of the militia, lately 
sent to the southward, to Colonel Stevens, who was 
Morgan's junior officer in the Continental line, with 
the commission of Brigadier-General, he will command 
Colonel Morgan, and this. Gates thinks, will disgust 
him, and therefore, with great earnestness and warmth, 
presses his promotion. I shall thank you for your confidential communications upon This matter, as the 
report, I think, will not be pressed or taken up until 
the Virginia Delegates are fully informed, as it was 
upon my motion, to obtain time for information, it lies 
upon the table. Besides, as he left the army in disgust, under your immediate command, I did not like 
the present mode of his obtaining the promotion, without (that I know of) any alteration of circumstances, 
at the pressing instance of <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>. 
</p><p>
Pray, my dear Sir, do you recollect the purport of 
a letter lately written to Colonel Harrison, Speaker 
of the House of Delegates, representing the deranged 
state of the French finances, their as well as Spain's 
declining navy, and the increasing strength of the 
British navy? I have heard of such a letter that 
gentleman received from you, and had shown to many 
of the members of our Assembly, and that it was 
like to prejudice rather than promote the service. I 
mention this in confidence, as the purport of the 
letter may have been misrepresented, and I have it 
not directly from one who saw it, or heard it read. 
Between ourselves, I fear that worthy man is no 
zealous friend of the alliance. I may be mistaken, 
but it is my present opinion. 
</p><p>
An account, transmitted to the Admiralty Board 
by General Torman, makes the British, on the New 
York station, nine line-of-battle ships, two or three 
fifties, and seventeen frigates, and other armed vessels. 
Should this intelligence be true, the French fleet, as 
we have been told, though we have not yet the particulars of their strength, will be unequal to the 
undertaking. My letters from Virginia speak of our 
people as being roused. A bill had passed the Delegates, by a majority of three only, adopting the 
scheme of finance recommended by Congress. Thirteea of the Senate only were present ; the opmion 
of ten of these publicly known, five for, and five 
against the bill. It was conjectured the others were 
in favor of the measure. Every fifteenth militia-man 
is to be drafted to fill up the deficiency of our line. 
This bill was also before the Senate. I hope you find 
the recruits coming in fast. The news of the arrival 
of the fleet will accelerate them. With great respect, 
I am, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate, humble servant,

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your letter to Colonel Harrison turns out as I expected before I received your full information. If the 
whole had been read and attended to, it was impossible to put any other construction on your manner 
of treating the subject than to convince your correspondent of the absolute necessity of great exertions this campaign, while we had a promising prospect before us, lest, by remissness and delay, we 
should find our ally, as well as ourselves, embarrassed with greater difficulties than at present ; and 
I very sincerely wish, should this summer pass away 
without some signal advantage gained on our part, 
we may not find your conjectures verified in the 
event. 
</p><p>
I have my hopes we shall yet be able to do somefhing important upon the arrival of the French reenforcement, as I presume their fleet will then command the water, without which, I confess, I have no 
sanguine expectations. With the command of the 
water, the enterprise may be successful. Mr. Bingham has received a letter from Martinique, informing 
him the combined fleets fell to leeward on the 5th of 
July, supposed for Jamaica ; thirty-three or thirty-six 
ships of the line, and tAvelve thousand troops. They 
expected a reenforcement of a few thousand troops 
more. If this account be true, it is probable Jamaica 
will fall, and that we may have them along our 
coast. 
</p><p>
You are desired, by some late resolutions, to turn 
your thoughts towards the recovery of South Carolina and Georgia, as soon as the operations of the 
campaign in this quarter have been executed. Gates's 
and De Kalb's letters represent the distresses of the 
Southern department in a very gloomy light, as to 
provisions and equipments. The Virginia recruits, 
when raised, are ordered to join that army. If this 
interfere with your plans, you should let us know it, 
as they will not be ready to march until the beginning of next month. The law passed by the Legislature will probably bring into the field about three 
thousand. A Colonel or Major Pinckney, of South Carolina, writes Colonel Motte, a Delegate of that State, 
that the enemy are not more than twenty-five hundred strong at their posts in the country, exclusive of horse, of which they have a large corps, and 
about eight hundred or one thousand men in <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>. Of our twenty-five hundred mihtia, not above 
fifteen hundred had reached Hillsborough, in North 
Carolina. But Mr. Jameson, of the Virginia Privy 
Council, writes us that many of the deserters had 
been taken up and sent forward to Hillsborough, 
had about twelve hundred militia under him. 
Baylor's and Bland's dragoons nearly equipped, so 
that if they can get provisions sufficient and forage, 
which, by this time, it is probable they are furnished with, they will be in condition to face the enemy, 
and I hope drive them into the town. 
</p><p>
We have been greatly perplexed the last week 
with <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>'s refusal to act in the office of 
Quartermaster-General, unless the new system was 
totally repealed, and he was allowed to conduct it, 
under your direction, in such manner as he thought 
most conducive to the public service. Besides, Congress were to request Pettit and Cox to resume their 
offices.'-' If <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> thought the new system 
wanted amendment, and had pointed out the defect, 
Congress would have considered the matter, and, I 
doubt not, would have made the necessarv alteration. 
But the manner of these demands, made in such 
peremptory terms, at the moment of action, when the 
campaign was opened, the enemy in the field, and 
our ally waiting for cooperation, has lessened <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> not only in the opinion of Congress, but 
I think, of the public ; and I question whether it will 
terminate with the acceptance of his refusal only. 
</p><p>
On Saturday <a href='/results.php?tla=tip' rel='colleague'>Colonel Pickering</a> was appointed to 
the office of Quartermaster-General, with the rank 
of Colonel, and the pay and rations of a BrigadierGeneral, and to hold his place at the Board of War 
without pay or right to act, while in the office of 
Quartermaster-General. This gentleman's integrity, 
ability, and attention to business will, I hope, not 
only prevent the evils to be apprehended from a 
change in so important a department at this time, 
but will, I hope, be able to reform some of the 
abuses crept into that business, and lessen the amazing expenditures of the department. He must, if he accepts, have a disagreeable office in the present state 
of our finance ; but we must support him all we can. 
The promotion I lately mentioned has not taken 
place, though if we take up the business I suppose 
it will be done ; as M. is the oldest Colonel, and 
Gates is the only Major-General belonging to Virginia, and the State has a right to two. But I see no 
occasion of stirring in it at present, as, if taken up, 
it must be on the general principle of promotion, 
and then not only Virginia, but Maryland, and other 
States, will expect to partake of the same privilege 
of bringing forward their officers, when, I believe, 
there are few States whose lines are so full as to 
justify the promotions. I am, &c.,

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received jour favor of The loth ultimo, 
upon the subject of a report respecting a certain 
gentleman, and thank you for the freedom and candid manner of your communications. The resentment, 
discovered against the gentleman alluded to, began 
to subside before your letter came to hand ; and 
though for some time it was occasionally mentioned 
in conversation, it has lately died away, and will, I 
expect, not be revived. The report of the Committee 
not only accepted his resignation, but went further; 
and, I believe, had it been then determined, the gentleman would have been informed his services in the 
line of the army would have been dispensed with, 
that he might have leisure to attend to the settlement of his accounts. Had this step been taken, it 
is probable a resignation would have ensued, and 
perhaps a public discussion in the papers, which 
would have produced no good; and, upon the whole, 
I am well pleased the matter was carried no further than it has been. 
</p><p>
But, unacquainted as I am with antecedent circumstances, and judging from what was before me, my 
opinion was, the gentleman was justly reprehensible 
for the manner of his conduct as a servant of the 
public employed in an important office, or as a citizen embarked in the common cause of America. The 
amazing sums of money gone into that department, 
under his superintendence, about eighty millions, and, 
it is said, about thirty millions unpaid, the whole of 
which is unaccounted for, has excited uneasiness not 
only in This body, but the people at large, who call out for a settlement of the public accounts ; and although repeated endeavours have been used to bring 
the officers in this great department of the army to 
account, none have been rendered, nor any likelihood 
of bringing them to a settlement. The embezzlement 
and waste of public property, in these departments, 
have greatly contributed to enhance our debt and 
depreciate the currency; and these abuses demand 
inquiry and punishment. But I see no fair prospect 
of obtaining satisfaction for past transgressions, and 
shall be happy to find we shall be able to avoid the 
like practices in future. A reform, or an attempt to 
reform, seemed absolutely necessary for the satisfaction of the public ; and, although the new system was 
pronounced a physical impossibility in execution, others, who have served long in the army, and were of 
the Committee that made the alterations, entertained 
a contrary opinion; and they affirm the gentleman 
now in office, if he can be supported with money, 
can fully carry the new system into execution. 
</p><p>
In short, I have seen some, and been told of so 
many abuses in the Quarter-master's, Commissary's, 
and Medical departments, in the course of the last 
two years, that I candidly confess I feel a degree 
of resentment against the conduct of many in those 
departments, bordering on prejudice so nearly, that I 
have resolved to condemn no person, even in opinion, 
without sure proof of delinquency, lest I should injure the character of some honest man in the general censure, which, unhappily, is but too prevalent. 
</p><p>
What I feared for some time is at length but too 
evident, that our designs against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> must 
wait for more favorable circumstances to attempt 
carrying them into execution. Perhaps something 
may, in the course of the winter, be done at the 
south, should we be in a situation to recover our 
losses there, and be in time provided with a well appointed regular army, and magazine of provisions 
laid up. It is to be hoped we shall, in the spring, 
before the enemy can be reenforced and obtain supplies, be in condition to act offensively against New 
York. Your letters of the 20th of last month, and 
of the 27th, to the States, are before a Committee, 
and will, in a day or two, be reported upon, as to 
flour and meat. The great objects of drawing forth, 
in time, a competent regular army, and laying up 
magazines, will soon come in, and I hope soon go 
through Congress, that the several States may proceed to make the necessary provisions. I shall leave 
this place on Thursday for Virginia, and mean to attend our next session of Assembly, in hopes of promoting a cession, on the part of the State, of their 
claim to the lands north-west of the Ohio, to the 
United States, which will be recommended to all the 
States having unappropriated western territory, for 
the purpose of completing the Confederation. I shall 
be glad to hear from you while there, upon any matters that may occur and you shall think proper to 
communicate.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The Medical department was under the consideration of a Committee before I left Congress, and Yill, 
it is probable, undergo a change that may curtail the 
number of the present appointments. Should this be 
The case, and the new arrangement take place before 
I return (which at present is my intention to do 
before Christmas), I shall recommend to the support 
of The Virginia Delegates the gentlemen you have 
been pleased to mention, whose long services and well known characters entitle them to be among the first 
officers in the establishment. 
</p><p>
If I am not mistaken, the spirit of party is much 
abated in Congress. Some instances of the old prejudices and partialities that disgraced and must ever 
disgrace their counsels, I think I have discovered; 
but they are few, and I entertained hopes that the 
flame was nearly extinguished. And, although some 
restless tempers, as some there are and ever will be 
in public assemblies of men, may attempt to revive 
those disputes which were carried to such height between the contending factions, as to neglect the more 
important concerns of the public, there are, I trust, 
a sufficient number of mild spirits who will oppose 
and repress such dishonorable attempts, and confine 
themselves to the discussion alone of such matters as 
justice and the general welfare require. I am certain the important objects now before Congress are 
sufficient to engage their attention and employ their 
time, without perplexing themselves by a revival of 
old and expiring controversies. 
</p><p>
It was with reluctance I left <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> before 
the report upon your letter respecting the army and 
magazines was complete, and the arrangements of the 
civil offices of Congress were digested; but an apprehension that the Assembly was to meet the first 
Monday in October, as usual, and a desire of spending a short time with my family before I went to 
<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, determined me to set out so as to reach 
home about the middle of September. I now find I 
might have staid a fortnight longer, as the session 
does not commence until the third Monday in this 
month. 
</p><p>
Congress having taken some steps towards completing the Federal Union, which I anxiously wish to 
accomplish, induced me to be here early in the session, that the sense of this State upon that interesting question might be taken; that, if the proposition 
was approved, it might be divulged to other States 
without delay ; and Virginia, being more interesting. 
than any other in a cession of unappropriated territory, the example would not fail to have weight, and 
be followed by others. We are already too large for 
the energy of republican government ; and, I fear, 
shall still be so, if the Assembly shall relinquish their 
claim to the north-west of the Ohio to the Continent. 
I wished, too, to be able to be present the beginning 
of the session, to urge the filling up our battalions 
immediately, and providing magazines in time, as the 
ensuing winter to the south and the approaching 
spring to the north, if our ally shall command the 
water, might afford us favorable opportunities of acting to advantage. But, alas ! instead of the French 
commanding the water, we have the mortification to 
hear Rodney, with twelve ships of the line and four 
frigates, has arrived at the Hook. Where, for God's 
sake, is Count de Guichen, with his great and formidable fleet ? Surely, not inactive. 
</p><p>
Adieu. Yours, &c.,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I beg leave to mention to you a young gentleman, captured by the enemy when the Buckskin 
fell into their hands in the Chesapeake Bay, and 
who was put on shore under parole, and wishes to 
be discharged from the obligation as soon as possible, 
as he conceives it restrains him not only from acting 
in the field, should the situation of his country require his services, but even from attending the hospitals for his instruction, which he is very desirous 
of doing. The person I speak of is Dr. John Lewis, 
a son of the late Mr. Charles Lewis, whose name I 
mentioned to you some years ago, while he was in 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and, being refused the liberty of coming 
out, was at length obliged to return to Great Britain. 
His parole is, I think, singular, as it extends only to 
his not doing or speaking any thing to the prejudice 
of the enemy, without the clause of rendering himself when called for. 
</p><p>
You will receive from the President a copy of a 
Report which has passed in Congress, in consequence 
of Colonel Harrison's communications. You will also 
be informed of the arrival of Provost, with a reenforcement to the enemy in the south, and of his progress since his arrival. Arnold's position at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, Provost in North Carolina, and Cornwallis in 
South Carolina, will, I fear, effectually obstruct the 
supplies from our State, or so delay them as to render Greene's situation critical. If the French ships 
from Rhode Island shall succeed in their enterprise 
in the Chesapeake, the event will be propitious, and 
produce the happiest effects. Our State will be 
thereby further aided by a supply of one thousand 
stand of arms, and some stores retaken and sent forward in one of the French frigates. The arrival of 
Provost, and the great want of arms in the Southern 
States, it must be confessed, presents a rather gloomy 
prospect ; and, under this temper of mind, you will 
receive a letter reiterating what has, I think, been 
several times intimated, a desire that you will pay 
particular attention to the Southern department. I 
wish we could but content ourselves with a communication of ficts, and any reflections upon them for 
illustration, leaving the combination and execution of 
the various operations of a campaign to those whose 
business it is to project and execute them. 
</p><p>
Paul Jones's arrival gives us no relief in clothing 
or arms, a disappointment the more to be regretted 
as our wants increase. Yet we know not whom to 
blame. Jones will, I expect, unfold this dark, and, 
as yet, mysterious business. I presume you must 
have been informed that Virginia has receded from her former instructions to her Delegates in Congress, 
restricting the claim, on her part, to the free navigation of the Mississippi, which, if approved by Congress, 
will probably bring about an alliance with Spain, and 
an acknowledgment of our independence. No doubt 
this event, if it takes place, will give us more credit 
in Europe ; but we pay dear for it. 
</p><p>
We are about appointing the officers who are to 
be at the head of our great departments. Yesterday 
<a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague'>Mr. Morris</a>, without a vote against him (though 
S. A., and his colleague. General W., declined to ballot), was chosen Financier. I cannot say he will 
accept, but have some hopes he wilL Our finances 
want a Necker to arrange and reform them. Morris 
is, I believe, the best qualified of any our country 
affords for the arduous undertaking. We shall, in a 
day or two, appoint the officers for the Foreign Affairs and the Marine. I wish we had men in these 
offices as well qualified to execute them, as Morris in 
the Treasury. Some, however, that are nominated, if 
they can be chosen, will do very well. We are under difficulties about the War Office, lest any person 
we could now put into it may not answer so well as 
the present Commissary. This may, and I expect 
will, postpone that appointment.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Having returned to Congress a few days only, and 
private matters requiring my attention for great part 
of the time, I have not been able regularly to attend to business, or to acknowledge the receipt of your 
favor transmitted to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, after my leaving it, 
and sent after me to Virginia by <a href='/results.php?tla=mad' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=mad' rel='colleague'>Mr. Madison</a></a>. The 
moment for successful operations against our enemies 
was certainly immediately after the disaster in Gardiner's Ba}, when, had it been embraced, the port at 
<a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, and the troops under Arnold, as well as 
the British ships then in Virginia, must have fallen 
an easy conquest to our united efforts ; for which 
purpose the State was, I believe, in readiness. 
</p><p>
Abortive as the project has proven, we yet hope 
for the best, and that still it may be in the powder 
of our ally to give us effectual aid in the Chesapeake I and, believe me, at no time was it more necessary than at present, when all the lower country 
of our State, from its great navigable waters, is exposed to the ravage and rapine, not only of British ships of war, but of the vessels employed by 
the Board of Refugee Commissioners in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
To you it is unnecessary to describe the distress of 
the inhabitants upon the navigable waters of Virginia. 
Your knowledge of the country enables you sufficiently to judge of it, exclusive of such information 
as, I doubt not, you receive from that quarter. Had 
we a sufficient stock of arms, distressing as it is to 
our militia to be so generally out on duty, as it must 
be to them at this season of the year, I think they 
would do much in opposition to the enemy, supported even by no considerable body of regulars. But, 
wanting arms, their negroes flying from them, and 
their prospects of making little or nothing from their 
estates to support their families and bear the burdens of the war, may shake their fidelity and attachment to the cause so far as to slacken their exertions, if some succour is not afforded them by water, to restrain the ravage of these plunderers. I mention 
these things as facts falling under my own observation before I left the State, that, if they have not 
been more particularly communicated by others, you 
might hear some intimation of them. 
</p><p>
The late movements of Cornwallis and Phillips indicate a junction of their armies on the Roanoke, 
from whence they may direct their operations north 
or south, as they shall see best, without the fear of 
successful opposition ; or may, it would seem, cut off 
all communication between Virginia and the other 
Southern States, and reduce <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> to the 
greatest extremity. From these dangers, that at present threaten us, a naval force sent to the Chesapeake would at once relieve us, and admit Virginia 
to afford that succour to the other Southern States 
they so much need. The great object of the enemy 
is undoubtedly the Southern States ; and it is submitted to your reflection, how far you can support them 
by your influence, in the destination of such aids as 
may arrive from Europe, or the operation of that 
force now here. We are told all the ships of war 
have left <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, with about two thousand troops, 
after having once put back. Adieu ! Pardon the 
haste of this letter, which is written in Congress, in 
consequence of the President's information that an 
express was coming off for head-quarters.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your favors of the 14th of December last and the 
11th instant, have been duly received. A series of 
ill health through the fall and the greatest part of 
the winter, which, until very lately, rendered my attendance in Congress seldom, and very irregular, 
must be my apology for suffering the first to remain 
so long unanswered. 
</p><p>
Congress have been, for some time past, almost 
wholly employed in devising some general and adequate funds for paying the interest, and in time sinking the principal, of the public debt, as well as to 
provide for future loans, should the continuance of the 
war render borrowing necessary. Difficulties, apparently insurmountable, presented themselves in almost 
every stage of the business, owing to the different 
circumstances of the several States, and the necessity 
that the subjects, selected for taxation to form the 
funds, should operate throughout them all, generally 
and equally, or nearly so, to make them acceptable. 
</p><p>
After opening and discussing a variety of questions, 
no object has been yet discovered to which so few 
objections lie, as the impost duty formerly recommended to the States, and which, with some alterations from the former plan, to obviate the objections that have been raised, has been agreed to in a Committee of the Whole, and will, I think, be finally 
adopted. what this duty, when granted by the 
States, will amount to annually, is very uncertain. 
In time of peace, there can be no doubt but it will 
be considerable, and for years prove an increasing fund ', but it is thought by no means adequate to the 
payment of the interest, and sinking the principal, 
of the national debt. Other means have, therefore, 
been considered in aid of the impost duty, land, polls, 
salt, wine, spirits, tea, &c. ; these last, being what are 
called luxuries, it is thought may bear a small tax in 
addition to the impost duty I fear, at present, few 
of them will go down; and that we shall be obliged, 
at last, to rest the payment of the public debt upon 
the mode prescribed by the Confederation (requisitions 
proportioned on the States according to the value of 
land, buildings, &c., a plan for obtaining which scale 
of proportion has been digested, and agreed upon in 
Congress, and will immediately go on to the States), 
and the produce of the five per cent, duty, if granted. A small poll-tax, did not the constitution of 
Maryland stand in the way, might probably succeed, 
as it would operate more equally, perhaps, than any 
other, and may be adopted, allowing Maryland to substitute some other adequate and productive fund in 
its room. 
</p><p>
A short time will bring to a conclusion our efforts 
on this business, which I am in hopes will terminate 
in the adoption of such measures as may be acceptable to the States, and produce the granting such 
funds as will restore public credit, give value to the 
great mass of depreciated certificates, and enable Congress to render to every class of the public creditors 
ample justice. Congress have the purest intentions 
towards the public creditors, and will use their best 
exertions in obtaining from the States the means to 
do them speedy and complete justice. 
</p><p>
Such is their opinion of the merit and services of 
the army, that, did it not wound the sense of justice, 
they want not the inclination to give them the preference to any other class of creditors ; but equity 
and sound policy forbid discrimination and partial 
distinctions. One ground of discontent in the army, 
and on which they found the opinion that justice is 
not intended to be done to them, is the delay in 
complying with their requests ; but, with those acquainted with the deliberations of public bodies, and 
especially with so mixed a body as that of Congress, 
allowances will be made for slow determination. Every 
class of public creditors must know the inability of 
Congress to pay their demands, unless furnished with 
the means by the several States; and the exertions 
of that body have not been wanting, heretofore, to 
obtain the means, though they have not produced the 
desired effect. The measures now digesting will, there 
is good reason to expect, prove more efficacious for 
obvious reasons. 
</p><p>
Reports are freely circulated here, that there are 
dangerous combinations in the army ; and, within a 
few days past, it has been said, they are about to 
declare they will not disband until their demands are 
complied with. I trust these reports are not well 
founded, and that the army will exercise, awhile 
longer at least, that patient forbearance, which hath 
hitherto so honorably distinguished them. To you it 
must be unnecessary to observe, that when once all 
confidence between the civil and military authority 
is lost, by intemperate conduct, or an assumption of 
improper power, especially by the military body, the Rubicon is passed, and to retreat will be very difficult, from the fears and jealousies that will unavoidably subsist between the two bodies. To avoid, therefore, the adoption by the army of any hasty and 
rash measure, should employ the attention, and draw 
forth the exertions of every worthy officer in it ; for 
from these alone can opposition be expected. 
</p><p>
The ambition of some, and the pressure of distress 
in others, may produce dangerous combinations, founded on the pretence that justice is delayed and will 
be refused to them. The pretext is plausible and ensnaring, and may draw into engagements the unsuspecting, honest soldier, from which it will be difficult 
to extricate himself, even when he sees the dangers 
they lead to. If there are men in the army who 
harbour wicked designs, and are determined to blow 
the coals of discord, they will gradually endeavour to 
hurt the reputation of those averse to their projects, 
and by sinister practices lessen their weight and influence among the soldiery. I have lately heard 
there are those who are abandoned enough to use 
their arts to lessen your popularity in the army ; in 
hopes, ultimately, the weight of your opposition will 
prove no obstacle to their ambitious designs. If this 
be true, and they are likely to succeed, I own it 
will prove a bad prognostic of the future. I shall 
be among the number of those who entertain fears 
of the army, and doubt that peace will not be followed by its usual blessings to America. Whether to 
temporize, or oppose with steady, unremitting firmness, what is supposed to be in agitation of dangerous tendency, or that may be agitated, must be left 
to your own sense of propriety, and better judgment.

With respect to the business of Vermont, I think 
you need not be uneasy from apprehensions that the army, or any part of them, Y/ill be employed to enforce a compliance with the act of the 5th of December last, should the people of Vermont refuse a 
compliance with that demand ; at least for some time 
to come, if ever. To go into detail upon this matter would be prolix, and rather improper for the 
scope of a letter. It cannot be denied, that the act 
of Congress of the 20th of August [<a href='/results.php?year=1781'>1781</a>], opened the 
prospect to Vermont of an acknowledgment of their 
independence, and admission into the Union. Although it gave ground of hope, it was not conclusive ; and the Legislature of Vermont, absolutely rejecting the offer, and recommending to the people an 
inviolable adherence to their union and encroachments 
on the adjoining States, as well as other unwarrantable acts they have unjustly concealed from the public in their remonstrance, released Congress from their 
offer, and left them at liberty afterwards to accept or 
refuse, as they saw fit, when Vermont, repenting of 
her conduct at a future period, complied. 
</p><p>
A particular state of things produced the act of 
Congress ; a change of circumstances afterwards dictated the delay in determining on their proposition, 
and the report of a Committee, to whom it was referred. This report authorizes observations I decline 
to make. This proceeding in Congress they style 
a violation of the compact entered into with them. 
There always has been a strong opposition to the 
claims of Vermont, and their admission into the 
Union. Virginia has generally been among the number of her opponents, not so much, perhaps, upon 
the question of independence, as the impolicy of her 
admission into the Union while several very important questions of local concern remained undetermined; 
and, until these great points are settled, the consent of Virginia, I expect, will be withheld, and, if before 
obtained, it will be a sacrifice of her opinion to the 
peace and common weal of the United States. 
</p><p>
If Vermont confines herself to the limits assigned 
to her, and ceases to encroach upon and disturb the 
quiet of the adjoining States, at the same time avoiding combinations, or arts, hostile to the United States, 
she may be at rest within her limits, and, by patient 
waiting the convenient time, may ere long be admitted to the privileges of Union. The influence Vermont has gained in 'the army, and in some of the 
States that espouse her cause, do little credit to the 
parties concerned; and to this influence is in a great 
measure to be ascribed the variable, indecisive conduct of Congress respecting the claims of that people. 
The remonstrance states the receipt of official letters 
recommending a compliance with the act of Congress, 
and intimates yours to be of the number; and that 
these communications influenced them to comply. 
The assertion is wrong as to yours, and may be 
equally false as to others, and is one proof, among 
a variety of others, of the disingenuity and want of 
candor in Vermont. It exhibits, also, very little respect to this body, when they ascribe their compliance to other motives than the recommendation of 
Congress. 
</p><p>
Seven States have voted five years' whole pay as 
the commutation for the half-pay to the officers; but 
the resolution has not passed the House, being postponed, for the present, from an opinion prevalent with 
many, that the consent of nine States is necessary 
to give it validity. Delaware and Georgia are absent; 
were they represented, probably the vote would be 
sufficient. 
</p><p>
That we shall have peace soon, is almost reduced 
to a certainty; but my fears are, it will not be 
attended with those blessings generally expected. 
There are so many great questions, very interesting 
to particular States, unsettled, which require speedy 
determination to preserve quiet, that it is difficult to 
avoid uneasy impressions for their consequences. The 
present conjuncture, perhaps, above all others America 
has experienced, calls for good dispositions in the 
States, and moderation and wisdom in their counsels. 
May the spirit of Union govern them, is the earnest 
wish of, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate, humble servant,
