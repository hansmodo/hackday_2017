Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
We have at length got through the plan of funds 
to be recommended to the States for their adoption. 
It has been the most difficult and perplexing discussion of any that have engaged the attention of this 
body for some time. The various objects to be combined, and the different interests to be reconciled, to 
make the system palatable to the States, was a work 
not easily or speedily to be effected ; and although it 
was the wish of many to settle the plan upon clear 
and unquestionable principles of finance, yet such 
were the prejudices of some States, and of some individuals, and such their jealousies, we were obliged to 
take a middle course with respect to its duration, and 
the appointment of collectors, or hazard ultimately 
the loss of the measure. As it stands, I believe it 
will answer the purposes intended, if the States will 
grant their concurrence. A copy will be transmitted 
to you for your and the army's information. 
</p><p>
As the state of our finances at present is such as to make it difficult for the officer now at the head of that department, much more so for any new hand 
who might succeed him, to form the necessary arrangements for obtaining money sufficient for disbanding the army, <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Morris</a> has agreed to act until that 
business is accomplished, and will, I hope, be able to effect it to the satisfaction of the army. But from appearances, the period of disbanding will be more 
distant than many at first apprehended, if that measure, as it seems to be proper it should, goes hand 
in hand with the evacuation of our country by the British forces. By this time you are better able to judge of the views and designs of Sir Guy Carleton, 
or of those who direct his movements, as I presume the intended interview took place, though, I confess, I thought there was indelicacy in the manner of that 
gentleman's mentioning his proposed attendants. In every thing else but that of evacuation (and they may be doing all they can in that, for any thing I 
know), they seem to act with fairness and liberality; and I should be sorry to find them in that, or any other instance, practising the old game of deception. 
We have reports that something of this sort appears in their conduct respecting the negroes in their possession, claimed by our citizens. These relations come 
from men of character, and, until the contrary is ascertained of what they assert, credit will be given to 
their reports. No proclamations can authorize a refusal of property to those who claim under the article 
of the treaty, and establish their right by satisfactory 
proof 
</p><p>
Colonel F. Thornton, about two years ago, lost 
many of his negroes, who went on board some of the 
British ships of war, up the Potomac. He wrote to 
me, the other day, about them. These, I believe, are 
not sanctioned by proclamation, and yet, I suspect, if 
the old gentleman was to send a person to claim 
them, his labor would be lost. If what we are told 
respecting the conduct of those in power in New 
York, concerning the claimed property of the American citizens, be true, it will prove an effectual bar to 
the restoration of confiscated estates, had there been 
a disposition in the States before to render this. I 
wished to have seen the treaty faithfully executed on 
both sides ; but when arts and prevarication take 
place on one side, they are apt to prevail on the 
other. 
</p><p>
I proceed immediately to Virginia, in order to attend the Assembly now convening, and shall thank 
you for any information respecting these matters you 
can properly communicate, that the truth may be 
known, and misrepresentations, if any prevail, removed. If any thing occurs to you, which you do not 
choose to communicate directly to the Executive, with 
respect to the arrangements necessary to be made on 
a peace, and shall confide them to me, proper attention shall be paid to your observations. With perfect 
esteem and respect, I am, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate, humble servant, 
</p><p>
