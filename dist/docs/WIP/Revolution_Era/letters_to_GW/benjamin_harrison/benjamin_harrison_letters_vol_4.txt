My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
It gives me great pleasure to inform that the Assembly yesterday, without a dissenting voice, complimented you with fifty shares in the Potomac Company, and one hundred in the James River Company, 
of which I give you early notice to stop your subscribing on your own account. As this compliment 
is intended by your country in commemoration of 
your assiduous cares to promote her interest, I hope 
you will have no scruples in accepting the present, 
and thereby gratifying them in their most earnest 
wishes. I most sincerely tender you and your good 
lady the compliments of the season, and many happy 
renewals of it ; and am, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your esteemed favor of the 22d of last month 
reached me but a few days ago. Letters, by post, 
are some time getting to me, owing to the distance I 
am from the post road. 
</p><p>
I was fully aware of the difficulties the compliment 
made you by the Assembly would lay you under, 
and assure you that the love and friendship I entertain for you, my earnest wishes that you might still 
support that noble disinterestedness of character that 
has hitherto marked all your steps and actions, and 
a perfect knowledge of the delicacy of your feelings, 
gave me a full share of perplexities on the occasion. If you were without enemies, or the eye of 
malevolence was not intently fixed on all your actions, I should not see the least impropriety in your 
accepting a present from your grateful country, particularly as every care has been taken, in the preamble to the grant, to guard against the most distant 
appearance of its being a gratuity for the important services you have rendered America, and to fix it to 
the true objects of the acts, the great and real advantages that will derive to the country from the 
extension of its navigation, the parent of which you 
have been, and to whom, alone, they owe their existence, or will probably owe their completion. But, on 
the other hand, when I view mankind, their proneness to put the worst construction on every action 
of those of exalted character, and the triumph it will 
give your enemies to have an apparent, though false, 
opportunity to attempt the lessening your reputation, 
I am at a loss what advice to give, and shall, therefore, leave the determination to your own far better judgment. 
</p><p>
As to your fears of appearing ostentatious, by a 
refusal, I think they are altogether groundless. Your 
countrymen have too high an opinion of your discernment not to acquiesce in your determination; but 
more especially in points where reputation is the 
stake. Their motives for what they have done were 
of the purest kind. They saw, with concern, the sacrifices you had made for their benefit, by a total neglect of your domestic affairs ; and they have been 
earnestly seeking an opportunity to show their gratitude and love for you. They thought one presented 
itself that was out of the reach of detraction, and, 
therefore, embraced it with one voice, and, as far as 
I could see, with one mind, and, I am certain, would 
sensibly feel any slur cast on your reputation. With 
these sentiments, though they will feel unhappy that 
they cannot be gratified in their wishes, yet they 
will not take amiss a refusal dictated by motives 
that have hitherto done you so much honor. I am 
happy to find that, though you have not taken your 
final resolution with respect to the compliment, you will still forward the schemes ; as the works, under 
your patronage and protection, will advance more 
rapidly than they would otherwise do, and the subscription probably be filled, as I fear would not be 
the case if advantage is not taken of the ardor of the present Government. 
</p><p>
I am extremely obliged to my good friends at 
<a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a> for their kind inquiry as to the health 
of Mrs. Harrison, who is getting better, though slowly. 
I have hopes, and indeed expect, she will mend faster 
when the weather will permit her to use exercise, 
which seems to be her only remedy. She and the 
girls join me in the most friendly and affectionate 
compliments to you and the ladies. I am, my dear 
Sir, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and 
regard. 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
