My dear General, 
</p><p>
Had I not so perfect a confidence in your friendship, I should very much fear to tire you with my 
scribbling of this day ; but cannot leave my pen before I have again mentioned my tender, respectful 
affection to my dear General. I want to tell jou 
that Madame de Lafayette and my three children are 
well, and that all of us, in the family, heartily join 
to present their dutiful, affectionate compliments to 
Mrs. Washington and yourself. Tell her that I hope 
soon to thank her for a dish of tea at I<a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>. Yes, my dear General, before the month of 
June is over, you will see a vessel coming up the 
Potomac, and out of that vessel will your friend 
jump, with a panting heart, and all the feelings of 
perfect happiness. 
</p><p>
I intended to have gone sooner ; but a few commercial matters will keep me here; for, since nobody 
meddles with them, I have undertaken, in my private 
capacity, to do what is possible for one who has 
neither title nor instruction. It is at least a comfort 
that, in my private capacity, I cannot commit Congress ; and that I never speak but of what I know. 
Four ports having been declared free, I send <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague'>Mr. Morris</a> a letter respecting the duties to be paid there; 
and I hope Congress will also publish that all duties 
have been removed for the exportation of brandies. 
</p><p>
Most of the Americans here are virulent against our 
Association Wadsworth must be excepted, and Dr. 
Franklin said little; but Jay, Adams, and all the others, 
warmly blame the army. You easily guess I am not 
remiss in opposing them. However, if it is found 
that the heredity endangers the true principles of democracy, I am as ready as any man to renounce it. 
You will be my compass, my dear General; because, 
at this distance, I cannot judge. In case, after better 
consideration, you find that heredity will injure our 
democratic constitutions, I join with you, by proxy, 
in voting against it. But I do so much rely on your 
judgment that, if you think heredity is a proper 
scheme, I shall be convinced that your patriotism has 
considered the matter in the best point of view. To 
you alone I would say so much ; and I abide by 
your opinion in the matter. Let the foregoing be 
confidential ; but, I am sure, your disinterested virtue 
will weigh all possible future consequences of hereditary distinctions. 
</p><p>
There are no news at this moment that are worth relating. What respects balloons, M. L'Enfant will tell. The present English disputes are somewhat 
ridiculous ; they must end in a dissolution of Parliament, or a union between Pitt and Fox. Adieu, my dear General. Accept, with your usual goodness, the 
affectionate tribute of a heart so entirely devoted to you, that no words can ever express the respect, the love, and all the sentiments, with which you know it 
</p><p>
Alluding to the recent experiments of Montgolfier in the construction of balloons. is glowing for you, and that make me, until my last breath,

My dear General,
</p><p>
I have already had the pleasure to acquaint you with my arrival in America, and am endeavouring to 
reach <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a> as soon as possible. My first 
plan was only to stay here two days; but the affectionate reception I have met with in this city, and 
the returning some compliments to the Assembly, render it necessary to stay one day longer. On Friday, I will be at the Head of Elk ; the next day, at 
<a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a> ; and by Sunday, or Monday, I hope at last to be blessed with a sight of my dear General. 
There is no rest for me until I go to <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>. I long for the pleasure to embrace you, my dear General; and the happiness of being once more with 
you will be so great, that no words can ever express it. Adieu, my dear General ; in a few days I shall 
be at <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>, and I do already feel delighted 
with so charming a prospect. My best respects wait upon Mrs. Washington; and, not long after you receive this, I will tell you myself how respectfully and 
affectionately I have the honor to be, my dear General, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=laf" rel="me">Lafayette</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. In case your affairs call you to the Springs, I beg leave to go there after you, or to accompany you in your journey.

My dear General, 
</p><p>
Everywhere I have met with delays; but so agreeable were they in their nature, that I cannot complain of them. It is not quite the same with the 
Indian treaty, although the hope to he useful has 
kept me there longer than I had expected. My presence at the openmg of it had been desired. Many 
circumstances kept it off. At last it began, and my 
influence with the Indians was found greater than I 
myself could expect. I was, therefore, desired to 
speak, to hearken, to answer. I took the liberty to 
caution the Commissioners upon such points as you 
had mentioned to me, and did not leave the ground 
until they thought they had no farther occasion for 
me. But, as the business is just beginning, I cannot 
give you any further intelligence, but that a great 
deal of intrigue is carried on by some Tory Indians 
of Brant's party, and that the Whig and Tory distinctions are kept up among those tribes to an 
amazing degree of private animosities. 
</p><p>
This day, my dear General, I am going towards 
<a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>, <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and Newport, where the French 
ships now are; and as, if I went by land, I should 
be so much kept off by my friends as to be very 
late at our appointed meeting, I intend submitting to 
the little inconvenience of going by water from Rhode 
Island to <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>, where I hope to be about 
the 26th, and where I shall be happy to receive the 
orders of my dear General. 
</p><p>
Waiting upon the Assembly at <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, and 
visiting <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a> in my way to <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>, 
would be my plan; but I expect your orders, to know 
where I am to meet you. It is possible you had 
rather not go to <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>. In a word, my dear 
General, as your paternal goodness to me cannot 
stand upon any kind of ceremony, give me your orders; tell me what I had best to do, and I shall be, 
as you well know, happy to obey them. 
</p><p>
One thing, my dear General, I very much wish you might grant me. As the time of my stay in 
Virginia will depend upon your advice respecting 
French letters which I am to receive there, as it will 
be there a last visit for this American trip of mine, 
I shall be happy if, without inconvenience to yourself, you may come with me so far at least as <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, where your friends depend upon me to have 
an opportunity to see you. 
</p><p>
Could you pay the Virginia visits with me, could 
I meet you somewhere, at <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a> I suppose 
(where in that case I would go before I visit <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>), it would be to me a most heartfelt happiness. 
I beg your pardon, my beloved General, but I want 
to see you, and no heart can better feel the pleasure 
to be with you, than the filial heart of 
Your respectful and affectionate friend,

My dear General, 
</p><p>
On my arrival at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, I have been so friendly 
received, that no words can express my truly affectionate gratitude. To these enjoyments I have added 
the heartfelt pleasure to contemplate the effect a sudden appearance of your picture had upon a people, 
whose love to you is as great at least as in any 
part of the world. Circumstanced as I am, I could 
not, with any propriety, set out so soon as I expected. I am sorry our meeting again is deferred ; but, 
when you are absent, I endeavour to guess what you 
would haA^e advised me to do, and then do it. I am 
sure you would advise my staying here some time 
longer. I therefore will not go until the 1st or 2d 
of next month, and then I embark from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> in 
the Nymph frigate to go to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. M, de 
Grandchain, who commands her, begs to be respectfully remembered to you ; and as he expects reaching 
York about the 8th or 10th, he will, in company with 
me, wait upon you wherever you ma}'' be found.

The bearer I send to <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>, in order 1

So late in the season, I think you will advise my 
going immediately to <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>. I • hope you will 
let me know where we are to meet ; and I also hope, 
my dear General, you will not deny my affectionate, 
pressing request, to induce your visiting with me our 
friends in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>.

The Chevalier's respects and mine wait upon Mrs.

My dear General, 
</p><p>
I have received your affectionate letter of the 8th j 
and from the known sentiments of my heart to you, 
you will easily guess what my feelings have been in 
perusing the tender expressions of your friendship. 
</p><p>
No, my beloved General, our late parting was not by 
any means a last interviev/. My wliole soul revolts 
at the idea ; and could I harbour it an instant, indeed, 
my dear General, it would make me miserable. I well 
see you never will go to France. The inexpressible 
pleasure of embracing you in my own house, of welcoming you in a family where your name is adored, 
I do not much expect to experience; but to you I 
shall return, and, within the walls of <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>, 
we shall yet often speak of old times. My firm plan 
is to visit now and then my friend on this side of 
the Atlantic ; and the most beloved of all friends I 
ever had, or ever shall have anywhere, is too strong 
an inducement for me to return to him, not to think 
that whenever it is possible I shall renew my so 
pleasing visits to Mount Yernon. 
</p><p>
Since I have left you, my dear General, we have 
passed through <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> to <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, where I was 
happy to find a numerous and well-chosen Congress. 
Their testimonies of kindness to me, and my answer 
to them, you will see in the newspapers. As to my 
services abroad, it has been (on motion respecting 
what I told you) universally decided that public confidence in me was a matter of course, a doubt of 
which ought not to be expressed. But, as I know 
the sense of the Congress, and as <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague'>Mr. Jay</a> has accepted, and Mr. Jeflerson will be Minister in France, 
my situation in that respect will be very agreeable. 
</p><p>
Orders have been sent to Canada to reenforce the 
Lake posts, put the vessels in commission, and repel 
force by force. But I. think that if once Congress 
have the trade to regulate, mercantile interdictions <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> will set these people to rights. Although party spirit 
had a little subsided in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, yet that city is 
not by any means settled. How far from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> ! 
</p><p>
Although your nephew is not arrived, I will hope 
for the pleasure to see him in Paris. <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met friend'>General Greene</a> 
was in <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a> when the letter reached him, from 
where he came to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and I had the pleasure 
to spend some days with him. Inclosed I send you 
a small cipher. Should any public political business 
require a fuller one, I will write to you a complete 
cipher I have had long ago with <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague'>Mr. Jay</a>'s present 
department. 
</p><p>
Mr. Carey, printer of the Volunteer journal, has been 
obliged to fly for his life, and now lives at Mr. Sutler's, hatter. Front street, in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, where he is 
going to set up a paper. A letter from you, becoming a subscriber, and telling him I have mentioned it 
to you, will the most oblige me, as I have promised 
him to recommend him to my friends. He is now 
an American; and we have nothing to do with his 
quarrel with the Duke of Rutland, which disputes, 
by the by, seem to subside, and vanish into nothing. 
The French packet is not yet arrived. 
</p><p>
The Chevalier de Caraman and Captain Grandchain 
beg leave to offer their respects to you, Mrs. Washington, and all the family. My most tender, affectionate respects wait upon Mrs. Washington and all 
the family. I beg she will give a kiss for me to 
the little girls, my friend ; and I beg Mrs. 
</p><p>
Stuart, the Doctor, Mr. Lund Washington, and all our 
friends, to receive my best compliments. I hope <a href='/results.php?tla=beh' rel=''>Mr. Harrison</a> will be soon appointed, and I wish his cousin may know it. 
</p><p>
Adieu, adieu, my dear General. It is with inexpressible pain that I feel I am going to be severed 
from you by the Atlantic. Every thing, that admiration, respect, gratitude, friendship, and filial love, can 
inspire, is combined in my affectionate heart to devote me most tenderly to you. In your friendship I 
find a delight which words cannot express. Adieu, 
my dear General. It is not without emotion that I 
write this word, although I know I shall soon visit 
you again. Be attentive to your health. Let me 
hear from you every month. Adieu, adieu.

My dear General,

Nothing but the love of glory and his respect for you could induce him to cross the seas, as his business 
here far exceeds his leisure; and his numerous and gratified friends make him very happy at home.

My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
Before I leave the borders of France, I wish once 
more to remind you of your absent friend, and to let 
you know that I am well, and just beginning my 
German march. I have been lately visiting some 
French towns, where I spoke a great deal about 
American trade, and fully answered the views I had 
the honor to communicate in a former letter. 
Now I am on my way to the Deux Fonts, where 
resides our friend, the future Elector of Bavaria ; to 
Cassel, where I shall see again the Hessian regiments ; to Berlin, where I am told Lord Cornwallis 
is also going. From there, I shall wait on the King of Prussia, on his grand manoeuvres in Silesia ; visit 
Saxony ; see the Austrian camp in Bohemia ; pay 
my respects to the Emperor at Vienna ; return to 
Berlin, where grand manoeuvres are to take place at 
the end of September ; and, after I have on my 
way examined all the fields of battle, I shall return 
through Holland, and be again in Paris by the 
middle of October. 
</p><p>
This letter, my dear General, goes with our old 
friend <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague friend met'>Dr. Franklin</a>, who, I hope, will be received 
with that respect he so much deserves. It will be 
forwarded by his grandson, a very deserving young 
man, who wishes being introduced by me to you ; 
and I beg leave to recommend him to your attentions. He has been much employed in public ; got 
nothing by it; and, as the Doctor loves him better 
than any thing in the world, I think he ought to 
have the satisfaction to see him noticed by Congress. 
You will oblige me to let them know that I spoke 
to you my mind about it. 
</p><p>
You remember an idea, which I imparted to you 
three years ago. I am going to try it in the French 
colony of Cayenne, but will write more fully on the 
subject in my other letters. Nothing new now in 
the political world. War is far at a distance. Adieu, 
my beloved General. My most affectionate respects 
wait on Mrs. Washington. Remember me to the 
young ones, to my Aid George, to Mr. Lund, all our 
friends, and particularly to Mrs. Stuart. You know 
my heart, my dear General, and I need not add the assurances of the filial love, respect, and gratitude, 
I have the honor to be with,

My dear General, 
</p><p>
This letter has been requested of me as an introduction for M. Andre Michaux, whom, for many reasons, I am happy to present. In the first place I 
know you will he glad to know a man whose genius has raised him among the scientific people, and who, as a botanist, has, at his own expense, travelled 
through countries very little known. lie now is sent by the King to America, in order to know the trees, the seeds, and every kind of natural production, 
whose growth may be either curious or useful; and for them the king will set up a nursery at a country seat of his, which he is very fond of. I am the 
more pleased with the plan, as it opens a new channel of intercourse and mutual good offices between the two nations. I beg, my dear General, you will 
patronize this gentleman, and I much want it to be said in France, that he has been satisfied with his reception in America. 
</p><p>
I have been visiting the Prussian army, and now am in the Austrian capital. I had, but an hour ago, a long conversation with the Emperor upon the 
United States, and the American trade, in which I took care properly to answer his questions. Everywhere I enjoy the unspeakable pleasure to hear my 
beloved General spoken of with that respect he so well deserves. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear General. My best respects wait 
on Mrs. Washington. Remember me to the young

The inclosed, my dear General, is a vocabulary

My dear General, 
</p><p>
To one who so tenderly loves you, who so happily 
enjoyed the times we have passed together, and who 
never, on any part of the globe, even in his own 
house, could feel himself so perfectly at home as in 
your family, it must be confessed that an irregular, 
lengthy correspondence is quite insufficient. I beseech you, in the name of our friendship, of that paternal concern of yours for my happiness, not to miss 
any opportunity to let me hear from my dear General. 
</p><p>
I have been travelling through some garrison towns, 
in order to preserve the habit of seeing troops and 
their tactics. Now I am mostly at Fontainbleau, 
where the Court is residing for a few weeks. The 
inclosed letter from the Minister to <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a> will, 
I hope, prove agreeable to the United States. Our 
Committees will go on this winter, and I will endeavonr to propose such measures as may be thought 
advantageous. <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a> is a most able and respected representative, and such a man as makes me 
happy to be his Aid-de-camp. Congress have made a 
choice very favorable to their affairs. 
</p><p>
The treaty of Commerce between France and England is made, but not yet ratified. They are to treat 
each other like the most favored European nation; so 
that America is safe. Newspapers will acquaint you 
with the Dutch quarrels. It is strange to see so 
many people so angry on so small a spot, without 
bloodshed. But parties are, at the same time, supported in their claims and cramped in their motions 
by the neighbouring powers. France sides with the 
patriots. The new King of Prussia interests himself 
in behalf of the Stadtholder, his brother-in-law. And 
so does England, underhand. But the republicans are 
so strong, and the Stadtholder is such a blockhead, 
that it will turn out to the advantage of the former. 
No present appearance of a war in Germany. The 
Russians and Turks are quarrelling, but will not so 
soon make a war. The Empress is going to Krimee, 
where it is said she will meet the Emperor. She had 
given me polite hints that I should go to Petersburg. 
I have answered with a demand of a permission to 
go to Krimee, which has been granted; so that, if 
the affair of the forts, which I think must be taken, 
does not more agreeably employ me, I will set out 
in the last days of February for Krimee, and return 
by Constantinople and the Archipelago. I will refer 
to the hints given in a former letter about those 
forts, which, if timely advertised, would carry me 
quite a different, and much more pleasing, course. 
</p><p>
I have been so much affected, my dear General, and so deeply mourn for the heavy loss which the 
United States, and ourselves particularly, have had to 
support, while our great and good friend, <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met friend'>General Greene</a>, has been snatched from a country to which 
he was an honor, that I feel a comfort in condoling 
with one who knew so well his value, and will, of 
course, so much have lamented the loss. 
</p><p>
There is, between <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Adams</a>, a 
diversity of opinion respecting the Algerines. Adams 
thinks a peace should be p urcha sed from them. <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a> finds it as cheap, and more honorable, to 
cruise against them. I incline to the latter opinion, 
and think it possible to form an alliance between the 
United States, Naples, Rome, Venice, Portugal, and 
some other powers, each giving a sum of money not 
very large, whereby a common armament may distress the Algerines into any terms. Congress ought 
to give <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Adams</a> ample powers 
to stipulate, in their names, for such a confederacy. 
</p><p>
You will be pleased to hear that I have great 
hopes to see the affairs of the Protestants in this 
Kingdom put on a better footing ; not such, by far, 
as it ought to be ; but much mended from the absurd and cruel laws of Louis XIV. 
</p><p>
I hope your jackass, with two females, and a few 
pheasants and red partridges, have arrived safe. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear General. My best and tenderest 
respects wait on Mrs. Washington. Remember me to 
the one who was formerly Master Tub, and now must 
be a big boy; and also to the young ladies. Be pleased to pay my affectionate compliments to George 
and his lady; to Doctor and Mrs. Sheart, Doctor Craik, Doctor Griffith, your brothers ; Mrs. Lewis ; to 
your venerable mother; to all our friends; — and often 
think of your most devoted friend, your adopted son, 
who, with all the affection and respect which you 
know are so deeply rooted in his heart, has the honor 
to be, my dear General, yours, 
</p><p>

P. S. A new instance of the goodness of the 
State of Virginia has been given me, by the placing 
of my bust at the Hotel de Ville of this city. The 
situation of the other bust will be the more pleasing to me, as, while it places me within the capitol 
of the State, I shall be eternally by the side of, and 
paying an everlasting homage to, the statue of my 
beloved General. 
</p><p>
I have received the hams, and am much obliged to 
that kind attention of Mrs. Washington. The first 
was introduced three days ago, at a dinner composed 
of Americans, where our friend Chastellux had been 
invited. They arrived in the best order. Madame de Lafayette and the little family beg their best respects to Mrs. Washington and yourself

My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
Although I cannot omit an opportunity of writing 
to you, my letter will not be so long and minute as 
I should like to make it, because of the constant 
hurry of business occasioned by the Assembly. Every clay, Sundays excepted, is taken up with General meetings. Committees, and smaller Boards, It is a 
pretty extraordinary sight at Versailles; the more so, 
as a great deal of patriotism and firmness have been 
displayed. 
</p><p>
From the time of this King's arrival to the throne, 
the expenses of the treasury have been increased 
about two hundred French millions a year ; but it 
went at such a rate under M. de Calonne, that, having got a monstrous deficiency, and knowing not how 
to fill it up, he persuaded the King to assemble notable persons of each order, to please them with a 
plan of Assemblies in each Province, which was much 
desired, and to get their approbation for new taxes, 
with which he durst not, by himself, saddle the 
nation. 
</p><p>
The Assembly was very properly chosen, both for honesty, abilities, and personal consequence. But M. de Calonne much depended on his own powers of 
speaking and intriguing, as well as on the King's blind confidence in him and all his plans. We were not the representatives of the nation ; but have been 
supported by their partiality to us. 
</p><p>
Calonne's plan of Provincial Assemblies has been 
amended by us. His plan of a tax has been rejected. 
It has been the case with several other projects. 
Some others were altered for the better, and sometimes new ones substituted ; and we declared that, 
although we had no right to impede, it was our right 
not to advise, unless we thought the measure were 
proper, and that we could not think of new taxes 
unless we knew the returns of expenditure and the 
plans of economy. The more we entered into the 
business, the less possible it was for the Ministry to 
do without us. To the Assembly the public looked 
up ; and, had the Assembly been dismissed, the credit was gone. As we were going to separate for the 
Easter days, I made a motion to inquire into bargains, by which, under pretence of exchange, millions 
had been lavished upon Princes and favorites. The 
Bishop of Langres seconded my motion. It was 
thought proper to intimidate us; and the King's brother told, in his Majesty's name, that such motions 
ought to be signed, upon which I signed the inclosed. 
</p><p>
M. de Calonne went up to the King, to ask I 
should be confined to the Bastille. An oratory battle was announced between us for the next meeting ; 
and I was getting the proofs of what I had advanced, 
when Calonne was overthrown from his post; and so 
our dispute ended, except that the King and family, 
and the great men about Court, some friends excepted, 
do not forgive me for the liberties I have taken, and 
the success it had among the other classes of the 
people. 
</p><p>
M. de Calonne's successor was M. de Fourqueux, 
an old man, who lasted but a fortnight ; and now we 
have got the Archbishop of Toulouse at the head of 
affairs, a man of the most upright honesty and shining abilities. M. de Villedeuil, a clever man, will act 
under him; and we may consider the Archbishop as 
a Prime IMinister. 
</p><p>
We are going to have good Houses of Representatives in each Province ; not to vote the taxes, but 
to divide them. We have got the King to make reductions and improvements to the amount of forty 
millions of livres a year. We are proposing the 
means to insure a better and more public method of 
administration ; but shall be obliged, in the end, to 
make loans and lay taxes. The Assembly have acted 
with firmness and patriotism. The walls of Versailles 
had never heard so many good things; and our meeting, particularly in the alarming situation of affairs, 
when the Kingdom was driving away, like Phaeton's 
car, will have proved very beneficial. 
</p><p>
I have been much hurt to hear that the unpaid 
interest of the American debt was considered as a 
very uncertain revenue. I said every thing that was 
proper on this subject ; but could not prevent that 
being considered as a fact, which, hitherto, has proved 
but too true. Full justice has been done to the 
security of the capital ; but the punctuality of the 
interest has been animadverted upon. M. de Calonne's 
letter has met with some diflficulties from the farmers, which are going to be settled, so that the merchants need not be uneasy. The cloud that was 
gathering on the Turks and Russians is, for the moment, clearing up. 
</p><p>
My health has been deranged during the Assembly, so far as to endanger a little my breast ; but a 
good regimen, and a little patience, without interrupting public business, have got me in a very fair 
way. Inclosed is a copy of my signed motion, which 
I find in a newspaper. I would have translated it ; 
but you will very easily have it done. When the 
opinions of the several Committees shall be printed, 
I will send them to America. 
</p><p>
My most affectionate respects, and those of Madame de Lafayette and family, wait on Mrs. Washington and you, my dear General. Remember me to 
the whole family and all friends. Most respectfully 
and tenderly I have the honor to be, my beloved 
General, 
</p><p>

My dear General, 
I have a few days ago written to you by M. de Moustier, the new Minister from this Court. He is a 
sensible and honest man, with whom I think that the 
people of America will be satisfied. He is very desirous to be presented to you, and I have invited 
him in your name to INIount Vernon, as well as Madame cle Brehan, a very agreeable lady, his sister-inlaw, who goes out with him. 
</p><p>
Inclosed here, my dear General, is the copy of an official letter to Congress, wherein I have expressed 
my sentiments on the present state of affairs. 
What is become of the happy years, my beloved General, when, before my sentiments were formed, I had 
time to model them after your judgment? This comfort at least remains for me, — to endeavour guessing 
what your opinion will be on every case that occurs. 
</p><p>
There is nothing new since my last. Amsterdam has ended her resistance, and there are now States 
Generals and Provincial States for each of the seven Provinces regularly elected, which are, to a man, bound 
to the Stadtholderian party. It is one of the vices of their Constitution, that the voice of their Magistrates, howsoever elected, is mistaken for the voice of the nation. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a> and myself are now employed in 
commercial affairs for the United States. M. de Calonne's letter will be framed into an arret of the 
Council, and additional favors will be so adjusted as 
to take in every thing that is consistent with this 
Government. The disposition of the Minister is as 
good as we can wish ; and I am happy in the good 
fortune America had, that such a man as <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a> was sent to this country. Nothing as yet is decided with respect to war. If it breaks out, the fjiult 
will be with England. The new Secretary at War 
has created a Board of General Officers, to carry on 
the affairs of that department, whereof he is the President. Such a measure is very meritorious, and cannot fail to do him great honor. He is, as you know, 
the brother to the Archbishop. 
</p><p>

My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
I am fortunate in this opportunity to wish you a happy new j^ear, and to devote the first moments of 
this day to the heartfelt pleasure to remind you, my beloved General, of your adoptive son and most affectionate, devoted friend. I beg you will present my 
best respects to ]\Irs. Washington. Madame de Lafayette joins in the most tender compliments to you 
and to her ; and I hope, my dear General, that you will be so kind as to mention me very affectionately to all the family and friends. 
</p><p>
It is needless for me to tell you, that I read the 
new proposed Constitution with an unspeakable eagerness and attention. I have admired it, and find in 
it a bold, large, and solid frame for the Confederation. 
The election principles, with respect to the two Houses 
of Congress, are most happily calculated. I am only 
afraid of two things; — first, the want of a declaration 
of rights ; secondly, the great powers and possible continuance of the President, who may one day or other 
become a Stadtholder. Should my observations be 
well founded, I still am easy on two accounts. The 
first, that a bill of rights may be made, if wished by 
the people, before they accept the Constitution. My 
other comfort is, that you cannot refuse being elected 
President ; and that, if you think the public vessel 
can stir without those powers, you will be able to 
lessen them, or propose measures respecting their permanence, which cannot fail to insure a greater perfection to the Constitution, and a new crop of glory 
to yourself But^ in the name of America, of mankind at large, and your own fame, I "beseech you, 
my dear General, not to deny your acceptance of 
the office of President for the first years. You only 
can settle that political machine ; and I foresee it will furnish an admirable chapter to your history. 
</p><p>
I am returned from the Provincial Assembly of 
Auvergne, wherein I had the happiness to please the 
people, and the misfortune to displease the Government 
to a very high degree. The Ministry asked for an 
increase of revenue. Our Province w^as among the 
few who gave nothing, and she expressed herself in 
a manner which has been taken very much amiss. 
The internal situation of France is very extraordinary. The dispositions of the people, of which I gave 
you a picture^ are working themselves into a great 
degree of fermentation, but not without a mixture of 
levity and love of ease. The Parliaments are every 
day passing the boundaries of their Constitution, but 
are sure to be approved by the nation, when, among 
many irrational things, they have the good policy to 
call for a General Assembly. Government see that 
the power of the Crown is declining, and now want 
to retrieve it by an ill-timed and dangerous severity. 
For my part, I am heartily wishing for a Constitution 
and bill of rights, and wish it may be effected with 
as much tranquillity and mutual satisfaction as it is 
possible. 
</p><p>
The Emperor has made a foolish attempt on Belgrade, but cannot fail to take it another time, and at 
the entrance of the spring the two Imperial Courts 
will open a vigorous and no doubt successful campaign against the Turks. They have been led into 
a war by Great Britain; and should France take a 
decisive part, it is more probable she will side with 
Russia. But this Government will avoid to be committed in the affair, and perhaps will not be the better for it. The King of Prussia is now courting 
France, and proposes, I think, to withdraw his regiments from Holland ; but this is a very insufficient, 
and probably a very useless reparation. 
</p><p>
Inclosed, my dear General, are an arret of the 
Council, and a letter to <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, both of which, 
after long negotiations, we have had the satisfaction 
to obtain. I expected it might be finished before 
my journey to Auvergne ; but new difficulties have 
arisen, and <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a> and myself have but lately 
ended the business. I am more and more pleased 
with <a href='/results.php?tla=' rel=''>Mr, Jefferson</a>. His abilities, his virtues, his temper, every thing of him commands respect and attracts 
affection. He enjoys universal regard, and does the 
affairs of America to perfection. It is the happiest 
choice that could be made. Adieu, my dear General. 
With filial love and respect, I have the honor to be, 
Your devoted and affectionate friend,

My dear General, 
</p><p>
In the midst of our internal troubles, it is a comfort to me that I may rejoice in the happy prospects 
that open before my adoptive country. Accounts 
from America give me every reason to hope the new 
Constitution will be adopted. Permit me once more, 
my beloved General, to insist on your acceptance of 
the Presidency. The Constitution, as it is proposed, 
answers most of the purposes ; but, unless I am much 
mistaken, there are some parts which would not be 
quite free of some danger, had not the United States 
the good fortune to possess their guardian angel, who 
may feel the advantages and inconveniences of every 
article, and will be able, before he retires again, to 
ascertain to what degree Government must necessarily 
be energetic, what power might be diverted into a 
bad use, and to point out the means to attain that 
perfection to which the new Constitution is already 
nearer than any past or present Government. 
</p><p>
The affairs of France are come to a crisis; the more 
difficult to manage, as the people in general have no 
inclination to go to extremities. Liberty or death is 
not the motto on this side of the Atlantic; and, as 
all classes are more or less dependent, as the rich 
love their ease, and the poor are depressed by want 
and ignorance, the only way is to reason or persuade 
the nation into a kind of passive discontent or non-obedience, which may tire out the levity, and undo 
the plans, of Government. The Parliaments, notwithstanding the inconveniences attending them, have 
been necessary champions to stand forth. You will 
see by the publications (for we have sent over every 
thing), that the King has assumed pretensions, and 
the Courts of Justice have stated principles, which so 
widely differ, that one could hardly believe those assertions were made in the same country and century. 
Matters could not rest there. 
</p><p>
Government have employed the force of arms 
against unarmed magistrates, and expelled them. 
And the people ? you will say. The people, my 
dear General, have been so dull, that it has made 
me sick, and physicians have been obliged to cool 
my inflamed blood. What has the more wound up 
my anger, is a Bed of Justice wherein the King has 
established a Cojir Pleniere, composed of Judges, Peers, 
and courtiers, without a single Representative. And 
these Ministers had the impudence to say, that all 
taxes and loans should be registered. Thank God, 
we have got the better! and I begin to hope for a 
Constitution. The Magistrates have refused sitting in 
the Coiir Pieniere. The Peers, who are thirty-eight (a 
few of them have sense and courage), will not, however obey. Some, like my friend La Rochefoucaiild, 
behave nobly ; the others follow at a distance. The 
Parliaments have unanimously protested, and made 
an appeal to the nation. Most of the inferior Courts 
reject the new regimen. Discontents break out everywhere, and in some Provinces are not despicable. 
The clergy, who happen to have an Assembly, are 
remonstrating. The lawyers refuse to plead. Government is embarrassed, and begins to apologize. Their 
Commandants have been in some parts pursued with 
dirt and stones; and, in the midst of these troubles 
and anarchy, the friends of liberty are daily reenforced, shut up their ears against negotiations, and say 
they must have a National Assembly, or nothing. 
Such is, my dear General, our bettering situation ; 
and I am, for my part, very easy, when I think that 
I shall, before long, be in an Assembly of the Representatives of the French nation, or at <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>. 
</p><p>
I am so taken up with these affairs, that I can tell 
you but little of the European politics. My disapprobation of Ministerial plans, and what little exertions I could make against them, have induced me to 
cease my visits to the Archbishop's house ; and the 
more I have been connected with him and the Keeper of the Seals, the greater indignation I have professed against their infernal plan. 
</p><p>
I am glad our American Arret du Conseil has taken 
place before the full tide of these troubles ; and am 
now, through other Ministers, endeavouring to bring 
about a plan for the total enfranchisement of duties 
on whale oil, which would put the American merchants on the same footing with the French, even 
with respect to bounties, and that without obliging 
the fishermen to leave their native shores. Should 
we succeed in that, our next o}3Ject must be the trade with the West Indies. 
</p><p>
I am happy in the Ambassador we have in this 
country; and nothing can excel <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a>'s abilities, virtues, pleasing temper, and every thing in him 
that constitutes the great statesman, zealous citizen, 
and amiable- friend. He has a young gentleman with 
him, Mr. Short, a Virginian, who is a very able, engaging, and honest man. This letter will be delivered 
by JNI. de Warville, a man of letters, who has written 
a pamphlet against Chastellux's journal ; but is, however, very clever, and wishes very much to be presented to 3'ou. He intends to write the history of 
America, and is, of course, very desirous to have a 
peep at your papers, which appears to me a deserved 
condescension, as he is very fond of America, writes 
pretty well, and will set matters in a proper light. 
He has an officer with him whom I also beg leave 
to recommend; M. de la Teniere is his name. 
</p><p>
But to come to politics. I must tell you that the 
war between the Imperial Powers and the Turks is 
going on. The Emperor has made several attempts ; 
but there is a fatality in that man which makes him 
ever begin and never finish any thing. The skirmishes have generally been doubtful. He has taken a 
town ; but was severely brushed in another assault, 
and the same day met with a second defeat. These 
matters, however trifling, show that the Turks are 
either very ill-attacked, or more lucky than we did 
expect. The siege of Belgrade will be the grand expedition that way, and is not begun. There has been 
a junction made of the Austrians and Russians in 
another quarter ; but they have not sufficient means 
to operate. The grand army of the Russians are 
moving towards Oczakow, which Prince Potemkin, a 
former lover and the bosom friend of the Empress, is 
going to besiege. Paul Jones has entered the Russian service, and "will command a squadron on the 
Black Sea. All the powers are negotiating for a 
peace; but, at the same time, Sweden and Denmark 
are arming. There will be observation fleets; and it 
is expected that a peace will take place this winter. 
We must, of course, wish for decisive actions. Should 
they be unfavorable to the Christians, it may disgust 
them; and you never can get a concession from the 
Turks, until the Prophet has shown his displeasure, 
by suffering them to be flogged. In case both parties maintain their ground, a general war is apprehended for the next year. 
</p><p>
I beg, my dear General, you will present my most 
affectionate respects to Mrs. Washington and to your 
respected mother. Remember me to the family, the 
young ones, your relations; to all friends. Madame 
de Lafayette and children join in the best respects 
to you and Mrs. Washington. My younger daughter, 
Virginia, is now under inoculation. Adieu, my beloved General. I do not live one day without grieving for the hard separation w^hich deprives me of 
the blessed sight of what is dearest to me, and 
leaves me so few opportunities to tell you, with all 
the love of a devoted heart, that I am, forever, with 
the most affectionate respect.

MY DEAR General, 
</p><p>
It is with the utmost concern that I hear my letters have not come to hand, and, while I lament the 
miscarriage, I hope you do not impute it to any 
fault on my part. In these times of troubles, it has 
become more difficult to know or to reach opportunities ; and how this will be carried, I leave to the care 
of <a href='/results.php?tla=tmp' rel='colleague'>Mr. Paine</a>, who goes to London. 
Our revolution is getting on as well as it can, with 
a nation that has swallowed liberty at once, and is 
still liable to mistake licentiousness for freedom. The 
Assembly have more hatred to the ancient system 
than experience on the proper organization of a new 
and Constitutional Government. The Ministers are 
lamenting their loss of power, and afraid to use that 
which they have ; and, as every thing has been destroyed, and not much new building is yet above 
ground, there is much room for critics and calumnies. 
To this may be added, that we still are pestered by 
two parties; the aristocratic, that is panting for a 
counter revolution, and the factious, which aims at 
the division of the empire, and destruction of all 
authority, and perhaps of the lives of the reigning 
branch; both of which parties are fomenting troubles. 
</p><p>
And after I have confessed all this, my dear General, I will tell you, with the same candor, that we 
have made an admirable and almost incredible destruction of all abuses and prejudices; that every thing 
not directly useful to, or coming from, the people, 
has been levelled; that in the topographical, moral, 
political situation of France, we have made more 
changes in ten months than the most sanguine patriot could have imagined; that our internal troubles 
and anarchy are much exaggerated ; and that, upon 
the whole, this revolution, in which nothing will be 
wanting but energy of government, just as it was in 
America, will propagate and implant liberty, and make 
it flourish throughout the world, while we must wait 
for a Convention in a few years to mend some defects, which are not now perceived by men just escaped from aristocracy and despotism. 
</p><p>
You know that the Assembly have adjourned the 
West India affairs, leaving every j;hing in the actual 
state; namely, the ports opened, as we hear they 
have been, to American trade. But it was impossible, 
circumstanced as we are, to take a definitive resolve 
on that matter. The ensuing Legislature will more 
easily determine, after they have received the demands of . the Colonies, who have been invited to 
make them, particularly on the objects of victualling. 
Give me leave, my dear General, to present you 
with a picture of the Bastille, just as it looked a few 
days after I had ordered its demolition, with the 
main key of the fortress of despotism. It is a tribute, which I owe as a son to my adoptive flither, 
as an Aid-de-camp to my General, as a missionary of 
liberty to its patriarch. Adieu, my beloved General. 
My most affectionate respects wait on Mrs. Washington. Present me most affectionately to George, to Hamilton, Knox, Harrison, Humphreys, and all friends. 
Most tenderly and respectfully.

My dear General, 
</p><p>
What could have been my feelings, had the news 
of your illness reached me before I knew my beloved 
General, my adoptive father, w\as out of danger? I 
was struck with horror at the idea of the situation 
you have been in, while I, uninformed and so distant from you, was anticipating the long waited-for pleasure to hear from you, and the still more endearing 
prospect to visit you, and present you the tribute of a revolution, one of your first offsprings. 
</p><p>
For God's sake, my dear General, take care of 
your health ! Do not devote yourself so much to the 
Cabinet, while your habit of life has, from your young 
years, accustomed you to constant exercise. Your 
conservation is the life of your friends, the salvation 
of your country. It is for you a religious duty, not 
to neglect what may concern your health. I beg you 
will let me oftener hear from you. I write when an 
opportunity offers ; and to my great sorrow I hear 
my letters must have miscarried, or been detained. 
But, as our correspondence can have no other bounds 
but the opportunities to write, it was not a reason, 
give me leave to say, for you to miss any that may 
have offered; and you may easily guess what I am 
exposed to suffer, what would have been my situation, had I known your illness before the news of 
your recovery had comforted a heart so affectionately 
devoted to you. 
</p><p>
This letter will be delivered by two gentlemen (one 
of them an artillery officer) who are going to settle on 
the banks of the famed Scioto. How profitable the 
scheme may be to them, I do not determine ; but, as 
they personally are entitled to regard, and are much 
recommended to me, I beg you will honor them with 
your kind reception and good advices. 
</p><p>
The proceedings of the National Assembly cannot 
fail being known to you. We have run or cut down 
every thing that was, and perhaps it was the only 
way to get rid of the innumerable obstacles that opposed our revolution. We afterwards have made an 
immense emission of resolves, constitutional, legislative, administrative ; and, of the latter, a great deal 
too much. Happy it has been for us, that I persuaded the Assembly to begin with a declaration of 
rights ; as, among our decrees, few may be found that 
are not consonant with the most perfect principles of 
natural rights ; so that, our errors being on the popular side, and of the speculative turn, monarchical influence and practice will fit us to meet, in a few 
years, a second Convention; while, had we got halfway only, or taken another rule than that of nature. 
it would have been impossible to conquer our difficulties, or destroy our prejudices. It is from such a 
motive that I have been so eager to root out, not 
only the reality, but even the smallest appearance, of 
aristocracy among us. 
</p><p>
Now we are disturbed with revolts among the regiments ; and as I am constantly attacked on both 
sides, by the aristocratic and factious party, I do not 
know to which of the two we owe these insurrections. Our safeguard against them is with the national guard. There is more than a million of armed 
citizens ; among them patriotism reigns, and my influence with them is as great as if I had accepted 
the chief command. I have lately lost some of my 
favor with the mob, and displeased the frantic lovers 
of licentiousness, as I am bent on establishing a legal subordination ; but the nation at large are very 
thankful to me for it. It is not out of the heads of 
the aristocrats, to make a counter revolution. Nay, 
they do what they can with all the crowned heads 
of Europe, who hate us ; but I think their plans will 
be either abandoned or unsuccessful. I am rather 
more concerned with a division that rages in the 
popular party. The clubs of the Jacobins, and of 
Eighty-Nine, as it is called, have divided the friends 
of liberty, who accuse each other ; the Jacobins being taxed with a disorderly extravagance, and EightyNine with a tincture of ministerialism and ambition. 
I am endeavouring to bring about a reconciliation. 
The affair of the Gth of October will be reported in 
the House next week. I do not think there will be 
against the Duke of Orleans, and am sure there are 
not against Mirabeau, sufficient charges to impeach 
them. There is something cloudy in the present system of those two men, although they do not seem 
actually connected. They are both cowards, but the 
prince most particularly so. 
</p><p>
I hope our business will end with the year, at 
which time this so-much blackened, this ambitious 
dictator, your friend, will most deliciously enjoy the 
happiness to give up all power, all political cares, 
and to become a private citizen in a free monarchy, 
the Constitution of which, although I could not help 
its being defective now, will lay a foundation for the 
most excellent one to be made in a few years. 
</p><p>
The people begin to be a little tired with the revolution and the Assembly j one part to be ascribed 
to the French temper and numberless private losses ; 
the other part owing to the faults of the Assembly, 
the intrigues and the ambition of most of its leaders. But we have got wind enough to run the ship 
into the harbour. 
</p><p>
I depend on my friend Short to give you political 
intelligence. His abilities, zeal, and the affection and 
esteem he enjoys, put him in a situation to give you 
the best information. <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a> and myself know 
his worth, and can warrant it. He is a most valuable man to do American business here. My best 
respects wait on Mrs. Washington. I beg you to 
present my tenderest compliments to Hamilton, Knox, 
Jefferson. Be so kind as to show them my letter, 
as well as to <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague'>Mr. Jay</a>, to whom I also beg my affectionate compliments, and to all friends. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear General. Madame de Lafayette 
and family join in affectionate respects to you and 
Mrs. Washington. Most tenderly and respectfully I 
have the honor to be.

My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
Whatever expectations I had conceived of a speedy 
termination to our revolutionary troubles, I still am 
tossed about in the ocean of factions and commotions 
of every kind. For it is my fate to be on each side 
with equal animosity attacked, both by the aristocratic, slavish, parliamentary, clerical, — in a word, by all 
enemies to my free and levelling doctrine ; and, on 
the other side, by the Oiieanist factions, antiroyal, 
licentious, and pillaging parties of every kind ; so that 
my personal escape from amidst so many hostile 
bands is rather dubious, although our great and good 
revolution is, thank Heaven, not only insured in 
France, but on the point of visiting other parts of 
the world, provided the restoration of public order is 
soon obtained in this country, where the good people 
have been better taught how to overthrow despotism 
than they can understand how to submit to the law. 
To you, my dear General, the Patriarch and Generalissimo of universal liberty, I shall render exact accounts of the conduct of your Deputy and Aid in 
that great cause. 
</p><p>
You will hear that the National Assembly have 
permitted the cultivation of tobacco throughout the 
kingdom, as it was already established in the frontier 
Provinces, to which they have been induced on three 
accounts. First, because they thought a prohibition 
inconsistent with the principles of the bill of rights; 
secondly, because the removal of the -excise barriers 
to the extremity of the empire, made it necessary to 
have a general rule ; thirdly, because the departments 
formerly called Alsace and Flanders, being greatly 
contaminated by a foreign and aristocratic influence, 
there was no doubt of the impending attack of the 
rebel Princes, Conde and Artois, taking place, and 
being countenanced even by the country farming people, had we cut them off from that branch of cultivation all of a sudden. 
</p><p>
But what is greatly exceptionable, is a duty fixed 
on the introduction of American tobacco, with a premium in favor of the French vessels, and a duty 
much too high, although it was lately lessened, on 
American whale oil. But I beg you, and all citizens 
of the United States, not to be discouraged by that 
hasty and ill-combined measure, which I hope, before 
long, to see rectified, in consequence of a report of 
the Diplomatic Committee, including the whole at 
once, and for which my friends and myself have 
kept our arguments. I shall send you the report, 
the debate, and the resolve. Should we obtain an 
easy introduction of American tobacco, no cultivation 
of any importance can take place in France, and it 
will be the better for both countries. 
</p><p>
M. de Ternant has been named Plenipotentiary 
Minister to the United States. I have warmly wished 
for it, because I know his abilities, his love for liberty, 
his early, steady and active attachment to the United 
States, his veneration and love for you. The more I 
have known Ternant, the more I have found him a 
man of great parts, a steady, virtuous, and faithful 
friend. He has deserved a great share in the confidence of the National Assembly; the patriot side, I 
mean. The Eling has a true regard for him. In a 
word, I hope he will, on every account, answer your 
purposes, and serve America as zealously in the diplomatic line, as he did when in the army. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my beloved General. My best respects wait 
on Mrs. Washington. Remember me most affectionately to Hamilton, Jefferson, Knox, Jay, and all 
friends. Madame de Lafayette and children beg their 
tender respects being joined to mine for you and the 
family. Most respectfully and tenderly, I am, my 
dear General, 
</p><p>
Your filial friend,

]\Iy DEAR General, 
</p><p>
I wish it was in my power to give you an assurance, that our troubles are at an end, and our Constitution totally established. But, although dark clouds 
are still before us. we come so far as to foresee the 
momeut when a Legislative corps will succeed this 
Convention ; and unless foreign powers interfere, I 
hope that within four months your friend will have 
reassumed the life of a private and quiet citizen. 
</p><p>
The rage of parties, even among the patriots, is 
gone as far as it is possible, short of bloodshed ; but, 
although hatreds are far from subsiding, matters do 
not appear so ill disposed as they formerly were towards a collision among the supporters of the popular 
cause. I myself am exposed to the envy and attacks 
of all parties, for this simple reason, that, whoever 
acts or means wrong, finds me an insuperable obstacle ; 
and there appears a kind of phenomenon in my situation ; all parties against me, and a national popularity 
which, in spite of every effort, has been unshakable. 
A proof of this I had lately, when disobeyed by the 
guard, and unsupported by the administrative powers 
who had sent me, unnoticed by the National Assembly, who had taken fright. The King I do not mention, as he could do but little in the affair, and yet 
the little he did was against me. Given up to all 
the madness of license, faction, and popular rage, I 
stood alone in defence of the law, and turned the 
tide up into the Constitutional channel. 
</p><p>
I hope this lesson will serve my country, and help towards establishing the principles of good order. 
But, before I could bring my fellow-citizens to a sense of legal subordination, I must have conducted them 
through the fear to lose the man they love. Inclosed is the speech I delivered on the occasion. I send it, 
not for any merit of it, but on account of the great effect it had on the minds of the people, and the 
discipline of an army of five-and-forty thousand men; upward of thirty [thousand] of them are volunteers ; 
and who, to a man, are exposed to all the suggestions of a dozen of parties, and the corruptions of all kinds of pleasure and allurement. 
</p><p>
The Committee of Revision is going to distinguish, 
in our immense materials, every article that deserves 
to be constitutional; and as I hope to convene, in a 
tolerable state of union, the members of that Committee, as their votes will in the House influence the 
popular part of the Assembly, I hope that, besides 
the restoration of all natural rights, the destruction 
of all abuses, we may present to the nation some 
very good institutions of government, and organize 
it so as to ensure to the people the principal consequences and enjoyments of a free Constitution, leaving the remainder to the Legislative corps to mend 
into well digested bills, and waiting until experience 
has fitted us for a more enlightened and less agitated 
National Convention. 
</p><p>
In the mean while, our principles of liberty and 
equality are invading all Europe, and popular revolutions preparing everywhere. Should foreign powers 
employ this summer with attacks against our Constitution, there wiU be great bloodshed; but our liberty 
cannot fail us. We have done every thing for the 
general class of the country people ; and, in case the 
cities were frightened into submission, yet the peasants would swarm round us and fight to death, rather 
than give up their rights. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my beloved General. My best respects wait on Mrs. Washington. Remember me to Hamilton, 
Jay, Jefferson, Knox, and all friends. Most respectfully and affectionately I am, my dear General, 
</p><p>
Your filial friend,

</p><p>
My dear General, 
</p><p>
I most heartily thank you for your letter, elated 
March the 19th ; the more welcome to me, as I had 
long lamented your silence, and was panting for news 
from you, wherein I could be informed of every thing 
respecting your public and private concerns. I rejoice and glory in the happy situation of American 
affairs. I bless the restoration of your health, and 
wish I could congratulate you on your side of the 
Atlantic. 
</p><p>
But we are not in that state of tranquillity, which 
may admit of my absence ; — the refugees hovering 
about the frontiers ; intrigues in most of the despotic 
and aristocratic Cabinets; our regular army divided 
into Tory officers and undisciplined soldiers ; licentiousness among the people not easily repressed; the 
capital, that gives the ton to the empire, tossed about 
by anti-revolutionary or factious parties ; the Assembly fatigued by hard labor, and very unmanageable. 
However, according to the popular motto, ga ira, it 
will do. We are introducing, as fast as we can, religious liberty. 
</p><p>
The Assembly has put an end to her existence by 
a new convocation ; has unfitted her own members for 
immediate reelection and places in the Executive; and 
is now reducing the Constitution to a few principal 
articles, leaving to the Legislative Assemblies to examine and mend the others, and preparing every thing 
for a Convention, as soon as our machine will have 
had a fair trial. I stand the continual check to all 
interior factions and plots. By the inclosed speech 
of mine, and the giving up my commission, I gave a 
spring to the power of law over licentiousness ; and 
was I equally supported in repressing it, as I should 
be against aristocratic exertions, the people could 
soon be brought to a proper sense of liberty. As to 
the surrounding Governments, they hate our revolution, but do not know how to meddle with it, so 
afraid they are to catch the plague. We are going to 
take measures to discipline the army, both officers 
and soldiers. They will prepare to encamp and leave 
the cities. They will have the same power as in 
time of war. M. de Conde and his party will be 
summoned to explain themselves, and, if they continue caballing and enlisting, declared traitors. To 
M. de Ternant I refer for more particulars. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a> and myself had long thought that Ternant was a very proper man to act as French 
Minister in America. He in great measure belongs to both countries. He is sensible, honest, well-informed, and has a plain and decisive way of doing business, which will be very convenient. He has 
long been an officer under your command, feeling and acting in an American capacity. He is personally much attached to you ; and I had, in this revolution, many instances to experience his friendship to 
me. He might have been a Minister in the Council, but was rather backward on the occasion, and behaved as a prudent, not an ambitious man. So that 
I take him to be fit to answer your purpose. He will let you know what has passed in the Assembly respecting American affairs. 
</p><p>
The last transactions are an undoubted proof of their sentiments, . and show that the faux pas, in the regulation of duties, is to be attributed to the want 
of knowledge or sense, not of friendship. They have considered me as an American, who did only mind 
American profit, and did not know matters so well as a few mercantile men, most of them on the aristocratic side of the House, who presented foolish calculations; and you know the difficulties to unmake our 
decrees. But you may depend on this point, that brotherly measures to unite the two nations with the ties of most intimate affection, of common principles 
and common interest, will be most heartily received in France; and on that ground you may work your 
plan, and send it to France, with a private copy for me. The United States and France must be one 
people, and so begin the confederation of all nations who will assert their own rights. 
</p><p>
I have, in the affair of the black free men, acted according to my conscience, not to policy. Should 
the British look for advantage of honesty, I hope you will influence the Colonies to submit to a decree so conformable to justice. 
</p><p>
Mr. Short, who does the business of the United States with all the zeal and ingenuity of a most patriotic and most sensible man, who is respected and 
loved in France in a manner equally useful to the public and honorable to himself, has written to <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a> respecting <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a>. France will do 
every thing in her power to bring Spain to reason; but will have a difficult and probably unsuccessful 
task. Upon the whole, that navigation we must have ; and, in case the people of Louisiana wish to make a 
fifteenth State, who can help it? and who ought, Spaniards excepted, not to rejoice at it? For my part, certainly, I should not be a mourner. 
</p><p>
My best respects to Mrs. Washington. My compliments to the family ; to my dear Aid, George, and 
his family. Most respectfully and affectionately, my 
beloved General,
