My dear General, 
</p><p>
In revolving in my mind the chances of discovery by moonlight, and, on the other hand, the inconveniences of staying longer than you wish under our 
tents, I have thought if there was any position which might enable us to take advantage of the first hours 
of the night. How far the sending of the Pennsylvanians towards Aquakanac, and going ourselves to the Hackensac position, may awaken the enemy, I 
cannot pretend to say. The most difficult affair in this, would be the article of the boats. Colonel Smith 
will go to-morrow morning to <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, unless any intelligence received at head-quarters had made it 
useful that the enterprise be attempted soon, in which case he would go and reconnoitre the place. Suppose 
he was to bring from <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a> Colonel Gouvion, 
who has often examined the place with the eye of an engineer. These ideas, my dear General, have rather started into my mind than become fixed, and 
I thought I would communicate them. 
</p><p>
Most affectionately and respectfully yours, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=laf" rel="me">Lafayette</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. The Marquis de Laval Montmorency, one 
of the most illustrious families in France, is on liis 
way to the camp. The Chevalier de Chastellux, a 
relation and friend of mine, Major-General in the 
French army, is also coming. I every day expect 
my brother-in-law, and his friend, Count de Charlus, 
only son to the Marquis de Castries, who enjoys a 
great consideration in France, and has won the battle 
of Closter Camp. The duke of Lauzun has also 
written to me that he would come soon. These five 
gentlemen may, by their eminence at home, be considered as the first people in the French army. This 
little history I give you before their arrival, in consequence of what you have desired from me at the 
beginning. 
</p><p>
I write some letters to the Commanding Officers at 
<a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a>, <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, and King's Ferry, so that the 
gentlemen may be directed to come by the best road 
to my quarters, from which I will present them to 
you. I think the letters ought to be sent as soon 
as possible. 
</p><p>
As <a href='/results.php?tla=wih' rel='colleague met'>General Heath</a> commands in all these parts, I 
think, upon recollection, that I had better write to 
him alone. You might also send him a line on the 
subject.

</p><p>
My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
Your letters of the 25tli and 26th are both come 
yesterday to hand, which shows that the expresses 
have not made great despatch. I would have done 
myself the honor of writing to your Excellency, had 
I not every minute waited for intelligences from the 
southward. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency remembers that our shortest calculation for the arrival of the troops at the Head of 
Elk was for the 6th of March. I am happy to inform you that they will be there this day or to-morrow early; and notwithstanding the depth of the mud, 
and the extreme badness of the roads, this march, 
which I can call rapid (as, for example, they came 
in two days from <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a> to <a href='/results.php?city=princeton' rel='city'>Princeton</a>), has been 
performed with such an order and alacrity, that, 
agreeably to the report, two men only have been 
left behind, and yet these two men have embarked 
at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, with some remains of baggage. At every 
place where the detachment have halted, they have 
found covering and wood, &c., ready for them, and 
there has not been the least complaint made to me 
from any inhabitant. Every third day they have 
drawn their provisions. The clothing has been also 
distributed; and, having embarked yesterday at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, they passed the city about two o'clock, by a 
wind which was extremely favorable. Congress have 
given to our troops the advance of one month's pay, 
which will be distributed at the Head of Elk, in their 
emission. 
</p><p>
The artillery, consisting of one twenty-four, six 
eighteen, two brass twelve, one eight-inch howitzer, two eight-inch mortarSj in all twelve heavy pieces, 
four six-pounders, and two small howitzers, with a 
sufficient proportion of ammunition, will be at the 
Head of Elk this day and to-morrow; so that by the 
4th I hope we shall be ready to sail. A quantity 
of medicines and instruments, and fifteen hundred 
pairs of shoes, will be at the Head of Elk before we 
embark. Vessels will be in readiness to receive us 
with thirty days' provisions on board. I am also assured, that we shall have a sufficient quantity of 
boats to land the detachment; and two heavy scows 
will be added for the artillery. The public, and 
some of the private armed vessels in the Bay, have 
been ordered to the Head of Elk. Two despatchboats are there, and four more have been asked for. 
As a farther security for our subsistence, I have got 
the Minister's permission to dispose of the French 
flour and salt meat along the Bay, in case of necessity. 
</p><p>
On my arrival at this place I heard that M. de 
Tilly, the French Commander, had conferred with the 
Virginians, but upon seeing that nothing could be 
done immediately, he was undetermined whether to 
stay or return to Rhode Island. Fearing that our 
letters might miscarry, and wishing to hurry the 
preparations of the militia, I complied with the earnest solicitations of the Minister of France to send on 
Colonel Gouvion, and directed him to go thither by 
land or water, as the state of the Bay would permit, 
on board the French squadron, and afterwards to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague met'>Baron De Steuben</a>'s camp, where he may apprise 
these gentlemen of our force, our intentions, and the 
time of our arrival. 
</p><p>
This minute account I give to your Excellency to 
show you that nothing on our part has been wanting 
for the success of The expedition. Our preiDarations 
have, in every article, fulfilled, and in the most important one, time, have exceeded, what had been expected. Your letter was sent by express to <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague met'>General St. Clair</a>, who immediately came to town. But nothing having been done for the settling of the accounts, none of the promises having been complied 
with, and the men being much scattered, it has, after 
much consideration, been thought impossible to embark any number with us ; and <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague met'>General St. Clair</a> promises to make every exertion for the sending of two 
or three hundred in a few days, whom, however, I 
am not to depend upon. 
</p><p>
I am myself going to the Head of Elk, and shall 
arrive there this evening. It has not been possible 
for me to leave sooner the city, as the three days I 
have remained here have been fully employed in 
making and forwarding preparations. Before I go I 
will wait on the Board of the Navy, and propose the 
sending of the frigates; but the Trumbull having not 
her complement of men, and those of the Ariel having mutinied at sea, I am afraid we shall find difficulties. 
</p><p>
The preparations made at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>; the return 
of the Aminta; the remasting of the Bedford; the 
impossibility M. Destouches is under to give us any 
farther assistance ; the uncertainty of what M. de Tilly may have determined before he had received 
your letter ; — such are, my dear General, the many 
reasons which, from a pretty certain expedition, have 
lately made a very precarious one. Under these circumstances, indeed, there must always be more or 
less danger in going down the Bay, and venturing 
upon the low country about <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>. 
</p><p>
Being unacquainted with the answer you have received from Count cle Rochambeaii and M. Destouches, I am not able to judge how far I may depend upon the same ship being ordered again to the 
Chesapeake, in case (before the reception of your 
letter) she had thought proper to sail. Her coming was not in consequence of your proposition ; her 
going was relative to the difficulties of an expedition 
very different from ours ; and I wish I might know, 
if, though M. Destouches cannot give further assistance, this assistance at least may be depended upon, 
so as to hope for the return of the ship, should M. de Tilly have left the Bay. The bottom of the Bedford is said to be damaged, the Aminta was said to 
have been dismasted. Suppose those circumstances 
were true, they would be in our favor. 
</p><p>
If a detachment was to go from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to 
<a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, west Point would be left in danger. If 
Cornwallis continues advancing, perhaps our being in 
the neighbourhood of Arnold may be of service. I 
will, however, confine myself literally to my instructions ; and if Colonel Gouvion writes mo with certaint}', that M. de Tilly is gone, if I am not led to suppose he will return, I will march back the detachment. For the present, I am going on, because, upon 
the increasing of the enemy's force at Gardiner's 
Bay, you recommend despatch to me. 
</p><p>
I hope, however, that I shall hear from your Excellency, now that the chain is established. Colonel 
Pickering says, that in six days I may receive your 
answer at the Head of Elk. The hope of seeing the 
French ship again, or some other reason, may detain 
me. But your answer will determine my motions; 
and I can receive it by the 8th, which is about the 
time when it was thouo;ht we should arrive at the 
Head of Elk. My expectations are not great, and I 
think we have hut few chances for us. I shall make 
all possible despatch, and listen particularly to the 
voice of prudence. However, some hazard must he 
run, if we undertake in these circumstances. 
</p><p>
General Duportail having not left this place, I am 
led to hope, that, if we do not go, I may return in 
time for the journey to Rhode Island. I most instantly beg, my dear General, you will favor me with 
an immediate answer. 
</p><p>
With the highest respect and most tender affection, 
I have the honor to be, &c. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=laf" rel="me">Lafayette</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. One of our transports from <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a> had got 
aground ; but the troops on board of her will still be 
in time at the Head of Elk. Some new difficulties 
have been made for the collecting of shoes, but I 
will try to get over them. From the extraordinary 
motions of Lord Cornwallis, whom we have not heard 
of these many days, and from the movements in New 
York, I am led to hope that I shall hear from you 
respecting my future conduct, and that I may be at 
head-quarters before you think it prudent to leave 
New Windsor.

</p><p>
My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
Contrary winds, heavy rains, disappointments of vessels, and every inconvenience for which we had no 
remedy, have been, from the day of my arrival, combined against our embarkation. I hope, however, we 
shall be on board to-morrow morning ; and, as nothing 
certain has been heard from the French ships, no time 
will be lost on our part for the celerity of the expedition. The troops will embark five miles below 
this place, and three miles higher up than the point 
where <a href='/results.php?tla=roh' rel='colleague'>General Howe</a> landed. There will be more 
room for the arrangement of our vessels, and the shallowness of water insures us against the enterprises of 
any vessel of force. In this situation we may wait 
for intelligences from our friends. 
</p><p>
The State of Maryland have made to me every offer in their power. I will improve this opportunity 
of making up some deficiencies in the Quarter-master's 
and Engineer's departments, and of insuring to us a 
good stock of provisions. Upon the intelligence received that <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague met'>Baron Steuben</a> was gone with a large detachment to the southward, I had hinted the possibility of getting some militia from the lower counties, 
and repairing some cannon at <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>. But, having 
read the inclosed letter from the Baron, I will write 
again to Governor Lee (as my letter has been gone 
but two days), and save the State from any expense 
of that kind. 
</p><p>
To the obtaining of the vessels, has been joined 
the difficulty of getting them up the river, as they 
were taking every opportunity to slip off. All the 
vessels, three excepted, are only Bay crafts, and our 
Admiral ship mounts twelve guns. I have prepared 
some kind of orders for that fleet, but hope to be relieved from my naval command by the arrival of a 
French frigate, and have, at all events, sent for Commodore Nicholson, of <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>. Mr. McHenry has 
been very active in accelerating the measures of his 
State. 
</p><p>
By a letter from Colonel Gouvion, dated Wicomico 
River, I find that, after many adventures, he had 
landed there on the 4th, and was proceeding by land 
to his destination. The wind is fair enough to come 
up the Bay, and I hope soon to hear from our friends. 
The inclosed letter from the Baron, having first come 
into my hands, and being on public service, as it was 
written upon io he forwarded uith desjxdch, I took the 
liberty to open it, but was very sorry to have done 
it after a letter of the same date had come also to 
my hands. Both say the same thing (at least in 
every material point), and I am happy to find that 
the Baron's preparations are going on rapidly. 
</p><p>
Whatever may be the Baron's opinion upon the 
facility of taking, sword in hand, the fortifications at 
<a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, I will not hazard any thing before I have 
considered the matter with my own eyes. Arnold had 
so much time to prepare, and plays so deep a game; 
nature has made the position so respectable ; and some 
of the troops under his orders have been in so many 
actions, — that I do not flatter myself to succeed so 
easily as it may be thought. The prospect of preserving naval superiority must, I think, decide, if we 
are to have blood shed by regular approaches, or to 
risk our men in the dangers of an assault. But I 
would like to destroy the works in some measure, 
before we attempt to storm them. A conversation 
with the Baron, with Colonel Gouvion, and some other 
officers, joined to what I can see myself, will better 
fix my mind on the matter than it can be at present. 
</p><p>
When I left <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague met'>General Wayne</a> was not 
far from hoping he could soon collect a thousand 
men. But I am not so sanguine in my expectations. 
I am, however, trying to prepare matters for these 
men, but think that a sufficiency of vessels (unless 
ours are sent back) will not be obtained within a few 
days. Let <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague met'>General Wayne</a> arrive in time, or not, 
when he comes under my direction I wish to know, 
if, in case we succeed, he must be sent on to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>. Supposing he is to go tliere, would your 
Excellency think of selecting some riflemen for the 
Grand Army ? It seems to me that I heard you once mentioning this matter. 
</p><p>
The State of Virginia, I am told, finds difficulties 
in the keeping of prisoners. Suppose something of 
the kind was stated to me, am I to alter any thing 
in what you said to me on the subject ? I am in a 
great hurry to go, my dear General, but, let us succeed or fail in the object we have in view, I shall 
not be less hurried to return with the detachment to 
head-quarters, where I hope to be again as soon as 
you may possibly expect. 
</p><p>
With the highest respect, and most tender affection, I have the honor to be, my dear General, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=laf" rel="me">Lafayette</a>.

P. S. I beg you will present my respects to Mrs. 
Washington and Mrs. Hamilton, and my compliments 
to the family.

</p><p>
My dear General, 
</p><p>
The number of small frigates and privateers that 
are in the Bay, has made it impossible for me to carry the detachment farther down than <a href='/results.php?city=annapolis' rel='city'>Annapolis</a> ; and 
I have requested the Governor of Maryland, as well 
as the principal officers of the detachment, to give out 
that we were going to join <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>. But the 
object of the expedition is so perfectly known everywhere, that our sole dependence to keep Arnold must 
be upon the apprehension he has of a French fleet 
being cruising off the Capes. 
</p><p>
For my part, I came in a barge from <a href='/results.php?city=annapolis' rel='city'>Annapolis</a>, 
and, very luckily, escaped the dangers that were in 
the way. Colonel Harrison will have given to your 
Excellency a minute detail of the reasons which have 
prompted me to this measure. I have taken his advice in the matter, a,nd have no doubt but that your 
Excellency (considering the probability that no frigate would have been sent) will approve of the step 
I have taken, to forward as much as possible both 
the advantage of the expedition and the honor of 
the American arms. 
</p><p>
On my arrival yesterday afternoon, I found that 
<a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague met'>Baron De Steuben</a> had been very active in making preparations, and, agreeably to what he tells 
me, we shall have five thousand militia ready to 
operate. This, with the Continental detachment, is 
equal to the business, and we might very well do 
without any land force from Newport. 
</p><p>
By papers found in the baggage of a British officer (taken in a boat), it seems that General Gregory 
had a correspondence with the enemy. The Baron has suspended liim, but lie is still with the troops. Arnold is so well acquainted with the coming of the 
detachment, and the object is so well known, that, as 
I said before, our only chance to keep him must be 
the idea of a French fleet being off the Capes. He 
is fortifying at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, and trying to get provisions. There have been some trifling skirmishes with 
the militia. To my great disappointment, the French 
fleet have not yet appeared. If the project has not 
been given up, they must be expected every minute. 
They have had double the time which they wanted, 
and such winds as ought to have brought them in 
four days. 
</p><p>
I wanted to hold up the idea of my going to the 
southward ; but the Baron says that, if the detachment is not announced, the militia will desert. He 
wanted me to take the command immediately ; but I 
thought it more polite not to do it until the detachment arrives, or operations are begun. In your first 
letter to the Baron, I wish, my dear General, you 
would write to him that I have been much satisfied 
with his preparations. I want to please him, and 
harmony shall be my first object. As in all cases 
(even this of my going to the southward, and coming 
here to make arrangements with the Baron), I would 
reconnoitre the enemy's works, I will take an opportunity of doing it as soon as possible. They have 
not been, as yet, reconnoitred by the Baron, and I 
think it therefore more necessary for me to see with 
my own eyes. 
</p><p>
As I am just arrived, my dear General, I cannot 
give you a very exact account of matters. This letter I send by duplicate ; and have the honor to 
be, with the highest respect and most tender affection, &c., <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=laf" rel="me">Lafayette</a>.

</p><p>
My dear General, 
</p><p>
My letter of the 23d to your Excellency will, I 
hope, be safely transmitted, as the bearer of it. Major McLane, assured me that in case he was obliged to 
lose the despatch-boat, he could find means to get 
ashore and forward the despatches by land.'" In that 
letter, I gave to your Excellency an account of what 
had passed since I left <a href='/results.php?city=annapolis' rel='city'>Annapolis</a>, and communicated the intelligence of a British fleet having anchored in 
Lynn Haven Bay. This account, however, you will 
have sooner received from the Governor of Virginia, 
than you might possibly from me. My position with 
the troops near <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a> being intended to reconnoitre the works, and get, on board of ships in Hampton Road, intelligence from the Capes was more speedily forwarded through <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>, than it might 
have been in going around to Suffolk. 
</p><p>
;My surprise at not hearing of the French fleet was, 
I confess, very great, nor could I reconcile my mind 
to this uncertainty. But intelligence, received yesterday, has put it out of doubt, that they have done 
their best endeavours towards the cooperation ; and my 
accounts being gathered from many quarters, and 
some men who were at the first engagement, your 
Excellency may depend upon their veracity. 
</p><p>
On the 16th instant, both fleets fell in near the 
Capes with each other. They both consisted of eight 
ships of the line, fifties included, with the difference 
of twenty guns in favor of the enemy. Each ship of 
the line, and each frigate, singly engaged a partner, 
and the action lasted during three glasses. The enemy had two seventy-fours, much worsted ; one of them 
had sixty-five men killed. The London suffered in 
her rigging, and the British fleet sheered off for the 
Chesapeake, while the French stood in a line formed 
in good order. The enemy have sent their wounded 
up to <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, taken all the sailors and marines 
at that place, and refitted their damaged ships. They 
were also reenforced from <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a> by the Charon, 
a forty-four, that can be made a fifty, and two large 
frigates. But it appears that our allies are determined to carry the point, and that the addition to the 
British force has not prevented them from appearing 
near the Capes. Last morning the whole British 
fleet, with the reenforcement, went to sea, and about 
eleven o'clock we heard a furious cannonade, which 
lasted more than three hours. 
</p><p>
The action must have been bloody and obstinate. 
Upon its event depends the fate of our expedition. 
I wish it had been in my power not to make your 
Excellency a partaker of our anxiety, until I might 
have known on what side victory has been. But the 
fresh winds that blew last night make it impossible 
to have any account this morning. I shall, therefore, 
send off the present intelligence, which has come last 
night to hand; and, as expresses with proper officers 
are stationed at Hampton, I shall speedily forward 
every account that appears to be certain and interesting. 
</p><p>
I have directed that Arnold be circumscribed within 
his works on both sides of the Dismal Swamp. 
The water is still open to him, but every armed vessel in the river is getting ready to do what little 
service can be expected from them. The detachment 
at <a href='/results.php?city=annapolis' rel='city'>Annapolis</a> is also ordered to be in the most perfect readiness. With the highest respect, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c.,

Dear General, 
</p><p>
Had your Excellency's answer to my letter of the 
8th been forwarded with an equal celerity with your 
favor of the 6th, I should have received it before this 
time. But whatever change my new situation could 
make in your Excellency's dispositions, I thought it 
my duty in the meanwhile to obey the positive orders I had received. The troops are now crossing 
the feny, and will, with all possible speed, proceed to 
<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>. 
</p><p>
By a letter just received from <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>, I 
find that he is strongly of opinion that I must go to 
the southward. His intention is to carry the seat of 
war into South Carolina, thereby preventing a junction between Arnold and Cornwallis. He gives me 
many excellent reasons to justify the movement. He 
requests me to move to <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> ; and this will, if 
possible, increase my zeal to execute your Excellency's orders. <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>'s opinion is, that Lord 
Cornwallis will fall down towards Wilmington. His 
own project is, to carry the war into South Carolina. 
Under these circumstances a corps of light infantry, 
embarked at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> on board a light squadron, 
might have been upon the seat of war in a very 
short passage. I cannot help fearing, my dear General, that our campaign will take a defensive turn, 
which is far from answering our first plans and expectations. 
</p><p>
Major Macpherson is with me as a volunteer. That 
officer has most zealously employed himself, and has 
been most dangerously exposed in the discovery of a 
plot made to furnish the enemy with provisions. He 
has managed this matter with infinite address, being 
for two days and one night with six soldiers, who, as 
well as himself, put on the air of British, and in 
company with a spy who thought them to be the 
enemy ; and, by a most violent gale of wind, crossed 
the Bay in a small boat, by which means he was 
made sensible that a trade of flour is carried on with 
the enemy from the western shore of Maryland ; and 
saved a magazine of eight hundred barrels of Continental flour, which would otherwise have fallen into 
the hands of the enemy. In case we proceed southerly, perhaps it will be possible for <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> 
to give Major Macpherson a command in some detachment; and I should be happy, if he was recommended to him by your Excellency. 
</p><p>
My determination being to go on with rapidity, 
unless I am recalled, your Excellency may easily judge of my movements from the answer I shall probably receive in a few hours. Was I to assure your 
Excellency, that this journey is perfectly agreeable 
to the troops, I should not use that candor which 
you have so many rights to expect. But their zeal 
and discipline insure their readiness to obey. I shall 
do my utmost to prevent desertion; and, unless I am 
recalled, I shall proceed with celerity. But I beg 
your Excellency to remember, that experience has 
often taught us how much reduced has ever been 
the number of our troops, from the time of their departure to that of their arrival at the Southern army. 
With the highest and most affectionate respect, &c.,

My dear General, 
</p><p>
I request you will receive my affectionate acknowledgments for your kind letters. Every mark of 
friendship I receive from you adds to my happiness, 
as I love you with all the sincerity and warmth of 
my heart; and the sentiment I feel for you goes to 
the very extent of my affections. Inclosed, I send 
you, my dear General, two copies of letters to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>, which I also have sent to Congress for 
their information. You will also find copies of the 
strange letters I have received from General Phillips, 
and the answers, which, if he does not behave better, 
will break off our correspondence. 
</p><p>
The leaving of my artillery appears a strange 
whim. But had I waited for it, <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> was lost, 
and Major Galvan, who has exerted himself to the 
utmost, cannot be with us under two days, as he 
could never obtain or seize horses for the artillery 
and ammunition wagons. It is not without trouble 
I have made this rapid march. General Phillips has 
expressed to an officer, on flag, the astonishment he 
felt at our celerity; and when, on the 30th, as he 
was going to give the signal to attack, he reconnoitred our position, Mr. Osburn, who was with him, 
says that he flew into a violent passion, and swore 
vengeance against me and the corps I had brought 
with me. 
</p><p>
I am, however, uneasy, my dear General, and do 
not know what the public will think of our conduct. 
The little dependence we put upon their militia, I 
cannot expose in an official letter. I cannot say that 
no boat, no wagons, no intelligence, not one spy 
could be obtained ; that if once I had been manoeuvring with Phillips, he had every advantage over me ; 
that a defeat would have scattered the militia, lost 
the few arms we have, and knocked down this handful of Continental troops. A great deal of mischief 
had already been done. I did not know but that the 
enemy meant to establish a post. Under these circumstances, I thought it best to fight on none but 
my own grounds, and to defeat the main and most 
valuable object of the enemy. Had I gone on the 
other side, the enemy would have given me the slip, 
and taken <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, leaving nothing to me but the 
reputation of a rash, inexperienced young man. Our 
stores could not be removed. 
</p><p>
No orders from <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> have as yet come 
to me. I cannot conceive the reason of his delay in 
answering my letters. In the meanwhile, Phillips is 
my object ; and if, with a thousand men, I can be 
opposed to three thousand in this State, I think I am 
useful to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>. In a former letter, he 
tells me his object is to divide the enemy; and having no orders, I must be regulated by his opinion. I 
wish he would call for the Pennsylvanians, and leave 
me here. The enemy are gone down the river. I 
have detached some militia to Hood's, where I mean 
to make a fort. Colonel Innes, with another corps of 
militia, is gone towards <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>. His orders are, in case the enemy land there, to annoy them, 
and in case they mean to establish a post, he is to 
disturb them until I arrive. This position is sixteen 
miles from <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, forty-two from <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>, 
sixty from <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a>. I have sent an officer to 
Point Comfort, and established a chain of expresses 
to know if they appear to turn towards the Potomac. 
Should it be the case, <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a> will have my 
attention. Having missed <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, Mr. Hunter's 
Works, at <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a>, must be their next object, 
as they are the only support of our operations at the 
southward. 
</p><p>
Your first letters, my dear General, will perhaps 
tell me something more about your coming this way. 
How happy I should be to see you, I hope I need 
not to express. As you are pleased to give me the 
choice, I shall frankly tell my wishes. If you cooperate with the French against the place you know/'' 
I wish to be at head-quarters. If something is cooperated in Virginia, I shall find myself very happily 
situated. For the present, in case my detachment 
remains in this State, I wish not to leave it, as I 
have a separate and active command, though it does 
not promise great glory. But, as you gave me leave 
to do it, I shall in a few days write to you more 
particularly on my private concerns. It is not only 
on account of my own situation, that I wish the 
French fleet may come into the Bay. Should they 
come, even without troops, it is ten to one that they 
will block up Phillips in some of the rivers, and 
then I answer he is ruined. Had I but ships, my 
situation would be the most agreeable in the world. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear General. You will make me happy to write me sometimes. With the highest respect, 
and most tender affection, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, yours,

My dear General, 
</p><p>
There is no fighting here, unless you have a naval 
superiority, or an army mounted upon race-horses. 
Phillips's plan against <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> has been defeated. 
He was going towards <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, and I thought it 
would be enough for me to oppose him at some principal points in this State. But now it appears I shall 
have business to transact with two armies, and this 
is rather too much. By letters from North Carolina 
I find that Lord Cornwallis, who, I had been assured, 
had sailed for <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, is advancing towards <a href='/results.php?city=halifax' rel='city'>Halifax</a>. In consequence of letters from the same quarter, 
General Phillips has altered his plan, and returned to 
a place called Brandon, on the south side of James 
River, where he landed the night before last. Our 
detachment is under march towards the <a href='/results.php?city=halifax' rel='city'>Halifax</a> road. 
His command of the water enabled him to land where 
1 could not reach him. The bridge at Petersburg is 
destroyed; and unless he acts with an uncommon degree of folly, he will be at <a href='/results.php?city=halifax' rel='city'>Halifax</a> before we are. 
Each of these armies is more than double the superior to me. we have no boats for militia, and less 
arms. I will try to do for the best, and hope to deserve your approbation. 
</p><p>
Nothing can abstract my sight from the supplies 
and reenforcements destined to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>'s army, while I am going to get beaten by both armies, 
or each of them separately. The Baron remains at 
<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, where he hurries the collection of recruits, 
and every other requisite. I have forbidden every 
department to give me any thing that may be thought 
useful to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> ; and should a battle be expected (an event which I will try to keep off), no 
consideration will prevent our sending to Carolina 
eight hundred recruits, who, I hope, may be equipped 
in a fortnight. When <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> becomes equal 
to offensive operations, this quarter will be relieved. 
I have wrote to Wayne to hasten his march ; but, unless I am very hard pushed, I shall request him to 
proceed southward. The militia has been ordered out, 
but are now unarmed, and not yet used to this business. <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>, from whom I have as yet no 
letters, was, on the 2Gth, before Camden, but did not 
think himself equal to the storming of the works.

Most respectfully, &c.,

Dear General, 
</p><p>
My correspondence with one of the British Generals, and my denial of a correspondence with the 
other, may be perhaps misrepresented. I shsdl therefore give an account of what has passed, and hope 
your Excellency and <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> will approve of 
my conduct. On the arrival of our detachment at 
<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, three letters were brought by a flag, which 
I have the honor to inclose, and which, as Commander 
of the troops in this State, it became my duty to 
answer. The inclosed letters were successively sent 
in pursuit of General Phillips, who received them 
both with a degree of politeness that seemed to apologize for his unbecoming style. 
</p><p>
General Phillips being dead, of a fever, an officer 
was sent with a passport and letters from <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a>. I requested the gentleman to come to my 
quarters; and having asked if General PhilUps ivas 
dead, to which he answered in the negative, I made 
it a pretence not to receive a letter from General Ai'nold, which, being dated head-quarters, and directed 
to the Commanding Officer of the American troops, 
ouffht to come from the British General, chief in 
command. I did, however, observe, that should any 
other officer have written to me, I would have been 
happy to receive their letters. 
</p><p>
The next day the officer returned with the same 
passport and letter, and informed me that he was 
now at liberty to declare that Phillips was dead, and 
Arnold was Commander-in-chief of the British army 
in Virginia. The high station of <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a> having obliged me to an explanation, the inclosed 
note was sent to the officer of the flag, and the 
American officer verbally assured him that, was I requested to put in writing a minute account of my 
motives, my regard for the British army was such 
that I would cheerfully comply with the demand. 
</p><p>
Last evening a flag of ours returned from Petersburg, who had been sent by General Nelson from 
the advanced corps he commands, and happened to 
be on his way while the British officer was at our 
pickets. Inclosed is the note written by <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a>, in which he announces a determination of 
sending our officers and men to the West Indies. 
The British General cannot but perfectly know that 
I am not to treat of partial exchanges ; and that the 
fate of the Continental prisoners must be regulated 
by a superior authority to that with which I am invested. With the highest respect, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c.,

</p><p>
My dear General, 
</p><p>
My official letter, a copy of which I send to Congress, will let you know the situation of affairs in 
this quarter. I ardently wish my conduct may meet 
with your approbation. Had I followed the first impulse of my temper, I would have risked something 
more. But I have been guarding against my own 
warmth; and this consideration, that a general defeat, 
which, with such a proportion of militia, must be expected, would involve This State and our affairs in 
ruin, has rendered me extremely cautious in my 
movements. Indeed, I am more embarrassed to move, 
more crippled in my projects, than we have been in 
the Northern States. 
</p><p>
Had the Pennsylvanians arrived before Lord Cornwallis, I was determined to attack the enemy, and 
have no doubt but what we should have been successful. Their unaccountable delay cannot be too 
much lamented, and will make an immense difference 
in the fate of this campaign. Should they have arrived time enough to support me in the reception of 
Lord Cornwallis's first stroke, I should still have 
thought it well enough ; but, from an answer of <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague met'>General Wayne</a>, received this day, and dated the 19th, 
I am afraid that at this moment they have hardly 
left Yorktown.-' 
</p><p>
Public stores and private property being removed 
from <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, this place is a less important object. 
I do not believe it would be prudent to expose the 
troops for the sake of a few houses, most of which 
are empty. But I am wavering between two inconveniences. Were I to fight a battle, I should be cut 
to pieces, the militia dispersed, and the arms lost. 
Were I to decline fighting, the country would think 
herself given up. I am, therefore, determined to skirmish, but not to engage too far; and particularly to 
take care against their immense and excellent body 
of horse, which the militia fear as they would so 
many wild beasts. 
</p><p>
A letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> to General Sumner 
is dated May 5th, seven miles below Camden. The 
Baron is going to him with some recruits, and will 
get some more in North Carolina. When the Pennsylvanians come, I am only to keep them a few days, 
which I will improve as well as I can. Cavalry is 
very necessary to us. I wish Lauzun's legion could 
come. I am sure he will like to serve with me; and as <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> gave me command of the troops 
in this State, Lauzun might remain with me in Virginia ; if not, Sheldon's dragoons might he sent. As 
to Mojlan, I do not believe he will be ready before a long time. 
</p><p>
Were I any ways equal to the enemy, I should be 
extremely happy in my present command ; but I am 
not strong enough even to get beaten. Government, 
in this State, has no energy, and laws have no force. 
But I hope this Assembly will put matters upon a 
better footing. I had a great deal of trouble to put 
the departments in a tolerable train. Our expenses 
were enormous ; and yet we can get nothing. Arrangements, for the present, seem to put on a better 
face, but for this superiority of the enemy, who will 
chase us wherever they please. They can overrun 
the country ; and, until the Pennsylvanians arrive, we 
are next to nothing in point of opposition to so large 
a force. This country begins to be as familiar to me 
as Tappan and Bergen. Our soldiers are hitherto 
very healthy, and I have turned doctor to regulate 
their diet. Adieu, my dear General. Let me hear 
sometimes from you. Your letters are a great happiness to your affectionate friend, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=laf" rel="me">Lafayette</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. As I am for the present fixed in the command of the troops in this State, I beg it as a great 
favor that you will please to send me Colonel Gouvion. Should a junction be made with <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>, 
he will act as my Aid-de-camp. My respects, if you 
please, to Mrs. Washington, and compliments to the 
family.

My dear General, 
</p><p>
This letter will be handed by Colonel Morris, who 
waits upon your Excellency with <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>'s 
sentiments upon the different ways to improve Count de Grasse's assistance. I have been desired to add 
my own ; but the last letter I had the honor to write 
has anticipated the information which <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> 
wanted me to give. 
</p><p>
The light infantry are eight hundred and fifty ; the 
Pennsylvanians, about six hundred ; Virginia exchanged soldiers and new levies, four hundred ; the Marylanders will be six hundred. We have one hundred 
and twenty dragoons, and a chance to obtain sixty 
more. Had we accoutrements, we could have two 
hundred more, whom Colonel white has in readiness, with two hundred excellent horses, sixty of which I 
hope to equip by dismounting volunteers. As to 
militia, we may, in a few days, have three thousand. 
A demand from you upon the State of Maryland will 
procure one thousand well-armed militia. The conduct 
of some people in that State, appears to me very injurious to public interests. The new levies have been 
every day delayed, every petty pretence employed to 
prevent their joining either <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> or this 
army. The danger of <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>, upon which I was 
not very hasty to quiet them, brought on a confession 
that the men were ready. I then demanded them, in 
most urgent terms. At last, I sent George there, who 
wrote me that they make a beautiful battalion. But 
he could not obtain more than a promise to send them in three or four days. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a> is evacuated with some precipitation. 
I wait for a more particular account before I write 
officially. Yesterday, M. de Camus, a French officer 
of the navy, reconnoitred the shipping in York River. 
There are sixty sail, — ten of which, armed vessels; the 
largest, a fifty-gun ship ; their situation very much 
exposed. The enemy are not yet fortifying at York. 
What is doing at Gloucester is rather upon a contracted scale. They do not appear very much alarmed. Colonel Dundas was heard to say that an English and a French fleet had sailed at the same time. 
The intelligence concerning Count de Grasse has been 
kept a profound secret. 
</p><p>
My coming into this country has attracted this side 
a large portion of the enemy's force. In the meanwhile <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague met'>General Wayne</a> was filing off towards Westover, and the remainder of the army to Ruffin's Ferry. 
Should the enemy move southerly, we shall be at 
Westover before Wayne has done crossing, as the 
cavalry will be hurried. The moment Count de Grasse 
arrives, I will collect our force about Good's Bridge, 
and wait for intelligence from him. 
</p><p>
Colonel Gimat, and the French officers I have mentioned, are gone to <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, under pretence to see 
the fortifications which I have ordered to be levelled, 
and will proceed to Cape Henry, in order to deliver 
my despatches to the French Commanders, and give 
them every information in their power. Heavy artillery, and every thing relative to a siege, from the 
cannon to the tool, are not to be found this side of 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. Clothing, and particularly shoes, arms, 
dragoons' and horse equipments, ammunition, are articles which your Excellency will be obliged to send 
from the northward. I may add, medicines and hospital stores. Could Lauzun's legion be forwarded with 
despatch, they will be extremely useful; they might 
come with you, and would, in the mean time, serve 
to the safety of your journey. 
</p><p>
As to provisions, my dear General, want of system 
will render our subsistence difficult, unless intelligent 
Commissaries are immediately sent on. If you intend, as I hope, to come yourself, you might send on 
the heads of departments. An early application upon 
the State of Maryland may be productive of great 
good. My expectations have not, as yet, been communicated to any General Officer, not even to the 
Executive. I wish to write a private letter to the 
Governor. Count de Grasse will arrive before long. 
In case important operations are carried on in Virginia, which, I think, cannot fail to succeed, <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague'>Mr. Morris</a> ought to send some hard money. From the 
moment I took the command of this army, there has 
not been a farthing sent from the Treasury; and this 
State money is good for nothing. 
</p><p>
Lord Cornwallis's force at <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> was four thousand. There were then, at least, one thousand in 
<a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>. Some have been killed, and some are 
sick. But, if you add sailors, he will have much upwards of five thousand men, at the least. With the 
highest regard and affection, I have the honor to he, 
my dear General,

My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
This letter is not by any means directed to the 
Commander-in-chief, but to my most intimate and longcherished friend. I will lay before you my circumstances and my wishes. Certain I am you will do 
whatever you can for me, that is consistent with your 
public duty. 
</p><p>
When I went to the southward, you know I had 
some private objections. But I became sensible of 
the necessity there was for the detachment to go, 
and I knew that, had I returned, there was nobody 
that could lead them on against their inclinations. 
My entering this State was happily marked by a 
service to the capital. Virginia became the grand 
object of the enemy, as it was the point to which the 
Ministry tended. I had the honor to command an 
army, and oppose Lord Cornwallis. When incomparably inferior to him, fortune was pleased to preserve 
us ; when equal in numbers, though not in kind of 
troops, we have also been pretty lucky. Cornwallis 
had the disgrace of a retreat, and this State being 
recovered, Government is properly reestablished. The enemy are under the protection of their works at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>. 
</p><p>
It appears an embarkation is taking place, probably 
destined to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. The war in this State would 
then become a plundering one, and great manoeuvres 
be out of the question. A prudent officer would do 
our business here, and the Baron is so to the utmost. 
would it be possible, my dear General, that in case 
a part of the British troops go to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, I may 
be allowed to join the combined armies ? I know the 
command of a separate army ought not to be quitted. 
But, besides the services I may render in the cooperation, some arrangements, which I leave to your 
goodness for me to think of, may put me in a very 
brilliant station. 
</p><p>
M. de Choisy, I am told, is very unhappy to be left 
behind. Perhaps these French troops will be replaced 
by militia, which requires a general officer; perhaps 
a corps of observation in the Jerseys will be given 
to another. The militia requires a Major-General, as 
it will be very numerous. Does not <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague met'>General St. Clair</a> 
take command of the Pennsylvania line, and will not 
this line be forwarded to the southward, rather than 
the New England light infantry ? So that, my dear 
General, I hope something may be found for me in 
the Continental part of the army; the more so, as it 
seems it will form one of the divisions of the combined army under your command. 
</p><p>
I have calculated that nothing very material would 
happen before September. By that time your forces 
will be collected, clothed, and arranged ; a succour 
from the West Indies may arrive ; you will then decide if the upper part of the Island, Long Island, 
Staten Island, or <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> Island, is to be in our 
possession. This letter goes to-day by a faithful servant. It will arrive on the 29th at camp. Your 
answer might he with me so that I may leave on the 
10th, and arrive at head-quarters about the 20th. 
This matter I have not mentioned to any body, and 
wish it may rest between you and me. Lord Cornwallis is every day inquiring about my going to the 
Grand Army, which he says must be soon the case. 
This induces me to think they believe you are in 
earnest in your preparations. 
</p><p>
The command of this army has been a great matter for me. You may end this campaign of mine in 
the most brilliant manner, by the command I may, 
with some arrangements, get in the combined army. 
The services I may render, with respect to the cooperation, may be a very good reason, and my coming unexpectedly, unless I have many senior officers 
in the way, may entitle me to a great command. 
Should not a great part of the operating army in 
this quarter go to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, I would not trouble 
you with my wishes to return to head-quarters. But 
do not, I pray, believe I have the least notion of 
calculating upon commands, though in my personal 
circumstances they become peculiarly important to 
me. If I may be of the least use to you, it will 
make me happy to serve as a volunteer Aid-de-camp 
to you. 
</p><p>
Since writing the inclosed, my dear General, an 
officer of Tarleton's legion, who has been taken, was 
brought to my quarters. He had much conversation 
with my Aids-de-camp, and being an unguarded young 
man, spoke very freely. He says Lord Cornwallis 
and Colonel Tarleton are certainly going to New 
York. He adds, the light infantry, and a regiment 
of horse, do certainly embark for the same place. 
Preference is given to such troops as were the most fatigued in their manoeuvres through Virginia. He 
thinks the guards are to remain here ; does not know 
the disposition of any other troops. I thought this 
was worth mentioning to you. Would to God this 
embarkation could be intercepted !
</p><p>
I have this day seen the order of battle. It appears to me <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague met'>General St. Clair</a> is not comprehended 
in it. The Jersey troops, not being there, are, I presume, destined to a diversion with the New Jersey 
militia. New England, or the whole body of the 
militia, will perhaps furnish some general employment, so that I hope I may be put in, at all events. 
I should be with you, and of course should be very 
happy. 
</p><p>
Should the enemy remain quiet in this State, the 
Baron might do very well. But if the siege of New 
York does not succeed, and there is no place, I imagine you will march here in force. Adieu, my dear 
General. You will not forget this letter is entirely 
private, and by no means directed to the Commander-in-chief With every sentiment of respect, and the 
most tender affection, I have the honor to be, my 
dear General, &c., 
</p><p>

P. S. In case there is no appearance of a move 
of the enemy, and no propriety in our going toward

My dear General, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the loth is just come to hand. The 
moment a perfect intelligence can be got, Major Macpherson vill be despatched. But some expressions in 
your last favor vill, if possible, augment my vigilance 
in keeping you well apprised of the enemy's movements. 
</p><p>
There are, in Hampton Road, thirty transport 
ships full of troops, most of them red-coats ; there 
are eight or ten brigs, which have cavalry on board. 
They had excellent winds, and yet they are not 
gone. Some say they have received advices from 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> in a row-boat. The escort, as I mentioned 
before, is the Charon, and several frigates; the last 
account says, seven. The light infantry. Queen's 
rangers, and two British regiments, are, I think, on 
board. Two German regiments are, it seems, destined 
to the same service. I cannot be positive, and do 
not even think Lord Cornwallis has been fully determined. I have got in <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a> many people that 
watch his motions. But none has been able to slip 
out. His Lordship went to Old Point Comfort, had 
a survey taken of the properest place to build a fort, 
had the soundings examined, and returned to <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a> with General Leslie. 
</p><p>
This State is so difficult to be defended, that one 
false step involves the one that does not command 
the water, in a series of inconveniences. His Lordship has taken pilots for the Bay and for <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>. This, I suppose, is a feint. But a march south 
of James River, throws me out of supporting distance 
for any thing that is north of it; a march to the north gives the enemy command of every thing south of the river. 
</p><p>
Two battalions of light infantry and the militia are 
at this place, the healthiest and best-watered spot in 
the State. <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague met'>General Wayne</a> is at Good's Bridge, on 
the Appomattox, with the Pennsylvanians and Virginia Continentals, and looks toward Roanoke or <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>. Muhlenberg, with a battalion of light infantry, some riflemen, and the horse, has an intermediary 
position between me and Suffolk, in the neighbourhood of which moves a party of militia under Colonel 
Parker. General Weedon is in person at <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a>, and, the moment a fleet appears, will call out 
the militia. Gregory is on the other side of the Dismal Swamp. I cannot hear from him, but sent him 
orders by a safe hand to call out the militia, mount 
some cannon on the passes, and take out of the way 
every boat which might serve the enemy to go to 
North Carolina. You know, my dear General, that, 
with a very trifling transportation, they may go by 
water from <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a> to Wilmington. The only 
way to shut up that passage is to have an army before <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, and posted at the head of these 
rivers ; a movement, which, unless I was certain of 
a naval superiority, might prove ruinous. But, should 
a fleet come into Hampton Road, and should I get 
some days' notice, our situation would be very agreeable. 
</p><p>
I am endeavouring to get a cavalry, and it is not 
without trouble. Transportation is a great objection 
to the formation of magazines. A naval superiority 
would also level that difficulty. It appears a pretty 
large body of troops have been sent to Kemp's Landing ; some cannon removed from <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a> ; but nothing that can make his Lordship's intentions perfectly understood. Any certainty of a naval superiority, I 
would wish to know instantly, as then I will give 
his Lordship every opportunity to go up the rivers. 
There is a chain of expresses ; but I shall see that 
it is more properly conducted. With the highest 
esteem and most tender afFection, my dear General, 
</p><p>

My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
The embarkation, which I thought and do still 
think to have been destined to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, was reported to have sailed up the Bay, and to be bound 
to <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>, in consequence of which, I wrote to 
your Excellency, and, as I had not indulged myself 
too near <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, I was able to cut across towards <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a>. But, instead of continuing his 
voyage up the Bay, my Lord entered York River, 
and landed at York and Gloucester. To the former 
vessels were added a number of flat-bottomed boats. 
Our movements have not been precipitate. We were 
in time to take our course down Pamunky River, and 
will move to some position where the several parts of 
the army Vvill unite. 
</p><p>
I have some militia in Gloucester county, and some 
in York. We shall act agreeably to circumstances, 
but avoid drawing ourselves into a false movement, 
which, for want of cavalry and command of the rivers, would give the enemy the advantage of us. His 
Lordship plays so well, that no blunder can be hoped 
from him to recover a bad step of ours. The troops 
in York and Gloucester are, — two battalions of light infantry; two large Auspacli regiments, the eightieth 
and seventy-sixth, which are said to be the two largest ones in the British army; the forty-third, the 
Queen's rangers, and some horse. Lord Cornwallis 
himself commands. General O'Hara is in <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a> 
with the remainder of the troops. Leslie is, it is 
said, gone in a frigate to <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>. You must not 
wonder, my dear General, that there has been a fluctuation in my intelligence. I am positive the British 
counsels have also been fluctuating. I am so earnest 
in my opinion, that I should not be surprised if the 
light infantry and Anspachers were detached to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
</p><p>
York is surrounded by the river and a morass. 
The entrance is but narrows There is, however, a 
commanding hill (at least I am so informed), which, 
if occupied by them, would much extend their works. 
Gloucester is a neck of land projected into the river, 
and opposite to York. Their vessels, the biggest of 
which is a forty-four, are between the two towns. 
Should a fleet come in at this moment, our affairs 
would take a very happy turn. 
</p><p>
General Gregory and Colonel Parker have been 
directed to collect forces, and press near <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>. 
I have written to North Carolina to be guarded 
against any movement by land. I have written to Maryland for their new levies ; and, as agreeably to 
your intentions, his Lordship's remaining in the State 
keeps me with this army, I am still more anxious, 
if possible, to receive the private communications that 
have been announced. Had not your attention been 
turned to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, something, with a fleet, might 
be done in this quarter. But I see <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> is 
the object, and consequently I attend to your instructions by Captain Olney. It is the more important for me to know what Lord Cornwallis ought to 
do for fulfilling your Excellency's wishes, as we 
might try to influence his Lordship's manoeuvres, and 
endeavour to determine them towards a wrong point. 
</p><p>
Vessels are gone back to <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, it is thought, 
to fetch troops and cannon. Perhaps his Lordship 
does not choose to keep two distant posts. 
</p><p>
I beg, my dear General, you will forgive the more than usual scribbling of this hasty letter; and have the honor to be, with a respect equal to my affection,

My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
You have so often been pleased to ask I would 
give my opinion upon any subject that may occur, 
that I will this day take the liberty to mention a few 
articles. I am far from laughing at the idea of the 
enemy's making a retreat. It is not very probable ; 
but it is not impossible. Indeed, they have no other 
way to escape, and since we cannot get ships above 
York, I should be still more afraid of a retreat by 
"<a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, than any thing else. The French hussars remaining here, our dragoons and some infantry might be stationed somewhere near <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, rather on the north side. I see the service is much 
done by details, and, to use your permission, I would 
take the liberty to observe, that when the siege is 
once begun it might be more agreeable to the officers 
and men to serve, as much as possible, by whole battalions. 
</p><p>
Colonel Scammell is taken. His absence I had accounted for by his being officer of the day. I am 
very sorry we lose a valuable officer ; but though 
Colonel Scammell's being officer of the day has been 
a reason for his going in front, I think it would be 
well to prevent the officers under the rank of Generals or Field-Officers reconnoitring, for the safety of 
their commands, from advancing so near the enemy's 
lines. There is a great disproportion between Huntington's and Hamilton's battalions. Now that Scammell is taken, we might have them made equal, and 
put the eldest of the two Lieutenant-Colonels on the 
right of the brigade. 
</p><p>
I have, these past days, wished for an opportunity 
to speak with your Excellency on Count de Grasse's 
demand relative to M. de Barras's fleet. This business being soon done, we may think of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, 
at least of the harbour; or of <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>. I have 
long and seriously thought of this matter ; but would 
not be in a hurry to mention it, until we know how 
long this will last. However, it might be possible to 
give Count de Grasse an early hint of it, in case 
you agree with him upon the winter departure of the 
whole fleet for the West Indies. 
</p><p>
One of my reasons to wish troops, though not in 
great numbers, to be sent to Gloucester county, by 
way of <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, is, that for the first days it will 
embarrass any movement of the enemy up the river, 
or up the country, on either side; and when it is in Gloucester county it may be thought advantageous, 
by a respectable regular force, to prevent the enemy's increasing their works there, and giving us the 
trouble of a second operation; and, at the same time, 
it will keep from York a part of the British forces. 
With the highest regard and most sincere affection, 
I have the honor to be, dear General, 
</p><p>

My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency having personally seen our dispositions, I shall only give you an account of what 
passed in the execution. Colonel Gimat's battalion 
led the van, and was followed by that of Colonel 
Hamilton, who commanded the whole advanced corps. 
At the same time, a party of eighty men, under <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Laurens</a>, turned the redoubt. I beg leave to refer your Excellency to the report I have received 
from <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Hamilton</a>, whose well-known talents and 
gallantry were on this occasion most conspicuous and 
serviceable. Our obligation to him, to Colonel Gimat, 
to <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Laurens</a>, and to each and all the officers 
and men, are above expression. Not one gun was 
fired; and the ardor of the troops did not give time 
for the sappers to derange the abatis; and, owing to 
the conduct of the Commanders and bravery of the 
men, the redoubt was stormed with an uncommon rapidity. 
</p><p>
Colonel Barber's battalion, which was the first in 
the supporting column, being detached for the aid of 
the advance, arrived at the moment they were getting over the works, and executed then orders with 
the utmost alacrity. The Colonel was slightly wounded. The rest of the column, under Generals Muhlenberg and Hazen, advanced with admirable firmness 
and discipline. Colonel Yose's battalion displayed to 
the left, a part of the division successively dressing 
by him, whilst a kind of second line was forming 
columns in the rear. It adds greatly to the character of the troops, that, under the fire of the enemy, 
they displayed and took their ranks with perfect 
silence and order. 
</p><p>
Give me leave particularly to mention Major Barber, Division Lispector, who distinguished himself, and 
received a wound from a cannon ball. 
</p><p>
Li making the arrangement for the support of the 
works we had reduced, I was happy to find <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague met'>General Wayne</a> and the Pennsylvanians so situated as to 
have given us, in case of need, the most effectual 
support. I have the honor to be, with the most perfect respect.

Inclosed you will find some numbers, a copy of 
which I have kept, and which contain some names 
that may probably occur in our correspondence. I 
need not tell you, my dear General, that I shall be 
happy in giving you every intelligence in my power, 
and reminding you of the most affectionate friend you 
can ever have. The goodness you had to take upon 
yourself the communicating to the Virginia army the 
approbation of Congress, appears much better to me 
than my writing to the scattered parts of the body I 
had the honor to command. Give me leave, my dear 
General, to recall to your memory the peculiar situation of the troops, who, being already in Virginia, 
were deprived of the month's pay given to the others. 
Should it be possible to do something for them, it 
would give them great satisfaction. 
</p><p>

My dear General, 
</p><p>
I am sorry to think we are not yet gone, and there 
remain still some doubts of our going to-morrow. 
This delay I lament, not so much on private accounts, 
as I do on the account of our next campaign, in the 
planning of which your opinion, as I shall deliver it, must be of the greatest use to the common cause. 
As to the department of Foreign Affairs, I shall be 
happy to justify the confidence of the Congress, by 
giving my opinion, to the best of my power, whenever it is asked for. But the affair of finances will, 
I fear, be a difficult point for the American Minister, 
in which, however, I shall be happy to help him with 
my utmost exertions. The moment I arrive in France, 
I will write to you minutely how things stand, and 
give you the best accounts in my power. 
</p><p>
I have received every mark of affection in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, 
and am much attached to this town, to which I owe 
so many obligations j but, from public considerations, 
I have been impatient to leave it and go on board 
the frigate, where I receive all possible civilities, but 
where I had rather be under sail than at anchor. 
</p><p>
I beg your pardon, my dear General, for giving 
you so much trouble in reading my scrawls ; but we 
are going to sail, and my last adieu I must dedicate 
to my beloved General. Adieu, my dear General. I 
know your heart so well, that I am sure that no 
distance can alter your attachment to me. With the 
same candor, I assure you that my love, my respect, 
my gratitude for you, are above expression ; that, at 
the moment of leaving you, I felt more than ever 
the strength of those friendly ties that forever bind 
me to you, and that I anticipate the pleasure, the 
most wished-for pleasure, to be again with you, and, 
by my zeal and services, to gratify the feelings of 
my respect and affection. will you be pleased to 
present my compliments and respects to Mrs. Washington, and to remember me to <a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='colleague met'>General Knox</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague met'>General Lincoln</a>. Adieu, my dear General.

My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
Were you but such a man as Julius Caesar, or the 
King of Prussia, I should almost be sorry for you at 
the end of the great tragedy where you are acting 
such a part. But, with my dear General, I rejoice 
at the blessings of a peace where our noble ends 
have been secured. Remember our Valley-Forge 
times ; and, from a recollection of past dangers and 
labors, we shall be still more pleased at our present 
comfortable situation. What a sense of pride and satisfaction I feel, when I think of the times that 
have determined my engaging in the American cause ! 
</p><p>
As for you, my dear General, who truly can say 
you have done all this, what must your virtuous and 
good heart feel, on the happy instant when the revolution you have made is now firmly established ! 
I cannot but envy the happiness of my grandchildren, when they will be about celebrating and worshipping your name. To have one of their ancestors 
among your soldiers, to know he had the good fortune to be the friend of your heart, will be the eternal honor in which they shall glory ; and to the 
eldest of them, as long as my posterity will last, I 
shall delegate the fiivor you have been pleased to 
confer upon my son George. 
</p><p>
At the prospect of a peace, I had prepared to go 
to America. You know me too well, my dear General, not to be sensible of the pleasure I anticipated 
in the hope to embrace you, and to be reunited to 
my fellow-soldiers. Never did any thing please me 
so much as the delightful prospect I had before me. 
But, on a sudden, I have been obliged to defer my 
darling plan; and, as I have at last been blessed 
with a letter of yours, I know you approve of my 
lengthening my furlough upon political accounts. The 
inclosed copy of a letter to Congress, and my official 
letter to Mr. Livingston, which I request him to communicate to you, will fully inform you of the reasons 
that urge me to post off to Madrid. From there it 
will be better for me to go to Paris; and in the 
month of June I will embark for America. Happy, 
ten times happy, shall I be in embracing my dear 
General, my father, my best friend, whom I love 
with an affection and a respect, which I too well feel 
not to know it is impossible to me to express it. 
</p><p>
In my letters to Congress you -will also see, that, 
independent of the plans I had been permitted to 
propose to you, in the execution of which we were 
to have an immense naval and land force, it had 
been at last obtained I should enter Canada. I had 
my hopes to embrace you at <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'><a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a></a>, or at least to 
be met there by a detachment from the army. The 
necessity of a diversion was the ground upon which 
we had obtained the Eling of Spain's consent. But 
now those schemes are over, and we must rejoice in 
the happiness of those you have rescued from the 
hands of British tyranny. 
</p><p>
Now, my dear General, that you are going to enjoy some ease and quiet, permit me to propose a 
plan to you, which might become greatly beneficial 
to the black part of mankind. Let us unite in purchasing a small estate, where we may try the experiment to free the negroes, and use them only as tenants. Such an example as yours might render it a 
general practice ; and if we succeed in America, I will 
cheerfully devote a part of my time to render the 
method fashionable in the West Indies. If it be a 
wild scheme, I had rather be mad this way, than to 
be thought wise in the other task. 
</p><p>
I am so anxious to hear from you, my dear General, and to let you hear from me, that I have sent 
my own servant with a vessel, upon which I have 
prevailed to set him ashore on the Maryland coast. 
Before I leave France, I hope I may receive your 
answers, and I will be directed where to find you on 
my arrival. Upon that intelligence I depend to regulate my course, and if you are at home, 1 shall 
steer for the Bay of Chesapeake. 
</p><p>
Your influence, my dear General, cannot be better 
employed than in inducing the people of America to 
strengthen their Federal Union. It is a work in 
which it behooves you to be concerned. I look upon 
it as a necessary measure. Depend upon it, my dear 
General, that European politics will be apt to create 
divisions among the States. Now is the time when 
the powers of Congress must be fixed, the boundaries 
determined, and articles of confederation revised. It 
is a work in which every well-wisher to America 
must desire to be concerned. It is the finishing 
stroke, that is wanting to the perfection of the temple of liberty. 
</p><p>
As to the army, my dear General, what will be its 
fate ? I hope their country will be grateful. Should 
the reverse be the case, I should indeed feel very 
unhappy. Will part of the army be kept together ? 
If not, I hope we shall not forfeit our noble titles of 
officers and soldiers in the American army ; so that, 
in case of danger, we may be called upon from every 
quarter, and reunite in the defence of a country, 
which the army has so effectually, so heroically served. I long to know what measures will be taken. 
Indeed, my dear General, I depend upon your goodness for a very minute letter, not only on public accounts, but also because I want to be acquainted 
with every one of your personal concerns. 
</p><p>
Adieu, adieu, my dear General Had the Spaniards 
got common sense, I could have dispensed with that 
cursed trip to Madrid; but I am called upon by a 
sense of my duty to America. I must go, and defer 
the happy voyage. My best, most affectionate respects wait upon Mrs. Washington. Now we are going to quarrel ; for I must urge your returning with 
me to France. Her accompanying you there, is the 
best way I know of to compromise the matter; and 
so she will make Madame de Lafayette and me perfectly happy. 
</p><p>
I request your Excellency will please to present 
my compliments to Tilghman, George, and all the 
family. Remember me to all my friends in the army. 
I am so hurried in sending the vessel away, that I 
will write to them by other opportunities. They know 
my love to them, and I have a grateful sense of their 
friendship. Be so kind, my dear General, as to remember me to your much-respected mother. Her 
happiness I heartily partake. Adieu, once more, my 
dear General. With every sentiment of love and respect, I am forever. 
</p><p>
Your most devoted and affectionate friend,

My dear General, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 2d instant is just come to hand. 
Mine of yesterday mentioned that the ships in York 
River had gone down. Inclosed is an account I receive of an engagement off the Capes. What disposition has been made for the internal protection 
of the Bay, I do not know. James River is still 
guarded, but we have not as yet received any letter 
from Count de Grasse, relative to his last movements. 
I hasten to communicate them, as your Excellency 
will probably think it safer to keep the troops at 
the Head of Elk until Count de Grasse returns. Indeed, unless the greatest part of your force is brought 
here, a small addition can do but little more than we 
effect. Lord Cornwallis will, in a little time, render 
himself very respectable. I ardently wish your whole 
army may soon be brought down to operate. 
</p><p>
AVe will make it our business to reconnoitre the 
enemy's works, and give you, on your arrival, the 
best description of them in our power. I expect the 
Governor this evening, and will again urge the necessity of providing what you have recommended. By 
a letter from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, I hear that two British 
frigates followed the French fleet, and returned after 
they had seen them out of the Capes, A spy says 
that two schooners, supposed to be French, have been 
seen landing, up York River. But we have nothing 
so certain as to insure your voyage, though it is probable that Count de Grasse will soon return, 
</p><p>
I beg leave to request, my dear General, that in 
your answer to the Marquis de St. Simon, you will 
express your admiration at the celerity of their landing, and your sense of their cheerfulness in submitting to the difficulties of the first movements. Indeed, I should be happy something might also be 
said to Congress on the subject. Your approbation 
of my conduct emboldens me to request that, as <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague met'>General Lincoln</a> will of course take command of the 
American part of your army, the division I shall have 
under him may be composed of the troops which 
have gone through the fatigues and dangers of the 
Virginian campaign. This will be the greatest reward of the services I may have rendered, as I confess I have the strongest attachment to those troops. 
With the highest respect, I have the honor to be. 
Your most obedient and humble servant,

My dear General, 
</p><p>
Great happiness is derived from friendship ; and I 
do particularly experience it in the attachment "which 
unites me to you. But friendship has its duties, and 
the man that likes you the best will be the forwardest in letting you know every thing where you can 
be concerned. 
</p><p>
When the enemy came to your house, many negroes deserted to them. This piece of news did not 
affect me much, as I little value those concerns. But 
you cannot conceive how unhappy I have been, to 
hear that Mr. Lund Washington went on board the 
enemy's vessels, and consented to give them provisions. This being done by the gentleman who, in 
some measure, represents you at your house, will certainly have a bad effect, and contrasts with spirited 
answers from some neighbours, that had their houses 
burnt accordingly. You will do what you think proper about it, my dear General; but, as your friend, 
it was my duty confidentially to mention the circumstances. 
</p><p>
With the help of some wagons and horses, we got 
in two days from the camp, near <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>, to this 
place. We halted yesterday, and having made a 
small bargain for a few shoes, are marching to <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a>. No official account from Phillips. But 
I am told they are removing stores from <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> 
and Petersburg. I am surprised nobody writes to 
me ; and hope soon to receive intelligence. 
</p><p>
Our men are in high spirits. Their honor having 
been interested in this affair, they have made it a 
point to come with us; and discontents, as well as 
desertion, are entirely out of fashion. Requesting my 
best respects to be presented to Mrs. Washington, 
and compliments to the family, I have the honor 
to be, with those sentiments which you know, my 
dear General, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant and friend,

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=laf" rel="me">Lafayette</a>.

P. S. The Chevalier writes me, that <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague'>Count De Rochambeau</a> is going to join you, so that both armies 
will cooperate, I had rather remain in Virginia than go to Carolina. This I mention, because orders are 
to come from <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>. But, if the detachment is to go more southerly, I will go there as fast as I can.

My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 15th has safely come to hand. 
I am going to give you an account of matters in 
this quarter. The greater part of the enemy are at 
York, which they do not as yet fortify ; but are very 
busy upon Gloucester Neck, where they have a pretty 
large corps under Colonel Dundas. They have at York a forty-four gun ship; frigates and vessels are 
scattered lower down. There is still a small garrison 
at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>. Should they intend to evacuate, at 
least, they are proceeding with alarming slowness. 
</p><p>
From the enemy's preparations I should infer that 
they are working for the protection of a fleet, and 
for a defence against another ; that in case they 
hold <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, the main body would he at York, 
and a detached corps upon Gloucester Neck, to protect the water hattery. Their fortifications are much 
contracted. From the enemy's cautious and partial 
movements, I should conclude their intelligence is not 
very good, and they wish to come at an explanation 
of my intentions and prospects. We have hitherto 
occupied the Forks of York River, thereby looking 
both ways. Some militia have prevented the enemy's 
parties from remaining any time at or near <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>, and false accounts have given them some alarms. 
Another body of militia, under Colonel Innes, has kept 
them pretty close in Gloucester town, and foraged in 
their vicinity. 
</p><p>
Upon the receipt of your orders, I wrote to the 
Governor that the intelligence of some plans of the 
enemy rendered it proper to have six hundred militia collected upon Blackwater. I wrote to General Gregory, near <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, that I had an account the 
enemy intended to push a detachment to Carolina, 
which would greatly defeat a scheme we had there. 
I have requested <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague met'>General Wayne</a> to move towards the 
southward, and be ready to cross James River at Westover. A battalion of light infantry, and our only one 
hundred dragoons, being in Gloucester county, I call 
them my van-guard, and shall take my quarters there 
for one or two days, while the troops are filing off 
towards James River. Our little army will conseqiiently again assemble upon the waters of the Chickahominy ; and should Jamestown Island be thought a 
good place for a junction, we shall be in a situation 
to form it, while we render it more difficult for the 
enemy to attempt a journey to Carolina. 
</p><p>
I shall to-day write to the gentleman. Nothing as 
yet has appeared. I will take measures that he may 
hear from me the moment he arrives ; taking whatever is in the rivers, and taking possession of the 
rivers themselves, while the main body defends the 
Bay; forming a junction of land forces at a convenient and safe point ; checking the enemy, but giving 
nothing to chance, until properly reenforced. This is 
the plan I mean to propose. Some days ago I sent 
Washington to contrive the Maryland new levies out 
of their State. These Marylanders will be five hundred ; Virginians, four hundred ; Pennsylvanians, six 
hundred ; light infantry, eight hundred and fifty ; 
dragoons, one hundred and twenty. Such is the Continental force ; and in the course of eight days the 
already called for militia will make three thousand. 
Every thing I put at the lowest estimate ; but we 
may depend upon two thousand five hundred Continentals, rank and file, exclusive of artillery, and three, 
or, if more are wanted, four thousand miUtia. Maryland would send six hundred militia at least. I have 
two hundred more dragoons and horses ready, and am 
waiting for accoutrements. 
</p><p>
There is such a confusion in affairs in this part of 
the world, that immense difficulties are found for a 
perfect formation of magazines. I have, however, 
strongly urged the matter. The moment I received 
your first letter, I sent Mr. McHenry to <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, 
who had long conversations about it with the Governor and Council. I have recommended such plans 
as might answer your purposes. This State has a 
large quantity of beef, corn, some flour, very little 
rum. Maryland ought to be early called upon. Water transportation will, I hope, ease our difficulties. 
Had we any thing like money, matters would go on 
very well. The dry season has rendered most of the 
mills useless. We have no clothing of any sort ; no 
heavy artillery in order. Some arms will be wanting, 
some horse accoutrements, and a great deal of ammunition. Nothing but your own entreaties may have a 
sufficient quantity of those articles transported to 
the head of the Bay. In the present state of affairs, 
my dear General, I hope you will come yourself to 
Virginia, and that, if the French army moves this 
way, I shall have, at least, the satisfaction of beholding you myself at the head of the combined armies ; 
in which case I beg leave to recommend you may 
be accompanied by the heads of departments, which 
will save you an immense deal of trouble. The men 
we have here would not be equal to the task of a 
campaign upon so large a scale. 
</p><p>
In two days I will write again to your Excellency, 
and keep you particularly and certainly informed, unless something is done the very moment, and it will 
probably be difficult. Lord Cornwallis must be attacked with a pretty great apparatus. But when a 
French fleet takes possession of the Bay and rivers, 
and we form a land force superior to his, that army 
must, soon or late, be forced to surrender, as we may 
get what reenforcements we please. Adieu, my dear 
General. I heartily thank you for having ordered me 
to remain in Virginia; and to your goodness to me 
I am owing the most beautiful prospect I may ever 
behold. With the most affectionate respect, I have 
the honor to be, my dear General, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,

My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
We arrived last night at this place, and were much 
favored by the weather in our recognizing of the 
Island, where, I confess, my feelings were different 
from what I had experienced when looking at these 
forts with a hopeful eye. I saw the fatal sentry, alluded to by Colonel Gouvion, on an upper battery of 
Jeffery's Hook. I also saw a small vessel playing 
off this Hook J but quite a trifling thing, without 
guns, and but two men on board. Nothing else on 
the river but the usual guards of Spiten Devil. 
</p><p>
As you have been pleased to consult me on the 
choice of an Adjutant-General, I will repeat, here, my 
dear General, that, though I have a claim upon General Hand, in every other point of view, his zeal, 
obedience, and love of discipline, have given me a 
very good opinion of him. Colonel Smith has been 
by me wholly employed in that line, and I can assure you that he will perfectly answer your purpose. 
</p><p>
Unless, however, you were to cast your eye on a 
man who, I think, would suit better than any other 
in the world. Hamilton is, I confess, the officer whom 
I should like to see in that station. With equal advantages, his services deserve from you the preference 
to any other. His knowledge of your opinions and 
intentions on military arrangements ; his love of discipline ; the superiority he would have over all the others, 
principally when both armies shall operate together; 
and his uncommon abilities, — are calculated to render 
him perfectly agreeable to you. His utility would 
be increased by this preferment ; and on other points 
he could render important services. An Adjutant-General ought always to be with the Commander-inchief. Hamilton should, therefore, remain in your 
family ; and his great industry in business would render him perfectly serviceable under all circumstances. 
On every public or private account, my dear General, I would advise you to take him. 
</p><p>
I shall, on my arrival at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, write you 
how those matters are going, upon which I build my 
private schemes. But I heartily wish that some account or other from Europe may enable you to act, 
this winter, on maritime operations. I hate the idea 
of being from you for so long a time ; but I think I 
ought not to stay idle. At all events I must return 
when your army takes the field. 
</p><p>
I flatter myself with the hope of meeting Mrs. 
Washington on the road. Adieu, my dear General. 
Most affectionately and respectfully yours, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=laf" rel="me">Lafayette</a>.
