Dear General, 
</p><p>
I arrived here the last night, and this morning 
had the honor of congratulating Monsieur le <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague met'>Compte De Rochambeau</a>, and Monsieur le <a href='/results.php?tla=cdt' rel='colleague met'>Chevalier De Ternay</a>, 
on their safe arrival in this harbour. The fleet consists of seven sail of the line ; â€” the Due de Burgogne, of eighty guns ; Le Neptune and Le Conquerant, of seventy-four; Le Jason, L'Eville, L' Ardent, 
and Le Provence, of sixty-four; Le Fantasque, hospital ship, of sixty-four, mounts forty guns; two frigates and two bombs, with about five thousand land forces and one thousand marines. 
</p><p>
The inhabitants appear disposed to treat our allies 
with much respect. The town is to be illuminated 
this evening, by a vote of the inhabitants. For myself, I am charmed with the officers. I have promised them every assistance in my power. Monsieur 
Rochambeau has desired me to publish an advertisement, inviting the inhabitants to bring small meats, 
vegetables, &c., to market, and that they shall receive 
hard money in payment. This the Count intended 
with a good view to our currency. I have told him it will have a different effect, and that even at a 
distance. I shall, therefore, only assure the farmers 
that they will receive a handsome price. I have the 
honor to be, with the greatest respect. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wih" rel="me">William Heath</a> 
</p><p>
P. S. Inclosed is copy of a resolve of the General Assembly of this State. I have ventured to grant a 
pardon to such deserters from <a href='/results.php?tla=chg' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Greene</a>'s regiment as return by the first of September next, and 
hope it will meet your Excellency's approbation, as 
some of the deserters are at a distance.

Dear General, 
</p><p>
Nothing of any considerable consequence has happened since I had the honor last to write you. The 
French troops are landed, and encamped in a fine 
situation, to the south-east of the town, and extend 
nearly across the Island. The troops make a good 
appearance. The legion, under the command of the 
<a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='colleague met'>Duke De Lauzun</a> (the officer who took Senegal the 
last year), is as fine a corps as ever I saw. It is 
about six hundred strong. The officers express, the 
highest satisfaction at the treatment they meet with. 
The markets are become very good, and great regularity is preserved. In short, in every respect, I may 
say, hitherto every thing appears agreeable and satisfactory. 
</p><p>
I have this moment received a letter from a gentleman in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, advising that a vessel is just sent 
into that port, which was one of a fleet of thirty-six sail from Ireland for <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. I have given information of it to the General and Admiral, and, I apprehend, some of the fleet will go out on a cruise. The 
Hermione has been cruising for these three or four 
days. 1 have the honor to he, with the greatest respect.

Dear General, 
</p><p>
This afternoon, fifteen or sixteen British ships of 
war have made their appearance off this harbour, 
to the eastward of Block Island. More than half of 
them, I think, are ships of the line. From appearances, at sun-setting, they intended to come to, under 
Block Island. 
</p><p>
Admiral Graves has probably joined Admiral Arbuthnot, and their design is to block up the fleet of 
Monsieur le <a href='/results.php?tla=cdt' rel='colleague met'>Chevalier De Ternay</a>, and, if possible, intercept the expected second division of the French 
fleet. I thought it my duty to give immediate notice to your Excellency, and beg leave to submit the 
expediency of some small cruisers being immediately 
sent from the Delaware, to cruise for the French 
fleet, and direct them to a place of safety. I have 
written to the Council and Navy Board, at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, 
and proposed the same, in case the fleet should take 
the eastern coast. I have mentioned this to his 
Excellency, <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague met'>General Rochambeau</a>, who was so much 
pleased with it, that he requested I would write, for 
that he should leave it wholly with me. 
</p><p>
This night is spent in mounting a number of guns 
at advantageous posts at the entrance of the harbour, 
to make a cross-fire with the ships, &c. There are 
with the army a number of good engineers, and an 
exceedingly fine corps of artillery, with a numerous 
train of field-artillery, and some battering cannon. 
</p><p>
I had ordered <a href='/results.php?tla=chg' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Greene</a>'s regiment to march 
immediately for the main army, but, under present 
appearances, I think it best to detain them a few 
days. I have ordered them to take post at Butts's 
Hill, at the north end of the Island, to secure the 
communication. This has given much satisfaction to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague met'>General Rochambeau</a>, and I hope will meet with your 
Excellency's approbation. I have the honor to be, 
with the greatest respect.

Dear General, 
</p><p>
Nothing of consequence has transpired since I had 
the honor last to write to you. The British fleet continue off the harbour, sometimes at anchor, at other 
times cruising. Yesterday afternoon I counted twelve 
sail, principally large ships, at anchor, and four sail 
of frigates and sloops of war, cruising ; the former 
to the east of Block Island, the latter between that 
place and Point Judith. Their intention, undoubtedly, is to block up the squadron under the command 
of <a href='/results.php?tla=cdt' rel='colleague met'>Monsieur De Ternay</a>, intercept the expected second 
division of our allies, cut ofi all supplies by water, 
and impede the operations of the campaign; and, I 
fear, without the arrival of a further naval force, they 
have laid an embargo on the squadron now here. 
</p><p>
The <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> arrived here the last 
evening. Universal joy was diffused throughout the 
camp. I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wih" rel="me">William Heath</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. The troops, which put into <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, arrived here last night, by the way of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>. Inclosed is a return of the platform plank, at this place, belonging to the public. 
</p><p>
Upon the appearance of the British fleet, standing 
in for this place, I ordered <a href='/results.php?tla=chg' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Greene</a>'s regiment, 
and the recruits for the Rhode Island line, who were 
under orders to march to the army, to take post at 
Howland's and Bristol Ferry, Butts's Hill, and the 
dock where our flat-bottomed boats lie. This gave 
great satisfaction to <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague met'>Count Rochambeau</a>, who, under 
present appearances, is very earnest to have them 
remain a few days longer, for the security of the 
ferry, flat-bottomed boats, &c. The <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis</a> is of the 
same opinion.

Dear General, 
</p><p>
This afternoon the intelligence, contained in the 
inclosed, came to hand; upon which <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague met'>General Rochambeau</a> immediately made a requisition for two thousand militia. I have called upon Governor Greene 
for fifteen hundred men, and on Brigadier Godfrey, 
of the brigade in the county of Bristol, Massachusetts, for eight hundred. <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague met'>General Rochambeau</a> says 
that in six days he shall be safe, without the assistance of the militia. I have written to the Council of 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, that, if their militia for reenforcing the army 
for three months are detached, and not marched, those 
from the counties of Suffolk, <a href='/results.php?city=plymouth' rel='city'>Plymouth</a>, Barnstable, 
and Bristol, may march to Tiverton, which will not 
be greatly out of their way to the place of their 
destination ; and, should Sir Henry Clinton be coming 
this way, they may answer a good purpose. It will also be less burdensome to the militia, who, after so 
great drafts as have been lately made, will think an 
additional one, in the midst of harvest, almost insurmountable. 
</p><p>
If Sir Henry should not come this way, there shall 
be no needless detention of any of the levies. The 
<a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> is in sentiment with me in this 
particular. I hope it will not be disagreeable to your 
Excellency. It cannot, at any rate, make a detention 
of more than five or six days. It is with pain that 
I call on the militia to turn out; but <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague met'>General Rochambeau</a> is so pressing in his application, that he 
cannot be denied. Indeed, if Sir Henry, Clinton has 
a land force to spare from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, adequate to 
the enterprise, I think he never had a more inviting 
object than the present situation and circumstances 
of things offer him here. I have the honor to be, 
with the greatest respect. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wih" rel="me">William Heath</a>

P. S. The article of bread will be obtained, I fear, 
with much difficulty, for the troops that will assemble here.

Dear General, 
</p><p>
By a variety of intelligence, from various quarters 
(all which agree) the enemy intend to make an attempt on the fleet and army of our great and good 
ally at this place. I have called for the neighbouring militia of Massachusetts, and the whole of this 
State. I have also requested the Council of Massachusetts to send all the three months' militia this 
way, except those of the counties of Hampshire and 
Berkshire. Whilst these are collecting, with the advice of the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis</a>, I shall call on <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague met'>Governor Trumbull</a> to send one thousand militia from the nearest 
towns of Connecticut, to rendezvous at Greenwich. I 
have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, 
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wih" rel="me">William Heath</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. The fleet off the harbour, from their first 
appearance, have kept nearly the same station, to the 
eastward of Block Island.

Dear General, 
</p><p>
The inclosed this moment came to hand, which I 
beg to submit to your Excellency. This wall be forwarded at gun-firing in the morning. I detain the 
express, and wish your answer, if agreeable, by the 
return of the bearer, that Colonel Hull may have notice as early as possible. Colonel Thomas mentioned 
the matter in a letter to me yesterdays but, as it did not come from Colonel Hull, I took no notice of 
it. If the plan should be approved, it will probably 
be necessary to furnish the militia with some ammunition. As to burning the houses at Morrisania, although they are a nest for the nefarious enemy, yet, 
as many of them belong to persons friendly to our 
cause, who have been obliged to abandon their habitations, it may not only be impolitic but injurious to 
do it. However, I will advise as your Excellency 
may think fit to direct. 
</p><p>
I must confess, I do not well like the militia having so much to do in the matter. Notifying and 
collecting men from three regiments, among whom 
many disaffected persons reside, and upon the very 
line of the enemy, is very likely to give air of the 
design; and a knowledge of the design will tend to 
blow the whole. I have the honor to be, with the 
greatest respect, 
</p><p>

Dear General, 
I arrived here yesterday afternoon, found the General Assembly sitting, and presented your letter to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague met'>Governor Trumbull</a>, together with a representation, 
containing the spirit of my instructions. This morning I attended the Governor, Council, and the Representatives in the Council Chamber, when the papers were read, and I had an opportunity to speak on 
them. The papers were committed to a Committee 
of both Houses. I have the pleasure to acquaint 
your Excellency, they had that attention paid to 
them which their interesting importance required. A 
resolution has passed to send on immediately one 
hundred and sixty head of beef-cattle, which, it is 
supposed, will amount to five thousand rations per 
day, to the 1st of June. One thousand barrels of 
salted meat are also to be forwarded with the greatest 
despatch, with a quantity of rum. There are about 
a thousand barrels of salted meat deposited in this 
town ; it has been repacked, and is well stored. I 
shall endeavour, in the morning, to obtain a return 
of the whole quantity which has been procured in 
this State. I believe an accurate return has never 
been given in of the whole. 
</p><p>
An addition is made to the Committee of both 
Houses, who are to proceed to the consideration of 
the great supply for the campaign. Their resolutions 
on this head I think will equal your expectations. I 
have sent an express to Mr. Phelps, to forward all 
the beef-cattle he can command, without a moment's 
delay. I shall proceed to Rhode Island to-morrow, 
I have the honor to be, &c.,

Dear General, 
</p><p>
In consequence of intelligence, received yesterday 
morning from the westward, that the fleet of transports, which were lately in the Sound, and supposed 
to be coming this way, had sailed towards <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, 
General Count de Rochamheau expressed his pleasure 
that the militia, which had arrived and were on their 
march for his support, except those detached for 
three months, should return home, I immediately 
communicated it to them. 
</p><p>
Nothing could have exceeded the spirit which has 
been shown by the militia on this occasion. The hint 
given by the Count, that he had come to their support, but at that moment stood in need of theirs, instantly fired every breast, and old and young, of all 
denominations, were determined to rush into the field 
to his aid. The Count expresses the highest pleasure 
and satisfaction, as do all the officers on this occasion. The Count wishes to detain the three months' 
men a few days, to secure the pass at Howland's 
Ferry. I have the honor to be, with the greatest 
respect.
