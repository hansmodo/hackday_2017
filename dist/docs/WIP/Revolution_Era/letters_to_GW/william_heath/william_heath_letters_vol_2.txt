DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
We find, by the destination of the prisoners of 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>'s army to this neighbourhood, a 
wide and difficult field opens to us. To provide quarters, provisions, fuel, &c., for five or six thousand 
men, will be no small task. The Assembly suppose 
them to be under my direction, and have advised 
that they be placed in the barracks on Prospect and 
Winter Hills, <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>, and Sewell's Point- and, 
indeed, I do not see where else they can be quartered, if they are to remain together, and near this 
place. I have applied for a thousand or twelve hundred men for guards and am determined, on the one hand, to treat them with politeness and humanity, 
and, on the other, with precaution and strict order. 
But I must entreat your Excellency's endeavours to 
facilitate their removal as soon as possible, as their 
continuance, for any considerable time, will greatly 
distress the inhabitants, both as to provisions and 
fuel, especially the latter. 
</p><p>
Wood is now twelve or fourteen dollars per cord, 
on the wharves, and the inhabitants cannot obtain a 
supply at that price. So many of the coasters are 
taken by the enemy's cruisers, that they are become 
very unwilling to run the risk of falling into their 
hands. I submit to your Excellency the propriety 
and expediency of obtaining a protection from Lord 
Howe for such a number of vessels as may be 
thought necessary to supply the prisoners, from the 
eastern country. If some such method cannot be devised, I do not at present see how it can be obtained. I have wrote to Congress on the subject, and 
would also request your Excellency's direction as 
soon as may be convenient .to you. As soon as the 
disposition of, and regulations for, the prisoners are 
made, I will transmit them to your Excellency. It 
will be necessary, if practicable, to convey a quantity 
of flour this way. I have the honor to be, with 
great respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's obedient servant, 
</p><p>

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Yesterday, at half past nine o clock, A. M., I received your orders to march for <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>. At twelve, the division began their march ; marched fifteen miles,, 
and halted ; at three, this morning, pursued the march, 
and reached <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> at half past three, P. M. On 
my arrival, I found General Howe had sent off his 
cannon, and his division was filing off towards the 
Highlands. The enemy appeared to be advancing in 
force near the New Bridge. I threw my division in 
the rear, sent Patterson's to the Gorge, and Nixon's, 
Parsons's, and Huntington's to these heights, not being able to get further with the baggage. 
</p><p>
Early in the morning I shall send on the baggage 
into the Highlands, and follow with the troops, giving the enemy an offer of attacking us in rear, if 
they choose it. Sir Henry Clinton is once more disappointed, after marching all day on my flank. Fortutely, I have formed a junction. Since I arrived 
here, I have been honored with yours of yesterday, 
inclosing one to General Glover. Immediately on the 
receipt of your letter, I sent off an express to hurry 
his brigade on, with all possible expedition, by the 
shortest and best route ; and directed the express to 
take fresh horses. I &lt; shall critically observe the motions of the enemy in the morning. I have the 
honor to be, with the greatest respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I was honored with your favor of yesterday, on 
my way from <a href='/results.php?city=bald hill' rel='city'>Bald Hill</a> to this place. I had before 
ordered Parsons's brigade to encamp near Robinson's ; 
Huntington's, near the place where Parsons's encamped 
before they left this place; Patterson's, between that 
place and Danforth's ; Nixon's, at the gorge of the 
mountains. Glover's is not yet arrived. May I be 
permitted to request that, when it does, it may be 
attached to General Howe's division? 
</p><p>
By intelligence received since I had the honor to 
write in the morning, I learn that the enemy's advanced sentinels and videttes were posted, the last 
night, on the New Bridge. They appear to advance 
with the greatest caution. I think Major-General 
Howe was very fortunate in making his retreat the 
instant he did. Had he remained, I think he would 
have been Burgoyned; his intelligence being good, 
he escaped it. I have taken measures to obtain intelligence from every quarter on this side the river. 
Such as I receive shall be transmitted. I have ordered the light-horse to the left, and am determined 
to harass the enemy, if possible. I have the honor 
to be, with the greatest respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
In the following I shall give your Excellency a 
state of facts relative to the late capture of Lieutenant-Colonel Thompson and part of his detachment, on 
the lines of this post, on the 3d instant. 
</p><p>
Lieutenant-Colonel Thompson was at that time at 
Young's, near the White Plains ; his detachment consisted of five companies. Captain Watson, of the 
third regiment, with his company, was at Young's 
house with the Lieutenant-Colonel. Captain Roberts, 
of the fifteenth regiment, and Captain Stoddard, of the 
first regiment, were on his right ; their greatest distance about two miles. On his left were Captain Lieutenant Farley, of the ninth regiment, and Captain 
Cooper, of the fourteenth regiment ; their extreme 
distance rather greater than the companies on the 
right. Pickets were advanced from each. 
</p><p>
On the morning of the 3d instant, about nine-o'clock, the Lieutenant-Colonel was informed that a 
body of the enemy's horse were advancing, and, at 
that time, about two and a half miles distant. Apprehending the enemy to be horse only, he determined to remain where he was, and sent to the several 
companies to join him. Soon after this, the enemy 
attacked his picket (a sergeant and eight men), who 
fired on the horse, which checked them. On which 
the picket attempted to join the body, but were over 
taken by the horse, one or two of them wounded, 
and the whole taken prisoners. Not long after, the 
enemy's horse appeared in sight of the house. The 
Lieutenant-Colonel had been joined by Captain Roberts's company, who formed on the right. The enemy's horse halted at a distance, and discharged their 
rifles. Soon after, the infantry appeared, advancing to 
the front and right flank of our troops, who were now 
joined by Captain-Lieutenant Farley's company on 
the left; Captain Stoddard and Captain Cooper coming up, one on the right, the other on the left. Our troops preserved their order, and did not fire until 
some time after the enemy began. When they received orders to fire, the enemy immediately scattered, 
availing themselves of trees and the ground, of which, 
it must be acknowledged, they very judiciously took 
the advantage, springing from one tree and place to 
another, and constantly gaining ground ; their fire being directed both against the front and flank of our troops, and a number being killed and wounded, 
they broke, some retreating up the road, others into 
the house, from the doors and windows of which 
they fired on the enemy. 
</p><p>
At this time, Captain Stoddard and Captain Cooper 
came up ; the former gave the enemy two or three fires, but, the distance being great, probably did little 
or no execution. The horse, at this instant, were 
very active, and overtook several of our men who 
were making their escape. It is said our troops discovered great bravery, and fought well for about fif 
teen minutes, when the Lieutenant-Colonel was compelled to surrender. We had fourteen men killed on 
the spot, including Captain Roberts ; and seventeen 
wounded, three of whom are since dead. Lieutenant Colonel Thompson, of Marshall's, Captain Watson, of 
Greaton's, Captain Farley, of Wesson's, Lieutenant Burley, of Tupper's, Lieutenant Maynard, of Greaton's, 
Ensign Fowler, of Nixon's, and Ensign Bradley, of 
Sheppard's, with ninety non-commissioned officers and 
soldiers, were taken prisoners ; nine of whom, who 
were wounded, were left by the enemy at a house 
some miles down the road. 
</p><p>
The enemy set fire to Young's house, and soon re 
tired, leaving two dead, and carrying off their wounded; among whom was a Captain of grenadiers, wound
in the hip, and a Lieutenant of the infantry, in 
the thigh. Our troops immediately after went on to 
the ground, and buried the dead. The enemy's force 
is said to have consisted of about sixty horse, 
</p><p>
and forty of the refugees, and between four hundred 
and five hundred infantry, detached from different 
corps, including a part or the whole of the grenadier 
and light infantry companies of the guards. Colonel Enimerick was out as a volunteer, on foot, with his 
rifle, and was very active. Colonel Morton, of the 
guards, commanded the whole, and Colonel Delany 
was with the refugee horse. 
</p><p>
By two deserters, who left Fort Washington a few days since, I am informed that the enemy had 
at that place about one hundred and fifty sleighs, 
when they came away. The sleighs were employed 
in hauling wood. I am just now informed, by Colonel Badlam, who is on the advanced post, that a body of 
three hundred of the enemy's horse (probably part of 
these militia), and the seventh British regiment, came 
the last Monday from -Long Island to Westchester on 
the ice, where they now are. Whether their taking post at Westchester is with offensive or defensive 
views, is uncertain; probably both. I have written 
Brigadier-General Poor to hold his brigade in the 
most perfect readiness for action, have patrols on the 
ice of Hudson's River, against <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>, and from the 
guard at , down towards Fort Montgomery. 
</p><p>
Every precaution is in exercise; and I trust the enemy will be disappointed, should they attempt to surprise us. I have the honor to be, with the greatest 
respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I was, some time since, honored with yours of the 
28th ultimo, respecting clothing for the recruits, and, 
this morning, with that of the 17th instant. 
</p><p>
Several officers have already come from <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a> 
on the recruiting service, and others are on the road. 
I wish they may be successful, but am at a loss, from 
the tenor of your Excellency's letter, to determine what bounty the recruits, raised by this State (Massachusetts), are to receive. It seems the Continental 
bounty, after the act of March, <a href='/results.php?year=1779'>1779</a>, w T as to be two 
hundred dollars. The General Assembly of this State, 
on the 30th of September last, passed the following 
resolution, namely ; " Resolved, that a bounty of 
three hundred dollars, in addition to the bounty and 
subsistence-money allowed by Congress, be paid to 
each non-commissioned officer and soldier, who has or 
shall enlist as one of this State's quota of the Continental army, during the continuance of the present 
war between the United States of America and Great 
Britain." This bounty appears to be intended over 
and above the Continental bounty, and extended to 
all the soldiers belonging to their quota of the army 
enlisted at any preceding period. I purpose, to-morrow, to lay the matter before the Assembly, who, it 
is probable, may have received some particular instruction on the subject, or, at least, that they may 
conduct as they think proper. 
On Tuesday last two privateers, belonging to Salem (the Franklin and Jack), sent into that port a 
large letter-of-niarcjue ship, having on board one thou 
sand barrels of pork and beef, seven hundred and 
fifty barrels of flour, eight hundred firkins of butter, 
and dry goods to the amount of fifteen thousand 
pounds. 
</p><p>
A Dr. Apedale, lately come from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and, some time before, from Canada to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, reports, that before he left Canada, it was said 
that about one thousand regulars and Tories, with as 
many Indians as could be collected and would join 
them, were to make an excursion on our frontiers on 
the Mohawk River, as soon as the season was suit 
able, in two divisions, under the command of John 
son and Butler; and that Lieutenant-Colonel Stacy 
was held a prisoner in Canada with a view to be 
exchanged for Johnson or Butler, should either of 
them happen to be taken. How much credit is to 
be given to this report, your Excellency may be able 
best to determine. 
</p><p>
I have the happiness to forward this by Major-General the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>, who arrived at 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> on the 28th instant, where he was received 
with every demonstration of joy. I have the honor 
to be, with the greatest respect,

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Since I had the honor of writing you on the 
28th instant, I have been endeavouring to obtain intelligence of the situation of the enemy at <a href='/results.php?city=halifax' rel='city'>Halifax</a>, 
&c. I learn that their naval force, not long since, 
consisted of one ship of seventy-four guns, one of 
twenty, one sloop of war, and two or three privateers. 
General McLean, a vigilant officer, commands the 
land forces, which are said to consist of six regiments, each about five hundred strong, four of which 
are at <a href='/results.php?city=halifax' rel='city'>Halifax</a>, the other two at different posts in 
the province. The militia of the town is said to be 
about eleven hundred. 
</p><p>
From a gentleman, of the strictest probity and 
warmest attachment to our cause, and who has made upwards of forty voyages from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> to <a href='/results.php?city=halifax' rel='city'>Halifax</a>, I 
learn that, when he was last there, which was before 
the commencement of hostilities, the enemy had a 
strong work on George's Island, at the entrance of 
the harbour; another about half a mile from the centre of the town, and about the same distance from 
George's Island ; a battery on the east side, about 
two miles below, or without George's Island ; a battery also at the town ; the ship-yard and Arsenal 
about a mile above the town, where there is another 
battery. The basin begins just above the ship-yard, 
and extends up about six miles northerly, from east 
to west. Between three and four miles above the 
Navy Yard was a block-house, at a place called the 
Narrows. The citadel is on a high hill, back of the 
town, at the distance of a quarter of a mile, and 
commands both the town and harbour. The basin is 
very spacious, capable, perhaps, to contain the whole 
navy of England. 
</p><p>
I have just called at the Honorable Mr. Bowdoin s. 
He has preserved a chart of the harbour of <a href='/results.php?city=halifax' rel='city'>Halifax</a>; has 
made several inquiries of the gentleman I mentioned 
in my last, who, I believe, without the least suspicion, 
answered every one of them. Mr. Bowdoin is now 
making some minutes explanatory of the chart and 
the information he has received from the gentleman. 
The chart and minutes he will forward by to-morrow's 
or the next post, to your Excellency. I am looking 
out for the best pilots, and believe shall find a number of very good ones. 
</p><p>
By the last accounts from Penobscot, there were 
appearances of an evacuation, or the removal of a 
part of the ordnance and troops to some other place. 
The garrison at Penobscot, at present, is by no means 
strong, at most not more than four hundred. Captain 
La Touche, of his most Christian Majesty's frigate the 
Hermione, in his late cruise, ran into Penobscot Bay, 
where he lay for some time, made several signals, 
and took a plan of the works, which he has forwarded to the Minister at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. It is said the 
appearance of this frigate in the Bay has caused a 
great consternation and alarm. 
</p><p>
I have just established a correspondence with General Wadsworth, who commands the troops in the 
eastern parts of this State, and with Colonel Allen, 
at Machias, and have requested every piece of intelligence they may be able to obtain, either from Halifax or Penobscot. 
</p><p>
The last night,, I received most alarming accounts 
from <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, of the scantiness of provisions and 
rum at that post, A quantity of the latter is on the 
road to Springfield. Since I have been here, I have 
been endeavouring to promote the recruiting service 
all in my power; but the Court Unfortunately stop 
ping the towns bounties, in the settlements with the 
soldiers, has almost totally prevented enlistments. 
The new Assembly convened this day. I apprehend 
they will go any lengths that are recommended, to 
complete their quota, even by drafts, if they cannot 
be otherwise obtained. I wish to know your Excellency's pleasure, whether I shall urge it, arid how 
far. 
</p><p>
The issuing Commissary here informs me that there 
are upwards of nine hundred quintals of dry codfish 
in the stores, a considerable part of which will be 
in danger of spoiling in the course of the summer, if 
it is not issued. What pity it is that the army, in 
their present straits, cannot be relieved by it. 
</p><p>
A report prevails, to-day, that the Trumbull frigate 
and a French ship have re-taken the Iris, formerly 
the Hancock frigate, off Sandy Hook. I hope it will 
be confirmed. I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,
