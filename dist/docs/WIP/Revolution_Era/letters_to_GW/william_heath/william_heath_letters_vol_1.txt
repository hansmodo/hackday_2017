DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The kst night the fire-ships and row-galleys made 
an attempt upon the enemy's ships, which lay at anchor up the river. The fire-ships were well conducted ; the armed schooner was grappled and burnt ; 
the Phoenix was grappled for about ten minutes, but 
got herself clear. The Lady <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> galley and 
Independence, were conducted with great judgment 
and bravery. I wish I could say that the other galleys did any thing at all. The Phoenix either slipt 
or cut her cable ; the Rose was left alone, and it is 
thought might have been taken. I was an eye-witness to the whole; and, from the confusion which was 
apparent, I am confident that if an attempt should 
be made on the fleet below, and but one or two 
ships set on fire, their confusion would be beyond 
description. 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to acquaint your Excellency, that <a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='colleague'>General Mifflin</a> has about five hundred men at 
a moment's notice, to aid you in case of need. They were the last evening drawn out, when I reviewed 
them. They are of Colonels Slice's and Magaw's regiments, and the best disciplined of any troops that 
I have yet seen in the army. I shall, this evening, or to-morrow, send a return of the troops at this 
post. We are pushing our works with all diligence. I have the honor to be, with great respect, 
Your Excellency's humble servant,

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Early this morning, the Phoenix man-of-war, Rose 
frigate, and the two tenders, came to sail, and stood 
down the river, keeping close under the east shore, 
in order to avoid the fire of our cannon. But, not 
withstanding this precaution, the Phoenix was thrice 
hulled, by our shot from Mount <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>, -and one 
of the tenders once. The Rose was hulled once by 
a shot from Burdett's Ferry. They kept their men 
close, otherwise some of them would have been 
picked down by a party of riflemen, who were posted 
on the bank. They fired grape-shot as they passed, 
but did no damage save to one tent. We hope to 
hear that your batteries have done the work for 
some of them. 
</p><p>
We shall recover some swivel-guns, gun-barrels, 
shot, &c., out of the wreck of the tender, which was 
burnt the other night, the particulars of which shall 
be transmitted to your Excellency as soon as I can 
obtain them. <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>General Clinton</a> has about fourteen 
hundred men already come in, but their quarters are 
so scattered, that it will be almost impossible to collect them suddenly, if occasion should require it. If 
there are any spare tents, I earnestly beg for them, 
if it were but for one regiment. <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>General Clinton</a> 
has orders from the Convention of the State of New 
York to purchase ten thousand feet of boards, for 
erecting sheds, &c., but it is uncertain when we shall 
have them. I shall, to-morrow, send for six or seven 
hundred of tools, being able to employ that number more than we have at present. The more I view this post, the more I am convinced of its importance. 
</p><p>
The ships have now tried the practicability of passing  our works. They have explored every part of 
the shore, as far as they have gone up the river, 
and sounded the river in almost every place. Should 
the ships rejoin the fleet without receiving much da 
mage, I think Howe will be emboldened to attempt 
an attack somewhere above this place, thinking 
that there may be a greater probability of succeeding  here, than in the face of so many and strong 
works as have been erected in and around the city. 
However, should his inclination lead him this way, 
nature has done much for us, and we shall, as fast 
as possible, add the strength of art. Our men are in 
good health and spirits, and I dare say will give 
them a warm reception. 
</p><p>
I should be glad to have the carriages for the 
four-pounders sent forward the moment they are 
done, as we have not as yet a single cannon mounted beyond Mount <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>. I have just now received your Excellency's commands to inquire into 
the cause of the inactivity of some of the row-galleys, in the late attack on the enemy's ships ; but 
as the galleys have all left this post, and fallen down 
to the city, I must beg your Excellency to excuse 
me from that service. I have the honor to be, with 
the greatest respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most humble servant,

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have just received the honor of yours of the 14th and 17th instant. 
</p><p>
Yesterday morning, about sunrise, our troops, in 
three divisions, arrived in the neighbourhood of Fort 
Independence ; the right division by the <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> 
Road, the centre by Stephen Ward s, and the left 
by East Chester. Upon our approach, the enemy 
fled to Fort Independence, leaving fifteen muskets at 
one place, and ten at another, besides blankets, &c. 
</p><p>
I summoned the fort to surrender. I have taken 
the liberty to inclose a copy. The answer to the 
summons was verbal, and in substance, that, as the 
Americans were excepted, they, although Britons, had 
no answer to return. They afterwards fired a number of cannon at us from the fort, which we returned. We are just informed, by two deserters from 
the fort, that the garrison consists of about three 
hundred and fifty men ; that the last night they had 
.a twelve-pounder sent to the fort, and that General 
Agnew moved up yesterday with his brigade^ and 
took post at the northernmost woody hill, between 
Fort <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=kings bridge' rel='city'>King's Bridge</a>, and about twelve 
hundred Hessians near the fort. Between two and three hundred Hessians are in the houses just over the bridge. 
</p><p>
We took one light-horseman, with horse complete, 
and one soldier, and have had one man killed by a 
cannon ball this day. To-morrow we intend to make 
an attack upon the Hessians at the bridge, if they 
should not be reenforced. They have two pieces of 
cannon well posted. Our troops are all militia, and, 
although perhaps as good as any militia, yet they 
are not disciplined. Our numbers are about three 
thousand, but they begin to go home already. The 
want of covering, the weather cold, &c., causes many 
complaints. Much will depend on the success of our attack to-morrow. 
</p><p>
I have approved of the sentence of the court-martial on Strang, and have ordered him to be executed on Wednesday next at eleven o clock before noon. 
</p><p>
A Hessian Major, son of one of their Generals, commands Fort Independence. I have the honor to be, very respectfully, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most humble servant,

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have just received the honor of yours of the 27th instant. The last evening we moved back from 
the neighbourhood of <a href='/results.php?city=kings bridge' rel='city'>King's Bridge</a> ; <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a>'s troops to Dobbs's Ferry and Tarrytown ; the 
Connecticut militia, to New Rochelle; and the York militia, towards White Plains. This remove was for the following reasons. 
</p><p>
We could not reduce the fort by cannonade, being destitute of proper artillery. As to taking of it by storm, it is surrounded by chevaux-de-frise, hooked together; yet I think it might have been taken, if we had been so happy as to have had a few Continental 
troops. But our army is all militia, and your Excellency well knows that they are by no means adequate to such an enterprise. The houses in the vicinity are so scattered, that the troops were every 
hour exposed to surprise, if the enemy should make 
a sudden sally, or continually harassed by keeping 
out large guards exposed, in the open air, to the in 
clemency of the season ; and, as there remained little 
or no probability of success, either against the fort 
or island, and the principal object now being to collect the forage, protect the well-disposed, and curb 
the disaffected, the Generals who were present in 
council, namely, Lincoln, Wooster, Ten Broeck, and 
Scott, were unanimously of opinion that, as the be 
fore-mentioned purposes could be as well answered 
by the troops falling back, as remaining so near the 
fort, and many inconveniences avoided, the manoeuvre 
was advisable; and it was accordingly made. 
We have collected considerable quantities of forage. 
At present, it is stored at Kingstreet and Wright's 
Mills. Large quantities are still uncollected. 
</p><p>
The person who lately brought me intelligence from 
the city has,, since I wrote your Excellency, mentioned one piece which, if true (and he thinks it is), 
is very extraordinary, namely, that General Carletons 
army formed a junction with Howe's before the army 
went into the Jerseys ; and that a small garrison 
only is left at Quebec. It is reported here, and 
gains credit, that the enemy have burnt Newport and 
left Rhode Island. 
</p><p>
Daniel Strang was executed at <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>, on Monday last, agreeably to his sentence. The Tories gave out that we dare not hang him. I have the honor to be 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most humble servant, 
</p><p>
W. HEATH.

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The last evening I received the honor of yours of 
the 3d and 4th instant, which has given me great 
pain. Perhaps I may venture to say, that no officer 
is more attentive to orders or more anxious to carry 
them into execution, than I am. When I received your Excellency's orders to march towards King's 
Bridge, nothing could be more agreeable than the 
manoeuvre ; but I cannot say the taking the command of a body of troops, entirely militia, was so. 
It was indeed far otherwise. Before I received your 
Excellency's orders to move myself towards King's 
Bridge, upon the application of the Committee of the 
State of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, I appointed General Parsons to 
take the command of the troops destined for their 
secret expedition. He gave me his answer in writing , accepting the command in obedience to orders, 
but, at the same time, desiring that his answer might 
remain in writing, that it might appear, that although 
he cheerfully obeyed orders, yet that he considered 
the taking the command of a body of militia for 
such an attempt, to use his own words, as a sacrifice 
of his character. By your Excellency's orders to me, 
his has escaped, but it seems mine is to receive the 
fatal stab. As I feel myself much interested in this 
matter, your Excellency will bear with me to be a little explicit, and to recapitulate the whole expedition. 
Upon my arrival before the fort, I summoned the garrison to surrender, as your Excellency is sensible 
is the practice on the first investing of a place ; and 
this in particular I did at the motion of a gentleman 
before I left <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>, as it was supposed the garrison consisted of Hessian troops ; and, from some preceding circumstances, it might answer a very good 
purpose. And although some of the enemy may 
laugh at a fort being summoned, and not taken, I 
believe they will scarcely publish the summons. After this I called a Council of War, as I did in every 
instance of importance during our continuance before 
the fort, and in every one of them the Council were 
unanimous. I have taken the liberty to inclose one of them, to wit, that preceding our remove, by which 
your Excellency will perceive that the landing of 
Lord Percy, to surround us, was not so much as mentioned. 
</p><p>
The facts were briefly these. The troops were 
scattered in a circle of more than eight miles. We had tried to hut them, but the rain, preceding our 
remove, had driven four of <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a>'s regiments from their huts, with the loss of nearly all 
their ammunition. The enemy had sallied, early one 
morning, and surprised one of our out-guards. The 
regiment nearest the place were struck with a panic, 
and had quitted their quarters, leaving their baggage. 
The troops were so scattered as not to be collected 
in less than two or three hours ; in which case, those 
who were quartered within cannon shot of the fort, 
as was the case, would be entirely cut to pieces be 
fore they could be supported. A diffidence and uneasiness were discovered in even the bravest officers. 
In such a situation, and a universal desire to get 
more advantageously quartered, every officer objected 
to a storm, as they apprehended the militia inadequate to such an enterprise. Every purpose, it was 
supposed, would be, and has been ^answered, by the 
troops in their present cantonment, except that of 
reducing the fort. 
</p><p>
lS T o officer could be more anxious to effect some 
thing to purpose than I have been during the expedition here, or more harassed, perplexed, and fatigued, 
with an undisciplined militia ; and if, after all this, 
and having taken every step agreeably to the result 
in the Councils of War, I am to be censured, it is 
truly discouraging. However, if there has been error 
in judgment, we have all been in the dark, except 
some who may be distinguished for their sense and judgment. But, if I am not mistaken in them, their 
military propositions, in some instances, have been as 
laughable as my summons may be. It is not uncommon for those unacquainted with military operations 
to expect as much from undisciplined as disciplined 
troops, if their numbers are considerable ; but, in our 
present case, the officers of artillery, one and all, in 
formed me, that they could not be accountable for 
the artillery, if they were to be covered with militia; 
and every officer, acquainted with service, was wishing 
for a few Continental troops, when our conquest would 
have been easy. 
</p><p>
I thank your Excellency for your secret admonition, but must entreat that you would be pleased to 
let me know who were your Excellency's informers, 
as you were pleased to mention that they were some 
who have been with me. I think, what your Excellency is pleased to mention with respect to the fo 
rage, we are pursuing. I am a little at a loss for your 
final determination, as to my conduct here. In your 
letter of the 3d instant, you are pleased to direct 
that, after fixing a number of troops in this quarter 
and at <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>, the remainder should immediately 
march forward and join you; and in your letter of 
the 4th, you are pleased to advise some further at 
tempts on the fort. The last night I ordered a large 
scouting party to march, at one o clock this morning, 
from Ward s, to surprise the out-guards near Fort 
Independence, and attempt whatever might appear 
practicable. I have not as yet heard from them. I 
had yesterday ordered some of the troops lower 
down, and to take quarters below "Ward s. I shall 
immediately endeavour to make the necessary arrangement directed by your Excellency, and shall, in 
obedience to your orders, consult Colonel Duer; other-wise I should not do it in military matters, although 
I much esteem him for his good sense and judgment 
in other affairs. It will, most probably, be several 
days before the troops can move, in which time I 
hope to hear again from you; and in the mean time 
I can assure your Excellency, they shall not be idle. 
I thank your Excellency for the leave you have 
been pleased to grant me to ride to New England. 
Nothing but necessity could have induced me to solicit the favor. I shall endeavour to return in about 
four weeks from the time that I leave <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>, 
which will give me about two weeks at home. I 
have the honor to be, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most humble servant,
