DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for the long and friendly letter 
of the 14th instant, which I have had the pleasure 
of receiving from you. It was, for many reasons, 
grateful to me. I value the esteem of the wise and 
virtuous, and had wished to know the particulars of 
transactions respecting which only vague and unsatis 
factory reports had come to my knowledge. Delicacy 
forbad my breaking the subject to you when here. 
</p><p>
I was sure of your politeness, but not certain of a 
more than usual degree of confidence. The latter has 
now been made manifest, and, permit me to assure 
you, it shall be mutual. 
</p><p>
The impression attempted to be made has not 
taken. It passed without a single remark. Your friends thought it merited nothing but silence and 
neglect. The same reason induced me to take no 
notice of it in my answer. I have perused the several papers with which you favored me. The delicacy, 
candor, and temper diffused through your letter, forma strong contrast to the evasions and design observ 
able in some others. Gratitude ought to have attached a certain gentleman to the friend who raised him. 
A spurious ambition, however, has, it seems, made him your enemy. This is not uncommon. To the 
dishonor of human nature, the history of mankind 
has many pages filled with similar instances ; and we 
have little reason to expect that the annals of the 
present or future times will present us with fewer 
characters of this class. On the contrary, there is 
reason to expect they will multiply in the course of 
this revolution.* 
</p><p>
Seasons of general heat, tumult, and fermentation, 
favor the production and growth of some great virtues, and of many great and little vis. Which will 
predominate, is a question which events not yet produced, nor now to be discerned, can alone determine. 
What parties and factions will arise, to what objects 
be directed, what sacrifices they will require, and who 
will be the victims, are matters beyond the sphere 
of human prevision. New modes of Government, not 
generally understood, nor, in certain instances, approved; want of moderation and information in the 
people ; want of abilities and rectitude in some of 
their rulers; a wide field open for the operations of 
ambitious men, raised from low degrees to high stations, and rendered giddy by elevation and the ex 
tent of their views ; laws dictated by the spirit of 
the times, not the spirit of justice and liberal policy ; 
latitude in principles, as well as commerce; fluctuation in manners and public counsels; suspension of education; indifference to religion and moral obligation, &c., &c., are circumstances that portend evils, 
which much prudence, vigor, and circumspection are 
necessary to prevent or control. 
</p><p>
To me there appears reason to expect a long 
storm, and difficult navigation. Calm repose, and the 
sweets of undisturbed retirement, appear more distant 
than a peace with Britain. It gives me pleasure, 
however, to reflect, that the period is approaching 
when we shall become citizens of a better ordered 
State ; and the spending a few troublesome years of 
our eternity in doing good to this and future generations, is not to be avoided or regretted. Things 
will come right, and these States will be great and 
flourishing. The dissolution of our Governments threw 
us into a political chaos. Time, wisdom, and perseverance will reduce it into form, and give it strength. 
order, and harmony. In this work you are (in the 
style of one of your professions) a master builder ; and 
God grant that you may long continue a free and 
accepted one ! 
</p><p>
Thus, my dear Sir, I have indulged myself in thinking loud in your hearing ; it would be an Hibernicism to say in your sight, though, in one sense, more 
true. It is more than probable that I shall frequently 
do the like. Your letter shall be my apology, and 
the pleasure resulting from converse with those weesteem, my motive. I am, dear Sir, with perfect esteem and regard, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
The questions contained in your favor of the 23d 
instant, are as important as the manner of introducing them is delicate. While the maritime affairs of 
the Continent continue under the direction of a Committee, they will be exposed to all the consequences 
of want of system, attention, and knowledge. The 
Marine Committee consists of a Delegate from each 
State. It fluctuates, new members constantly coming 
in, and old ones going out. Three or four, indeed, 
have remained in it from the beginning, and have a 
proportionate influence, or, more properly, interest in 
it. Very few of the members understand even the 
state of our naval affairs, or have time or inclination 
to attend to them. But why is not this system 
changed? It is, in my opinion, convenient to the family compact. The Commercial Committee are equally 
useless. A proposition was made to appoint a Commercial Agent for the States, under certain regulations. Opposition was made ; the ostensible reasons 
were various ; the true reason was, its interference 
with a certain commercial agent in Europe, and his 
connections. 
</p><p>
You will, if I mistake not^ find M. Gerard disposed 
to be open and communicative. He has acquired an 
extensive knowledge of our affairs. I have no reason 
to believe he will use it to our prejudice. There is 
as much intrigue in this State House as in the Vatican, but as little secrecy as in a boarding-school. It 
mortifies me, on this occasion, to reflect, that the rules 
of Congress on the subject of secrecy, which are far too general, and, perhaps for that reason, more frequently violated, restrain me from saying twenty 
things to you, which have ceased to be private. 
</p><p>
The state of our currency is really serious. Where, 
or by what means, the progress of its depreciation 
will be prevented, is uncertain. The subject is deli 
cate, but the conduct of some men really indicates at 
least great indifference about it. It will not be many 
days before measures^ having a great though not 
immediate influence on this subject, will be either 
adopted or rejected. I shall then have an opportunity of being more particular. I am, very dear Sir. 
with perfect esteem and regard, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have had the pleasure of receiving your favor of 
the 16th instant. Britain refused the mediation of 
Spain at a time when their spirits were elated by 
their successes in the West Indies and the Southern 
States, and by the accounts they received of discord 
in Congress, discontent among the people, and a prospect of the evils with which we were threatened by 
the depreciation of our currency. Deceived by these 
illusory gleams of hope, they permitted their counsels 
to be guided by their pride. What reason they may 
have to expect succour from other powers is, as yet,a secret. M. Gerard is decided, in his opinion, that 
they will obtain none. The conduct of France, inestaishing peace between Russia and the Porte, has 
won the heart of the Empress ; and the influence of 
Versailles, at Constantinople, will probably give duration to her gratitude. The Emperor and Prussia are 
under similar obligations. The latter wishes us well, 
and the finances of the former are too much exhausted to support the expenses of war, without subsidies 
from Britain, who, at present, cannot afford them. 
There is no reason to suspect that the peace of Ger 
many will soon he interrupted. Britain may hire 
some troops there, but it is not probable she will be 
able to do more. Portugal and the Dutch, while directed by their interest, will not rashly raise their 
hands to support a nation, which, like a tower in an 
earthquake, sliding from its base, will crush every 
slender prop that may be raised to prevent its fall. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague'>General Wayne</a>'s letter has been referred to the 
Committee of Intelligence for publication. 
</p><p>
You may remember, Sir, to have received a letter 
from me last winter, recommending the person who 
carried it as an honest man, and who, in my opinion, 
would, with great fidelity, do the business you wished, 
and I advised him, to undertake. 
</p><p>
In May last, I received a letter from him, informing; me of his having written to you at the same 
time, and mentioning a matter of very delicate nature, which, I believe,- was omitted in your letter, as 
he gave me reason to expect he would soon be here. 
I avoided particulars, not choosing to risk more on 
paper than was necessary. lie has not, however, been 
here, nor have I received a line from him for some 
time past. From this circumstance, I have been apprehensive of his having relinquished that business ; 
and the more so, as he intimated to me his doubts 
of its being well conducted, unless under your immediate direction; that the views of the gentleman, with 
whom he first conversed on the subject, were not very 
extensive, and his attention to expense too great. 
</p><p>
The opinion I have of this man's usefulness leads 
me to mention these matters, that, if he has left the 
business, I might, if you think proper, press him to 
resume it. If he still perseveres, I do not wish to 
be informed of any other particulars. With perfect 
respect, and sincere regard, I am, dear Sir, 
Your most obedient servant,
