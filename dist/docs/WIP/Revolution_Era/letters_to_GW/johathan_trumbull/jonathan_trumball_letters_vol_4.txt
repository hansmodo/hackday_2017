Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Having had the satisfaction to accord with you in 
the sentiment of retiring from the busy cares of public life, to the tranquil scenes of private enjoyment, 
I anticipate, with much pleasure, the reflections which 
such a state will enable us to make upon the happy 
issue of those anxious and perplexing vicissitudes 
through which, in the course of an eight years' unusual war, you and I have had the lot to pass, and, 
in the cares and solicitudes of which, we have borne 
no ignoble part. 
</p><p>
I felicitate you, Sir, with great cordiality, on your having already reached the goal of your wishes, and 
most devoutly invoke the Divine benediction on your enjoyments and pursuits. A month more, I trust, will 
bring me to the haven of retirement ; in the tranquillity of which I hope to have leisure to attend to and 
cultivate those seeds of private friendship, which have 
been planted during the tumults of war, and in the 
cultivation of which I promise myself to reap much pleasure. 
</p><p>
Indulging these prospects, I am induced to wish, 
and even to hope, that the correspondence between 
you and me, which commenced under the pressure 
of disagreeable circumstances, may not wholly cease 
when we find ourselves in a happier situation. Although enveloped in the shades of retirement, the 
busy mind cannot suppress its activity, but will be 
seeking some employment, which will indeed be necessary to dispel that languor which a scene of inactivity would be apt to produce. Subjects will not be 
wanting ; far different, and more agreeable, I trust, 
than those we have been accustomed to dwell upon; 
and occasions will present which may serve to beguile 
a lingering hour, and afford some pleasing amusement, 
or instructive information. Let not the disparity of 
age, or the idea of a correspondent seventy-three 
years advanced on his journey through life, chill 
your expectations from this proposal. I promise you 
my best endeavours; and when you perceive, as too 
soon, alas ! you may, that your returns are not proportional to your disbursements, you have only to 
cease your correspondence ; I shall submit. 
</p><p>
The fruits of our peace and independence do not, 
at present, wear so promising an appearance as I 
had fondly painted to my mind. The jealousies, the 
prejudices, and turbulence of the people, at times, 
almost stagger my confidence in our political establishment, and almost occasion me to think that they 
will show themselves unworthy the noble prize for 
which we have contended, and which, I had pleased 
myself, was so near our enjoyment. But again, I 
check this rising impatience, and console myself under the present prospect, with the consideration that 
the same beneficent and wise <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> which has 
done so much for this country, will not eventually 
leave us to ruin our own happiness, to become the 
sport of chance, or the scoff of an admiring world; 
but that great things are still in store for this people, 
which time, and the wisdom of the Great Director, 
will produce in its best season. In this better confidence, I bid you adieu for the present, wishing you 
every felicity, while I subscribe myself, with sincere 
esteem, and the most affectionate regard, &c. &c.,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
With great satisfaction I have the honor to inform 
you that, last evening, the Convention of this State, 
by a great majority, voted to ratify and adopt the 
new proposed Constitution for the United States ; yeas 
one hundred and twenty-seven, nays forty. With additional pleasure I can inform you, that the debates 
on this subject have been conducted with a spirit of 
great candor, liberality, and fairness, and the decision 
received with the universal applause of a numerous 
body of the people of the State, who attended the 
public deliberations of their Convention, and expressed 
their cordial assent, on the moment of decision, with 
a general clap. 
</p><p>
The great unanimity with which this decision has 
been made, and the liberality with which its previous 
deliberations have been conducted in this State, I 
hope will have a happy influence on the minds of 
our brethren in Massachusetts. Their Convention is 
now collecting, and will be favored with this information to-morrow. It may not be amiss to mention that, 
in the list of affirmants in this State, stand the names 
of all our principal characters, with the men of liberality, sentiment, and influence. 
</p><p>
Although not honored with the appointment as a 
Delegate (being, in my particular circle, under the 
cloud of Commutation and <a href='/results.php?city=cincinnati' rel='city'>Cincinnati</a>), I have attended 
the debates of this Convention from their beginning 
to the close, and have been amply compensated by 
the pleasure, the satisfaction, and instruction I have 
participated on the occasion. With all those sentiments of sincere cordiality and respect with which I 
have ever had the honor to address you, my dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I now have the pleasure to subscribe myself, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jht" rel="me">Jonathan Trumbull</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. While I take the pleasure of congratulating 
you. Sir, on this joyous occasion, I pray you to indulge my wishes in begging you to present my sincerest respects to Mrs. Washington, with my tender 
solicitations for her health and happiness.

My dear General, 
</p><p>
Nothing worthy of your notice having fallen in my 
way to communicate, since the receipt of your very 
esteemed favor of the 20th of July, I have forbore to 
trouble you with my acknowledgments therefor until 
this time ; and I can now inform that the General Assembly of this State has lately been in session for a 
few days. After passing some resolves for organizing 
the Congress under the new Constitution, and doing 
but little other business, they were adjourned to January, the time for appointing Electors. This appointment the Assembly have retained in their own power, 
thinking it more likely to be exercised with judgment and discretion by the Legislature than it would 
probably be, was it to be intrusted to the people at 
large. Our Senators are the Honorable William Johnson and Oliver Ellsworth, Esquires, two very worthy 
and respectable members. The Representatives are to 
be chosen by the people before January next, in a 
mode very similar to that by which our Assistants and 
Delegates to Congress have been wont to be elected. 
</p><p>
The circular letter for the Convention of the State 
of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, being among the letters which the 
Governor laid before the Assembly, had, of course, a 
reading among the other public communications. This 
was all that passed respecting it; for although we 
had, in our Assembly, the champion of our antics, 
with some of his principal aids, yet no one had 
hardiness enough to call up the consideration of that 
letter, or to mention one word of its subject. Thus 
passed, in silent review, that formidable communication. 
Excepting a few, very few discordant souls, whose 
inharmonious principles will never suffer them to act 
in general concert, we continue very unanimous in 
sentiment and salutary measures in this State, and 
are progressing with much cheerfulness and great 
good humor to the commencement of the new Constitution. In the choice of a President we have, I 
believe, no discordant voice ; all minds are agreed, 
and every heart exults in the pleasing prospect of 
having their wishes so nobly gratified in this first 
great appointment. 
</p><p>
I wish the States were like to be as happily unanimous in their Vice-President. For myself, since 
our minds seem so much to be turned towards Massachusetts for filling that office, and since <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague'>Mr. Adams</a> 
is so much talked of as one, if not the first, of the 
Supreme Federal Court, I could wish to hear the name of <a href='/results.php?tla=jab' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Bowdoin</a> more generally mentioned than 
it is for the Vice-Presidency. From a long knowledge of this gentleman, in private as well as public life, I 
am led to entertain a high veneration for his character. I view him as a gentleman of liberal sentiments, 
extensive knowledge, and enlarged mind â€” a gentleman to whose wise, firm, and determined exertions, 
during the late troubles in Massachusetts, much more 
than to the studied popularity of their present Governor, is owing the happy tranquillity which that 
State now enjoys. It would afford me much satisfaction to reflect on the aid and support, which you, 
my dear Sir, would receive from the wisdom, prudence and discretion of such a character, in the arduous situation to which you will, you must he, advanced. 
</p><p>
If my <a href='/results.php?tla=dah' rel='friend met'>Friend Humphreys</a> continues to reside with 
you. Sir (I mention this circumstance with doubt, 
because, from his long silence and reserve, many of 
his friends consider him to be dead or absconded), if 
he should prove to be still with you, may I pray 
your Excellency to be so good as to mention to 
him the kind remembrance of his old friend T., and 
whisper in his ear that, if he should find himself not 
too fat or too indolent, his friend will be much 
pleased in hearing from him, or, at least, in hearing 
of him. 
</p><p>
My dear General, your very affectionate, obliged, 
and faithful friend and humble servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
By some unaccountable delay, the letter with which 
you have favored me, of the 13th instant, did not 
reach me till the 30th. While writing mine of the 
2d of this month, the doubt which you have been 
pleased to mention, respecting the law of Congress 
fixing the seat of Government, occurred to me ; but, 
turning to the law, I found the fifth section mentions, 
" That prior, &c., all offices attached to the seat of 
Government shall be removed to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, &c., at 
which place, the session of Congress next ensuing, shall 
be held." The sixth section mentions, "That in the 
year <a href='/results.php?year=1800'>1800</a> the seat of Government shall be transferred, &c., and all offices, &c. shall be also removed, 
&c.;" but not a word of the Legislature; by which 
it would seem it is left to its own adjournment, and 
the discretion of the President on extra occasions. Indeed, I conceived that the Constitution, in granting 
this discretion, must have contemplated Place, as well 
as time, of meeting ; because the necessity for its exercise might be grounded equally in one as the 
other. Witness the existing instance, the first that 
has occurred. 
</p><p>
Moreover, the Constitution must be paramount to 
the law in such cases ; otherwise, the power granted 
may be so controlled as not to be sufficient to surmount the necessity of the occasion. The like necessity may also exist under other circumstances ; such 
as the total destruction of the city by fire, or other 
means ; its being in complete possession of an enemy, 
and other insurmountable calamities which might occur. Ill all which cases if the law, fixing the seat 
of Government, must rise superior to the Constitution, the discretionary power of the President, calculated to afford a remedy under such exigencies, must 
be futile, and prove totally inadequate to the purposes for which it was intended. 
</p><p>
I also considered that, should doubts arise, they 
would be easily obviated by reflecting that this exercise of discretion could not be dangerous, because it 
would be in the power of Congress, as soon as met, 
to remedy the evil, should they apprehend any, by 
an immediate adjournment to wherever they might 
judge proper. Besides, it is calculated to remedy an 
existing inconvenience and danger to themselves, 
which in its nature is only temporary, and is hoped 
to prove of but short continuance. 
</p><p>
As to the place of meeting, I am very sensible it 
wall be an object of delicacy to decide. When I took 
the liberty to suggest the hints I gave to you, this 
difficulty presented itself; and I was then almost 
tempted to add a word on that head, but was repressed by the fear of assuming too much. I therefore now mention, what I before thought, that in casting about, it is probable the towns of <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a> and 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> will present themselves to your mind as 
the most convenient places. To the latter, I am sensible, objections will be started by some, notwithstanding its superior advantages, perhaps, for the present 
temporary occasion. To obviate, therefore, these objections to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, should they appear with weight, 
and to save any uneasiness in the minds of our southern brethren from that quarter, I have thought for 
myself (and in this I have been joined by others) 
that I should perfectly acquiesce in <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>. I 
should mention the expedient of convening Congress somewhere in the vicinity of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and leave 
the final decision of i^lace to their determination, 
but that I fear such event may occasion disputes 
and delay, not to say heats, perhaps, which might 
prove much more detrimental to our general interests 
than your fixing, at once, a place by your own judgment and discretion. I most sincerely hope that, 
whatever place is appointed, the melancholy occasion 
of lea^nng <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> may speedily be removed, and 
that Congress may soon be able to return to that 
city again. 
</p><p>
With real regard and respect, I am, &c. 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jht" rel="me">Jonathan Trumbull</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. Before closing this letter we are gratified 
with much more favorable accounts from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> 
than for some time past. I really hope they may 
prove true, and that circumstances in that distressed 
city may continue to meliorate, so that you may 
have complete relief from your present dilemma on 
that score.
