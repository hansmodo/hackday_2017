Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I am honored with your Excellency's letter of 25th 
June last, with a copy of one addressed to you from 
General Parsons, inclosed. Your feelings of distress 
excite a sympathy in my breast, and a readiness to 
do all in my power to remove the occasion. That the Committee from the Connecticut line of the army did 
not accomplish a full settlement, was to me a matter of sorrow, and fear for its consequences. The 
veteran troops who faithfully served, and bravely endured so many distresses in defence of their own and 
their country's righteous cause, in the unhappy contest with the British King and Ministry, and continue therein to the end, will be rewarded, acknowledged, and remembered with love and gratitude by 
this and future generations. Surely, none will forsake 
it, or cause disturbances at This time, when in a near 
view of a happy issue. Those who do, will meet with 
reproach and regret. 
</p><p>
The country, universally, have had many, very many 
embarrassments and great difficulties to encounter and 
struggle through; enemies secret as well as open; 
no permanent army raised ; soldiers to be hired into 
the service for short periods, at extravagantly high 
prices ; no magazines of provisions ; an army to be 
fed from hand to mouth ; finances deranged ; public 
credit abused and ruined ; a rapid depreciation of 
the currency ; the army not paid or clothed ; the force 
and pernicious policy of a cruel and inveterate enemy to be met and avoided ; heavy taxes ; unreasonable jealousies ; with a train of other grievances more 
easily conceived than expressed. Suffer me to mention one more, by way of inquiry; â€” whether it is not 
grievous to hear our officers say, " that they have 
no justice to hope for from the State, unless their 
accounts are closed, and their wages and subsistence 
secured, before the period arrives in which they have 
no further occasion for the services of the army." 
</p><p>
I do sincerely wish for that period, and will then, 
and ever, exert myself to obtain justice for the officers and soldiers of our line, as freely as I have 
done so to bring the war to a happy close. A full 
settlement was agreed on for the pay and wages of 
our line. The subsistence of the officers is the only 
matter unsettled. It was proposed to give them, eightpence half-penny per ration, not from the first of 
April last, as mentioned in the letter, but from the 
first of April, <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a> ; the residue to lie open for the 
determination of Congress. 
</p><p>
The Legislature of this State is not sitting. To 
call it to meet at this season, when every other business, public and domestic, calls for the attention of 
the members, will cause discontent and uneasiness. 
You may depend on my giving the subject as early 
a consideration as may be found convenient, and consistent with other circumstances. A sum of money 
for our line of the army, as much as can be collected, 
shall be forwarded soon. I have the honor to be, with 
sentiments of great regard and consideration, &c.,

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Since my last to your Excellency, I have received 
a letter from General Parsons, dated the 10th instant, filled with severe remarks and reflections on 
our Legislature. A copy thereof, with my answer, 
is inclosed. 
</p><p>
I wish to do the things that make for peace with 
both officers and men of the Connecticut line of the 
army, consisting of our own people, raised for defending and securing the rights and liberties of the whole, 
embarked in the same common cause, and to return 
to citizens again when the contest with the British 
King and Ministry is ended; to prevent, if possible, 
discord and division, so very dangerous in our situation, and hazardous to our present operations. Surely 
the officers do not desire to inflame the soldiery with 
apprehensions that the Assembly deny them that 
justice which was done them the last year, with 
which they were satisfied, when the Committee from 
the line know the whole accounts of pay and wages 
were gone through, and ready to be closed on the 
same principles, and that nothing remained in question but only the detained rations of the officers. 
This was not agitated, till it became time for the 
Committee to return to their duty ; when there was scarcely time for the members of so numerous a "body 
to deliberate on the subject. Eight-pence half-penny 
per ration was offered from the 1st of April, <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>. Many were of opinion, that by the time of payment, 
that rate would be more than sufficient for the same. 
Others proposed to secure a specific payment. As to 
what was due before that 1st of April, <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>, it naturally lay open for the direction of the Honorable Congress. 
</p><p>
In the midst of these deliberations, the Committee 
left us unexpectedly. I observed no design to deny 
justice to the officers ; to the soldiery there could be 
none. The accounts were fully agreed, prepared, and 
ready to be closed. I choose to forbear any recrimination. Yet suffer me to inquire, why the Committee 
from the line did not bring on the settlement for 
detained rations earlier. They knew it must require 
time of deliberation, when they well knew the principles for settlement of pay and wages were agreed 
on the last year. Do they mean to press for more 
than justice, from the necessity of their present services, and the fears of fatal consequences if denied? 
The whole line know and ought to consider their pay 
and wages are secured in full value, while the depreciation operates as a heavy tax upon the rest of 
the people. The officers may likewise consider, that 
their pay vas raised by Congress, fifty per cent, 
above what the State agreed with them for. The maxim adopted by the enemy is that old one of divide et imjiera. Shall we suffer avarice to divide 
and ruin us and our cause, and give them opportunity to exult and triumph over us ? 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> hath and doth smile propitiously upon 
us, and calls aloud for union, vigorous exertions, patience, and perseverance, and to endure hardship as 
good soldiers, that the end may be peace. Justice 
and peace ride together in the same chariot. It will 
he my constant endeavour, that peace may be obtained on just and honorable terms, and that justice be 
done to them who jeopard their lives in the high 
places of the field, in defence of, and to secure the 
blessings of freedom for ourselves and posterity. 
</p><p>
I wrote yesterday to the Treasurer, to inform me 
this week, what sum of hard money is and can be 
immediately collected for the arm}'-, which shall be 
sent forward without delay. The measures directed, 
and orders given for raising and marching our troops 
to the army, are now diligently carrying into execution. I have the honor to be, with every sentiment 
of esteem and consideration.

</p><p>
Your letter of the 21st ultimo arrived on the 5th 
instant, whereupon my Council being convened, amidst 
various accounts of the movements and designs of the 
enemy in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and some apprehensions of their 
hostile attack upon or invasion of this State, every 
exertion was made and making for its defence, by 
ordering the militia to be reviewed, and detachments 
to be sent to the sea-coasts, and valuable effects 
there deposited to be removed to interior parts, &c. 
</p><p>
But unfortunately, before those preparations could 
be completed, namely, on the 6th instant, a party 
under the command of the infamous Arnold, made 
wanton destruction both of lives and property in New 
London and Groton, near the harbour. Though many 
material circumstances, relative to the tragical scene, 
are not yet obtainable with such a degree of precision and certainty as might be wished, yet, according 
to the best intelligence I have been able to collect, 
it seems a number exceeding one and perhaps two 
thousand, chiefly of chosen British and foreign troops, 
landed in the morning on both sides of the harbour's 
mouth, whereof one division immediately marched up 
to, and soon took possession of the town and fortifications of New London, which were evacuated on their 
approach, as being indefensible ; whilst, on the opposite shore, the fort on Groton bank, being attacked 
by six or eight hundred men, was nobly defended 
for a considerable time by about one hundred and 
fifty men, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel 
William Ledyard, who bravely repulsed the assailants 
until they suffered about one fourth part in killed 
and wounded. But, being overpowered by superior 
numbers, Colonel Ledyard, perceiving the enemy had 
gained possession of some part of the fort, and opened the gate, although he had only three of his men 
killed, thought proper to surrender himself with the 
garrison prisoners, and accordingly presented his sword 
to a British officer on the parade, who received the 
same, and immediately thrust it through that brave 
but unfortunate Commander ; whereupon the soldiery 
also pierced his body in many places with bayonets, 
and proceeded to massacre upwards of seventy of the 
officers and garrison, till, by the interposition of a 
British officer, who entered the fort too late to rescue 
the gallant officers, &c., about forty of the defenceless survivors were made prisoners, and carried off, 
exclusive of about the like number, who were wounded, and many of them dangerously. 
</p><p>
This heroic opposition on the part of the garrison, 
however, together with the increasing appearance of 
the militia, and small skirmishes between some scattering parties and advanced guards, prevented the enemy from fully executing their savage plan, and occasioned them to retreat on board in the evening with 
precipitation, after having knocked off the trunnions 
of seven guns, and consumed by fire about seventyone dwelling-houses, sixty-five stores, twenty-two barns, 
a church, court-house, and jail, together with a number of vessels, lying unrigged, by the wharves. The 
rest of the shipping in the harbour was saved by 
running up Norwich River, and several valuable 
buildings, on each shore, preserved by quenching the 
flames. 
</p><p>
The loss of property by the conflagration was, however, very great, and ruinous to many individuals, as 
also a sensible damage to the public. Yet, what is 
more to be regretted, is the unhappy fate of that 
worthy officer. Colonel Ledjard, and those brave men 
(many of whom sustained respectable characters, 
and were esteemed the flower of that town), who so 
gallantly fought and unfortunately fell with him, victims to British cruelty. I have given directions for 
procuring authenticated information of those transactions, as soon as the situation of the wounded and 
prisoners (some of whom are paroled) will admit ; 
which will be forwarded as soon as obtained. I have 
the honor to be, with every sentiment of esteem and 
consideration, your Excellency's

State of Connecticut, <a href='/results.php?city=lebanon' rel='city origin'>Lebanon</a>, <a rel='day origin' value='6'>6</a> <a rel="month origin" value="11">November</a>,  <a href='/results.php?year=1781' rel="origin">1781</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
The very interesting and important news of the 
surrender of General Lord CornwalliS; with the British 
army, shipping, &c., &c., under his command, reached 
me on the 26th ultimo by a vessel from the Chesapeake to Rhode Island ; and the full confirmation, a 
few days since by a letter from my son. My warmest and most sincere congratulations await your Excellency on an event so honorable and glorious to 
yourself, so interesting and happy to the United 
States ; â€” an event, which cannot fail to strengthen 
the impressions of the European powers in favor of the 
great and good cause, in which you have so long and 
so successfully contended, and go far to convince the 
haughty King of Great Britain, that it is in vain to 
persevere in his cruel and infamous purpose of enslaving a people, who can boast of Generals and armies that neither fear to meet his veterans in the 
high places of the field, or pursue them to their 
strong-holds of security, and for whose help the arm 
of the Almighty has been made bare, and his salvation rendered gloriously conspicuous; â€” an event, 
which will hasten the wished-for happy period, when 
your Excellency may retire to and securely possess 
the sweets of domestic felicity and glorious rest from 
the toils of war, surrounded by the universal applauses of a free, grateful, and happy people. 
</p><p>
The very important assistance and powerful cooperation afforded by the fleet and army of our illustrious ally, the King of France, demand the most 
grateful acknowledgments. The gallant and intrepid conduct of the Commanders and Officers of both, has 
acquired them great glory, and entitles them and 
their army to the warmest thanks of America. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency has been made acquainted with 
the destruction lately committed upon New London 
and Groton, by a considerable force of the enemy 
under the infamous traitor, whose name and memory 
should rot. A force much more considerable has been 
kept there since. They have done much to repair 
the injury done to the fortifications; and particularly 
that on Groton side, which entirely commands the 
town and harbour, is already in much better condition than before, and the work is still going on. 
And, as I take it for granted that part of the naval 
force of his most Christian Majesty will remain on 
the station through the winter, I would take leave 
to offer to the consideration of your Excellency, that 
they may be stationed at the port of New London, 
which I conceive would be attended with advantages 
superior, with respect to themselves and the country, 
to any place they could choose. The harbour is very 
sufficient to contain any number and size of ships ; 
is peculiarly safe from the injuries of wind or storms. 
Its immediate connection with the main renders it 
accessible by the militia in case of need; and, adjoining to a country, through the favor of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> 
at present abounding with every kind of provision 
they can want, will render their supplies much more 
easy and safe than at the Island where they last 
wintered, and where they received great part of their 
supplies by water from New London, exposed to loss 
and capture, and which actually did, and must always, happen in some instances. 
</p><p>
I have very lately received a pressing request from 
his Excellency, the General of Martinico, for large supplies of fresh beef from this State, for the use of 
the garrisons and hospitals there. I purpose to permit and encourage private adventures to furnish it, 
which must be shipped from that port. The lying 
of a fleet there would greatly secure and protect the 
coasts, for a considerable distance, against the armed 
vessels of the enemy, who will doubtless get knowledge of the design, and be engaged to intercept vessels with such cargoes. And, for their more effectual protection, I must also request a convoy of a 
frigate, armed sloop, or something adequate, for any 
number of vessels which may be ready to sail, and 
ask your Excellency's direction in that respect also 
and on the assurance of which, I doubt not, a full 
and speedy supply might and would be afforded ; 
and without it I fear it will fall short. 
</p><p>
Permit me to add, in favor of the town which has 
so severely suffered, that a fleet stationed there would 
also afford relief and help to many of the distressed 
inhabitants, who have lost their all; and would be 
a protection to as much property, taken from the 
enemy, as perhaps is brought into any port standing 
in need of such protection. 
</p><p>
On the whole, I submit these and other reasons, 
which will readily occur to your Excellency's wisdom 
and candor. With every sentiment of esteem and 
consideration, I have the honor to be, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
