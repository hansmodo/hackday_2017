SIR, 
</p><p>
I suppose your Excellency is not wholly unacquainted with the character of Mr. David Bushnell, 
the bearer. He has had a liberal education, and discovers a genius capable of great improvement, in mathematical ; philosophic, and mechanical literature. His 
inventions for annoying the enemy's shipping are new 
and ingenious, and, I trust, founded on such principles 
as would insure success. The vigilance practised in 
guarding the shipping has, I suppose, been the only 
means of preventing such execution as would have 
been attended with very alarming and beneficial con 
sequences. He has, with persevering and indefatigable industry, pursued the object with very little 
prospect of any other reward than that of serving 
his country. 
</p><p>
Misfortune and accident have prevented the execution of this design ; but there is reason to believe 
the explosion of one of his machines, taken on board 
one of the enemy's ships some time since, has greatly 
alarmed their marine, and made them very cautious 
in their approaches to any of the neighbouring shores. 
</p><p>
It is a pity that so promising a genius should 
not be encouraged. I understand an establishment of 
miners and sappers is forming under, your Excellency's direction, and would therefore take the liberty 
to propose to your Excellency, whether a person of 
his particular genius might not be very useful in 
that department. 
</p><p>
If you should not have filled, and cannot probably 
fill, the officers with gentlemen of greater merit and 
genius, permit me to recommend Mr. Bushnell to the 
office of Captain in that service, which, from his abilities, genius, and integrity, I should judge him capable to execute with honor and advantage. The Council 
of this State, now convened, join with me in this re 
commendation. I am, with very high respect and esteem, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>

SIR, 
</p><p>
The time, when the arrival of the fleet under the 
command of the <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague'>Count de Estaing</a> may be expected, 
being so far advanced that the utmost readiness to 
cooperate with him is become necessary, should he 
appear on this coast, and the immediate danger to 
which our own seaports will be exposed from the 
collected force of the enemy, should he be prevented 
from coming this way, have prevailed to induce the 
General Assembly of this State to order the militia, requested by your Excellency, to be assembled at the 
places of rendezvous proposed, as soon as possible. 
</p><p>
Should the advanced season, or any other unforeseen cause, prevent the <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague'>Count</a> from coming this way, 
and the intended enterprise against the enemy at New 
York be laid aside, the frontiers and sea-coasts of this 
State will be eminently exposed to the ravages and 
depredations of the enemy. We would flatter ourselves it will be in your Excellency's power to send a part of the troops, under your command, into this 
State, to take post so as to cover and protect the 
most exposed part of our sea-coasts and frontiers ; and 
desire you to inform us whether we may expect that 
our hopes and wishes, in this respect, may be realized. 
</p><p>
The keeping up large guards of the militia on the 
coasts, besides the enormous expense attending, injures 
the public service by withdrawing the men from the 
field, and lessening our ability to supply the army 
with men or provisions. But, I persuade myself, I 
need not use arguments to prevail upon your Excellency to indulge our request, if consistent with the 
public service and a due regard to the general interests of the States. I am, with great esteem and 
regard, my dear General, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
