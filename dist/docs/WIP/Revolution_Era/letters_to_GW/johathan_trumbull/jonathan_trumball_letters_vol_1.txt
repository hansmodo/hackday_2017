SIR, 
</p><p>
Suffer me to join in congratulating you, on your 
appointment to be General and Commander-in-Chief of 
the troops raised, or to be raised, for the defence of 
American liberty. Men, who have tasted freedom, 
and who have felt their personal rights, are not 
easily taught to bear with encroachments on either, 
or brought to submit to oppression. Virtue ought 
always to be made the object of government. Justice is firm and permanent. 
</p><p>
His Majesty's ministers have artfully induced the 
Parliament to join in their measures, to prosecute 
the dangerous and increasing difference between Great 
Britain and these Colonies with rigor and military 
force y whereby the latter are driven to an absolute 
necessity to defend their rights and properties by 
raising forces for their security. 
</p><p>
The Honorable Congress have proclaimed a Fast to be 
observed by the inhabitants of all the English Colonies 
on this continent, to stand before the Lord in one day, 
with public humiliation, fasting, and prayer, to deplore 
our many sins, to offer up our joint supplications to 
God, for forgiveness, and for his merciful interposition 
for us in this day of unnatural darkness and distress. 
</p><p>
They have, with one united voice, appointed you to 
the high station you possess. The Supreme Director 
of all events hath caused a wonderful union of hearts 
and counsels to subsist among us. 
</p><p>
Now, therefore, be strong and very courageous. May the God of the armies of Israel shower down 
the blessings of his Divine <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> on you, give you wisdom and fortitude, cover your head in the 
day of battle and danger, add success, convince our 
enemies of their mistaken measures, and that all their 
attempts to deprive these Colonies of their inestimable 
constitutional rights and liberties are injurious and 
vain. I am, with great esteem and regard, Sir, 
Your most obedient humble servant,

SIR, 
</p><p>
On the 1st instant I met the Honorable Assembly 
of this Colony, to deliberate on the request and pressing  reasons sent us from the Massachusetts for an 
immediate augmentation of troops from this Colony. 
Our Assembly agreed to augment with two regiments 
of seven hundred men each, who are now raising to 
join the Continental Army. It w^as wished that we 
could have the advice and direction of the Congress, 
or your Excellency, before we took this step, but 
thought the present critical situation of our affairs 
would not admit the delay of obtaining it. Since 
your arrival at camp before <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, views and considerations of their situation and circumstances, I shall 
gladly be advised, and shall attend your request 
for the hastening and marching the men. 
</p><p>
There are thirteen hundred and ninety-one barrels 
of flour come to the care of Colonel Jedediah Hunting ton, at Norwich, for the use of the army, which I 
have ordered forward. The busy season with the 
farmers renders its speedy transportation difficult. 
Please to advise of the need of hurry, and where it 
shall be ordered to be delivered. 
</p><p>
Our Assembly supplied <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>Major-General Schuyler</a> with 
fifteen thousand pounds in cash, and forty barrels of 
another necessary article. Accounts from the north 
ward are favorable. The brig Nancy, Thomas Davis, 
master, which arrived at Stonington with molasses, is 
removed to Norwich. She hath on board eighteen or 
nineteen thousand gallons. The Committee of Inspection  and Correspondence, I trust, will take proper 
care respecting both vessel and cargo. 
</p><p>
The road by my door being the nearest for post-riding  from <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a> to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, I shall be obliged, whenever your Excellency has occasion to send to 
that city, if the rider may be directed this way, and to call on me, for the convenience of any despatches I may have occasion to forward by him. Fessenden 
has passed this way more than once. 
</p><p>
I am, with great esteem and regard, Sir, your obedient and most humble servant,

SIR, 
</p><p>
By the resolve in Congress of the 19th instant, it 
is recommended to the New England Colonies to complete the deficiencies in the -regiments belonging to 
them respectively. I have not been informed of any deficiency in the number of troops sent from Connecticut, It is recommended also to this Colony to complete and send for 
ward to the camp before <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, as soon as possible, the fourteen hundred men lately voted by our Assembly. 
The 25th instant I sent orders to the Colonels of the last raised regiments to march forthwith to the camp 
before <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, by subdivisions, if all were not in readiness. I. expect many of the companies will begin 
their march this day, and that the whole will move forward very soon. 
</p><p>
The Honorable <a href='/results.php?tla=joh' rel='colleague'>President Hancock</a>, in his favor of 
the 22d instant, informs that you had recommended, 
and the Congress have appointed, Mr. Joseph Trumbull 
Commissary-General of the American Army. I am also 
informed that you have taken Mr. John Trumbull into 
your service and family. These instances of kindness 
shown them justly claim my most grateful acknowledgments. A performance of their duty, answerable to 
your expectation, will meet your approbation and 
continuance of regard, and afford me peculiar satis 
faction and pleasure. 
</p><p>
The Rose, Swan, and Kingfisher, ships of war, with a 
small tender, the 26th instant came into the harbour at 
New London. On the 27th some men landed near the 
light-house, broke off the nuts, and plugged up with old 
files three or four cannon. They sailed out again on 
Friday last. It is reported Mr. Collector Stuart is packing  up his effects, in order to leave that port, I am, 
with great truth and regard, your Excellency's 
Most obedient and humble servant,

SIR, 
</p><p>
Yesterday, at twelve o clock, I received your letter 
by Major Johnson. I immediately gave the necessary directions. Some companies I ordered to New 
London; others to New Haven; Colonel Webb, with 
the companies that way, if not marched, to take his 
station at Greenwich. Same day, at eleven o clock, 
I received a letter from Brigadier-<a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague'>General Wooster</a>, 
dated the 9th, at the Oyster Ponds, on Long Island. 
He had with him four hundred and fifty men, besides 
militia, designing to preserve the stock at that place. 
The people on the Island had left it. He applied to 
me for three hundred pounds of powder, before I 
had made my answer and order for the powder, 
which I gave, notwithstanding our exhausted condition. On receipt of yours, I inserted an extract from 
it, for his observation. 
</p><p>
I am informed a quantity of powder for the camp 
is to be at <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a> this evening, and more to follow soon. We have none lately arrived, which is 
daily expected. I request your direction, that of the 
next quantity that comes to <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>, there may be 
lodged there so much as you shall judge expedient. 
Of what is expected do arrive in the mean time, I 
shall have no occasion to use your allowance. 
I am, most respectfully,

SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's favor of the 2d instant was 
delivered to me last night. This afternoon I received <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a> s, of the 31st of August. 
He has ordered the lead to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, with directions 
to forward it by the most direct route to your camp. 
</p><p>
We are infested by ministerial ships and transports. I gave your Commissary-General a narrative 
yesterday, and beg leave to refer you to him, from 
the haste of this express. Our coasts are kept in 
continual alarm. Three ships of war, with thirteen 
other vessels of divers sorts, were seen off Fisher's 
Island, and in the Sound, yesterday. They have 
gained no provisions from the main. Have heard 
nothing from Montauk, or any part of Long Island. 
New London is in great fears, and Stonington expects another attack. I have ordered the new-raised 
levies to guard and defend those two places, and 
the coasts as far as Connecticut River. There are 
likewise four companies of them beyond the river, for defence in those parts. This appears absolutely necessary for their security at present. Hope this use 
of them, till these dangers are over, will neither injure nor hinder any of your operations. 
</p><p>
Whether these are the same ships your Excellency noticed us of, remains uncertain. Yesterday, ordered 
the best intelligence to be gained, to render that matter more certain. 
</p><p>
Lord's day morning, constrained by the weather, came into the harbour at New London a schooner, taken by the Rose, Captain Wallace, at Stonington; 
four hands on board ; one, a white man, sent to Windham gaol; the other three, negroes, two belonging to <a href='/results.php?tla=nic' rel='colleague'>Governor Cooke</a> and one to Newport, ordered to be 
returned to their masters, and the schooner to her owner. <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>'s army is moved forward a few days will determine the event. 
</p><p>
I have ordered our Commissaries in the several counties to send to your camp all the hunting shirts they can procure. I am, with great esteem and regard, Sir, your very obedient and 
</p><p>
Most humble servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I have received your Excellency's letter of the 8th 
instant by the express, who was detained by sickness. and did not deliver it till the 12th, in the 
evening; and my own bodily indisposition is some 
hinderance. Your peremptory requisition is fully complied with; all our new levies will be at your camp 
with all convenient expedition. 
</p><p>
At the time they were by your direction to remain in the Colony on some reason to suspect a 
remove from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, that they might 
be able to give them more speedy opposition, I 
ordered Colonel Webb, of our seventh regiment, his 
men being raised in the western part of the Colony, 
to take his station, with three or four companies, at 
Greenwich, the nearest town of this Colony to New York his Lieutenant-Colonel and company at New 
Haven; the residue of his and Colonel Huntington s, 
who were forward in their march, one company to 
Norwich and the rest to New London. Last week I 
sent orders to Colonel Webb to march the companies 
with him to New Haven, to be on his way so much 
nearer to your camp. 
</p><p>
I am surprised that mine of the 5th instant was 
not received, or not judged worthy of notice, as no 
mention is made of it. 
</p><p>
Stonington has been attacked and severely cannonaded, and by Divine <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> marvellously protected. 
</p><p>
New London and Stonington are still so menaced by the ministerial ships and troops, that the militia can not be thought sufficient for their security, and it is 
necessary to cast up some intrenchments. We are obliged actually to raise more men for their security, and for the towns of New Haven and Lyme. I 
hoped some of the new levies might have been left here till these dangers were over, without injury to your own operations. I own that must be left to 
your judgment; yet it would have given me pleasure to have been acquainted that you did consider it. 
</p><p>
I thank Divine <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> and you for this early 
warning to great care and watchfulness, that so the 
union of the Colonies may be settled on a permanent and happy basis. 
</p><p>
I have before me your more acceptable letter of 
the 9th instant. The necessities of the Colony to 
supply our two armed vessels, to furnish the men 
necessarily raised for defence of our seaports and 
coasts, and to raise the lead ore, which appears very 
promising, prevent our being able to spare more than half a ton, which is ordered forward with expedition. Before the necessity of raising more men 
appeared, we intended to send a ton. 
</p><p>
You may depend on our utmost exertions for the defence and security of the constitutional rights and 
liberty of the Colonies, and of our own in particular. 
None have shown greater forwardness, and thereby 
rendered themselves more the objects of ministerial 
vengeance. I am, with great esteem and regard for 
your personal character, Sir, your most obedient and 
</p><p>
Very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jht" rel="me">JONATHAN TRUMBULL</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. The Glasgow and Rose men-of-war are 
now at Newport, and threaten that, on the return of 
the Swan from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, probably with men for the 
purpose, they will attack New London and Stoning-ton. All the regiments in the Colony, at a great 
expense, have been disciplined ; and one quarter of 
them on the sea-coast are situated, equipped, and 
held in readiness as minute-men for every emergency

SIR, 
</p><p>
Your letters, of the 20th and 21st instant, are 
received. I thought fit this morning to acquaint 
<a href='/results.php?tla=aab' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Burr</a>ell, appointed to command the regiment 
destined to Canada from hence, that a month's pay 
will be advanced to officers and men by you. This 
additional encouragement will enliven them to the 
service. Also to inform, that I understood the route 
of the Massachusetts and New Hampshire regiments 
would probably be by Number Four to Onion River, 
with a Commissary to attend such as went that way. 
A month's pay was promised the men by my proclamation, and, on being acquainted with the readiness 
of the men, one of the Committee of the Pay-Table 
should attend for the payment thereof at <a href='/results.php?city=litchfield' rel='city'>Litchfield</a>, 
to prevent delay. I am unable to inform how and 
when the money from you may be received. 
</p><p>
The men in that quarter are well spirited and 
zealous, but have yet received no intelligence of the 
progress made in the business. Shall give you every 
necessary intelligence as it comes to my knowledge. 
</p><p>
Every necessary requisite for the march of this regiment will "be provided on the best terms in my 
power. Shall forward the three regiments destined 
for your camp, without delay. I am, with sincere 
esteem and regard, your Excellency's

SIR, 
</p><p>
Inclosed is account of the charges and expenses 
incurred by providing for Messrs. Penet and De Pliarne, in their journey to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, by your Excellency's direction. I have sent forward to you the bills, 
showing how the account arose. Please to order payment to be made, and sent to me by the post who 
brings this. 
</p><p>
The battalion raising in this Colony, to march to the assistance of our friends at Canada, are enlisted to serve until the 1st of February next, with bounty, 
pay, wages, and allowances, agreeable to resolve of Congress, sent me by the express who last came to you this way. 
</p><p>
Our Treasury was exhausted, and knew not how 
to set the troops forward, until Saturday. intelligence came to me that twelve thousand two hundred 
dollars were received from the Honorable Congress 
for that purpose. My proclamation was out some 
time before, and I hear that men enlist freely, and 
hope they will be on their march soon; have ordered 
them to go off by divisions, and hope nothing will 
retard them. 
</p><p>
Through fear of delay, I wrote, last week, to you 
on the head of our payment of the troops that 
served under you last season ; the pay-rolls are to 
meet your approbation and order for payment ; and 
although provision is received for those going to Canada, yet there remain innumerable calls we are 
unable to answer without further supplies, and apprehend payment is to be made by you on those rolls. 
</p><p>
Three battalions, raised and marching to your camp. 
will come on soon ; three dollars a man was paid, in 
part of wages, to enable them to make necessary 
provisions. I hear that two or three companies are 
gone forward, and the rest going this week. 
</p><p>
I received a letter from Major-General Lee, dated at Stamford, January 31st, wherein he writes; U A most unexpected and severe attack of the rheumatism 
or gout has seized me here, and prevented me personally proceeding. I have sent Colonel Waterbury 
on, as he is sufficiently strong in numbers betwixt his own regiment and the volunteers. I thought 
it prudent to order back Ward's regiment, till they received your Honor's further orders." In another 
scrip, he says ; " There is a late resolve of the Continental Congress, which, had I seen before, would have stopped me. It is, that every detachment of 
the army is to act under the direction of the provincial Congress where it is. What then will be the 
use of a detachment at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> ? I answer by 
asking, is <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to be left to be more inimical 
to us than even the Province of Quebec? The policy 
of many there is strained to the utmost against our 
rights. However, I hope better things of their congress, if not perverted by artful threats and craft." 
</p><p>
Since writing thus far, I am. informed that General Lee was carried into <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> in a litter, and 
three members of the Continental Congress are to 
meet him there, to settle measures of conduct.

SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your two favors of the 8th instant ; 
have also received, per Bacon, the remittance for the 
expenses of the French gentlemen to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
I had no design to have ever called on you for the 
money paid our troops under your immediate command, but to have accounted with the Congress, had 
we not been unexpectedly drained of cash, and had 
pressing calls upon us two or three ways at once. 
That to the northward could not possibly have been 
answered, but for the seasonable arrival of the continental supply, just sufficient for that purpose. Our 
other demands for the common service are many. 
The men, for the short service with you, could not have inarched without some money, which they have, 
I trust, wholly expended for necessary clothing, &c. 
I therefore could have wished it had been in your 
power to have remitted the sum advanced by our 
Pay-Table, but shall do every thing in my power, that 
the common interest do not suffer. 
</p><p>
I am greatly concerned for the scarcity of powder 
and arms. We have not half a sufficiency for our 
selves, as the circumstances may be ; yet, anxious to 
furnish you, for the common good, with every supply 
in our power, have ordered a quantity of gunpowder 
lately arrived at Bedford, in Dartmouth, carted to and 
now lying at <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, on account of this Colony, 
to be sent you, with all possible expedition. Three 
thousand weight of this we conclude to order to Major Thompson, Agent .for the Massachusetts Colony, 
on account of money he supplied to Mr. Shaw, the 
importer, for that end, and you will consult him or 
them concerning the use of it. I suppose the whole 
to be upwards of six thousand weight ; the residue, 
on account of this Colony, for which shall expect 
payment, or to be replaced, as shall be hereafter 
chosen by us. I shall send you this week twenty or 
thirty stands of good arms. I have not certain ad 
vice from every quarter, but I believe our three 
regiments are all on the march to your camp, except 
those already arrived there. 
</p><p>
I have much more agreeable intelligence from General Lee, and the <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> Congress, than I expected. I cannot but hope propitious Heaven will 
smile success on that most timely and judicious exertion of your Excellency, to prevent our enemies possessing themselves of that important station. I 
have the pleasure to inclose you a copy of General Lee's letter. In compliance with his request, we have already sent orders to Colonel Ward to repair again 
forthwith to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
The retreat of the Northern army, and its present 
situation, have spread a general alarm. By intelligence from Major-<a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>, received last-evening, I have reason to conclude that they are 
now at Crown Point and <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, in a weak 
state, and under the necessity of an immediate re-enforcement, to enable them to make a stand, and 
prevent the enemy from passing the Lake and penetrating into the country. The prevalence of the 
smallpox among them is every way unhappy. Our 
people, in general, have not had that distemper. Fear 
of the infection operates strongly to prevent soldiers 
from engaging in the service, and the battalions ordered to be raised in this Colony fill up slowly; and 
though no measures be taken to remove the impediment, may not the army be soon freed from that infection ? Can the reinforcements be kept separate 
from the infected ? Or may not a detachment be 
made from the troops under your command and the 
militia raising in the several Colonies and ordered to 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, of such men as have had the smallpox, 
to be replaced by the troops raising for the Northern 
Department? Could any expedient be fallen upon, 
that would afford probable hopes that this infection 
may be avoided, I believe our battalions would soon 
join the Northern army. I shall omit nothing in my 
power to expedite them. 
</p><p>
The retreat of the army from Canada exposes the 
Northern frontiers of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and New Hampshire 
to the ravages of the Indians, who will doubtless be 
spirited up to fall upon them. Some of the settlements on Onion River, I am informed, are breaking 
up and removing, and the whole filled with the 
most disquieting apprehensions. Some powder and 
lead, upon application, have been supplied them from 
this Colony ; but the settlers there, from their infant 
state, and consequent poverty, are unable to devote themselves to the defence of the frontiers, unless they should be enabled to hire laborers to carry on 
the business of their farms in their absence. I 
could therefore wish, that your Excellency might 
think proper to recommend it to the Continental 
Congress, to order a battalion to be raised and stationed there, for the defence of those settlements. It 
would, I trust, be immediately filled up with a hardy 
race of men in that quarter, well adapted to repel 
the attacks of the savages, and ready to join and 
support the Northern army, upon occasion, and at 
all times may scour the woods, and furnish intelligence of the enemy's motions. 
</p><p>
If those settlers are driven back, besides the loss 
of their property, a much heavier expense will fall 
upon some of the Colonies for the support of their 
families, than the charges arising from the raising 
and maintaining a battalion of Continental troops ; and 
we shall still have a frontier to defend. 
</p><p>
The anxiety of the friends and relations of many, 
if not most, of those settlers who emigrated from this 
Colony, and the importance of the matter, will, I 
trust, be my sufficient apology for wishing to engage 
your influence with Congress, to support the motion 
I judge advisable and shall make, to have a battalion 
raised out of, and stationed on, those frontiers. 
</p><p>
By a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>, of the 1st in 
stant, received last evening, I am advised that Generals Schuyler, Gates, and Arnold, were to set out on 
Tuesday morning. I trust they are by this time at 
the end of their journey, and hope their presence 
may have a happy effect towards retrieving affairs in 
that quarter. I am, with great truth and regard, Sir, 
Your most obedient, humble servant,

SIR, 
</p><p>
I have received your agreeable letter, of the 7th 
instant, per Captain Sears. The condition and circumstances of the Colony of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> give me pain, 
lest the friends to American liberty in that Colony should be too much neglected and become disheartened, and the inimical designs and mischievous operations of others succeed. I have received credible 
information that the Provincial Congress there had spent some time, just before they adjourned to the 1st of February, in debating whether they should not 
address Mr. Tryon for the purpose of calling the General Assembly of that Colony, to revive the old 
scheme of adopting the Parliamentary insult of the 20th of February last, which was rejected. Surely our friends want to be strengthened, and our enemies to be checked. 
</p><p>
The following is an extract from a letter from one 
of our friends to another, dated December 27th, 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775">1775</a>. "Just after you left town, the Phoenix, a forty-gun ship, arrived and anchored just before Mr. Drake s, 
and in two or three days after, the Asia, in company 
of the Duchess of Gordon, came and anchored opposite to Peck's slip, so that we are highly honored. 
General Dalrymple is on board the Phoenix, and it 
is rumored that they have two hundred troops concealed on board, which has, for near a week past, 
kept us on pretty hard duty. The Colonel has slept 
in the barracks two or three nights. If they come 1 
hope to give a good account of them. We have 
some excellent field-pieces, and if they visit us the 
gates will be opened, and we will welcome them 
with a few 7 resolves of the Continental Congress, which 
is the name of one of the pieces." 
</p><p>
I wrote a letter to <a href='/results.php?tla=joh' rel='colleague'>President Hancock</a>, dated the 
6th of January, and another to one of our Delegates 
at Congress, requesting that more effectual measures 
may be taken for the security of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, to prevent our enemies from being supplied with provisions, 
furnished with intelligence, and from having an opportunity to use every artifice to insult and injure 
us from that quarter. It therefore gave me sensible 
pleasure to find, that you have adopted the measures 
mentioned in yours, and with great cheerfulness 
called my council, and, with their advice, appointed 
Colonel Waterbury, Lieutenant-Colonel Bradley, and 
Major Hobby, field-officers for one regiment ; Colonel 
Ward, Lieutenant-Colonel Lewis, and Major Douglas 
for another. Sent a proclamation to the two Colonels, 
and orders to them with the rest of the field-officers, 
by voluntary enlistment, to raise seven hundred and 
fifty men each, to join and assist Major-General Lee, 
with encouragement that they should be entitled to 
the same pay, wages, and billeting allowed the troops 
before <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, during the time they served, and to be 
dismissed soon, when the service would conveniently 
admit. 
</p><p>
The field-officers of each regiment to select captains and subalterns from those in the standing militia ; if needful, to request the chief officer of the 
militia companies to call their companies together for 
the purpose of enlisting the men with expedition ; 
and, to prevent difficulty for want of ammunition, 
have ordered Captain Niles, Commander of our armed 
schooner, the Spy, to take on board half a ton of 
powder, and transport four hundred pounds to New 
Haven, two hundred pounds to Norwalk, and four 
hundred pounds to Stamford, with orders to him to 
follow such directions as Major-General Lee may give 
for the service he is employed in, and to execute 
the same, until dismissed by him, or further orders 
from me. Wished, but failed, to have the pleasure 
of a short interview with him. When my orders 
w T ere ready, very early on Saturday morning last, 
Captain Sears took them, and I apprehend he got to 
<a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a> by noon. I wrote to Major-General Lee, in 
forming of what was done by me. I have no doubt 
but the men at the westward part of this Colony 
will readily and expedition sly engage in the service. 
May the Supreme Director of all events add His 
blessing on our endeavours to preserve, support, and 
maintain the constitutional liberties of these Colonies, 
which he hath made it our duty to do. 
</p><p>
Thirteen Indians, of the Caghnawaga tribe, came to visit me on the 13th, and seemed well pleased to have a conference on our affairs, and expressed their 
belief of my information, and that they were friends and brothers, and yesterday proceeded on their way to you. I am, with great esteem and regard, your 
Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,

SIR, 
</p><p>
I have received your two favors of the 24th and 
25th of July last. I have put Colonel Ward's regiment under marching orders, to proceed without loss 
of time, whatever way Congress shall direct. The 
troops from this State, destined to the northward, 
are marched to Bennington, and from thence to 
Skenesborough. At the request of <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a> 
for one thousand felling axes, I have sent eight hundred, ground and with helves, to go the same route. 
They went from hence the 29th last. The residue will go with clothing, preparing for that army, next Monday. I thought it not best to wait for orders, 
as we were very well assured of their necessity. 
</p><p>
Notwithstanding our enemies are so numerous and powerful, and have hired mercenaries into their service, yet, knowing our cause righteous, and trusting 
Heaven will support and defend us, I do not greatly dread what they can do against us. Our internal 
malignants may be permitted to do many injurious 
and insidious things. They are, therefore, to be 
watched with care and diligence, to prevent such 
hypocritical and designing men carrying on and perpetrating their wicked purposes. No doubt there are 
many such, the persons and characters unknown to 
me ; and not convenient to mention in a letter the 
notices given me of any. 
</p><p>
Last week I sent circular letters addressed to the 
civil authority, Selectmen, Committees of Inspection, 
and Military Officers, in all the towns in this State, 
to promote and facilitate the filling the several battalions ordered to be raised here, and to send them 
forward to the places of their destination. Recruiting  officers for the companies not filled are necessary, and I conclude are left for the purpose. The 
people have, in some measure, got through the hurry 
of harvest, &c. Hope that they will now cheerfully 
enlist and go on. 
</p><p>
Colonel Dyer and Richard Law, Esq., are directed 
to repair to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to confer with your Excellency on every subject needful for our direction, and 
for your information. You know our readiness to 
afford every assistance for our common defence. I 
am, with great esteem and regard, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jht" rel="me">JONATHAN TRUMBULL</a>.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I am honored with yours of the 1st instant, and 
although it would have made me very happy to have 
been able to procure a release of all our officers in 
captivity, I freely acknowledge and acquiesce in the 
justice and impartiality of the measures you have 
taken respecting them. 
</p><p>
We have now granted to our proportion of the six 
teen battalions the additional bounty of thirty-three 
dollars and one third, estimating that proportion at 
one thousand men. In making this estimate, we are 
governed by the proportion which the quota assigned 
by Congress to this State bears to the whole number 
to be raised, namely, as eight is to eighty-eight. This 
I trust will put the officers you have appointed in this 
State upon an equal footing with those of the eight 
regiments allotted to us before, and remove every 
impediment in the way of raising their men. 
</p><p>
I am not insensible, that the step taken by the 
New England States, of granting an additional bounty 
to their quotas of the Continental army, is objected 
to, as tending to produce discontent and disorder in 
the army. You will, therefore, permit me to state 
the reasons which have prevailed to induce the giving  it, and the manner in which this State hath been 
drawn in to accede to it. 
</p><p>
The length and severity of our winters in this cli 
mate are such, that a soldier can neither clothe nor 
support himself, or a family, so cheaply at any time 
as he can in a southern climate. Many, indeed most 
of our soldiers, have small families at home dependent, in a good measure, upon the savings they can 
make out of their wages for subsistence, which must 
always be the case while most of our youth many 
at the age of twenty-one years, or thereabouts. The 
almost total interruption of commerce, and the scarcity 
of materials for manufactures, have and must still 
greatly increase the prices of clothing and other articles, whilst the demand for all kinds of provisions for 
the army has likewise rendered every necessary article of subsistence much dearer than at the commencement of hostilities. At that time the wages given to a 
common laborer were about forty shillings per month; 
now ten dollars are rather less than a medium, and all 
articles of produce are risen in proportion. Add that 
the seaman is offered twenty dollars per month, and 
tradesmen and artificers in proportion. Neither is this 
chargeable to any ill principle, but the necessary consequence of drawing off so many of our men into the 
service. When these facts are considered, it was 
thought to be very apparent, that a New England 
soldier cannot, and in justice ought not to serve upon 
the same pay and allowances that were given in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775">1775</a>, or that one from the Southern States, when 
his expense for clothing and subsistence for himself 
and family is so much less, now can. Our people 
in general are so fully persuaded of this difference, 
it is alleged that it would be fruitless, as well as 
unjust, to attempt to engage them upon it, and vain 
to expect success in the attempt. 
</p><p>
These considerations induced the Massachusetts Assembly, in October, to offer an additional monthly pay. 
The Assembly of this State, who had before rejected 
the measure when proposed by some of their own 
members, followed their lead, and offered the same 
additional pay; but when they were advised of the 
disapprobation of Congress, and had your Excellency's 
objections laid before them, they cheerfully retracted, 
and determined to trust to the bounties and pay of 
Congress, with some encouragement in furnishing 
them with necessaries at prime cost, to induce them 
to enlist. In the mean time, all the other New England States offered large additional bounties; Massachusetts and New Hampshire, sixty-six dollars and 
two thirds ; Rhode Island, twenty dollars. It was 
soon evident, that these bounties would entice a great 
part of our men into the service of the States contiguous to us on the east and north, which, besides 
the obstruction which would thence arise to the rilling 
up our own battalions, would be highly prejudicial to 
the agriculture of this State, and, in effect, to the 
general service, as the army must still depend, for a 
very considerable part of its subsistence, on this State. 
</p><p>
In this situation the matter rested until the enemy 
took possession of Newport. It then became necessary to provide for the immediate defence of the New 
England States, and Commissioners met at <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> 
to concert proper measures for that purpose. They 
immediately agreed to raise an army of six thousand 
men for a temporary defence, until the Continental 
army might be raised. 
</p><p>
Sensible that an attempt to raise a separate army 
for their own defence, must effectually obstruct the 
raising a Continental army, and otherwise be liable 
to great objections, they considered raising the continental battalions speedily, as the only sure means 
of defence against the enemy, should they fall upon 
any of these States 5 and proceeded to deliberate upon 
proper measures for this purpose. 
</p><p>
The rapid increase of the prices of the necessaries 
and conveniences of life operates strongly to discourage 
soldiers from enlisting. These they attempted to limit 
by recommending prices to be affixed by law, beyond 
which they might not rise, by recommending that a 
stop be put to emitting further bills of credit, and 
measures to be taken to reduce the quantity now circulating. 
</p><p>
The number of men employed on board privateers 
and merchant vessels, formed another obstacle to raising  an army. They recommended an embargo upon 
all privateers and merchant vessels, except those sent 
after necessaries by permit, until the army was raised. 
The bounties offered by the other States were alleged as an impediment to raising the quota for the 
army in this State and Rhode Island. The Commissioners from this State strongly urged, that the additional bounties should be withdrawn, and encouragement, by supplying necessaries at a certain price, be 
substituted in their place. In this they were over 
ruled; and then, sensible of the mischief that must 
arise from the great bounties given by the other 
States, they consented, in case Massachusetts and 
New Hampshire would reduce their bounty to thirty-three dollars and one third, to recommend to this 
State to give the same bounty to our soldiers, which 
was agreed to, and recommended accordingly. 
</p><p>
Our Assembly, with reluctance, for the sake of 
uniformity, and to avoid what they considered as a 
greater evil, acceded to the recommendation, and 
offered the proposed bounty. 
</p><p>
I must leave the other New England States to 
give their reasons for the measures they have adopted, and only add, that it is my wish and desire that 
all jealousies and occasions of disunion and animosity 
of the several States, may be avoided and laid aside. 
It is not wonderful, that diversity of sentiments hap 
pens at a time that government is so far convulsed 
arid unhinged. It is necessary, as far as possible, to 
become all things to all men, and not suffer our enemies to avail themselves of any discord or disunion 
among these States. I am, Sir, with great truth and 
respect, 
</p><p>

SIR, 
</p><p>
I received, the 20th of last month, your Excellency's favor of the 15th, inclosing a list of the officers and companies under the new arrangement, with 
the number of men enlisted ; and, at the same time, 
another of the 17th, with the information from several persons who then had lately come out of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. 
I return my thanks for both. 
</p><p>
By accounts received from the various parts of the 
Colony, the recruiting officers, for the Continental 
service, have good success in enlisting men. 
</p><p>
The Assembly have granted Chaplains the same 
pay given last campaign, with the addition of forty 
shillings per month each, to enable them to supply 
their pulpits. 
</p><p>
Brigadier-General Prescott is not arrived. Shall give 
particular directions to prevent his escape, if he comes 
into this Colony. 
</p><p>
The 23d, yours of the 14th of December came to hand, per Messieurs Penet and De Pliarne. Every 
necessary assistance, for expediting their journey, was afforded without delay ; they set out the next 
morning. You shall be made acquainted with the Expense incurred on their account, when the same is known. 
</p><p>
The 28th instant, at evening, our General Assembly 
adjourned. There is great unanimity in our common 
cause. Among others, they passed an act for raising 
and equipping one fourth part of the militia of this 
Colony, to be forthwith selected by voluntary enlistment, with as many other able bodied, effective men, 
not included in any militia-roll, as are inclined to 
enlist, to stand in readiness as minute-men, for the 
defence of this and the rest of the United Colonies, 
with proper encouragement. Another act, for restraining  and punishing persons who are inimical to the 
liberties of this and the rest of the United Colonies, 
and for directing proceedings therein. No person to 
supply the Ministerial army or navy ; to give intelligence ; to enlist, or procure others to enlist in their 
service ; to undertake to pilot any of their vessels, or 
in any other ways to aid or assist them, on the penalty of forfeiting all his estate, and imprisonment in 
any of the jails in this Colony, not exceeding three 
years. No one to speak, write, &c., against the doing's of the Honorable General Congress, or acts of 
our Assembly, on the penalty of being disarmed, and 
rendered incapable to hold, or serve in any office, 
civil or military ; and be further punished, either by 
fine, imprisonment, disfranchisement, or to find surety 
of the peace and good behaviour. 
</p><p>
Any person or persons, who put, or shall continue 
to hold, or screen themselves under, the protection of 
the Ministerial army or navy, or aid or assist in carrying into execution the present Ministerial measures 
against America, their estates to be seized for the 
use of the Colony. 
</p><p>
A resolve to provide, so that we shall have two armed vessels, one of sixteen carriage-guns, the other fourteen ; with a schooner called the Spy, of four carriage-guns ; and four row-galleys. 
</p><p>
An act to exempt the polls of soldiers from taxes, for the last, and ensuing campaigns. Another act, for encouraging the manufactories of saltpetre and gunpowder. 
</p><p>
Hope to collect saltpetre and manufacture a considerable quantity of gunpowder early in the spring. The furnace, at Middletown, is smelting lead, and likely to turn out twenty or thirty tons. Ore is plenty. 
</p><p>
Please to favor me with an account of the quantity 
of lead received from Crown Point. From thence I 
received one hundred and eighty old gunbarrels, 
which are fitting up here, and will make one hundred 
and fifty stands of good arms. We are put to difficulty for gunlocks. Hearing that those stands, taken 
in the ordnance store-ship, had each a spare lock, thought proper to mention to you, that, if it be so, 
whether it may not be well to furnish a number for the arms fitting here. 
</p><p>
On the 29th, at evening, I met, at <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>, on 
my returning from the General Assembly, yours of 
the 23d December, and immediately sent to Captain 
Wads worth, a person employed by the Commissary-General, and much acquainted, to see if any blankets 
could be purchased, and found there are none. Many 
of our new-enlisted men, I am told, will bring blankets with them, which they get from private families. 
Those lost at the Bunker Hill fight were furnished 
in that manner, and our minute-men will supply 
themselves in that way ; but I am very doubtful of 
success, if attempted. Lieutenant-Colonel Durkee this 
day mentioned to me your direction to him on this 
head. Shall lay the same before the Committee at our next meeting. 
</p><p>
Inclosed is a copy of an Act empowering the commander-in-chief, &c., to administer an oath. Also, 
Minutes of the ordnance taken from the Ministerial troops at the several northern posts, from the 1st of May to the 13th of November, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775">1775</a>.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
In consequence of your favor, proposing a descent 
on Long Island, although I was so unhappy as not to 
be able to meet Generals Clinton and Lincoln at this 
place, as requested, I applied to the State of Rhode 
Island, and obtained their consent and orders, that 
Colonel <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, and such part of his battalion as 
shall not enlist on board the Continental vessels, 
should assist in the enterprise. Colonel <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> 
will accordingly begin his march this day for New London, and bring with him the whaleboats collected 
in Massachusetts Bay and Rhode Island, to the number of between eighty and ninety, which, it is apprehended, will be of great use to the troops ordered on 
this service, especially to secure and assist their retreat, should it be attempted to be cut off. When 
Colonel <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> arrives at New London, he has 
orders to put himself under the command of such 
General Officer as your Excellency shall appoint, 
</p><p>
I have this day conferred with Colonels Mclntosh 
and Livingston on the subject. They inform me they 
are supplied with provisions and ammunition for their 
purpose, and only want such a number of water-craft, 
as, with the whaleboats divided into three parts, in 
the whole may be sufficient to transport twelve hundred men ; as he means each division to be so placed 
at the inlets to the Island, as, if cut off from one, 
he may resort to the other to make his retreat sure, 
if necessary. These I have ordered for him, and they 
will be provided and ready without delay. 
</p><p>
The number of men he proposes to set out with 
will doubtless be sufficient for his first attempts. But 
what reinforcements will be necessary soon to follow, 
to answer every purpose, your Excellency will judge. 
They may be thrown over from Stamford or Nor walk 
very soon, if placed there. I am apprehensive lest 
some difficulties may arise with regard to the command of this detachment. Colonel Mclntosh is a 
superior officer to Lieutenant-Colonel Livingston ; and 
<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> is superior in rank to both. Colonel Livingston appears to be a young gentleman of real 
spirit and abilities, and has every advantage in his 
knowledge of the Island, and the people there. The 
other gentlemen have also their merit. May not a 
difficulty arise as to the command? I hope there will not. As the gentlemen are all well disposed, I 
hope they will cooperate to the best advantage in 
the whole. What is further necessary to render their, 
operations effectual, you will please to consider and 
direct. 
</p><p>
Our naval expedition against the ships of the enemy in the Sound is still in contemplation, and preparations are making for the same as fast as we can. 
Commodore Hopkins writes me, the 5th instant, that 
the Alfred and Hampden are ready, and that the two 
new frigates there would be ready in about a week, 
if they can be manned, neither of them having more 
than half their complement at that time. Our ship 
and brig will, we trust, be ready to join them, and 
when they are equipped it is proposed that they first 
attack the two frigates that infest the coast and 
Sound, if they, or either of them, shall appear in 
their way; otherwise they will proceed directly up 
the Sound, and give the best account they can of 
the ships this side Hell Gate, which is the principal 
object. I am now informed that the two frigates and 
the Alfred are manned from Colonel Richmond's regiment, which I hope will prove true ; but, if not, am 
in hopes they may be completed by volunteers from 
Rhode Island and New London; but if they should 
still fall short of their full complement, I beg leave 
to suggest to your Excellency whether they could 
not, without inconveniency, be filled up from some 
parts of your army, unless the row-galley men, by 
the enemy's ships passing up the North River, are 
rendered useless, in which case they may be ordered 
to some proper place along the Sound, for Commodore Hopkins to take them in. 
</p><p>
I have given Commodore Hopkins the utmost assurance to give him all possible intelligence, from 
time to time, of the enemy's ships of force this side 
Hell Gate, that he may be apprised what he has to 
encounter. To that purpose I beg leave to suggest 
to your Excellency to give orders to such commanders of the guards, or posts, in sight of the enemy's 
ships, to give me intelligence of their force, situation, 
and motions, or whether and when joined by any 
other of the enemy's ships through Hell Gate. 
</p><p>
I have heard that one twenty-four gunship of the 
enemy has already passed through to them. Since 
my last from Commodore Hopkins, am informed thai 
the <a href='/results.php?city=columbus' rel='city'>Columbus</a>, Captain Whipple, has arrived in port 
at Rhode Island. I have wrote to him to take her 
with him, which will make considerable addition to 
his force. Please to afford me your advice and fullest 
information. I cannot but flatter myself with strong 
hopes of advantages to be derived from this adventure of our ships, as well as the expedition to Long-island. Secrecy in both is of utmost importance. I 
am, with great esteem and regard, Sir,
