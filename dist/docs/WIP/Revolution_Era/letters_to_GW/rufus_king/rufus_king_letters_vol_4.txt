Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 
25th of August; and Dr. Nicholl, upon advice I have 
asked, has been so obliging as to give me information 
respecting the manner in which the order of the Court 
of Chancery should be published. In a day or two, 
I will procure its insertion in the proper newspaper. 
Some little attention will be requisite to avoid, as far 
as practicable, the great expense which commonly attends this kind of publication. The newspapers containing the notification shall be transmitted to you, 
agreeably to your directions. 
</p><p>
It is extremely difficult to form a satisfactory 
opinion respecting the probability of peace. I meet 
with few persons who appear to have much confidence 
in the success of Lord Malmesbury. The declaration 
of war by Spain, at a moment when England appeared to be making serious efforts to conclude a 
general peace, strengthens the belief of many that 
France prefers still to continue the war. All the internal movements of this Government that are visible, 
indicate a determination to prosecute the war with 
vigor. The funding of the floating debt earlier than 
usual, and at the commencement of the negotiation 
with France, when its influence upon the stocks is 
such as a measure so direct for the restoration of 
peace is calculated to produce, the augmentation of 
the militia by the addition of sixty thousand men, 
and the means employed to recruit the regular army, if peace is near, would seem to be improvideat and 
unwise ; but, if the war continues, twelve millions will 
have been funded on advantageous terms. The Government will have removed an important obstacle to 
the further use of their credit, and, by an increase 
of the internal strength of the nation, placed at their 
disposal the regular forces to be employed abroad. 
</p><p>
France will bend all her energies against that commerce in which England finds such immense resources 
to prosecute the war, not by attacking her navy, not 
by attempting the threatened invasion, but by compelling the neighbouring nations to exclude the commerce of England from the great and profitable markets of Europe. England, in turn, will endeavour to 
balance the account by conquering or emancipating 
the Colonies of Spain and France, thereby opening 
new and extensive markets in another quarter of the 
globe. Should the war unfortunately still go on, the 
meditated expedition against Canada by the Mississippi may possibly be undertaken. I think it much 
less probable, since the evacuation of our frontier 
posts by the British forces. Though I cannot seriously 
believe that such an expedition will be attempted, 
still it may be the part of prudence to consider it as 
possible, in order to guard against its mischiefs. 
</p><p>
Spain enumerates, among the injuries received from 
Great Britain, the treaty concluded with us and 
France was satisfied neither with that treaty, nor 
with the subsequent one, that was concluded at a 
fortunate moment between us and Spain. Both may 
have been dissatisfied from motives connected with 
the project of an expedition through the Mississippi. 
</p><p>
With perfect respect I have the honor to be, &c.,

Sir, 
</p><p>
I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 
22d of December. Count Rumford being in Bavaria, 
I have requested the Minister of that country at this 
Court to forward your letter to the Count with his next 
despatch. I have delivered to Mr. Fulton the letter for 
him, and, as soon as Sir John Sinclair returns to town, 
I will also deliver the letter addressed to him. I have 
before sent two copies of the Gazette, containing the 
publication of the Chancery order that you inclosed 
to me for that purpose. By this opportunity I transmit a third. 
</p><p>
Our affairs here, relative to the execution of the treaty, are in a good train. Some delays and difficulties have existed, but they exist no longer, and 
the Commissioners are going on in a satisfactory manner. In the conferences that I have had "uith this 
Government, upon these and other topics, I have 
found them candid and impartial, in as great a degree as I had expected. Several important points, 
not settled by the treaty, still remain open, and both 
time and patience are requisite, even now, to form a 
safe opinion, how far we shall in the end, be able to 
agree. I think I am not deceived in supposing, that 
a sincere and general desire exists in this country to 
live in harmony and friendship with us. This disposition is, however, fettered and enfeebled by prejudices, and opinions connected with the national commerce and marine, which make the Government slow 
and cautious in every step which has a reference to 
these important concerns. 
</p><p>
Some uneasiness has been manifest here for some 
few weeks past, concerning the situation of the British territories in the East Indies. It is not very 
easy to obtain good information upon this subject, 
but there is reason to believe, that much disaffection 
exists among the native troops in the Company's service. The establishment is understood to be twenty 
thousand Europeans, and sixty thousand native or 
black troops. Whatever the origin of these discontents may have been (and they are supposed to be 
of several years' standing), they have lately risen to 
such a pitch, that the Local Government of India has 
been compelled first to temporize, and then, as is 
commonly the consequence, to submit to measures 
they were unable to prevent. Lord Cornwallis is 
suddenly to be sent to Bengal, and with such extensive powers as, it is hoped, will enable him to restore 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> tranquillity. What may be his success, my want of 
accurate information forbids me to conjecture. 
</p><p>
From the continent, as a balance to the glory acquired by the Arch Duke, we have just received the accounts of the astonishing victories lately gained by 
Bonaparte in Lombardy. The immediate consequences must be the fall of ^lantua, and the easy subjugation of the South of Italy. 
</p><p>
Whether these victories, or any recent information from America, have had any influence with the Directory, respecting the situation of <a href='/results.php?tla=ccp' rel=''>General Pinckney</a>, 
remains to be ascertained ; but I have this morning been informed, by letters from Paris, that, on the 28th 
ultimo, the General was ordered by the Directory to leave Paris, and that he intended to depart on the 31st for Amsterdam. 
</p><p>
With perfect respect, &c., 
</p><p>
