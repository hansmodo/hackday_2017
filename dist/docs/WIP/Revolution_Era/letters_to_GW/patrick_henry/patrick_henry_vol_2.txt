DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
My great anxiety for the success of the American 
arms under your command, indus me to trouble you 
with this. Accounts from the camp are so various 
and contradictory that I know not what to rely on. 
If the weight of public affairs, under which you have 
so long labored, will permit, a few lines will be most 
welcome to me. 
</p><p>
Although it seems impossible to enlist Continental 
recruits here, yet the zeal of our countrymen is great 
and general in the public cause. I wish some proper 
exertions of that spirit were wisely directed to the 
general good. A hint from you may lead to some 
thing important,, at a time like this, when most people seem at a loss to fix on the most effectual means 
of prosecuting the war vigorously. The Assembly is 
now sitting, and I shall take pleasure in communicating to them any matter you judge proper for 
their attention. 
</p><p>
I beg leave to assure your Excellency, that with 
the most unfeigned respect, and the highest regard, 
I am, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>

SIR, 
</p><p>
Inclosed I have the honor to transmit you an ac 
count of necessaries sent off in nine wagons, for the 
Virginia regiments in Continental service. The goods have been delivered to Colonel Finnic, the Quarter 
master, and he has put them under the escort of 
Lieutenant Mennis and a party of soldiers, who, I 
trust, will deliver them safely. It is my wish that 
the troops of Virginia shall have them. I also send a list of some other articles, chiefly linens, that will 
shortly set out from our public store, for the same 
uses. 
</p><p>
Added to this supply, fifteen thousand pounds 
worth of woollens, &c., proper for the soldiers, will 
set out from Petersburg in a few days. These last 
are procured under an act of Assembly, empowering 
me to seize necessaries for our troops wherever they 
may be found. I have given orders, in consequence. 
to proper persons in different parts of the State, which 
I expect will produce many necessaries, if not enough 
for the Virginia troops". Orders are sent to both Carolinas for blankets, particularly, and soldiers clothes ; 
and nothing, possible for me to effect, will be left undone, in getting whatever the troops are in want of. 
</p><p>
I should be more particular, as to the goods seized, 
but the Commissioners have as yet sent me no distinct account of their proceedings. If it happens that 
the wants of your army are supplied in any short 
time, I beg to know it, that the execution of the 
present law for seizing goods may be stopped. 
</p><p>
I take the liberty to send, under cover to your Excellency, two letters from France, to the Marquis de la Fayette. One of them is from his lady, I believe. 
I beg to be presented to him in the most acceptable 
manner. I greatly revere his person and amiable 
character. 
</p><p>
The lenity of your publications respecting deserters 
is very apparent. But, nevertheless, a great many of 
them are yet skulking on the Eastern Shore, and 
really I think their case peculiar. Their officers took 
up the general opinion, that their service would be 
confined to that shore, and promised them to remain there. Their desertion followed upon orders to march 
away. I beg leave to observe, that, if your Excellency would offer them a pardon upon their enlistment to serve this State, it would forward the general service by enabling us to spare so many more 
troops for the Grand Army. I beg leave to assure 
you of the highest esteem and regard, with which I 
have the honor to be, Sir, your Excellency's 
Most obedient, and very humble servant, 
</p><p>

SIR, 
</p><p>
The reasons hinted in your Excellency's last favor 
are certainly of such weight as to prevent the flag-of-truce vessels, coming with stores, &c., for the Convention troops, from proceeding further than Hampton Road. Orders are, therefore, issued to-day, for 
vessels of our own to be ready at that place to convey the stores upwards to their destination, under 
the superintendence of proper Commissaries. 
</p><p>
My last accounts from the South are unfavorable. 
Georgia is said to be in full possession of the enemy, 
and South Carolina in great danger. The number of 
disaffected there is said to be formidable, and the 
Creek Indians inclining against us. One thousand 
militia are ordered thither from our southern counties ; but a doubt is started whether they are by law 
obliged to march. I have also proposed a scheme to 
embody volunteers for this service; but I fear the 
length of the march, and a general scarcity of bread, 
which prevails in some parts of North Carolina and 
this State, may impede this service. About five hundred militia are ordered down the Tennessee River, 
to chastise some new settlements of renegade Cherokees that infest our south-western frontier, and prevent 
our navigation on that river, from which we began 
to hope for great advantages. Our militia have full 
possession of the Illinois, and the posts on the Wabash; and I am not without hopes that the same 
party may overawe the Indians as far as Detroit. 
They are independent of General McIntosh, whose 
numbers, although upwards of two thousand, I think 
could not make any great progress, on account, it is 
said, of the route they took, and the lateness of the 
season. 
</p><p>
The conquest of Illinois and Wabash was effected 
with less than two hundred men, who will soon be 
reenforced ; and, by holding posts on the back of the 
Indians, it is hoped may intimidate them. Forts 
Natchez and Morishac are again in the enemy's hands ; 
and from thence they infest and ruin our trade on 
the Mississippi, on which river the Spaniards wish to 
open a very interesting commerce with us. I have 
requested Congress to authorize the conquest of those 
two posts, as the possession of them will give a colorable pretence to retain all West Florida, when a 
treaty may "be opened, and, in the mean time, ruin 
our trade in that quarter, which would otherwise be 
so beneficial. I can get no answer to this application, although it is interesting to our back settlements, and not more than four hundred men required 
for the service. 
</p><p>
I beg pardon for intruding these several subjects 
upon you. If you find leisure to make any observations upon them, they will be highly acceptable. 
With every sentiment of regard and esteem, I am, 
dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
