SIR, 
</p><p>
I have with me at this place four hundred and 
fifty of my regiment. I should before this time 
have returned to my station at Haerlem, but <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a> having ordered the three companies raised 
upon this end of Long Island for the Continental service to join their regiment at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, the 
County Committee requested me to remain here till the return of an express, which they sent to New 
York, to beg of their Congress, if possible, to prevent the three companies from being removed. The 
express has now returned, with liberty for the companies to remain here ten days from last Friday. 
It is thought best that I keep my station near New 
York, though I shall not return there till I know 
the destination of the fleet, which I understand, from 
your Excellency's information to <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Governor Trumbull</a>; 
has sailed out of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. I hope and expect such 
measures will be pursued, as will prevent their 
taking the stock from this, or the adjacent islands. 
</p><p>
The inhabitants here think that, had <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a> known their very exposed situation, he 
would not have ordered the companies away. The <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> Congress suppose they have no right to counteract his orders. They might indeed have sent 
to him, and received an answer in season, but they are so refined in their policy, have so many private views to answer, and take such infinite pains to 
keep out of the plain path, conscious, perhaps, of their own superior wisdom, that they do nothing like other people. It is now too late to send to <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a>. The Committee of Safety have therefore 
desired me to request your Excellency to continue their troops upon this station. I shall only say, that I know of no place so much exposed to the ravages 
of the enemy; and if the companies raised here, who have a great part of the good arms in the country, should be removed, and their places not supplied, I 
know of none so defenceless as this. It is my opinion, after all the soldiers are gone, that two hundred men might ravage the country, notwithstanding 
all the inhabitants could do to prevent it. From this representation I doubt not your Excellency will think proper to continue the troops raised here upon 
this station, or order others in their room. I am, with great truth and regard, your Excellency's

SIR, 
</p><p>
I herewith inclose a letter just received from <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Arnold</a>, and take this opportunity most heartily to condole with you for the loss of the brave and 
most amiable <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague'>General Montgomery</a>, and the other brave officers and soldiers who fell with him, and for 
the failure of success in the unfortunate attack upon Quebec, the particulars of which you will doubtless have received before this reaches you. 
</p><p>
I should have gone down, immediately upon hearing  of the defeat, to the camp before Quebec, but 
the necessity of securing this place and the country 
round in our interest, induced all the officers, and our 
friends here, to request me not to leave this place 
till we should have a reenforcement from the Colonies. When they arrive, I expect to proceed on 
with them. We have many enemies in this province, particularly among the clergy, who are using 
every artifice to excite the Canadians to take up 
arms against us ; but I hope to be able to prevent 
any thing of the kind. I have called in many of 
the commissions given by Governor Carleton, and 
have given out new ones under the Congress, and 
expect soon to have them spread through the country, which I expect, .and indeed I perceive already, 
that it answers very salutary purposes. After receiving new commissions, they look upon themselves 
as bound, and, unless we succeed, they will all be 
treated as traitors. I allow each parish to choose 
their own captains, a circumstance which pleases 
them much, and there have been but few instances 
that they have not chosen a zealous friend to our 
cause. The taking of Quebec must be a matter of 
the greatest consequence to the Colonies, but at 
present we are very ill provided for it. The place 
is strong. I believe they are determined to defend 
it to the last extremity. We have but about four 
tons of powder in the Province. We have, I believe, 
a sufficiency of small cannon, none larger than 
twelve-pounders, except two brass twenty-fours, which are at St. John s. We have expectations of having shot and shells cast at Three Rivers. 
</p><p>
In my opinion it will not only be necessary to 
forward men and powder from the Colonies, but 
also a number of heavy cannon, such as thirty-two 
pounders and one thirteen-inch mortar, if no more, 
and some small ones, if to be had. I understand 
that the large mortar from <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, with a number of pieces of cannon, are gone to your camp. It 
is of the greatest importance that whatever is sent 
from the Colonies should be here by the middle of 
March at furthest, for, after that time, the gentle 
men here inform me, it will be impossible to transport any thing from this place to Quebec, on account of the river being filled with ice, and the 
water, of consequence, overflows the flat country. 
Therefore, if any of our wants can be supplied from 
your camp, I could wish that whatever is sent may 
be forwarded as expeditiously as possible. I am, Sir, 
with the greatest esteem and respect, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
