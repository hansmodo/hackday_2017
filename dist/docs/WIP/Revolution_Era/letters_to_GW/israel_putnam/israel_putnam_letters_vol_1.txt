DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I received your favor of the 28th instant, and have, 
according to your direction, ordered two brigades, 
namely, <a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel='colleague'>General McDougall</a>'s and Huntington s, to 
put their heavy baggage over the river, and to be in 
readiness to march on the arrival of further orders. 
I have sent Lieutenant-Colonel Dimon to the White 
Plains, with his regiment, to relieve Colonel Cortlandt's detachment there, consisting of his own, Colonel Livingston s, and a party from Colonels Durkee's 
and Chandler's regiments. 
</p><p>
You may think it not necessary to keep a party 
at the White Plains, but, unless we do, the inhabit 
ants will be ruined; their grass, grain, and cattle 
will all be taken off by the enemy. There are seven 
hundred militia at the forts and different posts, whose 
time is out to-day, and must be discharged. I have 
advised with <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>General Clinton</a> in respect to calling in 
the militia, and concluded that one thousand should 
be called for immediately, five hundred from Connectsicut, and five hundred from this State ; and an Express was immediately sent off to <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Governor Trumbull</a>, 
requesting them to be sent without delay. But the 
season of the year renders it very difficult and doubtful whether they will turn out or not. When the two 
brigades are marched, now under orders, there will be 
left on this side the river two small brigades, consisting of two thousand three hundred and forty-seven, 
of which two thousand and fifty-one are returned fit 
for duty. Five hundred must be kept at the White 
Plains for the reasons above mentioned, five hundred 
at the Forts Independence, Montgomery, and Constitution. A subaltern's guard is kept at <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a> 
to guard the stores, another is necessary at Robin 
son's Mills for the same purpose, although, at present, the latter is only a sergeant s. The men for the 
ships and boats are principally out of these brigades, 
so that there will not be left a thousand men to keep 
up our guards, and to defend this important post and 
the passes. There are, I am well assured, five or six 
thousand troops at King's Bridge and Fort <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>. 
</p><p>
You had not received my two last letters, I perceive, at the time of writing yours. You will see, 
Sir, by this stating, how exposed and weak we are 
at this post, as well as the whole Eastern country, 
in case an attack should be made on any part. 
</p><p>
I am so unhappy as to differ from your Excellency 
with respect to the enemy's motions. Many considerations concur to evince that this post, or some more 
eastward, will be the real point of attack. This will 
divide and distract the New England militia, directly 
coincide with <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>'s operation, who is 
making his way to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, divide the Continent, facilitate the junction of their forces, and cut off all 
communication between the Northern and Southern 
States. In addition to this, their fleet was seen from 
Blue Point, standing eastward, of which I wrote you 
in my last. To draw the forces from this post, so as 
to return and get possession of the passes through 
the Highlands, is, I conceive, an object of so much 
consequence, that no cost or pains would be spared 
by General Howe for the obtainment of it. If it is 
not absolutely certain that the enemy are gone for 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, it is certain they may come here or go 
eastward; and should they, as they will, if my conjectures are right, it is certain the consequences must be very serious and unhappy, on account of so many 
of the troops being gone to the southward. 
</p><p>
If their real design is for this, or further eastward, 
it is very certain they would make as great show of 
a real intent to go to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> as possible. By 
a deserter, who canie from King's Bridge day before 
yesterday, I learn that three hundred horses, with 
wagons, are come from Long Island to King's Bridge; 
that they are building a new redoubt that is to mount 
six guns, which will be finished this week, and then 
they design to come out with a great foraging party, 
as they say; but something more is doubtless intend 
ed. But, if no more, Colonel Dimon's regiment will 
be unequal to their force, and it may be thought 
imprudent for me to leave this post. I am further 
informed by a Captain that has been in their service 
and left them, that there were two thousand men on 
Staten Island, two regiments of Hessians, and Cortland Skinner's brigade. There is a report that <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a> is at <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>. I am, most respect-fully, 
</p><p>

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
It is with the utmost reluctance I now sit down 
to inform you that the enemy, after making a variety of movements up and down the North River, landed, on the morning of the 4th instant, about three 
thousand men, at Tarrytown; and, after making an 
excursion about five miles up the country, they returned and embarked. The morning following they 
advanced up near King's Ferry, and landed on the 
east side of the river ; but in the evening part of 
them reembarked, and, the morning after, landed a 
little above King's Ferry, on the west side ; but the 
morning being so exceeding foggy concealed their 
scheme, and prevented us from gaining any idea what 
number of troops they landed. In about three hours 
we discovered a large fire at the Ferry, which we 
imagined to be the store-houses, upon which it was 
thought they only landed with a view of destroying 
the said houses. 
</p><p>
The picket and scouts, which we had out, could not 
learn the exact number of the enemy that were remaining on the east side of the river; but, from the best accounts, they were about fifteen hundred. At 
this same time a number of ships, galleys, &c., with about forty flat-bottomed boats, made every appearance of their intentions to land troops, both at Fort 
Independence and <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> Landing. Under all these circumstances, my strength, being not more than twelve hundred Continental troops and three hundred 
militia, prevented me from detaching off a party to attack the enemy that lay on the east side of the river. After we had thought it impracticable to quit 
the heights, which we had then possession of, and attack the enemy, Brigadier-General Parsons and myself went to reconnoitre the ground near the enemy, 
and, on our return from thence, we were alarmed with a very heavy and hot firing, both of small arms and cannon, at Fort Montgomery, which immediately 
convinced me that the enemy had landed a large body of men at the time and place before-mentioned. Upon which, I immediately detached off five hundred 
men to reenforce the garrison. But before they could 
possibly cross the river to their assistance, the enemy, who were far superior in numbers, had possessed 
themselves of the fort. Never did men behave with 
more spirit and alacrity than our troops upon this occasion. They repulsed the enemy three times, which 
were in number at least five to one. <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a> and General James Clinton were both present; 
but the engagement continuing until the dusk of the 
evening, gave them both an opportunity, together with 
several officers and a number of privates, to make 
their escape. 
</p><p>
The loss of the enemy in this affair, Governor 
Clinton thinks must be very considerable. Our loss, 
killed and wounded, is by no means equal to what 
he might have expected. General James Clinton was 
wounded in the thigh, but I hope not mortally. <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a> arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> the same evening, 
about eleven o clock; and, with the advice of him, 
General Parsons, and several other officers, it was 
thought impossible to maintain the post at <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> 
with the force then present, against one that the 
enemy might, in a few hours, bring on the heights 
in our rear. It was, therefore, agreed that the stores 
ought to be immediately removed to some secure 
place, and the troops take post at <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a>, until a 
reinforcement of militia should come to their aid. 
</p><p>
I have repeatedly informed your Excellency of the 
enemy's design against this post ; but, from some motive or other, you always differed with me in opinion. 
As this conjecture of mine has, for once, proved right, 
I cannot omit informing you that my real and sincere opinion is, that they now mean to join General 
Burgoyne, with the utmost despatch. I have written 
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>, and informed him of the situation of 
our affairs in this quarter. <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a> is Exerting himself in collecting the militia of this State. 
Brigadier-General Parsons I have sent off to forward 
in the Connecticut militia, which are now arriving in 
great numbers. I therefore hope and trust that, in 
the course of a few days, I shall be able to oppose 
the progress of the enemy. Time will not permit me 
to add any thing more respecting the engagement, 
only that our loss (I believe, from the best information,) does not exceed two hundred and fifty, killed, 
wounded, and taken prisoners. This evening I in 
tend writing you again, but am now very busy. I 
am, dear General, with sincere regard, 
</p><p>
Your very obedient, humble servant,

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Since I wrote you this morning, I have waited on 
<a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a>, to consult about our present circumstances, and fix upon the most effectual measure 
that could be pursued against the enemy, who are 
now landing a considerable number of troops at Fort 
Constitution, and proceeding up the river with their 
ships, galleys, flat-bottomed boats, &c. They will, from 
all appearance, be at the chevaux-de-frise in the space 
of an hour. They well know the situation of our 
troops, and I sincerely believe that their intentions 
are to make all expedition to get above us. I do 
not think weighing the chevcmx-de-frise is a matter of 
great moment to them. 
</p><p>
If they cannot effect it with the greatest ease, 
they w T ill proceed up the river with the flat-bottomed 
boats, and such small vessels as can convey the bag 
gage of the troops, stores, &c., to Half-Moon. If 
they attempt to march by land, on the west side the 
river, <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a> will annoy them as much as 
possible with about four hundred Continental troops, 
which I yesterday detached over, and the militia, 
which he is now collecting. If this side should be 
their route, I will, with the remainder of the Continental troops and the Connecticut militia (which, I am 
happy to inform your Excellency, are coming in very 
fast), oppose them to the utmost of my power. All 
our stores, baggage, &c., except a few barrels of flour 
and bread, are removed from <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>. I have now 
a small guard at that place, and, if I can with any 
safety remove it from thence, I shall be glad. All 
the ordnance stores, which are not immediately wanted, I .have ordered to the eastward. All our bag 
gage, except what is absolutely necessary, I shall 
send off in the morning to some place of security; 
after which my troops will be light, and I flatter 
myself will either be able to fight them, or keep 
pace, should they keep upon the water. 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to inform you that many more 
of our troops made their escape than what I was at 
first informed of. Colonel Dubois, who is one of the 
number, this day collected near two hundred of his 
regiment, that got off after the enemy were in the fort. 
About five o clock the enemy demanded a surrender 
of the fort; but, to their surprise, and the honor of 
our commanders, they had an answer that it should 
be defended to the utmost of their power. This renewed the action with double ardor, which continued 
till quite dark, when the enemy (who, we have since 
learnt, were five thousand in number) forced our 
lines ; after which, our troops would not surrender, 
but fought with bayonets, swords, &c., in such a manner as reflects the highest honor on our noble garrison. General James Clinton was wounded with a 
bayonet in his thigh, and a number of other officers 
and men with the same weapon. 
</p><p>
Yours, of the 1st instant, I have this day received. 
The ten pieces of artillery you mention were ordered 
from Springfield by Congress, two of which, from a 
request of General James Clinton, were sent to Fort 
Montgomery ; two I have with me ; and the other six 
are on the other side the river, with <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a>. I am, dear General, with great regard, 
</p><p>
Your obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
P. S. <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>General Clinton</a> commands the enemy in person, with two other General Officers.
