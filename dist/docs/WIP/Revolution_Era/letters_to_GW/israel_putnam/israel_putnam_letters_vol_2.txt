</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have been honored with the receipt of your two 
favors of the 8th, and imagine before this you have 
received mine of the same date, containing the disagreeable intelligence of the loss of Fort Montgomery, 
after a most spirited defence, and of our evacuating 
<a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> in consequence thereof. I congratulate you 
on the bravery of your troops in attacking and put 
ting to flight the British army, and regret the unfavorable circumstance that prevented its terminating 
in a complete victory. 
</p><p>
Last Monday, General Parsons, with about two 
thousand troops, marched down and took possession 
of <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> and the passes in the Highlands. He 
has taken a number of cattle, horses, and sheep, that 
were collected by the enemy. The enemy have burnt 
the buildings and barracks at the Village, and several 
dwelling-houses at <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>. They have demolished 
Forts Montgomery and Constitution, and are repairing Fort Clinton. Yesterday, about forty sail passed 
up the river, crowded with troops, and are now at 
anchor above <a href='/results.php?city=poughkeepsie' rel='city'>Poughkeepsie</a>, the wind not favoring. 
We were on our march after them, when I met the 
agreeable intelligence of the surrender of <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a> and his army, as prisoners of war, a copy 
of which is inclosed ; and thereupon I do most sincerely congratulate your Excellency. 
</p><p>
I have halted my troops, and am now considering 
what ought to be my next movement, I have sent 
to <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>General Clinton</a> for his opinion on the subject, 
and ordered General Parsons to spare no pains to 
find the situation and strength of the garrison at 
King's Bridge, in order to direct my future operations most advantageously. I have about six thousand troops, who are chiefly militia. I understand 
that General Campbell was killed at Fort Montgomery and several field-officers, and others of inferior rank. 
</p><p>
The enemy's loss, by the last accounts I have been 
able to get, is very considerable ; not less than a 
thousand. The two Continental frigates, and the row galley which lay above Fort Montgomery, were burnt, 
to prevent their falling into the hands of the enemy, 
for which I am very sorry, as one, I believe, might 
have been saved. 
</p><p>
I have the unhappiness to inform you, that Mrs. 
Putnam, after a long and tedious illness, departed 
this life last Tuesday night. With the highest esteem 
and respect, I am, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant,

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have been honored with the receipt of your two 
favors of the 15th and 19th instant; and have the pleasure to acquaint you that, after a tedious march, 
we are returned to this place ; the fleet passed down 
by here yesterday, and did but little damage on their 
return. 
</p><p>
Some heavy artillery, and a reinforcement of Continental troops, I am informed by General Grates, are 
on their way to join me. By a deserter, and two of 
our people who escaped from the enemy at Yerplanck's Point, day before yesterday, I am informed 
that four regiments are gone from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to reenforce General Howe, which caused General Yaughan's 
hasty return down the river, probably to increase the 
reenforcement, as fifteen hundred of the York militia 
are ordered to be drafted, to supply their place at 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. I trust and hope the succour they are 
sending will arrive too late to relieve General Howe. 
We have collected twenty-three boats that escaped 
the enemy, some of which want repairing, besides the 
boats supposed to be left up Esopus Creek, and the 
new galley, which have not been reconnoitered. 1 
shall order the boats that want repairing to be re 
paired, and some new ones to be built immediately. 
With esteem and respect, I am, affectionately, 
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Yours of the 31st October and 1st November, I 
have been favored with, and have taken the necessary precautions that your army should be supplied 
with provisions. 
</p><p>
In my last, I informed you that General Warner's 
brigade were ordered to join you ; but, as they are 
raised only till the 1st of December, the officers and 
men think it exceeding hard that they should be 
obliged to make that long march, and their times out 
soon after they could reach you. I have, in consequence of their request, detained them here, to make 
obstructions in the river. <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a> and my 
self have been down to view the forts, and are both 
of opinion that a boom, thrown across at Fort Constitution, and a battery on each side the river, would 
answer a much better purpose than at Fort Montgomery; as the garrison would be reenforced by militia with more expedition, and the ground much 
more definable. 
All these circumstances considered, we have concluded to obstruct the navigation at the former place, 
and shall go about it immediately. 
</p><p>
The cannon that were left at the forts are rendered entirely useless, except six twelve-pounders at 
Fort Constitution- and these are spiked, and the 
trunnions broke off, but may be stocked, so as to 
answer the purpose tolerably well. 
</p><p>
I yesterday received a letter from Colonel Hamil 
ton, dated at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, ordering me to send forward 
one thousand more Continental troops than was pro 
posed when he was here ; this will leave me with 
about three hundred Continental troops, and no militia except those whose times are out the first of December, to cover all this distressed country. I do not 
think I can justify myself in this, without first acquainting you; and, if I then have your Excellency's 
orders, I will, with pleasure, immediately and promptly comply with them. 
</p><p>
I am sorry to inform you that, for want of pay, 
General Poor's brigade of Continental troops have 
refused to cross the North River. The troops mutinied, the officers endeavouring to suppress them, 
and they so determined to go home, that a Captain, 
in the execution of his duty, ran a soldier through 
the body, who soon expired, but not before he shot 
the Captain through, who is since dead. I have got 
several of them in provost guard, and a general Court martial sitting for their trial. About twenty of them 
have made their escape, and gone home. I have sent 
off some light-horse, and officers of the brigade, to 
bring them back. In order to make peace, and reenforce you as soon as possible, I am endeavouring 
to borrow about one thousand or fifteen hundred 
pounds, to give them a month's pay. In the mean 
time they are curing themselves of the itch. As soon 
as this operation is over, they will march immediately. This, I acknowledge, is a bad precedent, but it 
is a worse one to keep troops ten months without pay. 
This department is absolutely in distress for money, 
and the necessary business cannot be carried on with 
out a supply is immediately sent. I am, dear General, 
very respectfully, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=isp" rel="me">ISRAEL PUTNAM</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I have just received information from Generals Dickinson arid Parsons, that Sir Henry Clinton 
has embarked about six thousand troops as a reenforcement for General Howe ; they have not yet sailed. I shall go down to White Plains this afternoon, 
to make a show there. Possibly this will prevent 
their going so soon as they would otherwise, if at 
all.

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I am favored with yours of the 4th, 5th, and 9th 
instant ; and you will see, by mine of the Vth, that 
I have detained General Warner's brigade. The New York regiments being annexed to General Poor's brigade, they are exceeding unwilling to be separated ; 
and I, knowing the disadvantages that would arise 
from their being here, have presumed, in some measure, to deviate from your Excellency's orders. Those 
regiments are principally composed of men whose for 
mer residence was within the enemy's lines ; and, the 
little time they were down in this quarter last summer, there was upwards of one hundred deserters from 
them, mostly to the enemy. We should soon lose 
the principal part of them here. Add to this, they 
have lately got some clothes and money, which puts 
them in a much better situation to march than most 
of the other Continental troops here. Besides all this, 
they began their march before I received your letter. 
This, Sir, has induced me to let them continue their 
route, and, in their stead, I have detained Wyllys's 
and Meigs's regiments, whose situation will by no 
means admit of their marching with that expedition 
which is necessary. Near one half of them without a 
shoe or stocking ; but a supply is soon expected. 
</p><p>
Colonel Charles Webb's regiment marched yester 
day. I have directed him to advise you of his route, 
by express, before he arrives. I shall be happy to 
find this step meets your Excellency's approbation. 
</p><p>
The inclosed is a copy of a letter from Colonel 
Hamilton to me, by which you will see that I am 
positively ordered to send all the Continental troops 
from here. This letter contains some most unjust and 
injurious reflections ; for I am conscious of having 
done every thing in my power to succour you as 
speedily as possible.
</p><p>
I shall go to <a href='/results.php?city=new windsor' rel='city'>New Windsor</a> this day to see <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague'>Colonel Hamilton</a> ; and, until I have your orders, I cannot 
think of continuing at this post myself, and send all 
the troops away. If they should go now, I am confident General Howe will be further reenforced from 
this quarter. For, by deserters, spies, and every other 
corroborating intelligence, there is now on York Island 
the thirty-fifth, forty-fifth, fifty-second, and fifty-seventh, 
British, four regiments of Hessians, and one of Waideck Brown's, Fanning's, Byard's, Robinson's, Ilirlehy's, and Delancy's first and second battalions of new 
levies. Some say Fanning's is at Panlus Hook, though 
that is immaterial. On Long Island, there are none but militia, By information from General Dickinson,there are about one thousand on Staten Island. 
</p><p>
I had, previous to the receipt of your letter, wrote 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Governor Trumbull</a> for a number of militia ; but I 
have my doubts whether they w T ill come or not, as 
they have been much fatigued this summer already. 
The Rhode Island expedition has been of no service 
to us. You have doubtless heard that it is dropped, 
and it is said about three thousand troops remain there. 
</p><p>
Mr. Colt has accepted his appointment as Deputy Commissary-General of Purchases. I have seen him this day. He informs me there are a number of 
cattle purchased, which shall be immediately for 
warded to you. Since I came here we have had 
near fifty deserters, some from all corps. I am, dear General, with much respect,

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I am now taking the earliest opportunity to acquaint your Excellency with my arrival in camp, to resume the command of my division. 
</p><p>
In the course of my tour to the eastward, I was 
at <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>, during the sitting of the Assembly, who 
supposed, from a resolution of Congress which then 
lay before them, that all the men raised for the public service in this State, under whatever description, 
whether artillery, dragoons, or artificers, were to be 
considered and credited as part of the eight battalions of infantry, which were assigned as a quota to 
this State for the year <a href='/results.php?year=1779'>1779</a>. 
</p><p>
This sentiment I opposed, at the time that the return of the number wanting to complete the eight 
battalions to the present establishment was laid before them. However, instead of raising fourteen hundred men, the deficiency of the two brigades under my command, they have made such deductions as 
leave, by their calculation, but six hundred men to be raised, and these are to be procured by voluntary 
enlistment. In consequence of this resolution, very few recruits, I fear, will be brought into the field, 
unless your Excellency should think proper to make some representations upon the subject to the Assembly, who will sit the next week at <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a> ; and this, 
I presume, will be of more efficacy than any other means whatever. 
</p><p>
From the letters which passed in my absence, and 
which I have seen since my return, I find there was 
reason to apprehend the enemy would have been in 
motion before this time, and that, upon these appearances, it was judged necessary for all the troops 
which were under my command to march for the defence of the posts on the North River, except the 
first Connecticut brigade, which is now held in readiness for that purpose. 
</p><p>
Although I do not in the least doubt the necessity 
and propriety of these measures, or wish to be informed of the secrets of the ensuing campaign, yet 
it is exceedingly natural for me to have some little 
curious about my future destination ; whether I am 
to command those troops which have been with me 
the winter past, or in some new department, or whether I am to remain to guard the huts at this place. 
For after <a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel='colleague'>General McDougall</a> is reenforced with the 
whole of my division (which will augment his to a 
very respectable command), nothing is said concerning the part which I am to act. However disagreeable the situation may be, I know there is a delicacy 
in thinking and treating on a subject, where one's 
self is so intimately concerned, beyond the limits of 
which, I hope I shall not be accused of passing. 
</p><p>
I am unhappy to inform your Excellency that, 
upon the removal of our detachments from the seacoast, the enemy have exhibited some specimens of 
enterprise, so little usual for them. A few nights 
since, a small party from a whaleboat landed at Fairfield, surprised and carried off Brigadier-General Silliman, of the militia, and his son Major Silliman. 
Last night, another party landed at Middlesex, near Norwalk, in quest of one Captain Selleck, who happened to be absent; but a Mr. Webb, late a Lieutenant in the train, two of the inhabitants, and the ingenious Dr. Bushnell, fell into their hands. As the 
last-mentioned gentleman, who was there in the 
prosecution of his unremitted endeavours to destroy 
the enemy's shipping, is personally known to very few 
people, it is possible he may not be discovered by 
his real name or character, and may be considered 
of less consequence than he actually is. 
</p><p>
I am this instant informed, that about fifty of the 
enemy's plunderers landed at Telleck's Farms this 
morning, and carried off every man his sheep, that is 
to say, fifty, before the militia could be collected to 
oppose them. These incursions I expect will be frequent and troublesome, but I hope not decisive, or 
very important. I am your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=isp" rel="me">ISRAEL PUTNAM</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I designed to have suggested to your Excellency the difficulties I am apprehensive will arise 
in procuring forage for the baggage-horses and teams. 
The grass is by no means sufficient to support them; 
and dry forage will be furnished with great difficulty, and I fear in very small quantities.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I cannot forbear informing your Excellency, by the 
return of Major Humphreys to camp, of the state of 
my health, from the first of my illness to the present time. 
</p><p>
After I was prevented from coming on to the 
army, by a stroke of the paralytic kind, which deprived me, in a great measure, of the use of my 
right leg and arm, I retired to my plantation, and 
have been gradually growing better ever since. I 
have now so far gained the use of my limbs, especially of my leg, as to be able to walk with very 
little impediment, and to ride on horseback tolerably 
well. In other respects I am in perfect health, and 
enjoy the comforts and pleasures of life with as good a relish as most of my neighbours. 
</p><p>
Although I should not be able to resume a command in the army, I propose to myself the happiness 
of making a visit, and seeing my friends there some 
time in the course of the campaign. And, however 
incapable I may be of serving my country, to my 
latest hour my wishes and prayers will always be 
most ardent and sincere for its happiness and freedom. As a principal instrument in the hand of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> for effecting this, may Heaven long preserve 
your Excellency's most important and valuable life. 
</p><p>
Not being able to hold the pen in my own hand, 
I am obliged to make use of another to express with 
how much regard and esteem, I am, your Excellency's 
Most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=isp" rel="me">ISRAEL PUTNAM</a>.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
By order from General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>, all the troops from this 
post, except about eleven hundred Continental and four hundred 
of the militia, are withdrawn. I have received intelligence, on 
which I fully depend, that the enemy had received a reenforcement at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, last Thursday, of about three thousand British and foreign troops ; that <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>General Clinton</a> has called in 
guides, who belong about Croton River; has ordered hard bread 
baked; that the troops are called from Paulus Hook to King's Bridge, and the whole troops are now under marching orders. 
</p><p>
Under these circumstances, and from a variety of other considerations, I think it highly probable the designs of the enemy 
are against the posts in the Highlands, or some part of the counties of Westchester or Dutchess. Should their attack be upon 
the posts in the Highlands, you cannot have the least expectation 
the posts can be maintained, with our present force, against the 
strength the enemy may, or probably will send. When you con 
sider the infinite importance of the post to the general interest 
of the country, and of this State in particular, I cannot entertain 
a, doubt of your immediate attention to the defence of it. Unless a greater force than at present is here, or appears probable to 
be here, is supplied for the defence of the post, you must be 
sensible I cannot be answerable for the defence of it. I there 
fore beg you to pay an attention to this important post, and 
afford me a reinforcement of the militia, that will enable me to 
maintain it. If it is possible for you to pay a personal attention 
to this object, I shall be happy in your counsel and assistance, 
and am, dear Sir,

believe nothing prevents them from paying us an immediate visit, 
but the contrary wind.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
This morning we had information from our guard-boats, That there were two ships of war, three tenders, and a large number 
of fiat-bottomed boats, coming up the river. They proceeded up 
as far as Tarry Town, where they landed their men. This evening they were followed by one large man-of-war, five topsail vessels, and a large number of small craft. I have sent off parties 
to examine their route, and harass their march, if prudent. 
</p><p>
General Parsons has gone down to reconnoitre. He has not 
yet returned; but by information from several different quarters, 
we have reason to believe they intend for this post. They are 
now making up, as we hear, for Croton Bridge. You will please 
to give such orders to the militia, in consequence thereof, as you 
shall think proper. I have sent the barge to you with this, and 
most sincerely wish you would come down as soon as convenient. 
I should have wrote you before, but I thought this movement 
only to drive off some cattle, &c. I am, dear Sir, with great 
regard,

By the inhabitants, who live just by Fort Independence, I am

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
In my letter of yesterday, I acquainted you of the enemy's 
having possession of Fort Montgomery. Yesterday they proceeded up the river with their ships, galleys, flat-bottomed boats, 
&c., and landed a body at Fort Constitution, took possession of 
that post, and played round "the die raux-dc-f rise a little. I expect every moment to have information that they are advancing 
up. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a> is on the west side of the river, with about 
four hundred Continental troops, which I sent him yesterday, and 
is exerting himself in collecting the militia. If they attempt to 
land on that side, he will oppose and annoy them as much as 
possible. If this side should be their object, I shall, with the remainder of the Continental troops and the Connecticut militia 
(which, I am happy to inform you, came in yesterday and the 
day before in great numbers, but, I am sorry to say, they 
already begin to run away), oppose them every way in my 
power. Certain it is, that they mean, at all events, to join <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a> without delay. They are on a desperate point; 
and I dare say that their orders are positive to join the Northern 
army, at all risks. <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>General Clinton</a> commands them in person. 
He has two general officers with him, and, I believe, between 
five and six thousand men. If they should proceed by water, I 
shall do every thing in my power to arrive at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> before 
them. Weighing the chcvaux-de-frise, I do not think is a matter 
of any moment to them. They can take a fair wind, and, with 
their flat-bottomed boats, which all have sails, go to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, or 
Half- Moon, with great expedition, and, I believe, without any 
opposition. Would it not be a matter of great importance to 
send, if you can possibly spare them, a detachment from your army towards <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, or some advantageous ground, to prevent 
them from getting between you and me ? For, if they should 
come on your rear, the situation of your army would be disagreeable.

The loss of Fort Montgomery has, instead of depressing the 
spirits of the country, animated them. So many forts and strong 
holds have been given up without fighting, that they began to 
despair, and thought that our troops would not face the enemy. 
But now they begin to be convinced of the contrary ; for the few 
brave men, who were in that fort, defended it five hours against 
at least five thousand of the enemy, determined on carrying the 
post. The garrison, in the whole, did not amount to more than 
six hundred. Notwithstanding the great superiority of the enemy, 
our troops never surrendered the fort, but fought, from one re 
doubt to another, after the enemy had got into the fort; and, 
when they could do no more, they fought their way through, and 
most of them made their escape. Colonel Dubois, who had a 
wound with a bayonet in his neck, has mustered nearly two hundred of his men, who were with him in the action, many of 
whom have slight wounds with bayonets and swords, but are in 
high spirits, and, I hope, will effect something clever.

remain at home, pray let them be mustered.

DEAR GOVERNOR, 
</p><p>
Upon your letter, and some intelligence I received from below, 
I am fully of opinion the enemy intended a desperate effort to 
relieve <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>. I had the advice of the General 
Officers here, and we were of opinion, that to keep our force collected would be the best means of preserving our safety. As it 
is uncertain which side of the river the enemy will take, and 
having it in their power to make their election (in which we 
shall be unable to follow them), to throw our main force on the 
west side of the river would leave our principal stores a prey, 
and expose the resources of this and the Northern army to be 
cut off. 
</p><p>
I have thought it advisable to order Colonel Brinkerhoff's regiment immediately to march and join you ; and, should the enemy 
succeed in weighing the chevaux-de-frise, and proceed up the 
river, I should think it advisable for you to proceed to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> 
with despatch ; and, should the number of cannon you have incumber your march, you will convey as many of them as you 
shall think proper to some place of safety, and proceed on with 
the rest. The militia of Connecticut, I hear, are coming in. I 
shall do every thing in my power to oppose the enemy, and to 
give succour to you, trusting .that, through the smiles of Heaven, 
we shall yet be free. With great esteem and respect, 
</p><p>
I am, your obedient, humble servant,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
The shipping, moving up the river, must fully convince us that 
their intentions are for <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>. It is, therefore, a matter of the 
utmost importance for us immediately to fix upon what manner 
we shall dispose of our troops. If we were convinced that <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> was able to oppose them, I think we ought not to lose 
one moment, but march immediately down to King's Bridge. 
</p><p>
I wrote <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> on Sunday, and begged of him to ac 
quaint me with his situation. Would it not, therefore, be prudent 
to keep our troops at <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a> until I receive his answer? Your immediate opinion will oblige, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your very humble servant,

SIR, Since the General wrote the within, he has received 
yours ; and I am directed by him to acquaint your Excellency, 
that he agrees with you in opinion, that moving up the river will 
be the most practicable method to be taken. The General intends 
moving up immediately ; and I am, in haste, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
T. YATES, Adjutant.

DEAR GOVERNOR, 
</p><p>
I received your agreeable favor, and congratulate you on the 
glorious intelligence it contains of the capture of <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>. I have halted my troops, who were on their march 
northward, and desirous of doing every thing to subserve our important cause, and bring our struggles to a happy and speedy 
issue. I should be glad of your opinion respecting my future 
movements whether I shall proceed to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, or remain to 
watch the motions of the enemy on the river, and protect the 
shore, or move immediately down to attack King's Bridge, leaving all the York militia in Dutchess county to guard the river. 
General Parsons, with about two thousand troops, is at <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>. 
My troops will halt upon the road where they are, till I receive 
your advice in the premises, which I request may be as speedy 
as possible ; also, that you would acquaint me whether you will 
probably be able to afford any assistance, in case it should be 
thought advisable to move down to the Bridge. With esteem 
and respect, I am, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=isp" rel="me">ISRAEL PUTNAM</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. If you should advise going to the Bridge, I desire Colonel Lamb would come down.

SIR, 
</p><p>
By the inclosed copies, the originals of which were taken yesterday, on their passage to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, your Excellency will be able 
to form some judgment of the enemy's intentions, and what is 
best to be done, as far as circumstances will admit. Would it 
not answer a very valuable purpose to get the guns out of the 
row-galley that is scuttled in Esopus Creek, as they may be turned to the annoyance of the enemy, and prevent their getting 
possession of them? If your Excellency has no capital objection to the measure, I could wish that it might be carried into execution as soon as possible. 
</p><p>
I have this morning written to <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> for some heavy cannon on travelling carriages, with fixed ammunition, and Continental troops, which if I receive, I expect to be able to oblige 
them to retire below the chevaux-de-frise. Whenever the cannon arrive, you shall be advised" previous to any operation, in order 
that we may act in conjunction as much as circumstances will permit. I am, with great regard, your Excellency's

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
The night before last I arrived at this place, and shall this 
day proceed down towards the Plains. Yesterday, General Parsons and myself were down at Eastchester, and within three miles of King's Bridge. From every appearance, the enemy seem 
much frightened. They have called in all their out guards, and 
collected their main force at the Bridge. 
</p><p>
Deserters come in very fast ; and, from every account I am 
able to procure, their strength at the Bridge is about two thousand five hundred. Inclosed you have a late paper, which, in 
my opinion, paints their distress in many particulars. When opportunity will permit, I shall be glad to see you down here. My 
compliments to your brother; and I am, dear Sir, 
Your very humble servant,
