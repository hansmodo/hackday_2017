DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have just arrived here; find only part of two 
regiments of the militia, from the Massachusetts. The 
badness of the roads hath much retarded the troops. 
I have left some of our best officers at different posts 
to forward them, and provide every necessary to facilitate their march. I flatter myself, from the provision that hath been made and is now making, that 
the time will not be long, nor the period distant, 
when they shall rendezvous at your Excellency's 
head-quarters, wherever they may be, or such other 
place to which they may be ordered. Nothing shall 
be neglected, in my power, speedily to effect this. 
</p><p>
Soon after advice was forwarded to your Excellency by Mr. Bowdoin, that the State of Massachusetts Bay had ordered out about six thousand of 
their militia, to reenforce the Continental army, the 
General Court were informed, by <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>, 
that the time for which the men, doing duty at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, engaged to serve, was near expiring; and 
that the forts there would, in all probability, be left 
in a short time too defenceless, unless they could be 
reenforced by the militia; the consequence of which 
might be extremely injurious to the cause of America. 
He therefore urged the Massachusetts to send him 
at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> some of their militia, in the most pressing 
and energetic terms, in order that he might succour those forts, if he should find it necessary. The Court 
thereon ordered two of their most western regiments to march directly for <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>. 
</p><p>
In consequence of an application from the Commissioners assembled at <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> from the New England States, appointed, among other things, to adopt 
measures for the immediate defence of the State of Rhode Island, and the neighbouring States, the Court 
of Massachusetts Bay have halted in that State the men raised to reenforce the Continental army in the 
counties of <a href='/results.php?city=plymouth' rel='city'>Plymouth</a>, Barnstable, and Bristol, which will amount to ten or eleven hundred. The remainder, from the best returns I can obtain, will a little exceed four thousand, officers included. 
</p><p>
I left <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> last Monday, in the forenoon. 
There were no late accounts from the Island of Rhode 
Island. A few days before, some ships, to the number of ten or twelve, had left it and gone up the 
Sound. Whether they had troops on board, or not, 
we could not learn. The accounts, with regard to the 
number of troops on the Island, are so various that 
no good judgment can be formed. Some positively 
affirm that there are not more than three thousand 
five hundred, others, with as much assurance, declare 
that there are nine thousand. From the best information I could obtain at Bristol and Rowland's Ferry, 
their numbers do not much exceed, if any, five thou 
sand men. Indeed, I have sometimes doubted, from 
their manoeuvres, whether they amount to that number. 
I am, with the most perfect regard and esteem, Sir, 
Your most obedient, humble servant,

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Agreeably to your Excellency's orders, I waited 
upon <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>, on my way to the militia 
who had assembled and were assembling at Manchester, on the Grants, received his instructions, and met 
the troops the 2d instant. I found only five or six 
hundred there; but one regiment was on the road 
from the Massachusetts, and about thirteen or fourteen 
hundred from New Hampshire. Before many of them 
arrived, I received <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>'s orders to join 
him, with all the troops excepting one small regiment. Part of them began their march yesterday; 
the remainder were to leave the Grants this day. The 
army here is to take post upon a small island in the 
Mohawk River, where it unites with the Hudson. 
That post is supposed to be more favorable than the 
one now occupied by them. 
</p><p>
I am to return with the militia from the Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and the Grants, to the 
northward, with a design to fall into the rear of Burgoyne, who, from the best information we can obtain, 
hath left a very naked and uncovered rear, and, if 
possible, cut off his communication with the Lakes. 
This movement, probably, will cause him to reenforce 
the several posts of which he hath possessed himself, 
and which, at all hazards, he must attempt to maintain, or induce him to make a detachment with a 
view to attack us. In either case, it will greatly 
weaken his main body, and may give the force here 
an opportunity to act against them with success. The 
Massachusetts, I hear, have ordered out two thousand 
of their militia. From the best accounts we can obtain, the enemy are not more than six thousand strong. 
If Burgoyne falls down into the country this way, I 
see nothing but he must be ruined, unless supported 
by General Howe, which, by his movements, he undoubtedly expects. 
</p><p>
I am happy to inform your Excellency, that I now 
enjoy my usual good state of health. I am, dear 
General, with sincere regard and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
