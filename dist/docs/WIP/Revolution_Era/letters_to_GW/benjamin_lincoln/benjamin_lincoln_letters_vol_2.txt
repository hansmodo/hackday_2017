MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Would not an early attempt upon the city of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, by part of the Continental troops and the 
eastern militia, be attended with great probability of 
success ? Indeed, if there was but a small prospect 
of our carrying the city, it appears to me that our collecting a respectable body of men in its vicinity 
would be attended with many good effects ; as there 
by we should probably divide the enemy, put them 
on the defensive, and oblige them to govern their 
movements by ours. We should be in a good situation to guard the North River, and even give succour to the northern parts of the State of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, 
should Britain be so infatuated as to attempt a second 
invasion thereof. We should then receive an easy 
supply of provisions and forage. We should draw the enemy from an open champaign country to one strong 
by nature, less favorable to their designs, and more 
friendly to ours. We should have our rear open to a strong and plentiful country, filled with men friendly to the common cause. We should bring back the 
war to a climate more healthy, at least for the New 
England people, than a southern one, for which reason the militia could with greater ease be drawn 
forth. We should avoid those inconveniences, which 
necessarily arise from the want of provisions and forage, when our whole force is collected in one camp, 
and have an opportunity of fighting the enemy in 
detachments, which is of importance to us, as a considerable proportion of our men will be undisciplined. 
</p><p>
I hope these suggestions do not convey the most 
distant idea of a measure injurious to the Southern 
States. Nothing can be farther removed from my 
mind than the thought that the cause can be sup 
ported but by our most vigorous, united, and confidential exertions. We are all embarked on the same 
bottom, and shall be saved or lost together. Should 
the Union be broken, and we find ourselves sinking, 
in vain will the Southern States lay the blame of the 
sad event upon the Northern, or the Northern re 
criminate upon the Southern. 
</p><p>
I am happy to inform your Excellency, that my 
wounded leg daily acquires strength, and there is no 
present appearance of any further exfoliations. It is a little shorter than the other. However, the defect 
I hope to supply by a corked shoe, and that it will 
not be long before I shall be able to walk.* I am, 
dear General, with sentiments of regard and esteem, 
Your affectionate, humble servant,

MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I was honored with your kind favor of the 7th 
ultimo, on the 19th, accompanying your valuable present, the epaulettes and sword-knot. You will permit me to return my most cordial thanks for them, 
and to assure your Excellency that this testimony of 
your approbation of my conduct fills me with the 
highest sentiments of duty and affection, will always 
be remembered with the warmest gratitude, and ranked among the first honors which have been conferred 
upon me in life. I must have been insensible, in 
deed, not to have felt this honorary, and very particular mark of respect ; blind, not to have discerned 
the candor and friendship with which I have been 
treated, from my first being honored with a command 
under your Excellency; criminally inattentive, not to 
have noticed the concern you have expressed for my 
safety and perfect recovery ; and must ever be unhappy in reflection, should I not pay you that tribute of love and esteem which justice and gratitude indispensably demand. 
</p><p>
My leg hath acquired such degree of strength, that 
I can bear considerable weight on it. There have 
been lately several exfoliations the openings are now 
small; the limb is free from pain and inflammation, and 
puts on a better appearance than it hath ever before. 
</p><p>
By the advice of my surgeons, for the sake of a 
ride, I came to this town, the week before the last, 
with Mrs. Lincoln. She was immediately taken with 
the smallpox, in the natural way, and now lies very 
ill. I am, my dear General, with regard and esteem. 
Your obliged, humble servant,

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Immediately on my arrival here, I called for a re 
turn of the troops and Continental stores in this 
State, and the State of Georgia, but I have not yet 
obtained them ; otherwise, I should have done myself 
the honor of inclosing them; but, from all I can 
learn, there are very few Continental stores in either 
of the States. 
</p><p>
The troops have been supplied by this State ; and 
the heads of the several departments of Medical, 
Commissary, and Quarter-master, when supplies were 
necessary, have applied to the civil authority (there 
being no military chest here), who granted them, or 
not, as their own judgments dictated, which mode of 
doing business often created dissensions between the 
civil and military, and a militation of orders. 
</p><p>
In this situation I found matters, and that the 
army (to use Major-General Howe's own words) "had 
been in a state of abject dependency on the civil 
authority." Indeed, the Continental officer commanding in the department has not had it in his power, 
from the want of supplies which he could control, to 
march the troops without the consent of the President of this State, however urgent the necessity. I 
hope things will be better settled, and that I shall 
never be driven to the hard necessity of altercating 
with the civil power, than which nothing would be 
more disagreeable. 
</p><p>
The enemy from St. Augustine lately marched into 
Georgia. They summoned a small fort in Sunbury, 
but, satisfied with the spirited answer given by the 
officer commanding it, retreated over the Altaniaha 
River. They plundered negroes, cattle, c., to a 
considerable amount. I am not able to learn whether 
they have left the State or not. What was their 
original motive, whether a diversion of the troops 
here, whether to cooperate with a force from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, or to secure a quantity of provisions, is not 
yet determined. I think the latter is most probable, 
though there are some reasons to suppose they expected to act in conjunction with a body from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
</p><p>
There are here very few troops, and I think a 
very small proportion of those called for by Congress 
will arrive. By the next opportunity, I hope to for 
ward the returns of the troops, and of the few Continental stores in this department. I have the honor 
to be, dear General, with the greatest esteem and 
affection, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
On the evening of the 25th ultimo, I received 
information at <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, that the enemy had arrived, with upwards of twenty ships, at Tybee, near the mouth of the River <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>, and in a harbour south of the river. The few troops at <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> were 
immediately put in motion, and marched for Georgia, 
On my way, I met an express from General Howe, 
who w^as in Georgia, informing that, on the morning 
of the 29th, the enemy landed, in force, a little 
below the town of <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> ; and that he, with five 
or six hundred men, occupied the heights in front of 
it ; but, upon perceiving that the enemy had turned 
his right, at some considerable distance, through a 
swamp he thought impassable, ordered a retreat, 
which he effected with part of the troops, though 
the enemy, it is said, were twenty-five hundred or 
three thousand strong. His loss, in men and officers, 
I inclose. What stores were lost, I cannot yet learn; 
among them were six field-pies. One of the field pies only was under the direction of Major-General 
Howe. 
</p><p>
The General speaks well of his officers and men ; 
and that more than they did, could not have been 
expected. lie retreated over the <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>. I met 
him here, where we are collecting the troops. Our whole force at this place amounts to about fourteen 
hundred. As soon as a body of men, equal to covering the State of Georgia, can be collected, we shall 
recross the <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>. It ought to be with a respect 
able force, for the communication with this State is 
frequently cut off by the <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> overflowing its 
banks, which renders the causeways impassable in 
boats or otherwise. There are no strong grounds in 
this country; many of the inhabitants of the State 
are unfriendly; and, besides, the country abounds 
with navigable rivers; all of which the enemy command, and through which they can, at any time, fall 
in our rear. 
</p><p>
I have met with almost every disappointment since 
I came into this department. After an encouragement to expect a force consisting of seven thousand 
men, besides the militia of South Carolina and Georgia, I have now only fourteen hundred. I was as 
sured that there were a great plenty of supplies 
and military stores ; instead of which, there were no 
field-pies, arms, tents, camp utensils, lead (and very 
little powder), intrenching tools; and, in short, hardly 
an article in the arsenal or Quartermaster-General's 
store, under the direction of the Commanding Officer in this department. This deficiency of stores did not 
arise from the neglect of the Commanding Officer, 
but the want of a military chest. I forbear; the 
subject is disagreeable ; for you to hear, will be 
painful. 
</p><p>
I expected, before now, to have had the honor of 
forwarding to your Excellency a return of the troops 
here, but the distracted state of affairs still prevents it. 
</p><p>
I have daily the unhappiness to see families of 
affluence fleeing before the enemy, reduced in a few 
hours to a state of want. 
</p><p>
My wound, which was nearly closed when I left 
camp, is opening again, and in a worse condition 
than it was seven months ago ; but I flatter myself 
nothing worse than some small exfoliations will take 
place. I am, my dear General, with the highest sentiments of esteem,

</p><p>
January Qth. Last evening I heard that the enemy were reenforced by troops from St. Augustine, 
and now amounted to four thousand ; and that Colonel Campbell, the Commander of the British forces 
in Georgia, had left <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>, and marched, with his 
main body, up the river, whether with a design to 
cross and attack this post or not, is uncertain.

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I had the honor of your very obliging favor of the 
28th of September, the last evening. I wish it was 
in my power to give you such an account of matters 
in this department, as would afford you some satisfaction in the perusal ; but, Unfortunately for me, and 
perhaps it may soon be more so for the public, I 
cannot do it. We remain unsupported by troops, unsupplied with many essential articles, and uncovered 
with works ; and, what adds to the unhappiness, is 
the little prospect that our affairs will speedily be in a better channel. For, with regard to troops, General 
Scott is not arrived, nor do I know when he may be 
expected, for I have not had a line from him since 
he was ordered this way ; but, from the best information I can obtain, if he comes at last, he has not 
more than four hundred men now fit for duty. 
</p><p>
That is all we are encouraged to expect from Virginia, which, with those here from that State, will 
amount to between six and seven hundred ; from 
North Carolina, we have about one hundred and fifty 
Continental troops. More may not be expected from 
them, excepting militia. What number of those may 
be sent is uncertain ; and, indeed, unless they serve 
for a longer time than the last (namely, three months 
from the time they entered this state, a time too 
short, either to learn the duty, or to be inured to 
the fatigues of the camp), little may be expected 
from them. With regard to this State, they have not, 
in their five regiments, seven hundred men fit for 
duty ; and we have no reason to expect that their 
number will be much augmented, considering the 
aversion the people have for the service here ; or that 
any permanent force will be brought by them into 
the field. For, after solemn debate in the House of 
Assembly, they resolved, that the militia should not 
be drafted to fill up the Continental battalions, and 
that the militia, when in the field, should not be under the Continental articles of war ; and refused, on 
the recommendation of Congress, to raise any black 
corps. The Georgia battalion does not amount to one hundred men in the whole ; they are not in a capa 
city to keep that number up, for they have no legislative power in the State. The militia, therefore, are 
not properly organized, nor can be ; they come out at 
their own option, and return at their discretion. 
</p><p>
Thus, Sir, you see the state of our force, and our expectations. We are very deficient in many necessary articles, such as ammunition, tent-cloth, blankets, 
clothes, c. This arises, in a great measure, from a 
large proportion of the vessels being taken, which 
were sent out hence for the public, and from others 
coming to a bad market. 
</p><p>
This town, which is the magazine of the State, and 
which, for that and many reasons, claims the attention of the enemy, and to possess themselves of which 
is among their first objects, is in a very defenceless 
situation. The works about it, begun, are not finished ; many more are necessary to be constructed, but 
from the want of negroes (the only laborers in this 
country), the matter is neglected. They have been 
sent for into the country, but, from some defect in 
the law, they are not brought in. 
</p><p>
Fort Moultrie, on Sullivan's Island, six miles from 
the town, supposed to be the key of the harbour, is 
in a very decayed state, and without a ditch, pickets, or abatis to it. The repairs of that, also, are delayed from the same cause. Two floating batteries 
have been recommended to cover the bar, and they 
would undoubtedly answer the most valuable purpose, 
as no heavy ship can come over it, unless they take 
out their guns, or they are so much careened as 
they cannot work them. These, also, though indispensably necessary to the safety of the harbour, are 
unprovided. 
By this short state of affairs, you will see what 
little expectations there are., that we shall be able to 
make any considerable defence, in case any thing 
serious is attempted here by the enemy. Besides, if 
they should attack the town, I think they will at 
tempt to amuse us in the back parts of the country, 
and keep those people at home ; indeed, there has 
been a late attempt to seize our magazines at Ninety Six and Camden. A very considerable number 
of men got in arms, but their designs were fortunately discovered, and many of them are taken. Yet 
the combination is alarming, and requires particular attention, considering what great proportion of the 
back inhabitants of these States are unfriendly and 
indifferent to the cause. 
</p><p>
I have frequently, and, I think, faithfully, represented these matters to Congress, and to this State ; 
and have endeavoured to convince them, by every argument in my power, that this State also was surely 
an object which claimed the attention of Britain, 
and policy, as it would affect us, and interest, would 
stimulate her to attempt the subjugation of it. We 
have about one thousand Continental troops in this 
State, and at <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a>, in Georgia. The Virginia dra 
goons and infantry are at <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a>. They were sent there on our retreat from before <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>, in order 
to give confidence to the inhabitants and the militia 
of the country, and to be some check on the unfriendly, and the Indians. The second, third, and 
fifth South Carolina battalions, and part of the artillery, are at Sheldon, opposite Port Royal Ferry, and 
between thirty and forty miles from the <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>, 
as a cover to the country, while the people take in 
their crops, and remove their stock, which should be 
done immediately. The first and sixth battalions are 
at Fort Moultrie, and the North Carolina troops in 
this town. 
</p><p>
As soon as it shall become necessary, I mean to 
collect the Continental troops to a point, and to 
leave the well-affected militia to cover the back part 
of the country. They will render more service there 
than in garrison. The militia in the vicinity of 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> will be called in to its aid. I have re 
quested the State to provide some secure place, properly supplied with provisions, as an asylum for the 
aged, the infirm, the women, and children ; that, in 
case of a siege, we may have no useless mouths in 
town, or any circumstance which would induce a 
more early surrender, or add to the absolutely necessary distresses of a siege. 
</p><p>
I think this town might be defended against a 
very formidable attack, if all was done for its security which ought to be done. For it is situated on a 
peninsula our lines in the rear of it are about half a mile in length, and will soon have in front of 
them, at the distance of a musket shot, a fosse, in 
which the water wilL be retained six or seven feet 
by dams, one towards Cooper, and the other towards 
Ashley River ; this completed, and the necessary 
works about the town finished, and the floating batteries provided, we should not be easily insulted, 
with a proper garrison and magazines, I am, my 
dear General, with the warmest sentiments of regard 
and esteem, unalterably yours,

</p><p>
MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I was, a few days since, honored with your Excellency's favor of the 26th of October last, by Lieutenant-Colonel Ternant. I am too fully convinced of the 
utility of the new regulations, not to afford him every 
countenance and assistance in my power; and it will 
be my greatest attention to have the troops in this 
department formed on the plan adopted for the order 
and discipline of the army of the United States. 
</p><p>
I hear, but have no official notice of it, that the 
Virginia line are ordered from the main army, to reenforce this department. If this should prove true, 
it will be fortunate indeed for this country, and, I 
think, exceedingly so for the United States and the 
cause in general ; for it is such an attention to the 
safety of this people, that, if ever an idea has been 
formed and nourished among them that they were 
neglected by Congress, it must now be removed; be 
sides the security it will afford to this State and 
Georgia. 
</p><p>
By the last accounts I have received from <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>, the enemy seem to be alarmed by the movements of the Spaniards ; and, towards the end of the 
last month, sent off the sixty-eighth regiment to St. 
Augustine, and, some say, another small corps. What 
has been the fate of Mobile and Pensacola, is uncertain; by some accounts, we have reason to believe 
that they are in the hands of the Spaniards. This I 
have from a number of deserters ; and it is since con 
firmed by Mr. Cowen, one of our officers who was lately exchanged and left <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>. I think there 
cannot be a doubt but that such a report prevails there but what gave rise to it, I know not. Though 
I have not so full evidence in favor of the report, as 
gives me satisfaction respecting the truth of it, yet 
I have thought it necessary and my duty to give 
your Excellency this hint. 
</p><p>
While I congratulate your Excellency on the success of the arms of the United States, in the department more immediately under your direction, I have 
to lament that so little has been done here, that we 
have nothing for our consolation, but that we have 
not permitted the enemy to run away with us. I 
have the honor to be, with the highest esteem, 
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

MY PEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I had, a few days since, the honor of your favor 
of the 12th ultimo, by <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Colonel Laurens</a>, announcing 
that the Virginia line were ordered to this department, than which nothing could be more acceptable, 
saving that of their not being needed. Their speedy 
arrival is an event most ardently wished for. 
</p><p>
By our late accounts from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and from a large ship being seen off this bar on the 10th, 
with troops on board, said to be from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to 
<a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>, we are led to believe that the enemy will 
be early reenforced in Georgia. From that idea, and 
from a belief that this town will be the object which 
will claim their first attention, I have requested the 
Governor of this State to order into <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a> a number of his militia, to relieve the Continental troops there; all of which I mean to draw, as soon as possible, into such post as will facilitate their being 
thrown suddenly to a point. 
</p><p>
I find myself greatly embarrassed to know what 
ground to occupy; for, if we draw them into this 
town or its vicinity, and the enemy should attempt 
the same route as the last year, we shall lose the 
advantages of opposing them at the several strong passes between this town and the <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>. If we 
should throw the troops near that river, from an idea 
that the enemy will cross it, and instead of that they 
should take shipping, and land between us and this 
town, they will shut us out of it; the consequence 
of which would, I think, be its loss. Besides, if we 
keep the troops near this town, and the enemy should 
land northward of the bar, they will, in that case, 
probably reach Haddrel's Point before us, and there 
by Fort Moultrie will be in danger. If we divide our few troops, there will be danger that we shall 
be beaten in detachment. 
</p><p>
It is, my dear Sir, among my first misfortunes, that 
I am not near enough to your Excellency to have 
the advantage of your advice and direction. But this 
I cannot enjoy. I feel my own insufficiency and 
want of experience. I can promise you nothing but a disposition to serve my country. If this town 
should be attacked, as now threatened, I know my 
duty will call me to defend it as long as opposition 
can be of any avail. I hope my inclination will coincide with my duty. 
</p><p>
If the enemy mean seriously to attack this town, 
I think, previous thereto, they will have their emissaries in the back part of this country to stimulate 
the Indians, and the unfriendly, to acts of hostility. 
We have, therefore, to guard against their baneful influence as much as possible. For this purpose, it is 
necessary that we at all times keep a body of men 
in arms near the inland frontiers. I have requested 
the Governor of North Carolina, immediately on the 
attack of this town, to embody a number of militia, 
and march them towards the frontiers of his State, 
where there are many disaffected people ; as they 
would not only quell any disturbance there, but, in 
case they should not be needed for that purpose, 
they might march this way, and serve as a reenforcement to us. 
</p><p>
Two of ours, and the French frigates, are going out 
to see what discoveries they can make. They would 
have gone sooner, but the French ships had not 
water over the bar, and ours were out of repair. 
</p><p>
I have requested the Governor of Virginia to order shoes, stockings, and other clothing to be sup 
plied the troops on their march, and that he would 
forward clothing here for their future supply. I wish, 
if you approve of the application, that you would 
support it. 
</p><p>
I am very sorry that <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Colonel Laurens</a>, after waiting a number of days, could not get a passage by 
water as he expected; for thereby, my letter to you, 
instead of being the first, was long detained, and the 
consequence was that you received the information of 
our raising the siege before <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> from Congress, 
when you ought to have had it from me. Though I 
was in hopes that I had given too great evidence of 
my attachment to you, to believe that it was from a 
designed neglect, yet I could not so fully rely on the 
candor of the world, and was afraid that it would be 
construed to my disadvantage, and that some might 
attempt to persuade your Excellency that I have not 
really that attachment and esteem which I have al 
ways expressed. I hope no such attempt has been 
made, for nothing could be more injurious.

(Since I began this letter, what was before 
conjecture, is now nearly reduced to a certainty ; 
namely, that the enemy mean a descent on this 
State, which probably will happen soon. Yesterday,a vessel was decoyed into this harbour, by a tender 
to our Continental frigates, bound from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to 
<a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>, in company with a fleet of about ninety 
sail, bound to that port, convoyed by the following ships, namely; three seventy-fours, three sixty-fours, 
one fifty-four, one forty, and one frigate ; the Europe, 
Russel, Roebuck, Robust, Renown, Defiance, Romulus, 
and Perseus. She was separated from the fleet off 
Cape Hat-terns, in a storm, about twenty days since. 
She has on board a few bales of clothing, some furniture, &c., but the whole, as it is said, of inconsider 
able amount. Passengers in her, one Lieutenant and 
one Ensign in the British service, besides other passengers; and five privates in Robinson's corps. 
</p><p>
This news has induced me to write to Governor 
Jefferson and Governor Caswell, requesting them to 
give every possible assistance to facilitate the march 
of the troops ordered from the main army to reenforce this. I have the honor to be, my dear General, with the greatest regard and esteem,

MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have received information that, on the 3d instant, 
the enemy landed about eight thousand troops, commanded by Sir Henry Clinton. If this is true, we 
may soon expect them before this town; for they 
probably know that we soon expect reinforcements. 
</p><p>
Two o clock, P. M. I have just received information that a large fleet is off. Matters are fast ripening, and will, I think, soon become very serious. 
</p><p>
Eight o clock. I am told that fifty sail of vessels 
got into North Edisto this day. 
</p><p>
February 13^, three o'clock in the morning. By a 
person just from Edisto, I learn that the number of 
vessels in at the harbour there is a little short of fifty. 
</p><p>
I am collecting the troops, and posting them in 
and near this town, saving the light-horse, and two 
hundred light troops. Those are in the southern 
part of the State, left with a view to hang on the 
enemy's left flank, should they attempt to march 
across land, and prevent the small parties strolling 
into the country, plundering, and distressing the in 
habitants. I am, my dear General, with the highest esteem, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant,

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Sir Harry seems to be collecting his force on 
James's Island, and is there throwing up some works ; 
one among the ruins of Fort Johnson, another a little to the westward of it. It is said that he is also 
throwing up a bomb-battery opposite the town. Drawing his principal force to this Island, hauling his galleys and other armed vessels of small draught of 
water near the mouth of Wappoo, collecting a number of boats there, indicate that an attempt on the 
southerly part of the town, by boats, will be made. 
It is pretty evident that he means to introduce his 
ships into the harbour, which I find he may effect 
with more safety than I once supposed he could ; for 
our frigates, which it was thought could lie before 
the bar, so as to command the entrance of it, appear to draw too much water for the purpose, and cannot 
anchor with safety nearer to it than three miles, and there they are liable to be annoyed from the shore; 
and the channel is so narrow that they cannot anchor in line of battle. It is the opinion of all the 
Captains of the ships, that they can render more 
essential services by lying abreast, and acting in con 
junction with Fort Moultrie, than by taking any 
other post. 
</p><p>
General Hogan's arrival, last night, gives great happiness and spirit to the garrison; for we were be 
fore, and are now, much too weak ; we have but very 
little support from the country militia of this State ;there are but about two hundred of them in town, 
and it will be with difficulty that they will be 
brought into it, notwithstanding the exertions of the 
executive. The spirit with which they are conducting themselves, your Excellency will learn by the 
inclosed proclamation. 
</p><p>
The southern part of the State is exposed to the 
immediate incursions of the enemy, and to the depredations of the Tories. This, at present, keeps a 
number of men in that part in arms, to protect their 
families and property, which they say cannot be re 
moved. In the middle part of the country most of 
the inhabitants are disaffected, and a few days since 
were in arms, and killed a number of people. This 
forbids any troops being drawn from that part of the 
country; force might be sent into it. The frontiers 
of the State are obliged to arm to restrain the savages, and for the defence of themselves, and the upper part of Georgia. The Eastern Shore is left for 
the defence of <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> and the sea-coast. 
</p><p>
Governor Caswell has, in the most pointed terms, 
ordered on the whole of the late drafts of three thousand. About one third of them are arrived, and 
he has directed two thousand more to embody near the bounds of the northerly part of this State, to act 
in either State, as circumstances may require. I was 
in hopes General Scott would have been here before 
now, but I cannot learn that he has yet left Peters 
burg. 
</p><p>
Our works are constantly going on, and matters 
every day grow better. The people are recovering 
their spirits, and have now high expectations. I 
have the honor to be, my dear General, with the 
highest respect, 
</p><p>

MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Since my last, the enemy have, very unexpectedly, 
brought over the ships mentioned in the inclosed 
paper. It has been thought there was not water 
enough for a sixty-four gun ship. Before they came 
into the harbour, it was determined to form a line of battle across the channel, with our ships, to act in 
conjunction with Fort Moultrie ; but afterwards, as the 
enemy were so vastly superior to our force, it was 
thought best to remove our ships up to the town in 
Cooper River, and land their heavy cannon and men. 
We are endeavouring to obstruct the channel from the town to Shute's Folly. If we should succeed, great 
good will result from the measure, as thereby we 
shall prevent the enemy from running up that river, 
and cutting off our communication with the country 
on the east. 
</p><p>
The enemy are extending their works on Ashley 
River, from the mouth of Wappoo, with a design to 
cover their stores, which they can land near the first 
work, at the mouth of the creek, and remove them a 
mile or two across land to the head of another creek, 
which empties into the Ashley, where they have a 
work also, which is opposite a good landing on this 
side. I think they will throw their troops across 
above, take post at this landing, and then transport 
their stores, which will save them a very long land 
carriage. 
</p><p>
I lament, most sincerely, that, from the want of a 
sufficient power, we cannot oppose their passing this 
river, which might easily be effected, and oblige the 
enemy to take a circuit of forty miles. General Woodford is not yet arrived. By his letter of the 
6th instant, he informs me that his troops would 
leave Petersburg the day after. His numbers, by 
some means or other, are greatly reduced. By his 
return, he has only seven hundred and thirty-seven 
fit for action. 
</p><p>
General Scott informs me that he is coming on 
without the remainder of his troops. Want of clothing 
is the cause. A few of them have been persuaded to 
take care of General Woodford's baggage. Many of 
the North Carolina militia, whose times have expired, 
leave us to-day. They cannot be persuaded to re 
main longer, though the enemy are in our neighbourhood. 
</p><p>
General Mclntosh received, a few days since, a re 
solve of Congress, founded on a letter from the Governor of Georgia, and one from the Speaker of the 
Assembly of that State, purporting that he had lost 
the confidence of the people; in which resolve he is 
suspended from acting in the Southern department. 
I have not only to lament the loss of so good an officer, but that Congress have so suddenly come into a resolution, which must wound the feelings of an 
old servant of the United States, and who, by the 
war, is reduced from a state of great affluence to 
that but a little removed from beggary. He has the 
command of the country militia of this State, now in garrison. I have the honor to be, my dear General, 
with the highest esteem,

MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The enemy crossed the Ashley, in force, near the 
ferry, on the 29th ultimo, and the next day moved 
down, and encamped about three thousand .yards from 
our lines. Before this, they had transported their 
heavy baggage, ordnance, and stores, from out of 
Wappoo, across land, about two miles, to Old Town 
Creek, on the west side of the river, opposite their 
encampment. In the morning of the 1st instant, we 
discovered that they had opened ground in several 
places in our front, about eleven hundred yards there 
from. The next night they threw up a work on our left, distance nine hundred yards. The next which 
appeared was on Cooper River, six hundred yards 
from our right ; these, and some which they have 
since raised, seem to be closed. They have been some 
nights perfecting their works, and opening lines of 
communication. What they have done seems rather 
calculated to cover their approaches, than to annoy 
us from them. 
</p><p>
Seven ships of war passed Fort Moultrie yesterday 
afternoon, and anchored near where Fort Johnson 
stood, with no other apparent injury than the loss 
of one topmast. We have been busily employed in 
throwing obstructions in their passage of the Cooper. 
I wish they may prove effectual, for it is of the highest importance for us to keep that open ; thereby 
we preserve a communication with the country, from 
which we can draw our succours and supplies. In 
order the more effectually to do this, we mean to 
throw up a work on Lempriere's, one at Cainhoy up 
Wando, where we shall have our deposit of stores, 
besides some on the several landings, on the east 
side of Cooper River. These things have been some 
time in contemplation, but the necessary works to 
be made in town have prevented their being executed. Indeed, before the Virginia troops, under General Woodford, arrived, which was on the 7th, we could 
not man them; but from the addition of that force, 
and the North Carolina militia, who are coming in, 
we hope to spare some few men for this purpose, 
and that we shall be able to draw down some of the 
militia of this State into these works, who will not 
come to town. One of the enemy's ships, said to be a transport, fell to leeward last night (within Fort 
Moultrie), which ship they burned this morning. 
</p><p>
I expect soon the remainder of General Scott's 
troops, and some militia from North Carolina. I have 
the honor to be, my dear General, with the high esteem and affection, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant,

</p><p>
GENTLEMEN, 
</p><p>
From a representation of the officers, and from my own observation, I find the men sent here from the county of <a href='/results.php?city=worster' rel='city'>Worster</a>, 
under the command of Colonel Gushing, left their homes in such 
haste, that they are by no means prepared to remain in camp 
any considerable time, and many of them had no opportunity to 
make that provision for their families left behind, which they 
would have done had they considered they were to have been 
long detained. <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a> hath repeatedly, in the most 
pressing terms, urged that all the troops in the Grants, excepting 
one small regiment, should join him. Colonel Cushing's regiment, 
excepting some who have deserted, are this day to march for 
Stillwater, which most of them cheerfully undertake, notwithstanding their peculiar situation. I hope that, as early as men can be 
raised for a time limited, these will be discharged. This, as they 
come out upon an alarm, they do expect, and I am sure it will 
give quiet, and I think, on the whole, much promote the general 
interest. 
</p><p>
The enemy have left the Grants. They collected their whole 
force at <a href='/results.php?city=fort edward' rel='city'>Fort Edward</a>, and are moving down, and seem deter 
mined to possess themselves of <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>. I hope they will meet 
with a check before they reach it; I presume they will, if the 
militia expected arrive in time. There never was an opportunity 
when we could act with so great a probability of success against 
them as the present, for they have penetrated, and are penetrating far into the country, and have left a very naked and uncovered rear ; therefore, never a greater call for the exertions of 
the people. 
</p><p>
I am very sorry that I am obliged to inform your Honors, that, 
notwithstanding the evident pressing necessity for men at Stillwater to support our brethren there, a number of Colonel Cushing's regiment left it, on finding the enemy had quitted the 
Grants, and have returned or are returning home, contrary to 
the orders and advice of their officers. 
</p><p>
They pretend to say, in their own justification, that they came 
out on an alarm, for a particular purpose, namely, to oppose the 
enemy on the Grants ; and that, as Burgoyne has withdrawn his 
troops from that quarter, they are no longer held. Would it not 
be best, whenever they are ordered out, to limit the time of their 
service, and prevent, if possible, their entertaining an idea that 
they are bound to act in any one of the United States rather 
than another? 
</p><p>
I am, &c.,

</p><p>
GENTLEMEN, 
</p><p>
The evening before the last, I received a letter by express 
from <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>, desiring me to meet at head-quarters, near Half Moon, yesterday morning, where <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>General Clinton</a> was also 
desired to attend, to confer upon a plan of our future operation. 
I met them, and returned here between two and three o'clock 
this morning. 
</p><p>
The militia from the State of Massachusetts, and others, are to 
assemble in the Grants, where, probably, they will act for a time. 
It is <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>'s earnest desire that those of them who are 
to serve to the end of November may be forwarded here as soon 
as possible. To his request you will give me leave to subjoin my 
most serious solicitations, that every vigorous exertion to forward 
the troops with rapidity, in the power of the Council, may be 
adopted ; for, in a very few days, if they are not here, the operations of the main body of the northern army will l&gt;e delayed. 
I need not represent the many ill consequences, which may, and 
probably will take place, consequent thereon. 
</p><p>
The militia from the county of <a href='/results.php?city=worster' rel='city'>Worster</a>, called for by General Stark, are coming into camp. I am sorry they did hot, on 
the road, hear that I requested them to return and urge on the 
three months men ; for thos$ who come out on the alarms cannot 
remain long in camp, and while they are out, the counties they 
respectively belong to will find it difficult to raise their three months men. That consideration hath induced to suffer them to 
return. 
</p><p>
I hear that to-morrow I may expect five companies of the 
three months men. As soon as they arrive, I shall discharge the 
whole of Colonel Cushing's ; for the discontent among them is so 
general that they will be of very little service here if they re 
main. One company of them left the camp the day before yesterday ; some left us yesterday ; some, to day ; others, I hear, 
intend to leave us on the morrow. My situation at present is 
truly disagreeable ; for what can make a man feel more so than 
to be accountable for the conduct of troops who do not hold them 
selves under obligation to obey ? I expect matters will soon be 
in a better state. 
</p><p>
I am, &c.,

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The person I sent to <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a> is returned. He had 
an opportunity to confer with him, with Fraser and others, and 
was suffered to return into the country, under the character of a 
Recruiting Officer. He informs me that the flying camp is about 
three miles below Fort Miller, on the east side of the river, and 
consists of seventeen hundred men ; that the American troops are 
about half a mile above them, and he supposes there are about 
fifteen hundred of them. About one mile above, is the German 
camp ; then the British head-quarters, number unknown. At Fort 
Edward there are about three hundred men, commanded by a 
Major; about one hundred and fifty at Fort George; about five 
hundred at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>. By every appearance, the enemy's designs are to move down the river. This is confirmed by every 
person who comes out. 
</p><p>
My informant gives it as his opinion, from the best evidence 
he could collect, that there are about six thousand European 
troops on the south of Lake Champlain. I hear, by another per 
son who left <a href='/results.php?city=fort edward' rel='city'>Fort Edward</a> the 30th ultimo, that the enemy had 
sent one English regiment, and fifteen or sixteen light field-pies, 
to Fort Anne ; and that, on the 2d instant, <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a> intended to remove his heavy cannon to Stillwater. I hope you 
will take possession before him, as I know, in that case, you will 
seriously dispute title with him; and doubt not but you will con 
vince him that his claim is insupportable. 
</p><p>
I have sent to the officers, civil and military, and to a number 
of private gentlemen in the county of Berkshire, desiring their 
aid to the Commissary, by furnishing him with teams to forward 
on the flour here as fast as possible. I have received a quantity 
of ammunition from <a href='/results.php?tla=wih' rel='colleague'>General Heath</a>; have now a good supply, 
and have good reason to believe that I shall have a sufficiency 
of flour. Beef we have in plenty. I have the honor to be, dear General,

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I am honored with your favor of the 10th instant. General 
Stark, by his last letter, informed me his troops should join your Honor ; since which, I have heard of his march ; therefore have 
inclosed your letter to him. I should not have been short of 
ammunition, had the militia from the Massachusetts attended to 
the orders of the Court, and had the ball sent from Springfield 
and <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> been of a size suitable for the muskets. 
</p><p>
On our movement this way, the few enemy, who were at 
Skenesborough, left it, after burning a number of boats. We 
have in camp about two thousand men, and now a prospect of a 
supply of flour. On the return of the scouts, now out, I expect a good account of the enemy's situation ; shall not fail, immediately, by scouts and heavier detachments, to attempt giving that 
diversion to <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a> which we contemplated my movement here would effect.

SIR, 
</p><p>
You will please to take the command of five hundred men, and 
proceed, in the best route, to cross the Narrows, as soon as may 
be, to the landing at the north end of Lake George ; and, if you 
find any of our men prisoners there, you will relieve them, and 
destroy all such boats and stores belonging to the enemy as may 
fall within your power ; and if, upon inquiry, you find that you 
can attempt <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, without risking too much, you will do 
it. As in all your movements you must be regulated by the in 
formation you receive of the situation of the enemy, which may 
be such as to render it impossible to execute these orders, you 
are, therefore, to consider them as discretionary ; and, if you find 
matters different from what hath been represented, and you can 
not prosecute the above plan, you will adopt such an one, as, in 
your opinion, will most annoy, divide, and distract the enemy. 
<a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. You will give me, from time to time, the earliest information 
possible of your movements, and of the discoveries you shall 
make. I wish you success. 
</p><p>

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I just now received your favor of yesterday's date. By a 
scout, who has been near <a href='/results.php?city=fort edward' rel='city'>Fort Edward</a>, and from one of the 
inhabitants in that neighbourhood, I have a confirmation of the 
enemy's movements mentioned in your letter. I think it is not 
probable that their design is on your post. However, I will keep 
the most watchful eye over them, and, if possible, prevent a surprise. 
</p><p>
On being informed by almost every person who came in, as 
well as by the letter you inclosed to me from General Palmer, 
of the weak state of <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, and also advised that a considerable number of our men were prisoners in the enemy's hands,, 
and kept at Lake George Landing, under a very small guard, at 
which place the enemy had a large magazine of stores ; and sup 
posing a movement that way would perfectly coincide with the 
original design of my being" sent here, namely, if possible to di 
vide and distract the enemy, I was induced yesterday, with the 
advice of the officers, to send Colonel Brown, with five hundred 
men, to the landing at Lake George, to relieve the prisoners and 
destroy the stores there ; the same number of men under Colonel 
Johnson to Mount Independence; the latter to give a diversion 
to the enemy, while the former should execute his commission, 
and, if an opportunity should offer, without risking too much, to 
push for Mount Independence, while Colonel Brown would at 
tempt <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, and, farther, to amuse and divide the enemy 
by attacking their outposts, &c. A like number of men were 
sent under Colonel Woodbridge to Skenesborough, thence to Fort 
Anne, and on to <a href='/results.php?city=fort edward' rel='city'>Fort Edward</a>. 
</p><p>
I hope these movements will meet your approbation. I should 
have mentioned the design before, and not have put the plan in 
execution without your advice, could I have been sure the in 
formation would not have fallen into the hands of the enemy. I 
supposed that you intended to hint to me your apprehension of 
danger in this way, and that I must be cautious as to what I 
wrote, when, in the close of your favor of the 10th, you say, " I 
desire you will not fail frequently to acquaint me with your movements, and, as far as is prudent, with your designs." 
I am, &c.,

DEAR COLONEL, 
</p><p>
All your movements since you left this place have [been] very 
agreeable to me. I am greatly obliged to you for your exertions, 
and am glad to hear, that with spirit the officers and men under 
you have distinguished themselves. You are all entitled to the 
thanks of the public; mine you have most cordially. 
</p><p>
I had no idea, when I wrote to General Bayley, to which 
letter you refer, of your retreating while there was a probability 
of success ; neither do I now wish it. Colonel "Woodbridge will 
afford you all the assistance in his power. I had yesterday 
<a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>'s repeated orders to join him at Stillwater. I must 
do it myself with all the troops I can collect here. He had a skirmish, the night before last, with the enemy. He took two 
hundred and fifty prisoners and three field-pies. General Warner and you must act your own judgments with respect to at 
tacking the enemy's lines, continuing the siege, or retiring. I 
am this moment going to set off; expect to see <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> 
to-morrow. I shall leave General Bayley at Castleton, who will 
afford you every in supplies. 
</p><p>
I am, &c., 
</p><p>

</p><p>
P. S. While at Skenesborough, I could get no advice from you, 
and supposed our expresses were cut off. Indeed, I was con 
firmed in this opinion, after being informed that one of our boats 
was fired on by the Tories, and one man killed. The boat went, 
as afterwards I was told, into East Bay. I therefore took post 
for one night at Castleton.

GENTLEMEN, 
</p><p>
I marched from Manchester to <a href='/results.php?city=pawlet' rel='city'>Pawlet</a>, with the troops who 
had joined me, on Monday/ the 8th. On the 14th, a party of 
five hundred men, commanded by Colonel Brown, was ordered to 
cross the Narrows in South Bay, and march for the Landing at 
the north end of Lake George, to destroy the enemy's boats 
and stores, and relieve a number of our men, prisoners there ; 
and if, upon inquiry, he found an attempt upon <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> 
might be made without risking too much, he was to do it. A 
like number was sent to Mount Independence, under Colonel Johnson, in order to divert, at least, the enemy there, and take 
off their attention from our real object, and to attack it, if a 
favorable opportunity should offer. At the same time, another 
party of about five hundred was sent, under Colonel Woodbridge, 
to Skenesborough, who were to cover Colonel Brown, and march 
on towards <a href='/results.php?city=fort edward' rel='city'>Fort Edward</a>, and give the enemy a diversion in that 
quarter. 
</p><p>
The success Colonel Brown hath met with, you learn by the 
inclosed, which is a copy of his letter to me. He hath acted 
with great spirit, and informs me that his officers and men have 
behaved with bravery. General Warner is with Colonel Johnson, 
at the Mount, and hath the general direction of the three parties, 
lie informs me, that no opportunity hath offered by which he 
might attack the lines at Mount Independence with a probability 
of success. I feel myself very happy in having him there, for I 
have the greatest confidence in his prudence, fortitude, and zeal. 
General Bayley, who was Colonel Bayley in the last war, of the 
State of New Hampshire, now on the Grants, an experienced, 
good officer, is left at Castleton, in the neighbourhood of the enemy, and will forward supplies, and join the troops, if necessary. 
</p><p>
I moved, on Wednesday, the 17th, to Skenesborough, and 
marched that way about seven hundred men, with an intention to 
move towards the North River; but the day after, before the 
troops reached me there, I had information from <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>, 
that the enemy had abandoned all their posts in their rear ; and 
proposed I should fall on the enemy's left flank. I immediately 
remarched the seven hundred men on their way back, near to 
<a href='/results.php?city=pawlet' rel='city'>Pawlet</a>. The next day, by two expresses, I received <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates's</a> orders to take post at Stillwater; for the enemy had not 
only abandoned the posts in their rear, but had broken down all 
the bridges immediately on passing them, which evidenced <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne's</a> intention to move forward, at all events. 
</p><p>
I left <a href='/results.php?city=pawlet' rel='city'>Pawlet</a> the day before yesterday (Sunday), arrived here 
last night, and expect the troops in this evening or in the morning, twelve or fourteen hundred. The number sent out is far short of what I expected. There hath been in the Grants but 
about three thousand, including three small regiments of Continental troops, the rangers from the Grants and part of their militia, the militia from Berkshire, who came for twenty days only, 
with all the Massachusetts three months men. 
</p><p>
The prisoners taken at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> may soon be expected at 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, to which place <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> hath ordered them. An 
attack on this post, from the enemy, is hourly expected.

MY DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
In compliance with your wish, that I would give you the outlines of the several movements I made in the Northern department, in the year <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>, after <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> reassumed the command, to my being wounded on the 8th of October, I offer the 
following short state of the matter. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>'s arrival in camp at the Sprouts, about twelve 
miles above <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, was announced to me in <a href='/results.php?city=bennington' rel='city'>Bennington</a>, on the 
19th of September, by his letter of that date to General Stark, 
in which he requests our ideas of a plan for the future operations of the campaign. We were fully of opinion, that a body of 
militia should be collected in the Grants, and move in the rear of <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>, as this measure would oblige him to make 
heavy detachments to secure the several posts necessary to cover 
his rear, on the doing of which the salvation of his army might 
depend. He would also be obliged to escort his provision-wagons, 
which would serve to weaken his main body, as <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> 
would have little to fear in front. Besides, this movement would 
cover a large and valuable country, filled with provisions, and re 
strain the unfriendly. 
</p><p>
Immediately on <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> receiving this letter, he ordered 
me to attend him at head-quarters. At that interview I explained 
to him fully the reasons on which our opinion was grounded. 
lie acceded to the propriety of the measure, and ordered me 
back to <a href='/results.php?city=bennington' rel='city'>Bennington</a>, to receive the Massachusetts militia, who had 
been ordered on, and to make the necessary arrangements to act 
in conjunction with him on a general plan. On the 2d of September, the Commissary reported that there was a deficiency of 
flour, which was an alarming circumstance, as our division was 
to consist of militia, who cannot long be held, without proper 
attention is paid to their supplies. I immediately wrote to the 
officers, civil and military, in the county of Berkshire, requesting 
their attention to this matter, and their aid to forward the flour stored in that part of the country. They, and the people at 
large, stimulated by the most laudable motives, soon gave us, 
though the transportation was extremely difficult, the most ample supply. From an apprehension that it might be too long 
delayed, I wrote to that county for a body of their militia, and 
requested that they would come mounted, each bringing his sack of flour. 
</p><p>
On the 7th, having received some supplies, and good assurance 
that a sufficiency would be sent on, M T e moved to Manchester, 
with the troops which were collected, and gave orders for others 
to follow as they arrived. On the 8th, I reached <a href='/results.php?city=pawlet' rel='city'>Pawlet</a> with 
part of the troops. Here we halted for the arrival of the remainder, and the stores, and to know the situation of the enemy, and 
because it was a strong post, both of our flanks being covered by 
mountains, in most places impassable, forming, at this place, al 
most the point of an acute angle, not unlike my ideas of the 
strength of Thermopylae. Thus far we could pass with wagons. 
</p><p>
On the loth, our little army being collected, which consisted of 
two thousand five hundred men, and the stores being arrived, to 
execute our general plan, which was to annoy, divide, and distract the enemy, Colonel Brown was sent with five hundred men 
across the Narrows (part of Lake Champlain, or, as it is some 
times called, South Bay), to the north end of Lake George, with 
instructions to destroy all the boats and stores there belonging to 
the enemy, and, if possible, to relieve our prisoners at that post. 
Colonel Johnson was ordered, with a like number of men, to 
Mount Independence, with instructions to attempt that post, to 
favor the designs of Colonel Brown. Colonel Woodbridge was 
ordered with five hundred men to Skenesborough, with instructions to proceed to Fort Anne, and from thence to attempt the 
enemy's post at the Mills, if it could be done without risking too 
much. Hereby he became a cover to Colonel Brown, and se 
cured his retreat, if nothing more could be effected. In order to 
give despatch to these enterprises, and ease to the troops, the 
horse, which I wrote for from Berkshire to come on with sacks, 
having arrived, they were divided among the three commands, and 
took on the flour. The beeves were kept on foot. A number of 
militia light-horse were ordered on, with their saddle-bags filled 
with spare cartridges. Thus the men moved very light, and with 
great despatch. 
</p><p>
On the 17th, after leaving four hundred men to cover the 
stores at <a href='/results.php?city=pawlet' rel='city'>Pawlet</a>, I moved with six hundred towards Skenesborough, in order to join Colonel "Woodbridge, the more effectually 
to cover Colonel Brown ; at which post I intended Colonels 
Brown and Johnson should join me, in order to move in force 
into the rear of <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>. 
</p><p>
Colonel Johnson arrived in time before Mount Independence, 
and remained there a number of days; but, finding the enemy too 
well covered to attempt an assault with a probability of success, 
he returned when ordered. The enemy having evacuated their 
posts in their rear, it became unnecessary for Colonel Woodbridge 
to proceed farther than Skenesborough. Colonel Brown's success 
you have fully represented in the following extracts from his re 
port to me. 
</p><p>
On the 19th, I received a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>, approving the measures I had taken, and expressing his wish that I 
would take a different post, as <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a> had totally 
neglected his rear. I then ordered the troops, who were on their 
march to Skenesborough, to return to <a href='/results.php?city=pawlet' rel='city'>Pawlet</a>. On the 20th, I 
received his orders to take post at Stillwater. This laid me under the necessity of giving orders to our troops, before <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> and Mount Independence, to return and join me at Stillwater, as soon as they should have succeeded, or all hopes of 
success should be cut off; and, after leaving a proper guard at 
<a href='/results.php?city=pawlet' rel='city'>Pawlet</a>, to march the troops, not on command, to Stillwater. I 
left them, on the 21st, to be marched by their proper officers, 
and reached head-quarters at Behmus's Heights, in the evening 
of the 22d. 
</p><p>
After my arrival in camp, the General gave me the right wing 
of the army, which consisted of Nixon's, Glover's, and Patterson's 
brigades, and the Massachusetts militia, as they arrived from the 
expedition northward. Thus matters remained, without any thing 
very particular, until the 7th of October. In the afternoon, the 
enemy moved with their right towards our left. The light troops 
were sent out to skirmish with them, to retard and observe their 
motions; for the General was apprehensive that they meant a 
feint on the left while they should attempt a real attack on our right. The light troops were reenforced by Poor's and Learned's 
brigade on the left. As the action became serious, they were 
reenforced by militia and detachments from the right. Towards 
evening, <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> ordered me to move with the right, and 
attack the enemy's left; but it became so dark before we could 
reach their line, that nothing happened there but some skirmishing between the advanced parties. Their right suffered greatly, 
and were driven within their lines ; and some of their outworks 
were carried by our people, and the day ended gloriously on our side. 
</p><p>
I received orders to move by daylight, in the morning of the 
8th, with the right, and attempt the enemy's lines. We advanced 
three brigades, each brigade forming a column, and marching 
from its own encampment. At the same time, there was a movement on the left. On the approach of our advanced corps, the 
enemy, after exchanging n few shots, left their lines, to be possessed by us, and took post on a height in the rear of their lines. 
Soon after this I received a wound in my leg, which prevented 
my remaining longer in the field ; and my long ill health prevented my remarking further particulars on the campaign, which 
ended with so much advantage to America, and so justly to the 
honor of <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>. 
</p><p>
I am, my dear Sir, &c.,
