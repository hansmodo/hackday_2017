I have since my return, my dear General, been looking, agreeably to your request, among my young friends, to see whether I could find among them one 
who would answer your purpose as a private Secretary, &c., &c. I have at last found a Mr. Lear, who supports the character of a gentleman and a scholar. 
He was educated at <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>, in this State. Since 
he left college he has been in Europe and in different parts of this Continent. It is said that he is a 
good master of language ; he reads French, and writes an exceeding good letter that his abilities are surpassed by few, and his integrity by none. From the 
best information I can obtain, I am induced to believe that you will find him the man you described. 
For a more particular account of character and intellect, I beg leave to refer you to the inclosed ' letter 
from my son to me. He has an intimate knowledge of Mr. Lear. If you should now be in want of his services, he will, by the first opportunity, join your Excellency's family.

The Council of the American Academy have had a meeting here this day. Among other communications 
we had a very interesting one from the Reverend Mr. West, of Dartmouth, a gentleman of great abilities and extensive information. He wrote on the 
subject of extracting, by a simple machine, without the use of fire, fresh water from salt. He informed the Academy that he was admitted into the secret 
by the original inventor of the operation, and that they are now attempting some improvements upon it. 
However, thus far they had reduced the matter to a certainty, that three gallons of good fresh water could 
be extracted from a certain quantity of sea water (I think a barrel) in seventy or eighty minutes. He 
hoped, by some little amendments they were attempting, that double that quantity would be produced in the same time. Should they never improve upon the 
present discovery, it must be considered as a very important one. With great esteem and regard,

My dear General, 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure of inclosing two newspapers, 
in which are the debates of the Convention to Saturday, the 19th. They are not forward enough to give 
your Excellency a just state of the business. I therefore am induced to observe that, yesterday, we were 
on the ninth section. The opposition seem now inclined to hurry over the business, and bring on, as 
soon as possible, the main question. However, this 
they are not permitted to do. It is pretty well known 
what objections are on the minds of the people ; it 
becomes, therefore, necessary to obviate them, if possible. We have, hitherto, done this with success. The 
opposition see it, and are alarmed, for there are a 
vast many people attending in the galleries (we now 
assemble in one of our meeting-houses), and most of 
the arguments are published in the papers. Both are 
of use. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will see, in the paper, propositions 
for adopting the Constitution on conditions. This will 
not be attended to. It is possible, if we adopt it absolutely, that the Convention may recommend certain 
amendments. It will never, I presume, be adopted 
on any conditions. It will pass absolutely, or be rejected. I have now higher expectations that it will 
pass than when I last wrote. I think the friends to 
it increase daily. However, I would not raise your 
Excellency's expectations too high. It is yet impossible to determine, absolutely, its fate. Mr. Gerry, as 
mentioned in my last, left the Convention in dudgeon. 
He has not since returned to it. I presume he will 
not return. With the highest esteem, 
</p><p>

My dear General, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will find, by the papers of yesterday, which I do myself the pleasure to inclose, that 
the Governor has taken his seat as President of the 
Convention; and that he came forward with a motion 
for the adoption of the Constitution, and subjoined a 
recommendation that some alterations may take place 
in it. The motion has taken up a considerable time. 
Those in the opposition Vv^ant the Constitution to be 
accepted upon condition that the alterations be made. 
This they will not be able to carry. 
</p><p>
Yesterday noon, a motion was made that the motion under consideration should be committed. This 
was agreed to, and a large Committee was raised, 
consisting of two members from each of the large 
counties, and of one for two small ones. It was also 
agreed that each county should nominate their own 
members, and that they should take one who had 
given his opinion for, and one who had given his 
opinion against, the Constitution, in each county wherein two were chosen. I expect they will report tomorrow afternoon, to which time the Convention stands 
adjourned. I hope good will arise from the measure, 
and that the main question will be taken by Wednesday next. The gentlemen in the opposition urge that 
the Governor's motion ought to be divided, and that 
the first question be taken simply, " Whether they will 
or will not accept the Constitution." They are opposed in this, and I hope the large Committee will 
adjust the matter, and put an end to any further 
dispute upon the question. 
</p><p>
We find ourselves exceedingly embarrassed by the 
temper which raged the last winter in some of the 
counties. Many of the insurgents are in the Convention; even some of Shays's officers. A great proportion of those men are high in the opposition. We 
could hardly expect any thing else ; nor could we, I 
think, justly suppose that those men, who were so 
lately intoxicated with large draughts of liberty, and 
who were thirsting for more, would, in so short a 
time, submit to a Constitution which would further 
take up the reins of Government which, in their 
opinion, were too strait before. I hope people abroad 
will consider this matter, and make proper allowances for a clog of this kind. I think the Constitution will pass. I have the honor of being, my 
dear General,

My dear General, 
</p><p>
The Convention this evening ratified the Constitution ; present, three hundred and fifty-five members ; 
one hundred and eighty-seven yeas, and one hundred 
and sixty-eight nays; nineteen majority in favor of 
the adoption. 
</p><p>
As I mentioned to you in my last, the spirit which operated the last winter had its influence in the appointment of members for the Convention, and was a 
clog upon us through the whole business. To this source may be ascribed the great opposition we have 
experienced through the long debates, and the smallness of the majority. I hope the neighbouring States 
will consider this, and not suffer it to weigh in their decisions. 
</p><p>
Yesterday there was a motion for an adjournment, 
which cost us the whole day. Upon the question at 
evening, there were about one hundred majority 
against it; this was a damper upon the opposition, 
and they had little hope after. When, this evening, 
the question went against them, some of the leaders 
arose, and assured the Convention, that they were convinced that the debates had been conducted with 
fairness and candor, and that they should return with 
dispositions to satisfy the minds of their constituents, 
and to preserve the peace and order of the people at 
large. I hope and trust they will, and that we shall 
soon enjoy the blessings of a good government. 
</p><p>
I shall continue to write to your Excellency, whilst 
any thing relative to this great subject shall turn up 
here worthy your notice. Forgive the haste \ the 
post-office will be shut. And believe me, with the 
sincerest esteem and regard, 
</p><p>

P. S. Upon the issue of the question, every demonstration of joy was discovered among the people.

</p><p>
My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
I have had the pleasure of receiving the several 
letters, answers to those which I have had the honor 
of writing to your Excellency. In one of my last, 
I suggested to your Excellency what appeared to me 
to be the temper of our last House of Representatives relative to the new Constitution, and my apprehensions lest the same spirit which they possessed 
would be by them diffused through the different parts 
of the State. Their professed design was to shift the 
Governor, and to appoint one, and a Lieutenant-Governor, of their own sentiments. Hence federalism 
and anti-federalism were pitted one against the other. 
The antifederalists were in hopes of throwing such an 
influence into the Government by a change of its 
officers, as to prevent an organization of the General Government by this State, should it be adopted by nine. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=joh' rel='colleague'>Mr. Hancock</a> was put up by the federalists, and 
Mr. Gerry by the opposite party, for Governor. <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague'>Mr. Adams</a> and Mr. Lincoln were put up by the federalists as Lieutenant-Governor, and General Warren by 
the other party. The division of votes between 
Adams and Lincoln, prevented a choice of Lieutenant-Governor by the people. They had about two thirds 
of the votes. General Warren had the greatest part 
of the remainder. As no person was chosen, the four 
gentlemen who had the most votes were, by our Constitution, candidates from whom the House must choose 
two, and send their names to the Senate, one of 
whom must be chosen by them Lieutenant-Governor. 
Adams, Warren, Gerry, and Lincoln, were the candidates. The votes for them by the people stood as 
follows; — Warren, six thousand one hundred and fifty-seven; Adams, three thousand four hundred and ninety-five ; Gerry, six hundred and sixty-nine ; Lincoln, 
ten thousand two hundred and four. Warren and Lincoln were returned to the Senate. They elected Lincoln, who had twenty votes out of twenty-eight. He 
accepted the trust. I hope he will discharge the duties of his office with fidelity. 
</p><p>
I have been thus particular in returning the numbers (as the contest, as I said before, seemed to be 
between the federalists and those of a different character), that you might judge of the temper of the 
people, and of the state of the parties. Federalism 
is manifestly fast gaining ground. In our last House 
of Representatives, the antifederalists could carry any 
vote they pleased; and there cannot be a doubt but, 
if it had been with them to determine the question, 
they would instantly have rejected the Constitution 
with triumph. In the present House it has, I am 
confident, a great majority in its favor, much greater 
than it had in the Convention. In this State, the 
people are manifestly returning to that train of thinking and line of duty, necessary, and indeed indispensable, to their well-being. 
</p><p>
Though the majority have much to do, yet they 
must take care that they do not do too much ; the 
utmost good temper and moderation must be used, 
and we must make haste slowly. On the whole, if 
we act with judgment, temper, and moderation, we 
shall, I have no doubt, in a short time, have a Government established, the influences of which will not 
only promote and preserve the happiness and interest of the United States, but the beneficial effects 
of it will be enjoyed by all the different nations of 
the world. 
</p><p>
I wish my most dutiful respects to Mrs. Washington, and that the children may be assured and early 
taught that <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='me'>General Lincoln</a> loves them, and that he 
wishes they may live long, live happily, and be the 
most honored and useful among their brethren. With 
the sincerest esteem, 
I have the honor of being, my dear General, &c.,

My dear General, 
</p><p>
I was early convinced, upon your Excellency's retirement from public life, that too much of your time, 
for your own happiness, was engrossed by a correspondence as extensive as is the knowledge of letters, and by the frequent visits of people throughout 
the equally extended limits. An idea that these visits were multiplied by the ease with which people 
obtained letters of introduction to your Excellency, 
has restrained me from giving such letters but in a 
few instances, lest I should be instrumental in adding to your cares, and breaking in upon your domestic tranquillity. At this day. Sir, I ought to be more 
upon my guard than ever, as your burdens are multiplied, and as joiw whole time must be engrossed 
by the important calls of your elevated office. While 
under this conviction, I hope and trust that I shall 
not exceed the bounds of propriety. I consider, however, that there are instances, which to neglect would 
be highly criminal, and might justly be considered as 
a neglect of duty to your Excellency and to the 
public. Such I consider the instance now before me. 
</p><p>
This letter will be honored by its being borne by 
the Honorable George Cabot. Feeling, as all others do, an esteem for and obligations to your Excellency, 
he intends to wait upon you and express them. I hope his business will permit him to remain a little time with you, for I am sure your Excellency will 
find him a gentleman, in all respects perfectly agreeable. From his abilities, his integrity, his knowledge 
of the world, of commerce in general, and its connections with the different nations, our interest with them 
and with each other, I cannot help considering him an honor to our country, and one of the most able 
and useful men in it. lie has been drawn into public life ; but we have not had influence enough to 
retain him. If your Excellency should have time to 
open with him on the state of trade here, on its foreign and domestic connections, you will receive a 
very judicious relation; and such a one as will be 
pleasing, and throw light on the interesting and important subject, and as free from personal views and 
those local prejudices which have so often clogged 
our public proceedings and given a false coloring to 
them, as from any man I know on earth. 
</p><p>
Fearing that he would call, as thousands of others 
must do, without being particularly known, I have 
taken the liberty to beg it as a favor that he would 
take charge of this letter, and deliver it with his 
own hand. I have been urged to this from the fullest conviction that the happiness arising from an interview would be reciprocal. Captain Brown, formerly 
of Glover's regiment, and who was with your Excellency at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, now a very respectable merchant 
in this State, will accompany Mr. Cabot. I have the 
honor of being, with the most perfect esteem, my 
dear General, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=bel" rel="me">Benjamin Lincoln</a>.
