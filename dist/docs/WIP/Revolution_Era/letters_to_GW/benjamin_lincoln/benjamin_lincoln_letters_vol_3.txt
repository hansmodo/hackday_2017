Camp, <a rel='day origin' value='25'>25</a> <a rel="month origin" value="9">September</a>,  <a href='/results.php?year=1780' rel="origin">1780</a>. 
</p><p>
My dear General, 
</p><p>
I take this early opportunity to inform your Excellency, that, in the late interview, no exchanges 
took place, and that I see little prospect that any 
will be effected while the idea remains that officers 
only are to be the subject of it. 
</p><p>
In the course of conversation with General Phillips 
(for nothing more took place between us relative to 
a general exchange of prisoners, as I early informed 
liim that I was not authorized to go into that matter), I found that he supposed the reason why we 
declined the exchange of privates, was, that we were 
unwilling to throw into their hands, in the middle of 
a campaign, such a reenforcement as they would receive by an exchange of all the privates. To obviate 
this difficulty he mentioned, that the exchange of 
privates might be postponed to some future day, say 
the first of December, sooner or later, as should be 
agreed on, but so as not to act this campaign. This, 
I hope, will remove the objections which have existed against a general exchange of privates. I think 
policy, justice, and humanity, point to the propriety 
of exchanging them, if not immediately, yet at the 
close of the campaign. Your Excellency will permit 
me to offer the reasons on which I ground this 
opinion. 
</p><p>
The men now prisoners of war (excuse the personality of my situation) are those who, from an attachment to the liberties of America, engaged in her 
cause from a reliance that they should not only find 
every support from their fellow-citizens, in the important contest, but that they should enjoy all the 
immunities and blessings peculiar to the soldier, in 
the power of the people to grant. That an exchange, 
when made a prisoner, is one of the rights of a soldier, none, I think, will deny, and that he may claim 
a release, when just and reasonable terms can be had. 
</p><p>
The long and distressing captivity which many of 
the prisoners have endured ; the severe sufferings to 
which many of them are now reduced, from nakedness and hunger, their constant attendants, and the 
want of almost every convenience and necessary of 
life, the miseries of which are augmented and embittered by the narrow limits of a loathsome jail, and their having no assurance that their sufferings will 
soon have an end, â€” call for redress. 
</p><p>
The prisoners, pained with regret, are become sore; 
their minds are soured, and their friends and connections think them neglected by the public. This may 
prevent the recruiting our battalions, and cause a 
disrelish for the service. Every thing of the kind, I 
think, should be avoided ; and this was never more 
necessary than at the present day, when it seems to 
be the general voice, that our only safety and the 
freedom of America (under the Supreme Arbiter) depend on an army raised for the war. If we should 
refuse to exchange the privates, on the proposals 
made, of man for man, it must, I think, operate powerfully on the minds of those who otherwise might 
engage in the service, when they reflect how uncertain are the events of war, and that it may be their 
lot to become the prisoners, and be destined to a 
miserable, perhaps to an endless, captivity. And, 
when the enemy shall have published their declaration of our refusal to accede to an equal and fair exchange, we may find it a matter of much difficulty 
to justify ourselves to the world at large, who will 
naturally enough suspect us of injustice in not fulfilling our public engagements, as they will accuse us 
of wanting humanity in neglecting those very men 
who have stepped forth to assert our rights. 
</p><p>
The daily decreasing of the number of the Convention troops, by deserting to the enemy, for which we 
have no compensation, and the great expense to which 
we are exposed for the support of them, and of our 
officers and men, prisoners of war with the enemy, 
must have their weight in urging to the propriety 
of an exchange. 
</p><p>
To the foregoing reasons (in my humble opinion 
sufficient in themselves) permit me, my dear General, 
to annex an apprehension for our unfortunate prisoners now in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. The enemy, supposing themselves authorized by our refusal of an exchange, mr.y, 
under the pretence of economizing provisions, providing for their own safety, or some other plausible reason, have our prisoners removed to some distant, and 
consequently disagreeable, situation, where they may 
be subjected to less expense, &c. Should an event 
of this kind take place, retaliation is hardly in our 
power, as all parts of the Continent are equally 
agreeable to the British. 
</p><p>
I hope, Sir, on a review of the matter, as the objection of reenforcing the enemy this campaign is 
removed, a general exchange will be adopted, by 
which many of your officers and men, now suffering 
under the most miserable captivity, will be released, 
and once more have the honor of fighting, under your 
Excellency's particular command, in support of that 
independence of America, which induced them to quit 
the sweets of a domestic life for the toils of a camp, 
which no one will reenter with more cheerfulness, 
than he. 
</p><p>
Who has the honor to be, &c.,

</p><p>
My dear General, 
</p><p>
I was, in the evening of the 23d, honored with 
your Excellency's favor of the 11th. No measure 
has been left untried to save the question for filling 
up our battalions for the war; but every attempt of 
its abettors for that purpose (and many there were 
in the Assembly) proved abortive. The following 
short anecdote will point your Excellency to some, 
and, I think, the principal reasons on which the 
question was lost. A venerable gray-headed old gentleman, who has lost two sons in the war, rose in the Assembly, and observed that the army must be 
filled up, and by our own children, who were afraid 
of becoming slaves, which they supposed might be 
the case if they engaged for the war. "We have," 
continued the old gentleman, " sons now grown up, 
who will readily engage for three years, and, by the 
time their services shall expire, others, now young, 
will be ready to take their places." These ideas so 
fully possessed the minds of the country members, 
that they supposed every attempt to fill up the army 
for the war would be ineffectual, serve only to waste 
the time, and probably prevent its being done, even 
for three years. 
</p><p>
Though I am myself convinced that the measure is 
wrong, and that we had better have tried to have 
raised part of the number in the first place, and 
those for the war, yet I have the pleasing satisfaction to be fully convinced that those who were of a 
different opinion acted from the purest motives, and 
the fullest conviction that it was the most elioible. 
Notwithstanding the vote passed to raise the men 
for three years, or for the war, yet I have great 
hopes, from the encouragement given to them to engage for the war, in addition to the sum to be given 
for a three years' enlistment, and. from the disposition I find in the seaports in favor of the former 
measure, that great exertions will be made by them 
and others to carry it into execution. Indeed, this 
town has already secured about one third of its men 
for this term, and expect thus to secure the remainder. 
</p><p>
The Assembly meets next week ; and, if there is 
the most distant prospect that, on a revival of the 
question, it will share a different fate from its last, 
I am positive it will be renewed. 
</p><p>
By looking back into the state of onr finances, 
and forward to the expenses which will necessarily 
be incurred the next campaign, it is found that part 
of them must be provided for by direct borrowing. 
This, I think, will have a very happy effect ; for, before we can be again trusted, we must rescind some 
former resolutions, which have not given all that protection and support to creditors which, perhaps, the 
Legislative body intended they should give ; and 
adopt an enlarged system of politics, pregnant with 
the highest justice, the most permanent security to 
individuals. This will give dignity to Government, 
array the Legislature with confidence, and clothe the 
Executive with strength and vigor ; for a government whose resolutions are equal will as certainly 
find support, as that men regard, and steadily pursue, their own happiness. 
</p><p>
I am much surprised to hear that there is so scanty an allowance of clothing in camp, as we have had, 
for so long a time, not only a good supply on hand 
in Europe and the West Indies, but, as I have the 
greatest reason to believe, a sufficiency of clothes 
within this State, brought in by our privateers, to 
clothe our army at any time within these five months 
past, five times over. Our finances, I know, are in a 
miserable situation; but I cannot believe that those 
of the several States are in so ruinous a condition 
as to prevent the purchase of so necessary an article. 
</p><p>
Though it always gives me pain to offer a sentiment, which may in the least cast a censure upon 
Congress, for I know they are embarrassed, and are 
not supported as the best good of the public evidently dictates, yet I cannot but suggest my belief, 
that the want of proper arrangements, in some degree 
occasioned those distresses of our army, consequent 
upon a want of clothing. Either the Continental 
agents should purchase the whole for the army at 
large, or the several States should be left entirely to 
clothe their own troops, without the least interference 
of the agents; for, so long as it is the joint business 
of the agents and the respective States, a mutual reliance will occasion a failure of exertion in each. 
The former method is much to be preferred, because 
there would be a greater uniformity in the clothing 
of the troops, which will, among other conveniences, 
serve to prevent the existence of jealousies, arising 
from an apprehension of different usage. If an idea 
has ever been held up, that the Continental army is 
but the union of thirteen different armies, having different interests, and, in some degree, different pursuits, and of course, that good policy requires that 
each State should secure the affections of their own 
troops, and attach them to her particular interest, 
every step I wish might be taken to bury the sentiment in oblivion, and every measure tending to support it, if another can as conveniently be adopted, be 
by no means executed. 
</p><p>
This, then, will stand as another reason why the 
Continent should clothe the troops of the respective 
States, or rather their own army. The business of 
clothing the army is exceedingly loose and irregular, 
so far that this State, even at this late hour, are uncertain, whether Congress expect that they are to 
clothe their own troops, independent of them, or not. 
As it is a matter of great importance, I hope Congress will be explicit and decided on this point. It 
is particularly necessary that they should be so, as it 
is supposed, here, that the late requisition of Congress 
for the specific articles and cash, together with what they draw from the new emission, is the whole demand on this State ; and, as I said before, part of 
this expense must be provided for b}'' borrowing. 
Should Congress think it most expedient that this 
State, or the several States, should clothe their own 
troops and credit them for the expense, in the present requisition, I am confident that if they give 
orders to this State for this purpose, they will be 
immediately executed. 
</p><p>
Colonel Henly assures me, that the goods are here, and that an immediate supply for the whole army 
can be obtained. Some have been offered him on credit. He has no orders to purchase. 
</p><p>
To clothe all the troops of the Continent can now, 
I think, be easily effected. The inclosed will show 
your Excellency, what quantity of clothing has been 
lately sent on, and what remains on hand. I hope 
the matter will not be delayed a single moment, from 
an expectation of our receiving what we have in Europe, or the West Indies. The danger of the seas, 
and the risk of capture, are too great to justify the 
least suspension. Indeed, was it to arrive at the hour 
of our procuring a full supply, should we even then 
have more on hand than sound policy would direct? 
I believe not; but am rather of opinion that a provident people, under our circumstances, would store 
three times the quantity. If, on the whole, we should 
be ordered to clothe our own troops, I wish your 
Excellency's directions whether, if it can soon be 
effected, the recruits should be detained in the mean 
time, or marched on, without delay, to camp. In either 
case, I conceive it will be necessary to send a number 
of officers to Springfield, and to this town, as those 
will probably be the two principal places at which the troops will rendezvous; for, if we mean to keep 
them from straggling, marauding, and wasting their 
time, they must be sent in bodies under proper 
officers. It appears to me, that it will be also necessary to detain some of the arms now here and which 
are ordered on, to be put into the hands of those on 
whom we can depend. They will serve as a guard 
to others of a different character. 
</p><p>
The General Court have ordered, to each man, one 
dollar a mile, to enable him to march to camp ; but 
it is so far short of the real expense, that it will 
answer no valuable purpose. Indeed, if it was adequate, I think no good would arise from the measure ; 
for, I am confident, the men will not be got to camp 
unless they are marched under the care of proper 
officers, and different magazines established on the 
route, at which the men can be regularly supplied. 
I think there should be one in this town, one in 
Worcester, one in Springfield, and one in <a href='/results.php?city=litchfield' rel='city'>Litchfield</a>. 
If your Excellency should be of opinion that the 
measure is necessary, I wish you would suggest it 
to the Governor, who, ever disposed to do right, 
doubts the propriety of his ordering these magazines 
from the specific articles called for by Congress. If 
these are not taken, it will be difficult to establish 
them. 
</p><p>
There are some matters to be attended to here, in 
the military way, which seem to be the particular 
business of your Excellency, as Commander-in-chief, 
or the Commanding Officer in a separate department. 
Am I, Sir, as senior officer here, competent to such 
business ? If I am not, and further powers from 
your Excellency should be necessary, and you should 
think proper to grant them, I hope, if it can be avoided, an idea of my being Commanding Officer in 
this department will not be held up. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c.,

My dear General, 
</p><p>
As <a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='colleague'>General Knox</a>, who well knows the state of 
our affairs here, will be with your Excellency as early as this can reach you, I may omit many matters 
which otherwise I should think it my duty to mention. 
</p><p>
I am informed that Congress have acceded to a 
general exchange, and that it is left with your Excellency to carry it into effect, at such time as you 
shall think proper. I know too well your Excellency's feelings for the distresses of those of our people 
in captivity, not to be convinced that the first proper 
moment will be seized to execute a measure which 
will so effectually promote the happiness of many, 
who, it appears to me, have deserved every attention 
from their country. 
</p><p>
The inclosed is a list of a number of good men 
(not in the line of the army), who, before I left 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, solicited my interest in procuring their 
exchange. I wish, when an exchange shall take place, 
that these persons may be subjects of it. I have no 
doubt but there are many other citizens who wish to 
be exchanged. If their names can be obtained, I hope 
they will enjoy the same benefit. I am, my dear 
General, with the greatest esteem,

jMy dear General, 
</p><p>
I was honored with your favor of this date at half 
past one, at the Landing. We have put, and are putting on board the vessels, the ordnance, ordnance stores, &c. I shall send, in the same vessels, the corps 
of artillery, corps of sappers and miners, and also 
General Hazen's regiment. By sending General Hazen's regiment, I suppose it will be unnecessary to 
send the hundred men you mentioned. I thought it 
was best to send whole corps, and not a detachment, 
as the former mode would fully comply with the 
spirit of your orders. The vessels, I expect, will leave 
this at about seven o'clock, so as to be down early 
in the morning. I have ordered them to wait on 
your Excellency for further orders. 
</p><p>
The light troops, the Jersey brigade, and Colonel Van Schaick, will leave this in the morning. As 
there are so many empty wagons, I think the troops, 
with their aid, will march with ease and despatch. 
This idea, and the necessity the French will have 
for the vessels, have induced me to send none by 
water, saving the invalids and those before mentioned. 
I shall detain one vessel to receive such of the stores 
as are in our rear with Colonel Cortlandt, and may 
not be exposed to rain. The other stores and the 
troops can go on in the same boats they have with 
them. their wagons will be made light, and sent 
round. The moment I have made the necessary arrangements, I will follow the troops, and wait on 
your Excellency at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. I am, dear General, 
With the greatest respect, yours, most obediently,

</p><p>
My dear General, 
</p><p>
As Count de Grasse cannot aid us in our most 
favorite object, an expedition against <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, and 
if an attempt to reduce it is now made, it must be 
independent of a marine force ; and as your Excellency has asked my sentiments on the propriety or impropriety of attempting it under these circumstances, 
I do, on the fullest reflection, give it as my opinion 
that it may not be done with a rational hope of success, and beg leave to subjoin the following reasons, 
on which I have founded my judgment. 
</p><p>
First. If we have no ships of force to cover us, and 
to possess the harbour, we shall be reduced entirely to a land operation, and must regularly approach 
the works of the town, in doing which, we must contend with a heavy train of artillery. This will make 
it necessary for us to carry forward one equal, at 
least, which, together with the necessary stores for 
a siege, if I may judge by the quantity brought here, 
and by what was used by the enemy in the reduction of the place, will exceed, upon a moderate computation, twenty-five hundred tons. Add to that the 
baggage of the army, the stores in the Quarter-master's, Commissary's, and Hospital departments, and the 
whole will not be less than three thousand tons, to 
transport which it will be difficult, if not impossible, 
to provide teams. 
</p><p>
Secondly. As we must travel through a barren and 
a thinly inhabited country, where forage cannot be 
obtained but at a great distance, to remove which it 
would require a large additional number of teams 
(as three thousand bushels of corn will be necessary 
for each day's consumption, besides fodder), this also 
would be too great a demand for the country to 
bear, with others which would be increased by so 
large an army being in it. 
</p><p>
The removing such a force, with the necessaries for 
a siege, through an extent of country of four or five hundred miles, cut by many navigable rivers, unprovided with suitable boats for speedy transportation, 
would cause so great a delay as to shade, at least, 
every hope of success ; and especially if the harbour of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> should remain open, during that 
time, for the reception of such supplies and reenforcements as should be thought necessary by the enemy 
to baffle our attempt. 
</p><p>
Other reasons might be added, such as the ease 
with which the enemy might shift their situation, 
should they find it necessary; the impossibility of 
bringing off the artillery and stores, should the expedition fail; for a sufficiency of horses for this and 
other necessary purposes of the army could not be 
supplied. But I am confident I need not proceed. 
</p><p>
If the siege of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> should not be attempted 
this winter, the troops south of the Delaware will be 
such a reenforcement to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> as will put 
it in his power, with the present force of the enemy, 
to cover the country, and reduce the British to the 
lines of the town. The other troops will be refreshed 
by going northward to their winter-quarters, which 
will also cover that part of the country. By the 
French remaining in this State, they will hold a position convenient to give aid, either north or south, as 
circumstances shall demand. I have the honor to be, 
my dear General, with every sentiment of esteem, 
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

My dear General, 
</p><p>
I was yesterday honored with your Excellency's 
favor of the 26th ultimo, covering a letter from Sir 
Henry Clinton to me. I cannot but hope you have 
a little misapprehended him, and that it was not his 
intention to make my exchange depend absolutely on 
the exchange of the southern army. Did I fully believe this to be his meaning, I should suppose no 
advantages would result from my meeting Major-General Phillips, while there are any reasons existing in your Excellency's mind, which would make it 
improper, at this time, to go into a general exchange ; 
but, as I flatter myself he meant only to involve in 
my exchange that of General Phillips and General Riedesel, I think my meeting General Phillips will 
accelerate my exchange. I therefore will do myself 
the pleasure of waiting on your Excellency, on the 
10th of September, and hope then to have the honor 
of your instructions on the business I may have to 
transact. 
</p><p>
I propose to meet General Phillips at <a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a>, on the 12th of next month. If your Excellency's permission is necessary, for him to meet me at 
that place, I wish it might be sent to him. I have 
inclosed my letter to <a href='/results.php?tla=jac' rel='colleague'>General Clinton</a>, under a flying 
seal, which, if agreeable to your Excellency, I wish 
to have forwarded. I have the honor to be, my dear

Most obedient and most humble servant,

My dear General, 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to inform you that <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Laurens</a> sailed on the loth, after waiting several days 
in Nantasket Road for a fair wind. On his arrival here, he found the Alliance had not completed her 
crew, and that it would be difficult soon to effect it. 
This induced him to apply to the Navy Board to obtain from the General Court a power to impress, 
which not only failed in the House, but so alarmed 
the sailors, that some secreted themselves, and others 
left the town; so that, although the Assembly ordered the bounty increased out of their own chest, and 
afterwards gave a permission to enlist out of The State troops, a deficiency still existed, and the ship 
was detained solely by the want of a crew. This 
being represented by <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Laurens</a>, and the importance of his mission, joined by his request that I 
would aid in completing the crew of the Alliance by 
suffering the sea-officers to engage such of the recruits 
of this State, as were qualified for the marine service, induced me to permit it and eight or ten of the recruits, and about the same number of invalids, went 
on board, which I hope will meet with your Excellency's approbation. 
</p><p>
I have been frequently applied to for warrants for the pay of the invalids and others. Have I power 
to grant such warrants ? The late Lieutenant-Colonel Loring has been to Congress, I suppose, to solicit a 
new hearing. From the papers he showed me in September last, I thought that he had such new and 
material evidence to offer in his case, as gave flattering hopes that he would obtain his wishes, and prove 
himself an honest man. I know his circumstances to be such as forbid his remaining longer from his family, without great injury to himself and them. Give 
me leave to beg, my dear Sir, if he is to enjoy the benefit of a new hearing, that he may, as early as possible, have that favor. 
</p><p>
There are many deserters strolling through the 
country, who, I suppose, would return to their duty, 
if they could hope for a pardon. But past omissions 
to embrace the mercy so often held out to them, have, 
I presume, prevented your Excellency from repeating 
once more that which has been attended with so 
little success. Though I cannot solicit your Excellency in behalf of these infatuated men, without hurting 
your feelings (for I am confident your willingness to 
save has known no other hounds than the utmost 
limits of mercy to the wicked, which could he exercised short of cruelty to the good), yet I have my 
wishes that the most virtuous, if virtue can be applied to any of them, might he encouraged to hope 
for an opportunity of evidencing the sincerity of their 
repentance by future obedience, and rewarded accordingly. I have the honor to be, my dear General, 
with every sentiment of esteem. 
</p><p>
Yours, &c.,
