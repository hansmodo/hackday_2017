SIR, 
</p><p>
I have the honor of imparting to your Excellency 
the arrival of the King's fleet, charged by his Majesty with the glorious task of giving his allies, the 
United States of America, the most striking proofs 
of his affection. Nothing will be wanting to my happiness, if I can succeed in it. It is augmented by 
the consideration of concerting my operations with a 
General such as your Excellency. The talents and 
great actions of General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> have insured 
him, in the eyes of all Europe, the title, truly sublime, 
of Deliverer of America. Accept, Sir, the homage that 
every man, that every military man, owes you ; and 
be not displeased that I solicit, even in the first 
moment of intercourse, with military and maritime 
frankness, a friendship so flattering as yours. I will 
try to render myself worthy of it by my respectful 
devotion for your country. It is prescribed to me 
by orders, and my heart inspires it. 
</p><p>
I have the honor of rendering an account to Congress of the letter I write to your Excellency. M. de Chouin, Major of Infantry in the King's service, 
has orders to present you this. I pray you to grant 
the most extensive confidence to all this officer shall 
tell you on my part. He is a near relation to M. de Sartine. This Minister has been long since known 
for his attachment to the common cause. It is less 
the desire of pleasing a statesman, honored with the 
confidence of the King, which has determined me to 
send to you M. Chouin, than an opinion of his military knowledge, the clearness of his ideas, and the 
precision with which he will communicate mine. I 
beseech you to grant him your kindness. I have the 
honor to be, with respect, Sir, your Excellency's 
Most humble and most obedient servant,

SIR, 
</p><p>
The desire of communicating speedily with your Excellency determines me to make a debarkation on 
the coast of Jersey, in a village which, according to 
the map, is to the northward of the river Shrewsbury. 
If our common enemy are in possession, and can be 
driven from it, I shall fulfil the object of my descent. 
An instant of liberty will suffice for a good patriot 
to show himself. Every citizen will be eager to convey my homage to the Deliverer of his country. The 
first moments are so precious, above all upon sea, 
that it may be of the greatest importance for me 
to be informed, four-and-twenty hours sooner or later, 
of the projects of your Excellency. I have orders to 
second them. I dare assure you that I will do it to 
the utmost of my power. To act in concert with a 
great man is the first of blessings; it is one of those 
which flatter me the most in the commission with 
which I am honored. An apprehension that the letter, of which I have now the honor to send a dupli 
cate, may not come to hand till late, makes me ha 
rd a step, the motive for which must be the excuse. 
I have the honor to be,

SIR, 
</p><p>
The bar of the River Shrewsbury, the officer, sailors, 
and boats that I have lost in the waves, have not 
hindered <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Colonel Laurens</a> from braving them twice, 
to come and deliver me himself the letter that you 
did me the honor to write me on the 14th of this month. The desire of communicating with you alone would have induced me to hard a descent myself 
the first, and with four grenadiers as my only sup 
port, in a place, the debarkation of which is as difficult as it was unknown ; and where there existed not a single spot proper for embarkation. The sacrifice 
of several of my men appeared to me less affecting, 
as it was the sole means of communication I could 
have. 
</p><p>
I have occupied myself less with discovering the 
number of English vessels of war in the Road of 
Sandy Hook, than the means of entering it. I sup 
pose there are fourteen vessels of war, a throng of frigates, and a multitude of transports. This superiority 
of number, and the goodness of the English navy, 
will not hinder me from attacking Lord Howe in his 
retrenchment, and under his batteries, if the depth of 
the water do not forbid me. I only received three pilots yesterday ; they have need of re-collecting their 
ideas, and are at this time sounding the river. The 
hope of giving you something positive on this head 
engaged me to pray your estimable, well-informed, 
and most amiable Aid-de-camp, to pass a bad night 
on board the Languedoc. 
</p><p>
He will give you an account, Sir, of the regret I 
shall feel, if this powerful mark of friendship, which 
the King has given his allies, who are so dear to 
him, should not prove of so great utility as he might 
promise himself. 
</p><p>
I will not enter into any further detail in this letter. Mr. Laurens will tell you more than I can 
write. But it will be very important that the arrival of so great a naval succour should produce at 
the same time a general effort by land. If, unfortunately, that should be impossible, you are too good a 
patriot and too good a soldier not to feel the necessity I shall be under of going to seek elsewhere an 
opportunity of injuring our common enemy. The 
places that you shall point out to me will appear to 
me preferable, whenever naval circumstances and the 
state of my supplies will permit. It is with the 
greatest pleasure that I learn, from M. Gerard, the 
King's Minister, that you are clothed with the most 
ample powers to treat with me on military operations. I cannot act, either far or near, under the auspices of a greater master. You are a master; and 
you know that, the instant one thing becomes , we ought to attempt another. 
</p><p>
I have received a printed list of the eleven English vessels of the line, which are announced to us on 
very good part. This news, published by the order 
of Congress, acquires an authenticity which merits the 
highest attention. 
</p><p>
Accept my compliments upon your last victory. 
Even were not the success of America our own, by 
the intimate bands which bind us together, it would 
be impossible, as a soldier and as a man, not to participate in it. It is natural to love to see one laurel 
more adorning the brow of a great man. I have the 
honor to be, with respect, 
</p><p>

SIR, 
</p><p>
It is difficult to console one's self for the obstacles, 
as numerous as insurmountable, which stopped me at 
Sandy Hook. The importance of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, the happiness of fighting the English fleet, and the extreme 
satisfaction of acting directly with you, made me desire, with the greatest ardor, the possibility of entering. I offered, to too little purpose, in an assembly 
of your experienced pilots, a recompense of fifty 
thousand crowns to him who should find us a sufficiency of water. It is only by action that my regret 
can be diminished, and as yet we do nothing. Your foresight and your orders have, nevertheless, anticipated my wants, and rendered my delays less long. 
The re enforcement you have so properly sent, will, as 
I am informed, arrive this evening, and it will, most 
assuredly, be on the part you have so wisely and expeditiously taken, that our success will depend. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> has done me the honor to come 
and see me, and to communicate his views. I will 
second them with all my power. He is full of that 
spirit of activity and combination, with which you 
inspire all those who have served under your orders. 
I believe him as fully persuaded as I am of the necessity of acting. The intrenchments that are visible 
above Connanicut increase daily. They are numerous. 
The time I have been at sea begins to make me lose a number of men with the scurvy. The extreme 
difficulty of procuring water at Shrewsbury, and the 
tardiness with which it is collected here from different places, have long since obliged me to retrench 
our allowance. The officers and men support this terrible privation with courage and patience ; and we 
have acquired a virtue which has, hitherto, been re 
fused us, the virtue of perseverance. We doubtless 
owe it to the flattering hope of being useful to allies, 
whom our national taste had itself given us, before 
the orders of the King had prescribed it. 
</p><p>
The gentlemen, your Generals, will acquit them 
selves better than I of the duty of rendering you an 
account of the certain state of the preparations going 
on, and of the small burning of three English vessels, 
which guarded the eastern channel. I will confine myself by repeating to you, what I cannot well describe, the zeal and the infinite pains of Lieutenant <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Colonel Laurens</a>. He is on the wing the four-and-twenty hours round, to procure us refreshments and, 
when this is done, remains on board during a very 
long day with all the patience of an old sailor. We 
are indebted to him for a hospital established on 
shore, and for disembarrassing us of our prisoners; 
which, in our situation, form two important articles. 
</p><p>
I desire much that the present expedition may be 
speedily terminated, to give me leisure to employ 
myself with purging the Sound of the English vessels which now infest the navigation. I have received Colonel Sears with all the consideration and all 
the confidence which those merit whom you are pleased to send me, and, when it shall be time for it, 
I will consult him with the greatest eagerness. Accept the homage of the attachment and respect, with 
which I have the honor to be, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=cde" rel="me">ESTAING</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. Since writing my letter, I received that 
which you had the goodness to address me, on the 
26th of July, by Major-<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>. I am going 
to look for him on shore, that he may not lose any 
of the present precious moments. The reputation of 
this General Officer made his arrival to be wished. 
His influence on his countrymen, and his knowledge 
of the country, will render him formidable to our common enemy. You know how to divine whatever 
we stand in need of; and, from what I have seen, 
the discerning and employing men proper to the business in hand, seems to be one of the qualities which 
compose the illustrious character you bear. This is, 
perhaps, the most important part of the great General.

SIR, 
</p><p>
Those who have the happiness to be under your Excellency's orders, find in you a father. The Marquis de la Fayette has a superior title to your Excellency's affection ; he respects, admires, and loves you. 
I had the honor of asking you whether you permit 
ted him to send his cartel to Lord <a href='/results.php?city=carlisle' rel='city'>Carlisle</a>, to satisfy 
myself whether you were informed of it. You were so 
kind as to acquaint me that you had not seen the 
cartel. I thought, from that circumstance, that you 
would forbid the execution of it ; I am still persuaded that this is the case. Such marks of zeal, bravery, and sensibility, are never authorized in Europe, 
by its Generals ; they might fruitlessly rob the respective nations of their best subjects. Besides, Ambassadors, Commissioners, and men in office, are sup 
posed to speak only in consequence of orders which 
they have received. As public organs, they owe an 
account only to their own government of the things 
which they hard. Nations revenge their own injuries ; those who have most reason and strength on 
their side are the most sparing in opprobrious terms, 
and despise them ; they respect their enemies, while 
they endeavour to subdue them; they surpass them 
in wisdom, when they refrain from such offensive terms, which, one would think, should be only the 
useless resource of those who would dissemble their 
injustice. 
</p><p>
I could not, then, but presume that Lord <a href='/results.php?city=carlisle' rel='city'>Carlisle</a> 
would not accept a cartel, which he would have done extremely well to refuse. Older than M. de la Fayette, the experience which age gives tranquillized me 
upon the two subjects which I have just submitted 
to your Excellency, and which made me regard the 
cartel, till now, as almost null. It appeared to me a 
consequence of the interesting character which led 
this brave and amiable Frenchman into the service 
of the United States ; to have entreated your inter 
position in this affair would have appeared like a 
doubt of your doing it. 
</p><p>
The delicacy of my countryman might likewise 
have been wounded, if it should have been known 
that your refusal had been solicited by me. I do 
not hesitate, however, Sir, to make the request. I 
am this moment informed that <a href='/results.php?tla=joh' rel='colleague'>General Hancock</a> told 
M. de Chouin yesterday, that the English Commissioner had provided himself with a substitute. Can he 
have been guilty of choosing a bully? It is impossible that you should have suffered a doubtful expression in this cartel to have had such an effect. 
This challenge can only regard my Lord Carlisle, and 
could not have been construed otherwise. Your Excellency certainly will not have suffered it. Pardon 
an ill-placed uneasiness, if, in consequence of <a href='/results.php?tla=joh' rel='colleague'>General Hancock</a>'s phrase, I require you, as chief of the French, 
to hinder an individual to take upon himself alone a 
concern which is precious, which regards us all, and 
which is granted by his Majesty to the zeal of his 
navy and army. I have the honor to be, with respect, Sir, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most humble and most obedient servant,
