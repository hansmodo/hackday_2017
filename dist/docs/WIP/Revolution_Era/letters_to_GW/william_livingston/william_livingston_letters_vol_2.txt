SIR, 
</p><p>
I have received your Excellency's favor of the 14th 
instant, this day, and that of the 4th, a few days 
since. 
</p><p>
It would give me pleasure to consent to let three troops of Jersey horse enter into the Continental service till the opening of the next campaign, as it 
would not only give me an opportunity of obliging 
your Excellency, but would be of service to the troops 
in acquiring skill and experience, which they would 
afterwards introduce into our other squadrons. But, 
from our present situation, I think we could not spare 
more than one. 
</p><p>
With your request of the 14th I shall comply, as 
far as possible, and endeavour to procure, to-morrow,a resolution of both Houses to authorize the President and Council of Safety to impress wagons for a 
limited time. But these,, Sir, are very temporary expedients. It is impossible for this State to cure the 
blunders of those whose business it is to provide the 
army ; and, considering what New Jersey has suffered 
by the war, I am pretty certain it cannot hold out 
another year, if the rest will not furnish their pro 
portionable share of provisions ; and, for my own part, 
though I would rather spend the remainder of my 
days in a wigwam at Lake Erie, than be the most 
splendid vassal of any arbitrary prince on earth, I 
am so discouraged by our public mismanagement, and 
the additional load of business thrown upon me by 
the villany of those who pursue nothing but accumulating fortunes to the ruin of their country, that I 
almost sink under it. I do not say this, Sir, to discourage you from applying to me at any time for 
any thing that is in my power to do, assuring you 
that it always gives me particular pleasure to contribute in the least to alleviate that burden of yours, to 
which mine does not deserve to be compared. 
</p><p>
I shall pursue the plan, pointed out by the Committee of Congress, for procuring horses. I am, with 
the greatest esteem, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most humble servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have to acknowledge your Excellency's favors of the 16th and 17th instant. 
</p><p>
From your Excellency's known disposition to afford 
this State all the assistance which the circumstances 
of your troops will permit, I think the reasons assigned., in your letter of the 16th, against sending a detachment into Monmouth, have their weight ; 
and one is often obliged to make those applications 
against one's own judgment, for the satisfaction, and 
through the solicitations, of others. 
</p><p>
I am happy to find your Excellency concur with 
me in sentiment respecting the prisoners lately be 
longing to the British ship, stranded on our coast ; 
and I have acquainted Colonel Beatty that they are 
to be considered as the prisoners of this State, and 
to be delivered to the order of Mr. Boudinot, our Commissary. I am exceedingly pleased with the 
plan your Excellency proposes, in your letter of the 
17th, for suffering flag-boats to pass only once a month, except on extraordinary occasions. For the 
inhabitants of the States, who have no military business to transact, it is quite sufficient ; and the inconvenience of being delayed for that space of time, 
when such establishment is found necessary for the 
public good, ought to be, and by all true Whigs 
will be, cheerfully acquiesced in. Indeed, of all 
those who have applied to me for recommendations 
to the commanding officer at <a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a>, to go to 
Staten Island or <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, not above one in twenty 
appeared entitled to. that indulgence ; and many of 
them were as venomous Tories as any in the country. It is either from a vain curiosity (extremely 
predominant in women), cloaked with the pretence 
of securing their debts or effects, in which they 
seldom, if ever succeed ; or, for the sake of buying 
tea and trinkets (for which they would as soon forfeit a second Paradise, as Eve did the first, for the 
forbidden fruit), that they are perpetually prompted 
to those idle rambles. I have, accordingly, been 
very sparing in gratifying their requests ; but have 
often had the mortification to find that many of 
those whom I had denied, were, notwithstanding, 
successful in their subsequent addresses to the military officers, who, from a mistaken complaisance, 
seemed incapable of resisting the solicitations of 
those eloquent and pernicious vagrants. The men 
are still more seriously mischievous, and go with 
commercial motives, and to secure capital quantities 
of British merchandises. 
</p><p>
By a late law, our Legislature has made it penal 
for any of the inhabitants of this State to go into 
the enemy's lines without your Excellency's pass or 
mine ; and I am sure I shall not find myself disposed to grant any but in cases in which the principles of charity or humanity evidently appear to 
require it. 
</p><p>
I hope the capture of the thirty Dutch vessels by 
the enemy on their passage to the West Indies, on pretence of their being intended for America, laden 
with French goods, will animate their High Mightinesses to vindicate their rights, and protect their 
commerce. I have the honor to be, with the highest esteem, Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have received the honor of your Excellency's favor of the 4th instant, and am very far from differing with you in sentiment, that the militia of the 
country should be drawn out by the authority of the 
Government, rather than by the pecuniary reward attached to their service. This has always been my 
opinion ; and I have used my utmost exertions to get 
our militia upon that footing ; but it is a thing rather 
to be wished than expected, as our Legislature have 
uniformly manifested a disinclination to use compulsion. And when it is considered that the five shillings per day which they have added to the pay of 
the militia, is not equal to what they have lately done for the standing troops, I flatter myself that it will not 
be attended with the disagreeable consequences which 
your Excellency apprehends. The truth is, the militia have, of late, been so extremely backward to come 
out in the monthly service, that, without some addition to their past allowance, it was universally apprehended that our frontiers would be entirely left to 
the mercy of the enemy. But, for the reason your Excellency assigns, I wish it had been by way of 
bounty, instead of augmentation of wages. 
</p><p>
The confidence your Excellency is pleased to place 
in my friendship affects me with inexpressible plea 
sure. I hope, Sir, you will never have reason to 
think it misplaced ; and your friendship, in return 
(which, indeed, so bought, is too cheap a purchase), I 
shall always consider is the greatest felicity of my 
life. The communication of your sentiments, in the 
freest manner, upon my public measures, I shall not 
only esteem an honor done me, as a convincing mark 
of your confidence, but shall ever endeavour to improve to the public emolument, which I am sure 
will be the only motive that suggests them. 
</p><p>
Please to accept of my acknowledgments for your promise of continuing the troops, or the principal 
part of them, at their present stations, a few days 
beyond the period limited in your former letter. 
</p><p>
Our political stupor and security, owing to our last 
year's successful campaign, and a thirst for the mammon of unrighteousness, is truly lamentable ; and I 
am entirely of your Excellency's opinion, that there 
is the greatest reason to believe, that a vigorous 
prosecution of the war is determined on the part of 
the enemy. The slowness of our progress towards 
completing our quota of your reenforcements, affects 
me with unspeakable chagrin. And I can assure 
your Excellency, that I do not lose a day, without 
exerting myself to accelerate the motions of some 
gentlemen, who ought not to wait a prompter to 
that indispensable measure. With every sentiment 
of esteem, I have the honor to be, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wil" rel="me">WILLIAM LIVINGSTON</a>.
