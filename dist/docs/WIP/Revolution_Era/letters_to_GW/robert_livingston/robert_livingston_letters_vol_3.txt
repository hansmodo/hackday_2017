Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My anxiety for the supplies of the army has 
brought me to this place, in order that I might satisfy myself as to the quantity on hand, and the 
means of forwarding them. <a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='met'>General Knox</a> has communicated to me your Excellency's orders on this 
subject. Nothing short of them would, I am fully 
persuaded, be of' sufficient force to produce the desired effect; and the knowledge of them will, in a 
great measure, render the execution of them unnecessary. Impressed with this idea, I have been long 
laboring to bring Congress to assume the power which 
will enable them to call forth the resources of the 
States, but unhappily without effect. However, I hope| 
much from their pressing and reiterated demands.
What principally induced me to trouble your Excellency at this time, is an apprehension which I, in 
common with many other gentlemen, entertain of the 
propriety of leaving the command at <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a> in the hands of <a href='/results.php?tla=roh' rel=''>General Howe</a>. Having no personal acquaintance with him, I can have no prejudices, but 
the gentlemen from the southward by no means speak 
so favorably of him as I could wish. But in this, 
I conceive, that as yet he has had no opportunity of 
acquiring a military character. But confidence, which 
is so necessary to inspire courage, especially in militia, will, I fear, be wanting in him. If I might presume so far, I should beg leave to submit it to your 
Excellency, whether this post might not be most safely confided to <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel=''>General Arnold</a>, whose courage is undoubted, who is the favorite of our militia, and who will agree perfectly with our Governor. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will not consider this as designed to convey the most distant reflection on <a href='/results.php?tla=roh' rel=''>General Howe</a>, of whom I know nothing but by report, which 
may very possibly be ill grounded; but, if the most 
distant doubt remains, in a matter of so much moment, I conceive it should be removed. I make no 
other apology for the liberty I take, than the motive 
that suggests it, which has before now induced your 
Excellency to pardon an interference in matters to 
which I was no more competent than the present. 
This hasty letter is written while the express waits, 
whom I am unwilling to detain longer than while I 
declare the respect and esteem with which I am, 
your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
In compliance with the directions of Congress, contained in the inclosed resolution, I have the honor 
to inform your Excellency that our last despatches, 
dated in October, announced a disposition in the belligerent powers to terminate the war by a general 
peace. The Court of London, whose sincerity was 
most suspected because it was to make the greatest 
sacrifices, appears to have smoothed the way, by the 
commission to Mr. Oswald, which your Excellency 
has seen, empowering him to treat with the Thirteen 
United States of America. Mr. Hayneval, brother to 
Mr, Gerard, having been sent from France to sound 
the intentions of the British Ministry, returned perfectly satisfied of their sincerity, 
</p><p>
A little before our despatches were closed, our Ministers had delivered three ji'opositions to the Court 
of London. They consisted of three general heads, 
which comprised our right to the fisheries, the extent 
of our territories, and commercial objects. Though these propositions contained all we could ask, under 
each of these heads, yet Mr. Oswald gave our Ministers reason to conclude that they would be granted; 
which I am inclined to believe they have been, in 
their fullest extent, from the lead which our Ministers 
have taken in signing Provisional Articles. 
</p><p>
France, Spain, and Holland had made their proposals, so that the King of Great Britain was perfectly 
apprised of their demands before he met his Parliament. There is little room, therefore, to doubt, when 
these facts are compared with the speech of His Britannic Majesty, that, unless some unforeseen event 
should arise, a general peace will be concluded before the opening of the next campaign. 
</p><p>
I was honored by your letter of the 18th, and 
have delivered the one inclosed to <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, who 
is detained, by order of Congress, till they receive 
more certain advices as to the issue of the negotiation. I should also acknowledge the receipt of your 
favor of the 8th of January, which I found here on 
my return from the country. I think with you, that 
the British Administration will choose to take the advice of Parliament on the terms of peace, before they 
agree to them. Yet they have gone every length 
with respect to us. In this, however, they are perfectly safe ; as the opposition have, all along, dictated 
that measure, so that, on This quarter, they are secure from their attacks. More circumspection will be 
necessary in adjusting the Articles with the other 
belligerent powers. To this cause we may probably 
attribute the delays that the business still seems to 
struggle with. 
</p><p>
Be pleased. Sir, to accept my compliments, and 
those of my family, who join me in returning our 
best respects to Mrs. Washington. I have the honor 
to be, dear Sir, with great respect and esteem, 
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
