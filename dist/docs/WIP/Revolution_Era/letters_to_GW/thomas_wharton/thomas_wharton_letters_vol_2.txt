SIR, 
</p><p>
I had the honor of receiving your favor of the 
17th instant, which was immediately laid before the 
Council. 
</p><p>
In consequence of this application we have ordered 
out two classes of militia, offering an exemption from 
their fines to such delinquents of the former classes 
as can be prevailed upon to join them, and have invited all, of every class, to turn out as volunteers. 
The Lieutenants have orders, if they do not find 
these two classes turn out generally, to order to 
camp the next two succeeding classes. To encourage 
the people to exert themselves with alacrity, we 
have published an address, offering every motive we 
could suggest, to stimulate our constituents to their 
duty. What numbers may be drawn forth into service, in consequence of these measures, we cannot 
possibly ascertain with precision; but believe they 
will be more than we can possibly arm. If you 
should think proper to encourage our calling forth 
unarmed men, under the prospect of their finding 
arms at camp, we will endeavour to do more; but, 
from the view your letter presents of the want of that 
necessary article with you, we think it unnecessary 
to take further measures, at present, to draw forth a 
multitude of people who cannot afford any service. 
</p><p>
The other important subject, mentioned in your letter, of taking measures for completing our Continental battalions, I shall communicate to the Legislature as soon as they meet. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>

SIR, 
</p><p>
The inclosed recommendation of the Honorable 
House of General Assembly of this State, founded on a recommendation of Congress, has been repeatedly 
under consideration. As we are persuaded that, how 
ever it may be in other States, we cannot reasonably 
expect, in this State, where property is in general 
very equally divided, that farmers will exert them 
selves to enlist their neighbours children in the service, or even the laborers, whom they feel them 
selves in great want of, the Council can devise no 
means by which we can hope so effectually and expeditiously to raise our quota of troops, as by the 
officers of the battalions. If this measure shall meet 
your Excellency's approbation, we request, that you 
</p><p>
" Business for some time past has not been despatched in Congress with 
that degree of celerity, nor, possibly, in some instances, accuracy, which 
the peculiar exigency of these infant States demands ; not owing to 
negligence and inattention of the few members, who now faithfully devote 
their time, and drudge in the service of their country, but to a deficiency 
of numbers necessary for the discharge of the very important matters 
which every new day brings forth. There are, at present, no more than 
twenty-one members on the floor. Of these, three are ordered on a 
Committee to General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>'s camp, and one to visit the hospitals ; 
and, of late, from some unaccountable delinquencies, Congress, in order 
to guard against a total dispersion of the army, have been obliged to act 
personally, by several of its members, Quartermaster-General, Clothier-General, Commissary-General, and, as your Excellency will conclude from 
the intimation just now dropped, Director of Hospitals; and I might, with 
strict propriety, add two or three et ceteras. 
</p><p>
" I have taken the liberty of being so full on this head, in order to 
show your Excellency the necessity for hastening a more ample representation from the State of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, as well as to apologize for any 
unavoidable delay on the part of Congress ; and I have been urged more 
particularly to do so, from a hint which Mr. Lewis gave me this evening, of his intention to leave us in a few days." 
will please to select two out of each for this purpose, and give them orders to repair to the several 
counties, as soon as may be, on this important service. 
</p><p>
A sum of money will be deposited in the hands 
of the County Lieutenant, or other suitable person, to 
pay the bounty of one hundred dollars ordered by the 
Assembly, over and beside the bounty given by Congress, to each able-bodied recruit, who shall enter any 
of the battalions belonging to the quota of this State, 
for three years, or during the war. The words of 
the recommendation are, of the "twelve battalions," 
but we understand it to have been intended to all the 
battalions. 
</p><p>
The Council had, some time since, set on foot a 
collection of coarse woollens, blankets, shoes, &c., to 
be sent in the common fund in the hands of the 
Clothier-General. Very lately, Congress, departing 
from their former system, resolved that each State 
do endeavour to supply the present nessities of its 
troops. Agreeably to this, the Council immediately 
proceeded to bring a large quantity of woollens, 
which was concealed or neglected in Buck's county, 
to the supply of the distressed soldiers. The tailors 
have made considerable progress in making them up. 
They calculate that they will produce near one thou 
sand coats and waistcoats for privates, and a .few 
breeches. These goods seem not so fit for officers, 
except some surtouts would be thought acceptable. 
Your Excellency's direction concerning the distribution 
will be useful, as the Council are satisfied that you 
wish the most pressing necessity to be first relieved. 
</p><p>
The Assembly, in the exigence of our army at this 
inclement season, have gone into the most vigorous 
mode of relief, but a mode that cannot be continued 
nor renewed, consistent with trade and manufacture. 
They have invested two Commissioners, in each county, 
with power to seize and take all necessaries suitable 
to the purpose, in whatever hands they may be 
found ; and they have appointed Colonel Francis 
Johnston to receive and distribute the clothing as 
ordered by the Council. By this means it may be 
expected that great additions may be made to the 
clothing already made up and making. 
</p><p>
The officers, whose wants it is believed are very 
pressing, will be in some measure relieved ; but it 
cannot be expected that powers, of this extraordinary 
nature, can be exerted to procure any other goods 
than warmth and decency require. Lieutenant Peter 
son, of the eighth Pennsylvania battalion, applied to 
the Council for clothing for himself and several officers. At the foot hereof we transcribe, from his application, a specimen of their wants. 
</p><p>
The call upon the State was thought to be for 
covering for the naked part of the army ; and as no 
idea that fine ruffled shirts, laced hats, or even fine ones of beaver, silken stockings, or fine scarlet cloth, 
came under this description, no provision for these 
has been made, nor can be expected. Your Excellency can best judge whether any precaution may be 
necessary to prevent such officers, as intend shortly 
to resign, from obtaining a supply of the clothing 
expected to be delivered out. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c.,

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
In answer to your Excellency's letter of the 7th 
instant, I beg leave to inclose to you extracts of a 
letter to his Excellency the President of Congress, 
from this Council, and of a representation from the 
Council and the General Assembly to Congress, by 
which your Excellency will see that attention has 
been given to the supplying of the army with wagons, and what is the opinion of the Council respecting the difficulties attending this business. 
</p><p>
There is not any State on this Continent which 
has been so oppressed with Continental business as 
this has been, from the beginning of the present controversy to this hour. Its exertions have been so 
zealous and unremitting, that no time has been lost 
in inquiries after groundless charges of neglect made against it, which have been generally calculated to 
excuse indolent or improvident officers, or to disgrace 
the government established in it. The amazingly 
difficult task, which your Excellency has to perform, 
while you are embarrassed with perpetual applications 
and complaints of officers, who are not fully acquainted with their duty, must too forcibly convince you 
how near to an impossibility it is to conduct very 
extensive business without the subordinate officers discharging, in some sort, their duty ; and it is from the 
example of your Excellency alone, that it is believed 
to be possible to conduct the affairs of a large army, 
under the difficulties which you have had to contend 
with. Equal abilities or success in attempts of this 
kind are not to be expected in many instances. And 
this Council must acknowledge that they are not 
equal to the task imposed on them, if it is under 
stood to be their duty to furnish every Deputy Quarter-master with four or five wagons, whenever they 
are wanted, and to give equal attention to every other 
department of the State and army. This, indeed, 
seems to be expected of them; for there is, at present, 
an absolute dependence on the Council to supply the 
common rations of the soldiery now in the borough. 
An earnest desire to serve the general cause, and a 
zealous attachment to its interest, are the only motives which could possibly induce the Council to undertake such business in any extremity. 
</p><p>
The unparalleled patience and magnanimity with 
which the army, under your Excellency's command, 
have endured the hardships attending their situation, 
unsupplied as they have been through an uncommonly 
severe winter, is an honor which posterity will con 
sider as more illustrious than could have been derived to them by a victory obtained by any sudden and 
vigorous exertion. The latter often depends on some 
circumstance trifling in itself, while the former is derived from a determined perseverance through the 
greatest difficulties, which virtue and a truly patriotic 
spirit only can inspire. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thw" rel="me">THOMAS WHARTON, JR</a>.
