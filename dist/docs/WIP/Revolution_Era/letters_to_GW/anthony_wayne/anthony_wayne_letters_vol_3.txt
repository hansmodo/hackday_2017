Dear General, 
</p><p>
Being convinced that our field-pieces were too light 
to make the wished impression on the block-house by 
Bull's Ferry, from an experience of more than an 
hour (at no greater distance than from fifty to seventy yards), during which time both officers and 
men evinced a degree of bravery seldom equalled, 
but never excelled ; and seeing the enemy in motion on York Island, and their shipping under way, 
together with certain accounts of the embarking of a 
very large body of troops from Valentine's Hill, it 
was unanimously determined, in a Council of War on 
the field, to withdraw the artillery, and fall back by 
easy degrees to this place, to prevent the disagreeable consequences of being shut up in Bergen Neck. 
We accordingly moved off, after burning the flats and 
boats lying at the landing, and driving the cattle 
from that country, which was part of our plan. Our 
loss is from fifty to sixty killed and wounded, whom 
we carried off, without the least molestation. I will 
have the honor of transmitting to your Excellency 
the particulars to-morrow. 
</p><p>
I think it my duty to mention, that the enemy 
are in full motion on the North River, chief part of 
their troops embarked. As they have completed their 
foraging in East and Westchester, may not good policy induce them to take p0st between the Liberty 
Pole and this place, in order to render that essential 
article very difficult for your Excellency to procure, 
in case of a siege ? I will shift my ground about 
two in the morning, and fall back towards the camp. 
Interim, I am your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient, humble servant,

Dear General, 
In pursuance of the plan, which your Excellency 
was pleased to adopt, the first and second Pennsylvania brigades, with four pieces of artillery belonging 
to Colonel Proctor's regiment, and Colonel Moylan's 
dragoons, took up their line of march on the 20th, at 
three o'clock, P. M., and arrived, a little in the rear 
of New Bridge, at nine in the evening. We moved again at one in the morning, in order to occupy the 
ground in the vicinity of <a href='/results.php?city=fort lee' rel='city'>Fort Lee</a> and the Landing 
opposite King's Bridge, by the dawn of the day; and, 
agreeably to the inclosed order, we advanced towards 
Bull's Ferry, â€” <a href='/results.php?tla=wli' rel='colleague met'>General Irvine</a>, with part of his brigade, along the summit of the mountain, and the 
first brigade, under Colonel Humpton, with the artillery and Colonel Moylan's horse, on the common 
road. About ten o'clock, part of the first brigade 
had reached that place. Colonel Moylan, with the 
horse, and a detachment of infantry, remained at the 
fork of the road leading to Paulus Hook and Bergen, 
to receive the enemy, if they attempted any thing 
from that quarter. 
</p><p>
On reconnoitring the refugee post, near Bull's 
Ferry, we found it to consist of a block-house, surrounded by an abatis and stockade to the perpendicular rocks next to the North River, with a kind of 
ditch, or parapet, serving as a covered way. By this 
time we could discover the enemy in motion on 
York Island, which began to open a prospect of our 
plan taking full effect. <a href='/results.php?tla=wli' rel='colleague met'>General Irvine</a> was directed 
to halt in a position from which he could move to 
any point where the enemy should attempt to land, 
either in the vicinity of this post or <a href='/results.php?city=fort lee' rel='city'>Fort Lee</a>, where 
the sixth and seventh regiments were previously concealed, with orders to wait the landing of the enemy, 
and then, at the point of the bayonet, to dispute the 
pass in the gorge of the mountain, at every expense 
of blood, until supported by <a href='/results.php?tla=wli' rel='colleague met'>General Irvine</a>, and the 
remainder of the troops. 
</p><p>
The first regiment was posted in a hollow way, on 
the north side of the block-house, and the tenth in 
another hollow on the south, with orders to keep up a 
constant fire into the portholes, to favor the advance of the artillery, which was covered by the second 
regiment. When the field-pieces arrived at the medium distance of sixty yards, they commenced a constant fire, which was returned by the enemy, and 
continued without intermission from eleven until after 
twelve o'clock. By that time we had expresses that 
the enemy were embarking their troops from Voluntine's Hill, at Phillips's Landing. We also saw many 
vessels and boats moving up with troops from New 
York, which made it necessary to relinquish a lesser 
for a much greater object; that is, drawing the enemy 
over towards the posts already mentioned, and deciding the fortune of the day in the defiles, through 
which they must pass before they could gain possession of the strong grounds. 
</p><p>
In the interim we found that our artillery had 
made but little impression, although well and gallantly served, the metal not being of sufficient weight 
to traverse the logs of the block-house ; but, when the 
troops understood that they were to be drawn off, 
such was the enthusiastic bravery of all ranks of officers and men, that the first regiment, no longer capable of restraint, rather than leave a post in the 
rear, rushed with impetuosity over the ahatis, and advanced to the stockades, from wliich they were with 
difficulty withdrawn, although they had no means of 
forcing an entry. The contagion spread to the second; but, by very great efforts of the officers of 
both regiments, they were at last restrained, not 
without the loss of some gallant officers wounded 
and some brave men killed. Happy it was that the 
ground would not admit of the further advance of 
the tenth regiment, and that the situation of <a href='/results.php?tla=wli' rel='colleague met'>General Irvine</a>'s brigade prevented them from experiencing a 
loss proportioned to those immediately engaged (as 
the same gallant spirit pervaded the whole), which 
might he a means of frustrating our main object, 
by incumbering us with too many wounded. 
</p><p>
The artillery was, therefore, drawn off, and forwarded towards the wished-for point of action. The 
killed and wounded were all moved away, except 
three, that lay dead under the stockades. During this 
period. Colonel Moylan's horse drove the cattle, &c., 
from Bergen up towards the Liberty Pole, whilst 
a detachment of infantry destroyed the sloops and 
wood-boats at the landing, in which were taken a 
Captain and mate, with two sailors. Some others 
were killed whilst attempting to escape by swimming. Having thus effected part of our plan, we 
pushed forward to oppose the troops from Valentine's 
Hill that we expected to land at the nearest point 
to New Bridge. If effected, we were determined to 
drive them back, or to cut our way through; but 
in this project we were disappointed; the enemy 
thought proper to remain in a less hostile position 
than that of the Jersey shore. We therefore passed 
the New Bridge, and, by easy degrees, returned to 
this place about an hour ago. 
</p><p>
Inclosed is a copy of the orders of the 20th, together with a return of the killed and wounded, 
sixty-four in number, among whom are Lieutenants 
Hammond and Crawford, of the first, and Lieutenant Dehart of the second, all very worthy officers; the 
latter, mortally wounded. 
</p><p>
I cannot attempt to discriminate between officers, 
regiments, or corps, who, with equal opportunity, 
would have acted with equal fortitude. Should my 
conduct, and that of the troops under my command, 
meet your Excellency's approbation, it will much 
alleviate the pain I experience in not having it in my power to carry The whole of the plan into execution, which was only prevented by the most malicious fortune. I have the honor to be, with sincere 
esteem, your Excellency's

</p><p>
Dear General, 
</p><p>
After a variety of marches and countermarches, 
frequently offering battle to Lord Cornwallis upon 
military terms, the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> received intelligence on the 5tli that the enemy had marched 
from <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a> for Jamestown, and were preparing 
to throw their baggage and troops over that river. 
This induced the General to make a forward move 
to this place with the Continental troops, including 
Major Macpherson's little legion, together with a few 
volunteer dragoons under Colonel Mercer and Captain 
Hill, the vicinity of which to the enemy was such as 
to put it into his powder to strike them, should the 
passage of the James be their object. 
</p><p>
On the morning of the 6th several corroborating 
advices arrived, removing every doubt upon that head, 
with the addition that nothing but a forced march, 
with the lightest and most advanced part of the troops, 
could arrive in time to affect their rear. This induced 
the Marquis to order the advanced guard, Major Macpherson's, Colonel Mercer's, and Captain Hill's corps, 
one hundred and fifty riflemen, with Colonel Stewart's 
detachment of Pennsylvanians, amounting in the whole 
to about five hundred men, artillery and dragoons included, to make a forward move under my conduct, 
and endeavour to come up with the enemy. 
</p><p>
Upon our arrival at the Green Spring Farm, a variety of contradictory intelligence rendered it prudent 
to reconnoitre them with a military eye. Their vast 
superiority in horse also made it expedient to advance the whole of our little corps to drive in their 
guards, and keep their horse in check. About this 
period the Marquis arrived in person, and adopted 
the manoeuvre, which being effected, it was soon discovered that a very considerable part of their army 
yet remained on this side of the river, which induced 
the General to send for the remainder of the Continentals, distant about six miles. At two o'clock, P. M., 
a large smoke was raised by the enemy, probably as 
a signal to their parties to return to camp, and for 
all such as had crossed the river to repass it. 
</p><p>
At three o'clock the riflemen, supported by a few 
regulars, began and kept up a galling fire upon the 
enemy, which continued until five in the evening, 
when the British began to move forward in five 
columns. The Marquis, anxious to view them near, 
had proceeded rather far upon their left. It was 
therefore thought proper to order Major Galvan, at 
the head of the advanced guard, to meet and attack 
their front ; who, after a spirited though unequal contest, retired upon our left. A detachment of the 
light infantry, under Major Willis, having that moment arrived, also commenced a severe fire upon the 
enemy's left, but were obliged to fall back; which 
the enemy taking advantage of, began to turn our 
flanks, a manoeuvre by which, had they persevered, 
they must inevitably have penetrated between this 
corps and the other part of the army. But being 
joined at this crisis by Lieutenant-Colonel Harmer 
and Major Edwards, with two detachments from the 
second and third battalions of Pennsylvanians, under 
Colonel Hampton, it was determined, among a choice 
of difficulties, to advance and charge them. This was 
done with such vivacity as to produce the desired 
effect; that is, checking them in their advance, and 
diverting; them from their first manoeuvre. 
</p><p>
But, being enveloped by numbers, many brave and 
worthy officers and soldiers killed or wounded, we 
found it expedient to fall back half a mile to Green 
Spring Farm. Two of our field-pieces, which were 
necessarily introduced to keep up the idea of our 
being in force, were served with equal spirit and 
effect, until disabled by having Captain Crosby, with 
many matrosses, dangerously wounded, and all the 
horses killed. They at last fell into their hands. 
The wagons and ammunition were carried off safe. 
The enemy, sore from the contest, and finding us 
supported at that place by the remainder of the 
light infantry, were content with barely keeping the 
field, although opposed but by a handful of men 
compared with their numbers ; and who, from the 
nature of the ground, were obliged to act in a detached manner, except that part of the Pennsylvania 
line which had time to arrive, and then not more 
than five hundred men, with a few dragoons under 
Major Macpherson. 
</p><p>
From the mutual emulation in the officers and men 
of each corps, I am confident that, had the army 
been in force, victory would have inclined to our 
arms. However, every circumstance considered, our 
small reconnoitring party of horse and foot, who had 
the hardiness to engage Lord Cornwallis at the head 
of his whole army, with the advantage of so numerous a cavalry, on their own ground, and in their 
own camp, is more to be envied than pitied ; as it 
not only disconcerted the British General, and effectually amused him from his premeditated manoeuvre, 
but precipitated his retreat to James Island the same 
night, to avoid a general action in the morning, which 
the pointed attack he experienced in the evening 
might be the sanguinary prelude to. 
</p><p>
Our Field-Officers were generally dismounted by having their horses either killed or wounded under them. Colonel Cheeves, and other young Virginian 
gentlemen of his corps, were not more fortunate. I will not condole with the Marquis for the loss of two of his, as he was frequently requested to keep 
at a greater distance. His native bravery rendered him deaf to the admonition. I cannot attempt to discriminate between any corps of officers or men so 
equally deserving; but beg leave to observe, that if they possess a fault, it is an excess of bravery, a crime the least to be reprehended in a soldier. 
</p><p>
As the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> will furnish your Excellency with a general return of the killed and wounded, I shall only mention that the enemy, from 
every account and circumstance, have sustained a loss of near three hundred men in killed and wounded, among whom are many officers. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=atw" rel="me">Anthony Wayne</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. Colonel Stewart requests his best compliments to your Excellency. His small detachment suffered most, from their local situation.

Dear General, 
</p><p>
The most general and unhappy mutiny suddenly 
took place in the Pennsylvania line, about nine 
o'clock last night. It yet subsists. A great proportion of the troops, with some artillery, are marching 
towards <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
</p><p>
Every exertion has been used by the officers to 
divide them in their determination to revolt. It has 
succeeded, in a temporary manner, with near one 
half How long it will last, God knows ! I have ordered the Jersey brigade to Chatham, where the militia are also assembled, lest the enemy should take 
advantage of this alarming crisis. Indeed, the alarmguns have been fired, and the beacons kindled, 
towards <a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a> ; perhaps it was occasioned 
by our unhappy affair. I am, this moment, with 
Colonels Butler and Stewart, taking horse to try to 
halt those on their march towards <a href='/results.php?city=princeton' rel='city'>Princeton</a>. As a last resort, I am advised to collect them, and move 
on slowly towards Pennsylvania. 
</p><p>
What their temper may he, I cannot tell. We 
had our escapes last night. Perhaps we may he 
equally fortunate to-day. If not, adieu, my dear General, and believe me 
</p><p>
Yours, most affectionately, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=atw" rel="me">Anthony Wayne</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. Captain Billings is killed ; Captain Talbot, 
mortally wounded ; some others are also hurt. Major Fishbourn, who carries this, will be able to give you 
a particular account of last night's and this morning's 
transactions. I am happy to inform you that not an 
officer was absent on this occasion, nor have any of 
the soldiers gone towards the enemy. Their general 
cry is, to be discharged, and that they will again enlist, and fight for America, a few excepted. General Potter and Colonel Johnson, who were eye-witnesses of the W'hole, as far as it is yet gone, go 
express to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>.
