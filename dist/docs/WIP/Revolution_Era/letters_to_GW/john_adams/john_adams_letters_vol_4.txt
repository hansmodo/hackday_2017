Sir, 
</p><p>
That <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a> and the Spanish posts on the 
Mississippi will be among the fiirst attempts of the 
English, in case of a war with Spain, appears very 
probable ; and that a combined operation from Detroit 
would be convenient to that end, cannot be doubted. 
The consequences on the western settlements, on the 
commerce with the West Indies, and on the General security and tranquillity of the American Confederation, of having them in our rear and on both our 
flanks, with their navy - in front, are very obvious. 
</p><p>
The interest of the United States duly weighed, 
and their duty conscientiously considered, point out 
to them, in the case of such a war, a neutrality, as 
long as it may be practicable. The people of these 
States would not willingly support a war, and the present Government has not strength to command, nor 
enough of the general confidence of the nation to 
draw, the men or money necessary, until the grounds, 
causes, and necessity of it should become generally 
known and universally approved. A pacific character, in opposition to a warlike temper, a spirit of 
conquest, or a disposition to military enterprise, is of 
great importance to us to preserve, in Europe ; and 
therefore we should not engage, even in defensive 
war, until the necessity of it should become apparent, 
or, at least, until we have it in our power to make 
it manifest in Europe as well as at home. 
</p><p>
la order to preserve an honest neutrality, or even 
the reputation of a disposition to it, the United States 
must avoid, as much as possible, every real wrong, 
and even every appearance of injury to either party. 
To grant to Lord Dorchester, in case he should request it, permission to march troops through the territory of the United States, from Detroit to the Mississippi, would not only have an appearance, offensive 
to the Spaniards, of partiality to the English, but 
would be a real injury to Spain. The answer, therefore, to his Lordship, should be a refusal, in terms 
clear and decided, but guarded and dignified ; in a 
manner which no person has more at command than 
the President of the United States. 
</p><p>
If a measure so daring, offensive, and hostile, as 
the march of troops through our territory, to attack a 
friend, should be hazarded by the English, without 
leave, or especially after a refusal, it is not so easy 
to answer the question, what notice ought to be taken 
of it. 
</p><p>
The situation of our country is not like that of most 
of the nations in Europe. They have, generally, large 
numbers of inhabitants in narrow territories. We have 
small numbers, scattered over vast regions. The country through which the Britons must pass, from Detroit to the Mississippi, is, I suppose, so thinly inhabited, and at such a distance from all the populous 
settlements, that it would be impossible for the President of the United States to collect militia or march 
troops sufficient to resist the enterprise. After the 
step shall have been taken, there are but two ways 
for us to proceed ; one is war, and the other, negotiation. Spain would probably remonstrate to the President of the United States ; but whether she should 
or not, the President of the United States should remonstrate to the King of Great Britain. It would 
not be expected, I suppose, by our friends or enemies, that the United States should declare war at 
once. Nations are not obliged to declare war for 
every injury, or even hostility. A tacit acquiescence, 
under such an outrage, would be misinterpreted on 
all hands ; by Spain, as inimical to her, and by Britain, as the effect of weakness, disunion, and pusillanimity. Negotiation, then, is the only other alternative. 
</p><p>
Negotiation, in the present state of things, is attended with peculiar difficulties. As the King of 
Great Britain twice proposed to the United States an 
exchange of Ministers, once through Mr. Hartley, and 
once through the Duke of Dorset, and when the 
United States agreed to the proposition, flew from it ; 
to send a Minister again to St. James's, till that Court 
explicitly promises to send one to America, is a humiliation to which the United States ought never to 
submit. A remonstrance, from Sovereign to Sovereign, 
cannot be sent but by an Ambassador of some order or 
other; from Minister of State to Minister of State, it 
might be transmitted in many other ways. A remonstrance, in the form of a letter from the American Minister of State to the Duke of Leeds, or whoever may 
be Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, might be 
transmitted through an Envoy, Minister Plenipotentiary, 
or Ambassador of the President of the United States 
at Paris, Madrid, or the Hague, and through the British 
Ambassador at either of those Courts. The utmost 
length that can be now gone, with dignity, would 
be to send a Minister to the Court of London, with 
instructions to present his credentials, demand an 
audience, make his remonstrance ; but to make no 
establishment, and demand his audience of leave, and 
quit the kingdom in one, two, or three months, if a 
Minister of equal degree were not appointed, and actually sent, to the President of the United States from 
the King of Great Britain. 
</p><p>
It is a misfortune that, in these critical moments 
and circumstances, the United States have not a Minister of large views, mature age, information, and 
judgment, and strict integrity, at the Courts of 
France, Spain, London, and the Hague. Early and 
authentic intelligence from those Courts may be of 
more importance than the expense ; but, as the Representatives of the people, as well as of the Legislatures, are of a different opinion, they have made a 
very scanty provision for but a part of such a system. As it is, God knows where the men are to be 
found who are qualified for such missions, and would 
undertake them. By an experience of ten years, 
which made me too unhappy at the time to be ever 
forgotten, I know that every artifice which can deceive, every temptation which can operate on hope 
or fear, ambition or avarice, pride or vanity, the love 
of society, pleasure, or amusement, will be employed 
to divert and warp them from the true line of their 
duty, and the impartial honor and interest of their 
country. 
</p><p>
To the superior lights and information derived from 
office, the more serene temper and profound judgment 
of the President of the United States, these crude 
and hasty thoughts concerning the points proposed, 
are humbly submitted, with every sentiment of respect and sincere attachment, by his 
</p><p>
Most obedient and most humble servant,
