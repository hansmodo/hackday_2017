<a href='/results.php?city=fort mifflin' rel='city'>Fort Mifflin</a>, 16 October, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>; 
</p><p>
5 o clock, P. M. 
</p><p>
The enemy have opened three batteries on us. One, 
in front of the pest-houses, which, with Precache's, 
rakes the whole garrison, from whence they throw 
red-hot balls, as yet without success. Another, in rear of our north-west block-house, in which they have 
some royals, an eight-inch howitzer, one piece of artillery, twelve-pounder. I believe, the other, in rear of the mud-battery, in which, as yet, they have but 
one eight-inch howitzer ; but it is lengthened so as 
to mount a pair of cannon. The large battery, on the 
height to the left of Guyer's house, is not yet opened ; 
they have staked out a large piece of work to the 
left of that, and thrown up some dirt. 
</p><p>
What their intentions are by that, I cannot tell; 
but I am of opinion they will not attempt any thing 
effectual until their shipping opens the chevaiix-de-frise, 
and then make the attack all together. My reason 
is, that they relieve the party here from time to 
time, which I am convinced is not more on Province 
Island than five hundred, and which agrees with the 
number said to have been sent from Germantown. 
Certain I am, we have a new set of men. Their men 
are so detached from each other that I think it would 
not be a difficult matter to raise our siege by the Blue 
Bell. One party, the largest, extends from Guyer's 
house, a quarter of a mile to our left, in barns; the 
other, opposite to our rear; and the other, about the 
pest-houses. We might make a diversion from this garrison. Could we once oblige them to raise the 
siege, I am persuaded they have met with so many 
difficulties, they would not again attempt it. 
The shipping are very busy endeavouring to raise 
the chevaux-dc-frise. What success they have had, we 
know not. However, if undisturbed (which is the 
case), it must at length be effected. Want of ammunition obliges us to leave them undisturbed ; else, per 
haps, we might dismount their pies. When Colonel 
Angell comes, we shall be able to assist each other 
effectually. Colonel Greene's reenforcement of one hundred and fifty are on their way over now. I presume it will be sufficient, if the galleys give us the 
assistance in their power. I have the honor to be, 
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
SAMUEL SMITH.

P. S. I should be extremely obliged, if my letters 
from Maryland were forwarded.

</p><p>
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 
</p><p>
This will acquaint your Excellency that, early this 
morning, we carried all our galleys to action, and, 
after a long and heavy firing, we drove the enemy's 
ships down the river, except a sixty-four gun ship, 
and a small frigate, which we obliged them to quit, 
as they got on shore ; and, by accident, the sixtyfour gun ship blew up, and the frigate they set on 
fire themselves, took the people all out, and quitted 
them. Our action lasted till twelve o clock, and our fleet has received but very little damage. 
</p><p>
You will be informed of the glorious event of last 
night, by Colonel Greene. !" We, in our galleys, were

of great use in flanking round the fort. As I am 
very much fatigued, I hope your Excellency will be 
satisfied with this short account of our affairs of the 
river and fleet. I have not, as yet, got a man to 
reenforce our fleet, for I thought it a pity to take 
them from the fort, as they wanted them more than 
the fleet ; and, God knows, we are very weakly 
manned. Being in haste, I hope soon I shall have it 
in my power to give you a better account of this 
action. Besides the sixty-four and frigate being burnt, 
the Roebuck, which lay to cover them, we damaged 
much, and drove off, and, had she laid fast, we should 
have had her in the same situation. We want ammunition, cartridges for muskets, for eighteen and twentyfour pounders. Having nothing to add, I am your Excellency's

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have this moment arrived here, on my way to 
Congress, with despatches from Major-General Gates ; 
and, being uncertain whether your Excellency is apprised of the fact, I think it my duty to congratulate you on Lieutenant-General Burgoyne's surrender 
to the American arms. This fortunate event took 
place on the 17th instant, and put us in possession 
of six General Officers, five thousand combatants, five 
thousand stands of arms, and twenty-seven pies of 
well-sorted brass ordnance, with fixed ammunition, 
complete. 
</p><p>
I have the further pleasure to assure your Excellency, that we have made, during the campaign, up 
wards of two thousand discretional prisoners, among 
whom are several field-officers, and a large proportion 
of subordinate ones. The most material article in the 
convention between Major-General Gates and Lieutenant-General Burgoyne, is, that the latter, with his 
army, is allowed to return to Great Britain, on parole 
not to bear arms against America during the present 
contest. 
</p><p>
The incendiary crew from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> continue to 
ravage the banks of the North River. The dwellings of Judge Livingston and Mrs. Montgomery have,

</p><p>
On board the Chatham Galley, 26 October, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
By your Excellency's pressing, in your last letter, 
so much for my keeping up harmony with the fleet 
and army, I apprehended some letters had been wrote, 
as though a difference subsisted here. As to my 
own part, I can lay my hand on my heart, and declare, I have taken every step in my power to 
keep from the least shadow of a difference, and did 
not know that any one had the least complaint to 
make, among the Continental fleet or army, as I had 
not ever heard the least mention of any such thing, 
and perfect harmony always appearing. Calling on 
Captain Robinson, I found he had wrote a letter to 
your Excellency concerning a Council of War that 
was held, and I am sorry to find he had given such a representation of it; and beg leave to relate matters 
as they were. 
</p><p>
On the 19th day of October, I hoisted a signal for 
all Captains to come on board the galley in which 
the flag was hoisted. They came, among whom was 
Captain Robinson, and some other officers of the Continental fleet. Finding the galley too small, I desired 
the Captains to remove on board the floating battery, 
where we should have more room; and acquainted 
Captain Robinson that my design was to hold a 
Council. He- then replied, he supposed there was no 
occasion for him or his officers. I told him there 
was, and I expected him to attend ; but he left the galley, and did not come to the Council. This is 
the state of facts, which he represents as a partial 
and absurd Council ; and says, I knew he would 
not give his consent, when he, nor myself could possibly tell what the determination of the Council would 
be. 
</p><p>
Captain Robinson and myself have always had an 
exceeding good understanding ; but I am. astonished 
at his unkind treatment, in his letter to your Excellency. But, as I look on him as a good officer, this 
shall not in the least interrupt that harmony I have 
hitherto kept with him. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency may be assured that every thing 
that tends to promote peace, good order, and friend 
ship, between me and the officers of the fleet and 
army, shall be done, to the utmost of my power. 
</p><p>
I wrote to your Excellency in my last, of the destruction of the enemy's ships. I shall now be more 
particular. On the 22d, while the fort at lied Bank 
was attacked, the <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a>, of sixty-four guns ; the 
Roebuck, of forty-four ; two frigates ; the Merlin, of 
eighteen, and a galley, came up through the lower 
chevaiix-de-frise, which were attacked by the floating batteries and some of the galleys, while the rest of 
the galleys were flanking the enemy that were attacking the fort, where the galleys did much execution. 
As soon as the enemy was repulsed at the fort, the 
ships, finding so hot a fire, endeavoured to fall down, 
but the <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a> and Merlin ran aground. Early next 
morning the galleys and floating batteries attacked 
them, when an incessant fire was kept up. About 
eleven o clock, I believe, one of our shot set the 
August;! on fire, and at twelve, she blew up, being aground. The engagement still continued with the 
other ships ; and, at three in the afternoon, the Merlin, we think, also took fire and blew up. Then 
the fire ceased on both sides. The Roebuck dropped 
down to the lower chcvaux-de-frisc., and went through. 
Yesterday, I went down to the wrecks, and I. find 
the guns of both ships may be got out, if the enemy's 
ships can be kept at a proper distance. We brought 
off two twenty-four pounders, and, as soon as possible, 
shall endeavour for the rest. 
</p><p>
This day we can see great numbers of the enemy 
crossing Webb's Ferry, and, we are told, they have 
large numbers of fascines with them, by which, I suppose, they intend a grand attack on <a href='/results.php?city=fort mifflin' rel='city'>Fort Mifflin</a>. 
We are also assured, this day, that they landed a 
number of troops at Billingsport, so that we are apprehensive they intend to attack both forts at onetime. 
</p><p>
The fleet is now so poorly manned, and the constant cry from <a href='/results.php?city=fort mifflin' rel='city'>Fort Mifflin</a> is to guard that post, that 
I know not how to act without more assistance. 
</p><p>
Colonels Greene and Angell can spare no men, as 
they are afraid of being attacked ; and as to the 
vessels at Bordentown, I am informed they have not 
twenty private men on board, so that I expect no 
assistance from there. 
</p><p>
This night it blows hard, and I fear the galleys 
will not be able to lay near <a href='/results.php?city=fort mifflin' rel='city'>Fort Mifflin</a>, as, when 
the swell is great, they must get under a safe place. 
Having nothing to add, I am your Excellency's 
Most obedient, and most humble servant,

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's favor of the 27th October, I received the 30th ; and should be happy, if I had it in 
my power, to inform you that I was preparing for my 
march to the Delaware. 
</p><p>
I mentioned to the Governor and Council the urgent necessity for the immediate compliance with 
your Excellency's request, but have yet received no 
answer ; nor do I believe the orders will be given in 
time to be of any service. There are not more than 
one hundred western militia now at this post; the 
supplies have been drawn from the eastern parts of 
this State. The reports of our intended march to 
Red Bank have lessened the numbers at this post ; 
the troops, being eastern men, not choosing to abandon (as they term it) this part of the State. Mr. 
Boudinot, who is here, and returns to camp in a few 
days, will inform your Excellency the prevailing opinion in East Jersey. Thus it is with militia. They 
will undertake to judge for themselves. Those are 
difficulties and inconveniences your Excellency has 
often had to contend with and submit to, for which I 
am sincerely concerned. Our Governor and Council 
seem inattentive to your request, perhaps from an 
inclination to keep the troops in their present situation. General Winds, with his brigade, has not yet 
returned ; they were at <a href='/results.php?city=new windsor' rel='city'>New Windsor</a> by the last 
accounts. 
</p><p>
I would by no means presume to dictate to your Excellency, but beg leave just to hint, that, if an order was given to Generals Gates and Putnam, to raisea number of militia, and make an attack upon Long Island and <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> ; and myself, with what militia 
I could collect from this part of the State, to make a descent upon Staten Island, all at the same time, 
whether it would not answer a valuable purpose, 
although we should not all succeed. I have reason 
to believe it is an order that would be obeyed with 
great readiness ; the sooner the better, if it meets 
your Excellency's approbation. I should only require a few days notice, having boats now ready to transport five hundred men at a time ; and I am of opinion I could increase my present numbers (about six 
hundred men) to twelve hundred men, upon such an 
occasion ; and if I should be disappointed, I would 
make the attack with whatever numbers I could collect, 
</p><p>
By information that may be depended upon (in my 
opinion), the enemy are embarking troops from New 
York to Staten Island to reenforce Mr. Howe. I 
could, within twenty-four hours, have intelligence conveyed to Mr. Skinner, if your Excellency thought 
proper, that something was intended against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, &c., which might prevent the re enforcements 
being sent. 
</p><p>
I have a person now in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> ; he returns 
to-morrow ; if he brings any thing material, it shall 
he instantly communicated to your Excellency. I 
have the honor to he,

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
The intimacy of my connection with Mr. Duche 
renders all assurance unnecessary, that the letter, ad 
dressed by him to your Excellency on the 8th of 
October last, gave me the greatest concern. I flatter 
myself some undue means have been used to induce 
him to write such a letter, so incompatible with the 
amiable character he has ever maintained, and so 
fal to his reputation. I could not forbear communicating to him some of my sentiments on the occasion. 
These I might probably have been able to convey to 
him by secret means ; but did not choose to risk the 
imputation of a clandestine correspondence. I have,therefore, taken the liberty to send the inclosed letter 
to your Excellency, unsealed, for your perusal; resting it entirely on your better judgment to cause it 
to be forwarded or not. 
</p><p>
I hope your Excellency will pardon my giving 
you this trouble. The occasion is a very interesting 
one to me. My friendship for Mr. Duche calls upon 
me to do all I can to warn him against the fatal 
consequences of his ill-advised step, that he may, if 
possible, do something to avert them before it is too

<a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a>, 28 November, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Having obtained the fullest information respecting 
the strength and situation of the enemy upon Staten 
Island, and made the necessary preparations, I called 
in many volunteers, whose numbers, in addition to 
those on duty at this post, amounted to about fourteen hundred men. With this detachment I landed 
yesterday morning, before day, upon the Island, from 
Halstead's Point. The whole strength of the enemy 
was drawn to this side of the Island, and extended 
from the Blazing Star to their former works. General Skinner, with five regiments of Greens, were 
quartered in different parts.* About three hundred 
Waldeckers, with General Campbell, lay at the works, 
in which were light cannon, with a company of artillery, covered by a fifty-gun ship, and a sloop-of-war. 
</p><p>
I landed in three divisions (having the best guides), 
and intended to have marched in by-roads, in order 
to get in the rear of the Greens, and cut off their 
retreat. The divisions proceeded as far as was intended (seven miles), and then met at the appointed 
rendezvous ; but, to my great disappointment, they 
secured their retreat in the works by the most precipitate flight; General Skinner, Colonel Allen, and 
many other officers, having narrowly escaped. We 
drove in all their pickets, with little opposition, and 
now and then skirmished a little with them as they 
fled. I kept my design as secret as possible, not having communicated it to the Field-Officers until eight 
o clock the evening before ; but, notwithstanding all 
my precaution, Mr. Skinner received the intelligence 
at three o'clock in the morning, which frustrated my 
plan. I flattered myself I should have had the plea 
sure of giving your Excellency a good account of 
the General and his Green brigade, which, undoubtedly, would have been the case, had he not unluckily 
received the above information. 
</p><p>
We made the following prisoners, namely; two 
Lieutenants (one Colonel Bushkirk's son), one Surgeon, one Commissary, and twenty privates (Mr. Hood, 
of Brunswick, among the number) ; and killed five or 
six Greens. Our loss was three men made prisoners, 
and ten slightly wounded. In justice to both officers 
and men, I must inform your Excellency they be 
haved well, and wanted nothing but an opportunity 
to have done honor to the State they belong to. 
Their expectations were great, and their spirits high. 
I was astonished that the enemy had not collected 
and formed upon some advantageous ground. This 
I expected would have been the case, and proceeded 
with caution. They came down in a body to play 
the old game upon our rear. This I expected, and 
was sufficiently prepared for, having thrown up a 
small work at Halstead's Point, and placed two fieldpies in it, from which we kept up a brisk fire, and 
soon dispersed them. 
After remaining on the Island eight hours, and 
driving them within their works, we made an easy 
and secure retreat, not having lost a single man, 
horse, or boat. By a flag, just come over, I am in 
formed they say, in excuse for their gallant beha 
viour, that we were joined by two thousand Continental troops. Had it not been strong tide of 
flood, by which means they might have been easily 
reenforced from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, as General Putnam only 
intended a feint there, and their having two gondolas, 
and an armed sloop lying in the Sound, I should have 
remained in possession of the Island for the day. 
Those considerations, and the troops being much fa 
tigued, as the night was very cold, and they obliged 
to march through much water, determined me to re 
turn, which reasons, I hope, will meet with your Excellency's approbation. 
</p><p>
I proposed to the Governor to march most of the 
men from this post to the southern part of this State, 
to serve out the remainder of their time, (indeed, the 
whole force should have marched long ago, but the 
Council would not consent). If I am not forbid, I 
shall take the liberty of sending on six hundred of 
the best troops early to-morrow morning, which detachment I shall accompany. The weather is very 
bad, but I hope it will clear up this evening. 
</p><p>
My indisposition, being much fatigued and very 
wet in crossing the river, prevented my giving your Excellency the above information earlier. 
</p><p>
A fleet, consisting of twenty-five sail, is just arrived 
at the Narrows, said to come from England, and to 
have brought over some of the new raised Irish regiments. I have the honor to be,

<a href='/results.php?city=york' rel='city'>York</a>, 13 January, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have waited some time in expectation of informing you with the sense of Congress on the several 
subjects mentioned in your agreeable favor of the 
25th December, but am not yet fully able to answer 
my purpose. 
</p><p>
A Committee is appointed from Congress and the 
Board of War, who, in Concert with your Excellency, 
have full powers to form and execute a plan for reducing the number of battalions now in the service ; 
to recommend the necessary appointments of General 
Officers ; to determine on the necessary reinforcements 
for the cavalry, artillery, and infantry, and report 
their opinions on the best mode of obtaining the same ; 
to remove from office any officers of the civil departments of the army for negligence, incompetency, or 
fraud, and appoint others until the sense of Congress 
can be known; to report the necessary alterations to be made in the regulations of these departments ; to 
remove all just causes of complaint relative to rank, 
confining it, as nearly as may be, to the military line ; and for other purposes mentioned in their commission. The members are, Messrs. Folsom, Dana, 
General Reed, and Harvey, from Congress, and Generals Gates and Mifflin, and Colonel Pickering, from 
the Board of War. I sincerely wish that despatch 
may be made in this business, and that the first 
thing may be to consider of the necessary reinforcements, that measures may be immediately pursued to 
obtain them. The mentioning of this is, however, unnecessary to your Excellency. 
</p><p>
The Resolutions for allowing, hereafter, to officers, 
the cost of their retained rations, and for enabling 
your Excellency to increase the number of your Aids, 
I find, by your letters to Congress, are at hand. And 
the proposals of allowing to the officers, who shall 
continue in the service to the end of the war, and 
whose regiments shall then be reduced, half pay fora limited time; of enabling officers, after the war, 
to sell their commissions, under proper regulations ; 
and of giving to the widows of such officers as shall 
lose their lives in the service, pensions while they re 
main in a state of widowhood, are now before Con 
gress. The first has been largely debated, and I am 
apprehensive that it will meet with a negative. There 
are many weighty arguments against it, such as the 
infant state of the country, its aversion to placemen 
and pensioners, whereby Great Britain is likely to 
lose her liberty, the equality of the officers and soldiers of some States, before the war, and the bad 
effect that such provision would have on the minds 
of the latter. But I must confess that none of these 
weigh so much in my mind as the necessity of making a commission so valuable that a dismission will 
not only be disgraceful to an officer, but injurious 
to his interest. This will introduce that subordination to civil authority which is necessary to produce 
an internal security to liberty, and to the high officers of the military department such authority as to 
enable them to establish discipline, without which an 
army can be neither vigorous nor successful. 
</p><p>
Colonel Wilkinson is appointed Secretary to the 
Board of War, which I hope he will accept, that the 
just causes of complaint arising from his hasty pro 
motion may be removed. Should he refuse, I think 
Congress will be justified in taking effectual measures 
to remedy the evils resulting therefrom. 
</p><p>
General Heath is directed to procure and send to 
your Excellency one thousand bell tents, to prevent, 
in future, the danger arising from heavy rains at the 
critical moment of an engagement with the enemy. 
Is it not necessary that measures should be taken by 
Congress, or your Excellency, for further providing 
against this evil, by appropriating a drummer, fifer, 
or some other officer in each company, to carry a 
bell tent for the same, in times of action, when the 
baggage-w r agons are ordered to leave the army, that, 
whether advancing or retreating, the soldiers may 
never be in danger of having their muskets and 
ammunition rendered useless from the want of this article ? I remain, Sir, in haste, but with much esteem 
and respect,

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your Excellency's letter yesterday, of 
the Stli instant, desiring me to join my brigade as 
soon as possible. 
</p><p>
I apprehend your Excellency has not been fully 
acquainted with the business I was charged with by 
General Gates, which has been, and still will be, at 
tended with so many difficulties, as will necessarily 
detain me at this post till the embarkation of General Burgoyne. 
</p><p>
I was honored with the command of conducting 
him and his troops from <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a> to <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>, for 
the better supplying of whom, and the conveniency 
of the inhabitants of the country through which they 
marched, I divided them into two divisions ; the British, by Williamstown and Northampton ; the Germans, 
by Kinderhook and Springfield with Commissaries, 
Quarter-masters, and Wagon-masters for each, with 
particular directions to take bills for what supplies 
they received, and give orders on me for payment. 
This order not being fully attended to, I was obliged 
to send Quarter-master Story back to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> to collect the outstanding accounts. When that is done, I 
shall charge General Burgoyne with the whole, in one general account ; and as many of the charges, in my 
opinion, are unjust, and others extravagantly high, 
large sums being charged by the inhabitants for da 
mages in burning fens, destroying hay, grain, flax, 
&c.. also for clothing, furniture, &c., stolen out of their 
houses (these charges I know General Burgoyne will 
object to), the inhabitants look to me, and expect I 
shall see them paid. 
To acquit myself of censure, I am determined to 
lay them before the General Court, and desire that a Committee may be appointed to examine them, 
and make what deductions shall appear to them to 
be just, which I hope will give satisfaction to both 
parties. When this is done, I have to present it to 
him for payment, and then advertise the inhabitants 
to come and receive their moneys. I shall lose no 
time in bringing the whole to a close as soon as 
possible. 
</p><p>
Thus, Sir, I have given an account of what I have 
been doing, and still have to do, at this post, which 
I hope will meet your Excellency's approbation. 
</p><p>
I know of no detachments from my brigade left at 
any post. I shall advertise and order on all officers 
and soldiers who are absent with or without furloughs, 
as well as those recovered in hospitals. In the mean 
time, I beg leave to observe to your Excellency, that 
I have given three years service to my country, in 
which I have ruined my constitution, and so much 
impaired my health, that I am by no means fit or 
able to serve her in the field another campaign. 
These reasons, I hope, will have such weight with 
your Excellency as to recommend and urge to Congress in favor of my dismission, without offering another, which is notorious to the world ; and which is, 
that the pay is so small, under the present establishment, compared with the enormous high price of 
clothing and the necessaries of life, that no officer can support himself in camp. That being the case, 
what must become of his family ? This is a matter 
of general complaint, which, I hope, will be redressed, 
or I fear the consequences.

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I cannot let go my guide without taking this opportunity of writing to your Excellency, though I 
have not yet public business to speak of. I go on 
very slow r ly; sometimes drenched by rain,, sometimes 
covered by snow, and not entertaining many hand 
some thoughts about the projected incursion into Canada, If successes were to be had, it would surprise 
me in a most agreeable manner, by that very reason 
that I do not expect any shining ones. Lake Champlain is too cold for producing the least bit of laurel, 
and, if I am not starved, I shall be as proud as if I 
had gained three battles. 
</p><p>
Mr. Duer had given to me a rendezvous at a tavern, but nobody was to be found there. I fancy 
that he will be with Mr. Conway sooner than he has 
told me. They will perhaps conquer Canada before 
my arrival, and I expect to meet them at the Governor's house in Quebec. 
</p><p>
Could I believe, for one single instant, that this 
pompous command of a Northern army will let your Excellency forget a little us absent friends, then I 
would send the project to the place it comes from. 
But I dare hope that you will remember me some 
times. I wish you, very heartily, the greatest public 
and private happiness and successes. It is a very 
melancholy idea for me, that I cannot follow your fortunes as near your person as I could wish ; but 
my heart will take, very sincerely, its part of every 
thing which can happen to you; and I am already 
thinking of the agreeable moment when I may come 
down to assure your Excellency of the most tender 
affection and highest respect. I have the honor to 
be, &c.

This country does not answer our expectation with 
respect to wagons. Consequently, the conveyance of 
the salt provision, &c., collected at this place, will 
not be so expeditious as could be wished. A drove 
of cattle, from seventy to a hundred head, will set 
out to-morrow from <a href='/results.php?city=middletown' rel='city'>Middletown</a>. JWe_do_ business very 
regularly, visiting, in our route, each and every farm, 
and taking with^jus every article necessary for our army. Very little discontent prevails among the in 
habitants, and that only from among the notoriously 
disaffected. This State is void of all government ;therefore we can meet with no aid from the civil. 
They have a form, but there is no spirit or energy. 
The situation of the country, the want of government, 
and the artifis of the friends to the British army, 
render these lower countries an asylum to deserters 
from the Continental army. Several officers are now 
here for the business of apprehending deserters, but, 
though very active, they meet with little success, be 
cause they have no aid from government. The As 
sembly is now convened at this place. The active 
and spirited members wish a letter to the House 
from your Excellency on this head. They think many 
good consequences would result from it. I am in 
formed that there cannot be less than hundred 
deserters, who live on the fruits of their labor in this 
country. Some men of power and influence encourage 
this abominable practice by their private countenance. 
</p><p>
Perhaps if your Excellency would address the Le 
gislature on the subject, and at the same time furnish me with directions and authority to apprehend 
and deliver to the Provost such persons as are noto 
riously guilty of this high crime against the interest 
of the States, great advantages might accrue to the 
army. I am convinced it would encourage the recruiting service. 
</p><p>
I must again beg that your Excellency will order a proper person, with money to pay those persons 
with whom I must contract debts in the execution of my commission. I have promised the people that 
they shall be paid, and shall be much distressed if 
my promise is not fulfilled. I have the honor to be,

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I have been favored with your Excellency's letter 
of the 3d instant, inclosing a proposal, made to you 
by General Varnum, for recruiting the two Continental battalions raised by the State. 
</p><p>
I laid the letter before the General Assembly, at 
their session on the second Monday in this month, 
who, considering the pressing necessity of filling up 
the Continental army, and the peculiarly difficult circumstances of this State, which rendered it in a manner impossible to recruit our battalions in any other 
way, adopted the measure. Liberty is given to every 
effective slave to enter the service during the war; 
and, upon his passing muster, he is absolutely made free, and entitled to all the wages, bounties, and 
encouragements, given by Congress to any soldier en 
listing into their service. The masters are allowed at 
the rate of one hundred and twenty pounds for the 
most valuable slave, and in proportion for those of 
less value. The number of slaves in this State is not 
great, but it is generally thought that three hundred 
and upwards will be enlisted. I am, with great respect, Sir,

MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 
</p><p>
The application, which is the subject of this letter, 
is, I believe, not common in the American regions; 
yet I cannot but hope it will not, on that account, be 
deemed impertinent or presumptive. For several years 
I have been employed in writing a poem, on the Con 
quest of Canaan, by Joshua. This poem, upon the first 
knowledge of your Excellency's character, I deter 
mined, with leave, to inscribe to you. If it will not 
be too great a favor, it will certainly be remembered 
with gratitude. 
</p><p>
I am not insensible that the subject of this request 
is delicate ; as consent on the part of your Excellency 
cannot possibly add to your reputation, and may be 
followed by consequences of a disagreeable nature. 
Of the merit or demerit of the work, your Excellency 
cannot form a guess, but from the character of the 
writer, with which you will be made acquainted by 
General Parsons, who does me the honor to inclose 
this in one from himself. All that I can say upon 
the subject (and I hope I may assert it with propriety) is, that I am so independent a Republican, 
and so honest a man, as to be incapable of a wish 
to palm myself upon the world under the patronage 
of another, as to be remote from any sinister view 
in this application, and to disdain making the proffer, 
slight as it is, to the most splendid personage, for whose character I have not a particular esteem. I 
am, with the greatest respect, your Excellency's Most obedient and most humble servant,

</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=Bethlehem' rel='city'>Bethlehem</a>, 25 March, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Being informed by Dr. Shippen, the Director-General of the Military Hospitals, of an intention or pro 
posal to fix the general hospital at Letiz, one of the 
settlements of the United Brethren, eight miles from 
<a href='/results.php?city=lancaster' rel='city'>Lancaster</a>, and that he gave it as his opinion, that 
in that case the inhabitants of said Letiz might be 
moved to <a href='/results.php?city=Bethlehem' rel='city'>Bethlehem</a> and Nazareth, and finding said 
proposition founded upon misinformation and a very 
wrong notion of the constitution of these infant settlements of the United Brethren, commonly called 
Moravians ; I humbly beg leave to give your Excellency a short and true description of the Brethren's 
settlements in general, and of Letiz in particular. 
</p><p>
The Brethren's church in Germany, with a view to 
propagate the Gospel among the heathens, and to 
plant a nursery of missionaries to the Indians and 
negroes, as also to provide one or more places where 
their here-and-there dispersed and persecuted members might find rest and liberty of conscience, did, 
in the year <a href='/results.php?year=1736'>1736</a>, send a number of their members 
to make a settlement in Georgia, where the Trustees 
had promised them all indulgence in regard to their 
particular principles ; but being very ill-treated by 
the populace, on account of the war with the Span 
iards, they left Georgia, moved to Pennsylvania, and 
began this place, called <a href='/results.php?city=Bethlehem' rel='city'>Bethlehem</a>, in the forks of 
Delaware, in <a href='/results.php?year=1741'>1741</a>. 
</p><p>
Their poverty, and the wild state of these parts, 
made them deny many conveniences of this life, and 
they lived in simplicity and brotherly love, as one family, worked all for the benefit of the whole, and 
desired nothing but food and raiment; if one or the 
other had some private property, he deposited it, or 
disposed of it as he pleased, for his own interest, 
for there was no communion of goods, though it 
seemed so. 
</p><p>
In this way they began several other settlements ; 
but finding more and more difficulties to go on in 
this economy, it was, by common consent, altered in 
the year <a href='/results.php?year=1762'>1762</a> ; so that all who had a mind to carry 
on their art or trade, and usual occupation, for their 
own emolument, were assisted to do it. The steward 
of the single brethren, in their name and behalf, be 
came debtor for the debt of the house and stocks in 
their possession. So did the single sisters with their 
house. To encourage and to support honesty and 
fair dealing, the tavern, mill, and merchant store. 
were reserved for the benefit of the Society; and a 
few others, who required a large stock, and great 
risk, were also left to it. Each branch bears its expenses, as salaries, rent, and interest of the stocks, 
&c., and the yearly gain or overplus is appropriated 
to the funds for maintaining the ministers, schools, 
missionaries, old and infirm, and their widows, or 
phans, and children of missionaries. 
</p><p>
In this economical regulation we lived very happy 
in brotherly love and union, and enjoyed the blessings of God attending it. But it has been the cause 
of two very erroneous opinions, or ideas, in the mind 
of strangers, concerning these settlements, of very grie 
vous consequences for them, namely, as if they were 
still as one family, and as if they were very rich. 
Both are great mistakes, if taken in a natural sense ; 
for every congregation, and every family and private 
person, has to take care of itself, so as it is custo 
mary in other places, though we do help and assist 
each other a little more than is nowadays custom 
ary. All the moneys for transporting so many hundreds from the inner part of Germany to America, to 
buy lands, and great sums expended in building and 
providing stocks, have been borrowed, and very little 
paid off. 
</p><p>
In the year <a href='/results.php?year=1757'>1757</a>, upon request of some friends, a 
little town was laid out in <a href='/results.php?city=lancaster' rel='city'>Lancaster</a> county, and 
called Letiz (in remembrance of the place where, 
just three hundred years before, the first Brethren's 
settlement was begun by some of the followers of 
John Huss in Bohemia). Some brethren were settled there. With borrowed money they built three good 
fine houses ; one with a hall, where they can have 
divine service, till they shall be able to build another 
place of public worship. This house has, besides the 
hall, a few rooms where one of our bishops and the 
minister of the place dwell. On one side of it, the 
single brethren, and on the other the single sisters, 
build houses, on their own account. As well the single men as the single women in these houses have 
their own separate economy. Each house has two 
persons to take care of their temporal and spiritual 
welfare ; each person residing in the house is paid for 
his labor, and pays weekly a certain sum for boarding and lodging, to the House economy. The yearly 
profit in that economy is for the sick and superannuated, or others who cannot earn a livelihood. 
</p><p>
All the other houses in said Letiz, except the 
tavern and a house where a shopkeeper lives, about 
eighteen in number, are the property of private families, who built and fitted them, convenient for their 
several trades and occupations. Amongst them are 
two taverns, one whitesmith, one gunsmith, one organ builder, one skinner, the rest shoemakers, weavers, &c. 
</p><p>
The single brethren were turned out of their well regulated economy and different trades, and their 
house, to their great inconvenience and damage, converted into a hospil, which is also the case of those 
in <a href='/results.php?city=Bethlehem' rel='city'>Bethlehem</a>. 
</p><p>
Should your Excellency agree to Dr. Shippen's 
proposal, three hundred souls would be inexpressibly 
distressed, and the single brethren and sisters, and 
all the families at Letiz, by their removal, would be 
entirely ruined in their property their useful occupations, to the loss of the public, would be stopped; 
and it would be impossible to accommodate them 
with lodgings at <a href='/results.php?city=Bethlehem' rel='city'>Bethlehem</a> and Nazareth, where AVC 
are so crow r ded together that it is a great hinderance 
to our lawful callings, wherein we provided for ourselves and served the public. 
</p><p>
I pray, therefore, most humbly, in the name of the 
Bishop and Elders of the United Brethren, that your Excellency would please to grant to the Brethren's 
settlements in the fork of Delaware and at Letiz, 
near <a href='/results.php?city=lancaster' rel='city'>Lancaster</a>, and at Hope, in Sussex county, West 
Jersey, protection for their persons and property, 
against all such oppressive and destructive measures. 
</p><p>
It is our duty to comfort and to help, as far as we 
are able, all the distressed, and to serve the public 
in our callings, wherever we can. We have done it 
with a willing heart, and intend, by the grace of 
God, to do so as long as we live. 
</p><p>
Recommending your Excellency to God's favor and 
protection, I am, with deepest respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most humble servant, 
</p><p>
JOHN ETTWEIN. 
</p><p>
P. S. The bearer, Mr. Hasse, is well informed of 
our circumstances, and can give your Excellency further explanation of one thing or the other, if it is 
desired.

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
How happy I have been in receiving your Excellency's favor of the 10th present, I hope you will 
be convinced by the knowledge of my tender affection for you. I am very sensible of that goodness, 
which tries to dissipate my fears about that ridiculous Canadian expedition. At the present time we 
know which was the aim of the honorable Board, 
and for which project three or four men have rushed 
the country into a great expense, and risked the reputation of our arms, and the life of many hundred 
men, had the General, your deceived friend, been as 
rash and foolish as they seem to have expected. 0, 
American freedom, what shall become of you, if you 
are in such hands ! 
</p><p>
I have received a letter from the Board, and a re 
solve from Congress, by which you are directed to 
recall me and the Baron de Kalb, whose presence is 
deemed absolutely necessary to your army. I believe 
that of General Conway is absolutely necessary to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, and he has received orders to stay there, which 
I have no objection to, as nothing, perhaps, will be 
done in this quarter but some disputes of Indians 
and Tories. However, you know I have wrote to 
Congress, and as soon as their leave will come, I 
shall let Conway have the command of these few 
regiments, and I shall immediately join my respect 
able friend ; but till I have received instructions for 
leaving that place from yourself, I shall stay, as 
powerful Commander-in-chief, as if Congress had never 
resolved my presence absolutely necessary for the 
Great Army. 
</p><p>
Since your last letter, I have given up the idea 
of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and my only desire is to join you. 
The only favor I have asked of your Commissioners 
in France, has been, not to be under any orders but 
those of General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>. I seem to have had 
an anticipation of our future friendship ; and what I 
have done out of esteem and respect for your Excellency's name and reputation, I should do now out of 
mere love for General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> himself. I am 
glad to hear General Greene is Quartermaster-General ; it is very interesting to have there an honest 
man and a friend of yours. 
</p><p>
But I feel the greatest pain not to hear any thing 
about reinforcements. What can you do with a 
handful of men ? And my poor division, whom I was 
so desirous of instructing, clothing, managing myself 
in the winter, and whom, I was told, I should find 
six thousand strong at the opening of the campaign! 
Don t your Excellency think that I could recruit a 
little in General Greene's division, now that he is 
Quartermaster-General ? By that promotion I find 
myself very proud to be the third officer of your army. 
</p><p>
With the utmost respect and affection, I have the 
</p><p>
honor to be, &e.,

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Availing myself of the present moment of tranquillity, I sit down to renew a correspondence, which 
has been long interrupted, either by my residence in 
Italy, or by that common calamity which I am persuaded we both sincerely lament. Yet, how shall I 
resume a subject, which, by naturally carrying us 
back to those happy days when our acquaintance 
commenced, and obliging us to compare them with 
that sad and unfortunate reverse which has since 
happened, must necessarily affect us both with con 
cern ? A civil war, spreading enmity and distrust 
where affection and confidence ought naturally to prevail, is a circumstance which not only we, but every 
one not lost to humanity, must, I persuade myself, 
most seriously deplore. 
</p><p>
And is there no way to stop the further progress 
of this ruin, and heal the wounds which have been 
opened by so dire a calamity? Must the parent and 
the child be forever at r variance? And can either of 
them be happy, independent of the other? You, my 
dear Sir, know too well the circumstances and inte 
rest both of Great Britain and America, not to perceive the impossibility of it. Great Britain and 
America, united, will constitute the fairest and happiest state in the world; but, divided, they will be 
quite the reverse. It is not even possible that America should be happy, unconnected with Great Britain. 
Will the union, for example, which is at this time so 
firm among the Americans, from the sense of a common cause, be permanent, when they are totally in 
dependent? Are there no circumstances in the state 
of each Colony, no ingredients in the character of 
their respective inhabitants, which render this morally 
impossible ? A worse and more disastrous war than 
the present will, in such case, not fail, in the space 
of half a century, to desolate America from border to 
border. Remember the States of Greece after the re 
treat of the Persians; remember the Peloponnesian 
war. 
</p><p>
France, too; is it to be supposed, however specious 
and fair her conduct and promises may be at present, 
that she can in reality be a well-wisher to America? 
I doubt not of her professions, indeed, nor even of 
her readiness, in case of any appearance of a recon 
ciliation taking place between us, to make war sooner 
than suffer it to come to a conclusion. But will it 
be from affection to America that she will do so? 
Et sic notus Ulysses ? Will it not rather be from 
hope that Great Britain and America may weaken 
each other, and then fall a common prey to her insidious arts ? There can be no doubt of it. You 
yourself have most sensibly experienced the perfidy 
of that false and treacherous people. The interest of 
Great Britain and America is the same ; the same lineage, the same language, the same liberty, the 
same religion connecting them; but that of America 
and France is diametrically opposite, absolutely irreconcilable. 
</p><p>
That union and harmony, then, which so happily 
subsisted between us in the year <a href='/results.php?year=1763'>1763</a>, ought to be 
again revived, and forever preserved hereafter invio 
late and sacred. This, I am convinced, is the ardent 
wish of every good and honest man in this kingdom, 
whether in the highest or the humblest stations. In 
deed, the appointment of the present commission is an 
incontrovertible proof of it. Whatever errors or mis 
understandings there may have happened during the 
course of this unfortunate business, it is time that 
they were rectified, and that the wounds were on 
both sides healed. Let us mutually forget our past 
misfortunes, and unanimously strive to recover our former happiness and friendship. Let affliction teach 
us wisdom and moderation. 
</p><p>
You, my dear Sir, whose virtues have raised you 
to so eminent and conspicuous a situation, may, by 
using and exerting your endeavours, contribute very 
much to the completion of so divine a purpose ; and thereby acquire more glory, and confer more real 
and lasting service, both to your own country and to 
mankind in general, than perhaps ever yet happened 
to the lot of any one man. May Heaven give you 
the power, as I doubt not the inclination, to effect 
so great and virtuous a design! 
</p><p>
Allow me, before I take leave of you, to inquire 
after Mrs. <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> and my friends. I hope they 
are well; and desire that you will recall me to their 
remembrance. You will find, by a very imperfect 
and I fear injudicious, account of my travels in Ame 
rica, which I have taken the liberty to send you, 
how deep a sense I retain of the kindness and civilities of my American acquaintance. I hope Mrs. 
<a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> will not think that I have spoken too 
slightly of the Virginian ladies. If she does, be so 
good as to remind her, in a whisper, that I was at 
that time in love with a lady whom I had left in 
England ; and, of course, was half blind to the beauty 
of every one else. I was not, however, insensible to 
her merit; and I would add, if it were not for fear that she would suspect me of flattery, that the happiness of her acquaintance obliged me to speak that 
truth of the Virginian ladies, which, in my present 
judgment, I think the most honorable testimony I 
could bear to their virtue, "that they make the best 
wives and best mothers in the world." 
</p><p>
Wythe is, I take for granted, as philosophical and 
Socratic as ever, and as deeply absorbed in Grecian 
literature. Be so good as to present my best affections to him. Our friend, Small, is, alas ! no more. 
He died about two years ago, leaving a considerable 
fortune, but a much more considerable character be 
hind him. 
</p><p>
I am, myself, in possession of every blessing in life ;a respectable preferment, an independent fortune, a 
wife after the Virginian model, four sons and a daughter, and, above all things, of the most perfect friend 
ship and affection for yourself; being, dear Sir, with 
the highest respect and gratitude, your most faithful

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
In consequence of a letter from Governor Henry 
to the Virginia Delegates, directing the payment of 
thirty thousand dollars, as an additional bounty granted to the soldiers who have reenlisted into the Virginia regiments, I am to inform you, that the money 
shall be paid in any manner you may please to 
direct. 
</p><p>
It was with the most painful sensibility that I perused your last letter, on the subject of the present 
state of the army, and I am equally concerned in reflecting, that I do not see effectual measures taken 
to ward off the impending blow. 
</p><p>
As to the establishment, I am under no doubt of 
its being adopted, and put upon a ground of stability. 
Its not having taken effect as yet, has been owing to a thin representation. Virginia, the leader in this 
great business, for want of the constituent number to 
form a representation, remains a cipher, without suffrage, at this momentous period. Did I not fear to 
intrude upon your hours of essential business, I should 
sometimes write- to you, for my own information, on 
military subjects ; here being the greatest ignorance 
in every occurrence of that kind, mixed with an in 
activity, that permits affairs of the greatest magnitude to lie dormant, and give place to local trifles. I have 
said with freedom, in few words, what has often occurred since I have been here. I wish I had the 
capability to apply an instant remedy, for nothing 
procrastinated will do. However, the military establishment will come out soon. God knows what other 
regulations may take place. Virginia's drafted men 
will come on soon, and I believe may amount to 
seventeen hundred, instead of two thousand voted, as 
it is highly probable more men desert of those compelled into service, than if they had entered voluntarily. Colonel Harrison's artillery regiment are on 
their march. Would volunteers, provided they can be 
had, be of service to your operations ? Certain it is. 
they will not come out in such numbers as some have 
conjectured; but I believe a considerable body, per 
haps two battalions, may be induced to venture their 
persons, in this time of danger.

The order on the Paymaster, if it is to go through 
his hands, will and eighty dollars ; the eighty

Notwithstanding the different parts, Sir, we have 
taken in the unhappy differences still subsisting between Great Britain and America, I. flatter myself there yet remains a mutual share of esteem between 
your Excellency and me ; and I hope you do me the 
justice to think, that should the Commissioners, by 
whom I have the honor of sending this, be fortunate 
enough to accomplish a reconciliation, it will give me 
the highest pleasure. When I inform your Excellency that my brother, William Eden, whom I have a very 
great regard for, is one of them, I have no doubt of 
his meeting with all such civilities as you in your station can offer, or he in his desire. You may believe me when I assure you, that he heartily wishes 
success to his undertaking, and that you will find in 
him as much candor and probity as you could desire 
in a person you will probably have to treat with. 
He will assure you that I have endeavoured, at all 
times, to do justice to your character, and that I shall 
be happy in meeting your Excellency again on the 
same free and friendly terms we formerly lived. I 
beg my compliments may be offered to Mrs. <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>, and Mr. and Miss Custis ; and have the honor

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
On my arrival at <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a>, I found Lieutenant Colonel Campbell, who proposed my going with him to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, as he thought he could aid me greatly in furthering t some immediate relief to our suffering prisoners. By Colonel Allen I received General 
Clinton's permission to attend Colonel Campbell, and 
then proceeded to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. I found Major-General 
Daniel Jones in the command, and General Valentine Jones Commandant of the city. Both these gentle 
men appear determined to give every relief to prisoners that is in their power. They treated me with 
uncommon civility, and granted me every thing I 
asked. 
</p><p>
The exchange, I took with me, was completely carried into execution, with the addition of twenty-five 
officers and about twenty privates, being for the servants of General Burgoyne, Colonel Campbell, and 
others. General Jones has given me the strongest 
assurances that our officers and privates will not have 
reason again to complain of unnecessary severity ; in 
deed, their whole system appears to be changed, or 
at least in confusion. I cannot but mention the service I received from Colonel Campbell, who seems 
determined to interest himself in mitigating the rigors 
of captivity, which he appears well acquainted with. 
</p><p>
Many of our officers, who are now exchanged, are 
at a loss to know what to do, there being no provision made for them ; and having left both property 
and friends, they are anxious for any employment in 
which they may hope for some satisfaction for the 
multitude and severity of their sufferings. 
</p><p>
As I am much engaged to get my accounts in pro 
per order, I shall remain here till that is done, unless I receive other orders from your Excellency, 
which I beg to be favored with, if you think my 
immediate presence necessary at camp. If a successor to my department has been nominated, I should 
be much obliged by the information. I have the 
honor to be, with the greatest regard and esteem, 
your Excellency's

MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Agreeably to your Excellency's orders I have taken 
the oath of the gentlemen officers in General Woodford's brigade, and their certificates have been sent 
to the Adjutant-General's office. Give me leave, now, 
to present you with some observations delivered to 
me by many officers in that brigade, who desire me 
to submit them to your perusal. I know, Sir, (be 
sides I am not of their opinion in the fact itself), 
that I should not accept for you the objections those 
gentlemen could have had, as a body, to any order 
from Congress; but I confess the desire of being 
agreeable to them, of giving them any mark of 
friendship and affection, which is in my power, and 
acknowledging the kind sentiments they honor me 
with, have been my first and dearest considerations. 
</p><p>
Besides that, be pleased to consider that they began by obeying orders, and want only to let their 
beloved General know which were the reasons of their 
being rather reluctant (as far as reluctance may comply with their duty and honor) to an oath, the 
meaning and spirit of which was, I believe, misunderstood by them. I may add, Sir, with a perfect 
conviction, that there is not one among them but 
would be* thrice happy, were occasions offered to them 
of distinguishing yet, ly new exertions, their love for 
their country, their zeal for their duty as officers, 
their consideration for the civil superior power, and 
their love for your Excellency.

With the greatest respect and most tender affection, I have the honor to be, &c.,

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
It may ? perhaps, be some entertainment to you, to 
be informed of the proceedings of the present Assembly. 
</p><p>
After choosing Colonel Harrison Speaker, by a 
great majority, they seemed to be determined against 
every act of legislation which did not, in some measure, tend to the security of independence. The 
sense of the House was taken, as to their inclination 
to proceed upon the report of the revisers of the 
laws; but it was decided that the general business 
of the Commonwealth should be postponed until the 
military arrangements were absolutely settled. But I 
wish the prospect of success was equal to the ardor 
of the law-makers. They have, indeed, a bill, now 
committed to the whole House, for raising two thou 
sand volunteers, to reenforce your Excellency. They 
have annexed numberless seducing advantages, in order to obtain recruits. , But the demon of warice, 
and spirit of extortion, seem to have expelled pure 
patriotism from the breasts of those who usually compose armies. A regiment of horse is voted, also, to 
consist of three hundred and fifty. This, I conceive, 
will be soon completed, as many men of family and 
fortune propose to enter as privates. 
</p><p>
An act has passed the House of Delegates, agreeably to the recommendation from your Excellency 
and Congress, for the oblivion of past treasons. The 
persons in this country, who will be the objects of 
this law, are few in number, and I am afraid the 
time allowed for their coming in is too short for our act to have any effect in the army. A battalion of 
infantry is to be raised, for garrison duty, at the 
ports and harbours of this State. General Nelson 
leaves <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a> to-day, on his way to camp ; but 
it cannot be ascertained, before his arrival at <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a>, what number of troops he will carry with 
him. I am, dear Sir, your Excellency's

FROM GOVERNOR MORRIS. 
</p><p>
In Congress, 27 May, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have a word to say to you upon the subject of 
promotion, which we have just now finished, or rather 
unfinished, at least if that matter was before in an 
unfinished situation. That famous incomprehensible 
<a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a> Resolution (unluckily perhaps) introduced a very tedious debate, which terminated, at length, 
by rejecting the whole of what the Committee re 
ported with relation to the promoting of officers. 
</p><p>
You may be a little surprised when I tell you, 
that upon the whole matter I believe this is best. 
But how? It is true, I confess, that much ground of 
heart-burning is left under the <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a> Resolution 
governing these matters, by the mysterious trinity of 
seniority, merit, and quota. Let me, however, on the 
other hand, observe, that to tie up the hands of the 
Republic, as to the officers whom they are to appoint, 
is utterly inconsistent with the republican principles 
of Government, which ought to prevail among us. 
No danger, it is true, can arise at present; but, my 
dear Sir, we are laying foundations ; and how posterity, in future wars, may build on the foundations 
laid by ancestors, whom they will certainly reverence, 
no man can be hardy enough to assert. 
</p><p>
What, then, you will say, is the effect of the new 
rule ? In my poor opinion, it is no rule. What, 
then, is the use of the Resolution ? Nothing more 
than an apology for officers whom it may be found 
necessary to supersede. Congress, in effect, seem to 
have pledged themselves to their constituents, that 
they will pay a due attention to the quota of troops 
furnished by the States respectively, to the seniority 
of the several officers, and to that degree of military 
ability which nature or industry may have conferred 
upon deserving individuals. You ask me, what is to 
be the rule below the degree of a General Officer? I 
answer, that Congress could not, with propriety, make 
any rule. They have given to the States the power 
of appointing the officers in their own regiments. Of 
consequence, therefore, it would be idle to restrict 
them as to the persons whom they shall appoint. It 
will, therefore, be necessary to make application to 
the several States on the occasion. They have al 
ready, I believe, in most instances, given you the 
necessary power; and if so, then to fix the order of 
promotion will be only a limitation of such power. 
What are my ideas on the occasion, you will see 
by the letter I inclose, directed to Governor Clinton, 
which you will do me the honor to transmit to him. 
I am, dear General, 
</p><p>
Most sincerely, yours,

GOVERNOR MORRIS.

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have sent to your address three bundles, containing the several materials collected by the Committee 
for arranging the army. This business being now put 
under your care, I trust you will be enabled speedily 
to put your arm} " in the situation you wish, excepting always the deficiency of numbers, which is, upon 
the whole, well enough, since thereby it happens that 
less of the resources of the country are consumed ; 
and this is certainly a war of resources. The opinion 
of Congress, relative to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, you have doubt 
less ere this received. Mine did not arise from any pleasure I take in the distresses of my fellow-creatures ; still less from that horrid love of proscriptions, 
which, however dictated, certainly disgraces human 
nature. Simply, I wished that our enemies should be 
mulcted before they were received into our bosom, 
and that we might thereby possess ourselves of the 
sinews of war. 
</p><p>
Should there be still other desiderata as to the 
army, which, indeed, I well know there are, pray let 
me hear of them in a letter, to which I shall call 
the attention of the House, who have now entangled 
themselves in such an infinity of matter, that some 
management is really necessary to lead them to the 
most serious and important objects. The Committee 
had written to Governor Clinton for his assistance in 
arranging the regiments not with you. So much as 
I received in answer to that application you will find 
among the bundles. Whatever may come to hand, 
regarding Gansevoort's regiment, I shall do myself 
the honor to transmit immediately. I am called away. 
</p><p>
Should Mrs. <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> be still in camp, which, I 
confess., is rather unlikely, pray present my respects 
to her. I have the honor to be, dear General.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I had the honor, last evening, of your favor of the 
9th instant, requesting me to repair to camp, to assist in the business of arranging the army, as soon 
as possible. Although I am impressed with the necessity of that business being finished without delay, 
yet I cannot, in duty to the State I represent, quit 
Congress till the Confederation is ratified, which I 
hope will be done in a few days. In the mean time, 
the arrangement may go on, as General Heed will 
doubtless be at hand to assist you. He has paid a 
particular attention to the battalions of this State ; 
those of Maryland, on account of their distance from 
your camp, the Committee could make no inquiry 
about. These, also, may be arranged without any 
assistance from me ; and, indeed, I know nothing 
about either of them. Those to which I paid a particular attention were the battalions of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Jersey, and Virginia ; the last of which may be settled by conferring 
with the General Officers of that line, whose recommendation we followed. 
</p><p>
I will get the necessary papers from Mr. Morris, 
and forward them to you, with the hope of taking 
some labor from off your hands. I should have been 
happy to have given my immediate attendance in 
camp. I trust by the time you, with the assistance 
of General Heed, may have gone through the batta 
lions of this State, Maryland, and Virginia, to have 
the pleasure of affording you in this business all the 
assistance in my power. I am, dear Sir, with much 
respect and esteem,

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I hope you have received my letter from Cran 
berry, where I acquaint you that I am going to 
<a href='/results.php?city=hightstown' rel='city'>Hightstown</a>, though we are short of provisions. When 
I got there, I was sorry to hear that Mr. Hamilton, 
who had been riding all the night, had not been able 
to find anybody who could give him certain intelligence ; but, by a party who came back, I hear the 
enemy are in motion, and their rear about one mile 
off the place they had occupied last night, which is 
seven or eight miles from here. I immediately put 
Generals Maxwell's and Wayne's brigades in motion, 
and I will fall lower down, with General Scott's, with 
Jackson's regiment, and some militia, I should be 
very happy if we could attack them before they halt, 
for I have no notion of taking one other moment but 
this of the march. If I cannot overtake them, we 
could lay at some distance, and attack to-morrow 
morning, provided they don t escape in the night, 
which I much fear, as our intelligences are not the 
best ones. I have sent some parties out, and I will 
get some more light by them. 
</p><p>
I fancy your Excellency will move down with the 
army, and if we are at a convenient distance from 
you, I have nothing to fear in striking a blow, if opportunity is offered. I believe that, in our present 
strength, provided they do not escape, we may do some 
thing. General Fornian says that, on account of the 
nature of the country, it is impossible for me to be 
turned by the right or left ; but that I shall not quite 
depend upon. 
</p><p>
An officer, just from the lines, confirms the account 
of the enemy moving. An intelligence from General 
Dickinson says, that they hear a very heavy fire in 
the front of the enemy's column. I apprehend it is 
Morgan, who had not received my letter; but it will 
have the good effect of stopping them, and, if we 
attack, he may begin again. 
</p><p>
Sir, I want to repeat to you, in writing, what I 
have told to you, which is, that, if you believe it, or 
if it is believed necessary or useful to the good of 
the service and the honor of General Lee, to send 
him down with a couple of thousand men, or any 
greater force, I will cheerfully obey and serve him, 
not only out of duty, but out of what I owe to that 
gentleman's character. 
</p><p>
I hope to receive soon your orders, as to what I 
am to do this day or to-morrow ; to know where you 
are, and what you intend ; and would be very happy 
to furnish you with the opportunity of completing 
some little advantage of ours.

<a href='/results.php?city=englishtown' rel='city'>Englishtown</a>. 30 June, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
We esteem it a duty, which we owe to our country, ourselves, and the officers and soldiers under our command, to state the following facts to your Excellency. 
</p><p>
On the 28th instant, at five o'clock in the morning, 
we received orders to march with the following detachments, namely, Scott's and Varnum's brigades, 
Colonels Butler and Jackson in front, amounting to 
seventeen hundred men Colonels Wesson, Livingston, 
and Stewart, with one thousand men, commanded by 
General Wayne ; a select detachment of fourteen hundred men, rank and file, under General Scott, with 
ten pies of artillery properly distributed among the 
whole. 
</p><p>
About eight o clock, the van under Colonel Butler 
arrived on the left of Monmouth Court-House, on 
the rear of the left flank of the enemy, who were in 
full march, moving in r great haste and confusion. At 
this time our main body, under General Lee, were 
formed at the edge of a wood about half a mile distant from the Court-House. General Wayne, who 
was in front reconnoitring the enemy, perceiving that 
they had made a halt, and were preparing to push 
Colonel Butler with their horse and a few foot, gave 
direction for him to form and receive them, and at 
the same time sent Major Byles to General Lee, re 
questing that those troops might be advanced to 
support those in front, and for the whole to form on 
the edge of a deep morass, which extends from the 
east of the Court-House on the right a very considerable distance to the left. The troops did arrive in 
about an hour after the requisition, and were generally formed in this position. 
</p><p>
About the same time, General Scott's detachment 
had passed the morass on the left, and the enemy's 
horse and foot, that had charged Colonel Butler, were 
repulsed. The number of the enemy now in view 
might be near two thousand, though at first not more 
than five hundred, exclusive of their horse. The 
ground we now occupied was the best formed by 
nature for defence of any, perhaps, in this country. 
The enemy advanced with caution, keeping at a considerable distance in front. General Scott, having 
viewed the position of the enemy, as well as the 
ground where about twenty-five hundred of our troops 
were formed, repassed the morass and took post on 
the left, in a fine open wood, covered by said morass 
in front. 
</p><p>
Whilst this was doing, General Wayne, perceiving 
that the troops on the right, from the wood to the 
Court-House, were retreating, sent Major Fishbourn 
to General Lee, requesting that the troops might re 
turn to support him. In the interim General Wayne repassed the morass, leaving Colonel Butler's regiment to keep post on the right flank of the enemy. 
Generals Scott and Wayne then went together along 
the morass to the Court-House, when Major Fishbourn returned, and said that General Lee gave no 
other answer, than that he would see General Wayne himself, which he never did. The enemy, having now 
an opening on the right of General Scott, began to 
move on, when General Wayne and General Scott sent 
to General Lee to request him at least to form, to 
favor General Scott's retreat ; but this requisition met 
with the same fate as the last. The troops kept still 
retreating, when General Scott, perceiving that he 
would not be supported, filed off by the left. General Wayne ordered Colonel Butler to fall back also. 
Thus were these several select detachments unac 
countably drawn off without being suffered to come 
to action, although we had the most pleasing prospect, from our numbers and position, of obtaining 
the most glorious and decisive victory. After this, 
we fortunately fell in with your Excellency. You 
ordered us to form, part of those troops, whose con 
duct and bravery kept the enemy in play, until you 
had restored order. 
</p><p>
We have taken the liberty of stating these facts, 
in order to convince the world that our retreat from 
the Court-house was not occasioned by the want of 
numbers, position, or wishes of both officers and men 
to maintain that post. We also beg leave to mention, that no plan of attack was ever communicated 
to us, or notice of a retreat, until it had taken place 
in our rear, as we supposed by General Lee's order. 
We are, &c.,

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I came to this place early yesterday morning ; the 
enemy had left it the night before ; their main body 
is encamped about three miles from the town ; their 
rear within a mile ; we are in full view of each other. 
I am, and have been ever since I came out, at a 
great loss for light-horse, having none with me. General Scott sent me a sergeant and six, whose horses 
were tired, and were rather an incumbrance, as they 
could scarcely raise a gallop. Major Jameson was 
here yesterday. I applied to him. for a few ; he sent 
Captain Harrison, who staid with me about two hours, 
when Colonel Moylan sent for him. and his party. 
Colonel Moylan certainly has reasons for so doing; 
but, Sir, you know the cavalry are the eyes of the 
infantry, and without any, my situation must not be 
very pleasing, being in full view of the enemy's whole 
army. 
</p><p>
My advance engaged their rear yesterday. They 
reenforced, and sent a column on each flank. We re 
treated to a hill at this end of the town. They 
retreated to their own ground; a few were killed. 
I had one slightly wounded ; but had no horse till 
Cornet Dorsey luckily came up. I am, with esteem, 
Your most obedient and humble servant,

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have received your Excellency's favor by General Greene, and have been much pleased with the 
arrival of a gentleman, who, not only on account of 
his merit and the justness of his views, but also by 
his knowledge of the country, and his popularity in 
this State, may be very serviceable to the expedition. 
I willingly part with the half of my detachment, 
though I had a great dependence upon them, as you 
find it convenient to the good of the service. Any 
thing, my dear General, you will order, or even wish, 
shall always be infinitely agreeable to me, and I will 
always feel happy in doing any thing which may please you, or forward the public good. I am of the 
same opinion as your Excellency, that dividing our Continental troops among the militia will have a better effect than if we were to keep them together in 
one wing. 
</p><p>
You will receive, by General Sullivan, an account 
of his dispositions, preparations, &c. I therefore have 
nothing to add, but that I have been on board of 
the Admiral the day before yesterday. I saw among 
the fleet an ardor, and a desire of doing something, 
which would soon turn into impatience if we don t 
give them a speedy occasion of fighting. The officers cannot contain their soldiers and sailors, who are 
complaining that they have been these four months 
running after the British, without getting at them ; 
but I hope they will be soon satisfied. 
</p><p>
The Count d Estaing was very glad of my arrival, 
as he could open freely his mind to me. He ex 
pressed the greatest anxiety on account of his wants 
of every kind, provisions, water, &c. He hopes the 
taking of Rhode Island will enable him to get some 
of the two above-mentioned articles. The Admiral 
wants me to join the French troops to those I command, as soon as possible. I confess I feel very 
happy to think of my cooperating with them ; and, 
had I contrived in my mind an agreeable dream, I 
could not have wished a more pleasing event than 
my joining my countrymen with my brothers of Ame 
rica, under my command, and the same standards. 
When I left Europe, I was very far from hoping such 
an agreeable turn of our business in the American 
glorious revolution. 
</p><p>
Though I have no account, neither observations, to 
give to your Excellency, as I am here a man-of-war of the third rate, I will, after the expedition, scribble 
some lines to you, and join, to the account of General 
Sullivan, the assurance that I have all my limbs ; and 
that I am, with the most tender affection, and entire 
confidence, yours, with high respect,

FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 
</p><p>
Camp, before <a href='/results.php?city=newport' rel='city'>Newport</a>, 25 August, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>. 
</p><p>
MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I had expected, in answering your first letter, that 
something interesting would have happened that I 
might communicate to your Excellency. Every day 
was going to terminate our uncertainties; nay, every 
day was going to bring the hope of a success, which 
I did promise myself to acquaint you of. Such was 
the reason of my deferring what my duty and inclination did urge me to do much sooner. I am now 
indebted for two favors of yours, which I beg leave 
to offer here my thanks for. The first letter reached 
me in the time we expected to hear again from the 
French fleet; the second I have just received. My 
reason for not writing the same day the French fleet 
went to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> was, that I did not choose to trouble 
your friendship with the sentiments of an afflicted, 
injured heart, and injured by that very people I came 
from so far to love and support. Don t be surprised, my dear General; the generosity of your honest 
mind would be offended at the shocking sight I have 
under my eyes. 
</p><p>
So far am I from a critical disposition, that I will 
not give you the journal of our operations, neither 
of several instances during our staying here, which, 
however, might occupy some room in this letter. I 
will not even say to you, how contracted was the 
French fleet, when they wanted to come in at their 
arrival, which, according to the report of the animadverters, would have had the greatest effect; how 
surprised was the Admiral, when, after a formal and 
agreed convention, one hour after the American General had given a new written assurance, our troops 
made the landing a day before it was expected ; how 
mortified the French officers were to find out That there was not a gun left in these very forts, to whose 
protection they were recommended. All these things, 
and many others, I Would not take notice of, if they 
were not at this moment the supposed ground upon 
which it is said that the Count d Estaing is gone on 
to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. Believe me, my dear Sir, upon my honor, 
the Admiral, though a little astonished by some in 
stances of conduct on our part, did consider them in 
the same light as you and myself would have done ; 
and, if he is gone off, it is because he thought himself obliged by necessity. 
</p><p>
Let us consider, my dear General, the motions of 
that fleet, since it was proposed by the Count d Estaing himself, and granted by the King in behalf of 
the United States. I will not go so far up as to re 
member other instances of the affection the French 
nation have for the Americans. The news of that 
fleet have occasioned the evacuation of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
Its arrival has opened all the harbours, secured all the 
coasts, obliged the British navy to be together. Six 
of those frigates (two of them I have seen sufficient 
for terrifying all the trading people of the two Carolinas) are taken or burnt. The Count d Estaing went 
to offer battle, and act as a check to the British navy, 
for a long time. At <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> it was agreed he 
should go to Rhode Island, and there he went. They 
prevented him from going in at first; afterwards he 
was desired to come in, and so he did. The same 
day we landed, without his knowledge, an English 
fleet appears in sight. His being divided into three parts by our directions (for, though he is a Lieu 
tenant-General, he never availed himself of that title), 
made him uneasy about his situation. But, finding 
the next morning that the wind was northerly, being 
also convinced that it was his duty to prevent any 
reinforcement at <a href='/results.php?city=newport' rel='city'>Newport</a>, he goes out, under the 
hottest fire of the British land-batteries; he puts the 
British navy to flight, and pursues them, and they 
were all in his hands when that horrid storm arrived 
to ruin all our hopes. Both fleets are divided, scattered. The Caesar, a seventy-four gun ship, is lost; 
the Marseillais, of the same size, loses her masts, and, 
after that accident, is obliged to send back [permit 
to escape ?] an enemy's ship of sixty-four ; the Languedoc, having lost her masts, unable to be governed 
and make any motions, separated from the others, is 
attacked by a ship of the line, against which she 
could only bring six guns. 
</p><p>
When the storm was over, they met again in a 
shattered condition, and the Csesar was not to be 
found. All the Captains represented to their General, 
that, after a so long navigation, in such a want of 
victuals, water, &c., which they had not yet been 
supplied with, after the intelligence given by General 
Sullivan, that there was a British fleet coming, they 
should go to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>; tout the Count d Estaing had 
promised to come here again, and so he did, at all 
events. The news of his arrival and situation canie 
by the Senegal; a frigate taken from the enemy. General Greene and myself went on "board. The Count 
expressed to me, not so much to the envoy from General Sullivan, as to his friend, the unhappy circum 
stances he was in. Bound by express orders from the 
King to go to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> in case of an accident or superior fleet, engaged by the common sentiment of all 
the officers, even of some American pilots, that he would 
ruin all his squadron in deferring his going to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, 
he called a new Council of War, and, finding every 
body of the same opinion, he did not think himself 
justifiable in staying here any longer, and took leave 
of me with true affliction, not being able to assist 
America for some days ; which has been rewarded with 
the most horrid ungratefulness. But no matter. I am 
only speaking of facts. The Count said to me these 
last words : "After many months of sufferings, my men 
will rest some days ; I will man my ships, and, if I 
am assisted in getting masts, &c., three weeks after 
my arrival I shall go out again, and then we shall 
fight for the glory of the French name, and the inte 
rests of America," 
</p><p>
The day the Count went off, the General American Officers drew up a protestation, which, as had been very strangely called there I refused to sign ; but I 
wrote a letter to the Admiral. The protestation and the letter did not arrive in time. 
</p><p>
Now, my dear General, I am going to hurt your generous feelings by an imperfect picture of what I 
am forced to see. Forgive me for it ; it is not to the 
Commander-in-chief, it is to my most dearest friend. 
General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>, that I am speaking. I want to 
lament with him the ungenerous sentiments I have 
been forced to see in many American breasts. 
Could you believe that, forgetting any national 
obligation, forgetting what they were owing to that 
same fleet, what they were yet to expect from them, 
and, instead of resenting their accidents as those of 
allies and brothers, the people turned mad at their 
departure, and, wishing them all the evils in the 
world, did treat them as a generous one would be 
ashamed to treat the most inveterate enemies ? You 
cannot have any idea of the horrors which were to 
be heard on that occasion. Many leaders themselves, 
finding they were disappointed, abandoned their minds 
to illiberality and ungratefulness. Frenchmen of the 
highest character have been exposed to the most disagreeable circumstances; and yet, myself the friend 
of America, the friend of General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>, I am 
more upon a warlike footing in the American lines 
than when I came near the British lines at <a href='/results.php?city=newport' rel='city'>Newport</a>. 
</p><p>
Such is, my dear General, the true state of matters. I am sure it will infinitely displease and hurt 
your feelings. I am also sure you will approve the 
part I have taken in it, which was, to stay much at 
home with all the French gentlemen who are here, 
and declare, at the same time, that any thing thrown 
before me against my nation, I would take as the 
most particular affront. 
</p><p>
Inclosed I send you the general orders of the 24th, 
upon which I thought I was obliged to pay a visit 
to General Sullivan, who has agreed to alter them in 
the following manner. Remember, my dear General, 
that I don t speak to the Commander-in-chief, but 
to my friend ; that I am far from complaining of any 
body. I have no complaints at all to make to you 
against any one ; but I lament, with you, that I have 
had an occasion of seeing so ungenerous sentiments 
in American hearts. 
I will tell you the true reason. The leaders of the 
expedition are, most of them, ashamed to return, after 
having spoken of their Rhode Island success in proud terms before their family, their friends, their internal 
enemies. The others, regardless of the expense France 
has been put to by that fleet, of the tedious, tire 
some voyage which so many men have had for their 
service, though they are angry that the fleet takes 
three wrecks of the whole campaign to rent them 
selves, cannot bear the idea of being brought to a 
small expense, to the loss of a little time, to the 
fatigue of staying some few days more in a camp at 
some few miles off their houses ; for I am very far from looking upon the expedition as having miscarried, and I see even a certainty of success. 
</p><p>
If, as soon as the fleet is repaired (which in case 
they are treated as one is in a country one is not at 
war with, would be done in three weeks from this 
time), the Count d Estaing was to come around, the 
expedition seems to offer a very good prospect. If 
the enemy evacuates <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, we have the whole 
Continental army ; if not, we might, perhaps, have 
some more men ; what number, however, I cannot 
pretend to judge. All that I know is, that I shall 
be very happy to see the fleet cooperating with General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> himself. 
</p><p>
I think I shall be forced, by the Board of General Officers, to go soon to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. That I will do as 
soon as required, though with reluctance, for I do not 
believe that our position on this part of the Island is 
without danger ; but my principle is, to do every 
thing which is thought good for the service. I have 
very often rode express to the fleet, to the frigates, 
and that, I assure you, with the greatest pleasure ; on 
the other hand, I may, perhaps, be useful to the fleet. 
Perhaps, too, it will be in the power of the Count to 
do something which might satisfy them. I wish, my 
dear General, you could know as well as myself, how 
desirous the Count d Estaing is to forward the public 
good, to help your success, and to serve the cause 
of America. 
</p><p>
I earnestly beg you will commend, to the several 
chief persons of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, to do every thing they can 
to put the French fleet in a situation for sailing soon. 
Give me leave to add, that I wish many people, by 
the declaration of your sentiments in that affair, could 
learn how to regulate theirs, and blush at the sight 
of your generosity. 
</p><p>
You will find my letter immense. I began it one day and finished it the next, as my time was swal 
lowed up by those eternal Councils of War. I shall 
have the pleasure of writing you from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. I am 
afraid the Count d Estaing will have felt to the 
quick the behaviour of the people on this occasion. 
You cannot conceive how distressed he was to be 
prevented from serving this country for some time. 
I do assure you his circumstances were very critical 
and distressing. For my part, my sentiments are 
known to the world. My tender affection for General 
<a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> is added to them; therefore, I want no 
apologies for writing upon what has afflicted me, both 
as an American and as a Frenchman. 
</p><p>
I am much obliged to you for the care you are so 
kind as to take of that poor horse of mine ; had he 
not found such a good stable as that at head-quarters, 
he would have cut a pitiful figure at the end of his 
travels, and I should have been too happy, if there 
had remained so much of the horse as the bones, the 
skin, and the four shoes. 
</p><p>
Farewell, my dear General; whenever I quit you, 
I meet with some disappointment and misfortune. I 
did not need it, to desire seeing you as much as possible. With the most tender affection and high regard, I have the honor to be, &c. 
</p><p>
LAFAYETTE. 
</p><p>
Dear General ; I must add to my letter, that I 
have received one from General Greene, very different from the expressions I have to complain of. lie 
seems there very sensible of what I feel. I am very 
happy when placed in a situation to do justice to 
any one.

FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 
</p><p>
Camp, near Warren, 24 September, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>. 
</p><p>
MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I am going to consult your Excellency upon a 
point, in which I not only want your leave and opinion, as the Commander-in-chief, but also your candid 
advice, as the man whom I have the happiness to 
call my friend. In an address from the British Com 
missioners to Congress, the first after Johnstone was 
excluded, they speak in the most disrespectful terms 
of my nation and country.* The whole is under 
signed by them, and more particularly by the Presi 
dent, Lord <a href='/results.php?city=carlisle' rel='city'>Carlisle</a>. I am the first French officer in 
rank of the American Army; I am not unknown to 
the British; and if somebody must take notice of 
such expressions, that advantage does, I believe, be 
long to me. Don t you think, my dear General, that 
I should do well to write a letter on the subject to Lord <a href='/results.php?city=carlisle' rel='city'>Carlisle</a>, wherein I should notice his expressions 
conveyed in an unfriendly manner? I have mentioned something of this design to the Count d Estaing, but wish entirely to fix my opinion by yours, 
which I instantly beg, as soon as you may find it 
convenient. 
</p><p>
As every thing is perfectly quiet, and General Sullivan is persuaded that I may, with all safety, go to 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, I am going to undertake a short journey to 
wards that place. The Admiral has several times 
expressed a desire of conversing with me ; he has 
also thrown out some wishes that something might 
be done towards securing <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>; but it seems he 
always refers to a conversation for further explanation. My stay will be short, as I don t like towns, 
in time of war, when I may be about a camp. If 
your Excellency answers me immediately, I may 
soon receive your letter. 
</p><p>
I want much to see you, my dear General, and 
consult you about many points; part of them are respecting myself. If you approve of my writing to 
Lord <a href='/results.php?city=carlisle' rel='city'>Carlisle</a>, it would be a reason for coming near you for a short time/ in case the gentleman is displeased with my mission. 
</p><p>
With the most perfect respect, confidence, and affection, I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
LAFAYETTE.

</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=paramus' rel='city'>Paramus</a>, Monday, 26 September, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>. 
</p><p>
I am exceeding sorry to be the author of bad 
news; but lest a more imperfect account should reach 
head-quarters, I think it my duty to acquaint your Excellency of the misfortune sustained by Colonel Baylor's corps. Early on Sunday, the Colonel re 
moved with his regiment from <a href='/results.php?city=paramus' rel='city'>Paramus</a> to Harring 
ton, a small place two or three miles from Tappan, 
and took quarters. Between three and four this 
morning, the enemy, conducted by a number of the 
inhabitants, surrounded his pickets and effectually surprised the whole regiment. At eleven o'clock (the 
hour of writing this) Captain Stith, a sergeant, and 
twelve or thirteen men, who escaped, have arrived at 
this place. Captain Stith says, being surprised at 
his quarters, he ran out of the house, and seeing, or 
rather hearing a body of horse, which he took for 
his own troop, he ordered them to form, adding, the 
British troops are near us. He was instantly at 
tacked, and finding himself surrounded, asked for 
quarter, which they refused; he then fired his pistol 
and escaped. 
</p><p>
About sunrise we heard a very brisk fire, for a few 
minutes, at Tappan, supposed to be a feeble resistance of the militia at that place. Some of the 
wounded, just arrived, say that the enemy did not 
stay to take away the horses which were in the stables; that they saw about twenty of Colonel Baylor's 
horsemen killed, and about twelve or fourteen mor 
tally wounded with bayonets. A party is just gone to bring off the wounded and horses, if possible ; and 
other parties are sent to discover the route and numbers of the enemy. Captain Stith says they were in 
great force, but as it was dark, he could not form 
any opinion of their numbers. He thinks Colonel 
Baylor and Major Clough are certainly taken, as he 
saw the British troops at their quarters, which were 
near his own. It is possible, he says, that some of 
the officers on their right may have escaped towards 
Kakiat, to which place the enemy were directing 
their march by the last accounts. 
</p><p>
I came to the Jerseys with a view of relieving a 
friend from captivity, and have had the happiness to 
meet him, with a number of others, about forty, who 
were exchanged this day week. Several are now waiting, at <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a>, a favorable opportunity to pay their 
duty at head-quarters. Coining here on my way to 
camp, at this critical time, Major Pell, who commands 
at this place, has done me the honor to advise with 
me what measures are most eligible for him to adopt. 
The sick, and the few stores he had, are sent towards 
<a href='/results.php?city=pompton' rel='city'>Pompton</a>. He will continue to be near the enemy, 
but, as his party is weak, will be under the necessity of changing his post often, to elude the treachery of the inhabitants. r General Winds has taken post, 
with about one thousand militia, on an eminence 
near Hackinsac. I cannot learn that General Max 
well has moved from <a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a>. Many reports 
are, that the enemy have landed there, and at New 
ark ; but the last and best accounts contradict them. 
</p><p>
I intend to join my regiment to-morrow, as I can 
not be of any further service to Major Pell, who is 
active and vigilant. Your Excellency's

Most obedient, humble servant,

</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 7 October, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
A few days since, I received your Excellency's 
letter in Maryland, dated White Plains, inclosing one from the Commissioners of Arrangement, respecting 
my not performing the duties incident to my station, 
and desiring I may be ordered to my regiment, without being previously exchanged ; and that, in case 
of refusal, there would be a vacancy, to which an 
active officer might be entitled to succeed. 
</p><p>
The motives, which seem chiefly to have influenced 
them in their determination, are, first, the complaints 
of the officers in the Pennsylvania line ; secondly, 
that I am under no obligation, from the terms of 
my enlargement, not to act against the enemy with 
out returning an officer of the same rank ; and, thirdly, that I have, in no instance since my liberation, 
been considered in the light of a prisoner of war by 
the enemy. 
</p><p>
Although no definitive steps with respect to me, as 
I am informed, have been taken, yet I cannot but 
look upon it as a hardship, that the Commissioners should undertake to pass sentence without affording me an opportunity of representing the rea 
sons which have induced me to observe a line of 
conduct so contrary to their opinion and judgment. 
This circumstance, I hope, will plead my excuse for 
troubling your Excellency with the motives and principles which have directed my conduct in a case so 
new and uncommon; and which, I trust, will have 
the desired effect with the Commissioners. 
</p><p>
As soon as I was known, after 1 was made prisoner, I was treated with the utmost politeness and humanity by the enemy; and General Prescott having 
applied to General Howe in my behalf, from a high 
sense of some civilities shown by my father, procured me my liberty without parole. It was an act of 
generosity, which I felt very sensibly, but the offer 
I did not accept, although I had the opinions of some 
officers who were near me in favor of it. 
</p><p>
The idea I entertained of my situation was, that a 
compliment of the highest nature was paid me in 
the manner of liberating me, and that the point of 
honor of sending in an equivalent before I took an 
active part in the army was left to me. Some few. 
however, when I returned home, being of opinion I 
might instantly join the army without an exchange. 
I thought proper to apply to General Gates, who was 
then in town, and advise with him, he being an old 
officer, and one who had been bred in a military 
school. He replied, he would give his opinion as a 
man of honor and my friend, and that, was he in my 
situation, he would not act before he was exchanged. 
</p><p>
About this time I received your Excellency's letter, making me an offer of sending in to General 
Prescott to fix upon some friend of his, who was 
prisoner among us, to be returned to them on the 
same terms on which I was set at liberty. 
</p><p>
This I most joyfully and thankfully accepted, as a 
mode which would remove every difficulty on my 
part, and place me on an equal footing with the 
other officers of the army. But an order to take up 
all the Field-Officers in our possession, and confine them, in retaliation of the hard usage of General Lee 
prevented its taking place. 
I then ventured so far to trespass on your goodness as to propose sending in such a number of inferior officers as would be equivalent to my rank in 
the army, which, as I have been informed, is a 
usual article in the cartels of Europe. 
</p><p>
This, as far as I recollect, you wrote me was 
out of your power, and inconsistent with the cartel 
settled between the two armies, and could not be 
done. I then thought I had nothing to do but wait 
my exchange in course. 
</p><p>
Some officers of the British army, taken at Prince 
ton, as my brother informed me, having mistaken 
him for me, and heard I was with the army again, 
publicly declared, if I was taken prisoner by the 
enemy, they would have put me to death. 
</p><p>
Sir William Erskine's opinion, given to Colonel 
Fitzgerald at Brunswic, after the above, was, that 
I was perfectly free to take an active part without 
exchange. But, since the evacuation of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 
happening at the City Tavern, in conversation with 
Mr. Willing, he told me that General Howe had ex 
pressed his opinion with respect to me, in the fullest manner ; and, in doing this, his surprise I should 
take an active part without being exchanged. Mr. 
Willing told him he had been misinformed, for that 
he knew I had not joined the army. General Howe 
then instanced my forcing some recruits for the regiment, who had mutinied on board a shallop in this 
city. Mr. Willing said, if I had fallen into their 
hands they would have treated me with great rigor. 
</p><p>
It is unnecessary to mention to your Excellency 
the opinions of a great number of gentlemen in and 
out of the army, corresponding with my own, on the 
manner of my being set at liberty, because I did it 
in a former letter. I did not think it necessary to 
trouble you with every incident, as it fell out, relative to me, but the conversation between Mr. Willing 
and General Howe is, I believe, quite new to you. 
</p><p>
Whenever I join the army, I hope to be put on a 
footing with the other officers in it; nor can it be 
expected that I should run the hard of having the 
propriety of my conduct, in case of falling into the 
enemy's hands, made a subject of discussion for a 
Court-Martial, or what is worse, perhaps, for a whimsical, capricious commanding officer, disposed to take 
advantage of ex parte evidence, or to receive the 
mere say-so of any man who may expect to advance 
his interest by showing his rancor against me. 
</p><p>
Having thus stated to your Excellency the motives 
and reasons, on which my conduct has been formed, 
I must beg leave to persist in it, notwithstanding the 
interested discourses of some officers in the Pennsylvania line. 
</p><p>
I have derived no emolument of any kind from 
the public, since I have been in my present situation. My view has been to serve in the army till 
our affairs should wear a favorable appearance, and 
then to quit it, but to apply for a command, if we 
should be again threatened ; and I hope I shall not 
be precluded from this privilege by any partial determination of the Commissioners of Arrangement : 
as it is, and ever has been, my fixed principle that 
it is better not to be, than survive the loss of those 
blessings which are the objects of this contest and 
be a witness of the dreadful scenes which would probably be acted in this country on so unfortunate an 
occasion. I have the honor to be, with the greatest 
respect and regard, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant,

19 October, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
You have been informed of my unfortunate surprise 
of the 28th ultimo, and, I make no doubt, of the circumstances ; but I think it my duty to make them 
known to you, and at the same time to justify my 
conduct. 
</p><p>
On the 26th of September I was at <a href='/results.php?city=paramus' rel='city'>Paramus</a> with 
the regiment, where we had been four days. I directed Major Clough, on the 26th, to send the Quarter-master out to provide quarters for the regiment 
within four or five miles of <a href='/results.php?city=paramus' rel='city'>Paramus</a>, and at the 
same distance from the enemy that we then were, 
and at the same time gave him my reasons for so 
doing; which he approved of. They were, that I 
was apprehensive that the enemy would, if we remained more than three or four days in one place, 
attempt what they executed in two days afterwards. 
</p><p>
On the morning of the 27th, I marched the regiment to the quarters provided for us at Harrington, 
and made it my business, the moment I arrived there, to make every necessary inquiry about the 
roads leading from the enemy's encampment to our quarters, and also went out and examined the country myself. I was of opinion it was the most secure 
place I could have stationed myself in, and that it 
was convenient to gain the earliest intelligence of the 
movement of the enemy, as it would have been had 
they not received the most particular intelligence of 
our guard and patrol. 
</p><p>
There were two roads leading from the enemy's 
camp to our quarters, one on each side of the Hackinsac River. They joined at a bridge, at half a mile 
distance from our quarters, where I myself fixed a 
guard, of a sergeant and twelve men, with particular orders to keep a patrol of two men out on each of 
these roads constantly. They were to patrol a mile 
below the guard, and to be relieved every hour. The 
guard were ordered to keep the strictest look-out on 
the bridge; and I have reason to believe that these 
orders were punctually obeyed. 
</p><p>
On the 28th, early in the morning, the enemy 
marched up on the west side of the Hackinsac River, 
within half a mile of the distance the patrols went 
down the roads ; they there sent off a detachment 
through the fields some distance from the road, until 
they had got above the guard, which they cut off 
without our hearing of it. All communication being 
cut off from our parties, they marched up to our quarters; and executed the horrid massacre of which 
Dr. Griffith will inform you the particulars, as appears from the depositions. 
</p><p>
I am happy to inform you that my wounds are 
nearly well, and that I hope soon to regain my 
former state of health. I am, with respect, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant,

FROM GOVERNOR MORRIS. 
</p><p>
In Congress, <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 11 November, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
As Congress have delegated to a Committee, of 
which I have the honor to be a member, the superintendence of the Commissary and Quarter-master's 
department, this, together with our finances, which we 
have long been cobbling at, hath obliged me to con 
sider, in a more complete view, the state of our affairs, than my former detached attention would permit, or, indeed, than my natural indolence would have 
led to, unsolicited by necessity. While I write to 
you, you must read and interpret with the eye and 
the mind of friendship, and suppose a greater modesty of disposition than the language may indicate. 
For, though I by no means believe myself equal to 
the smallest of the objects thrown upon me, yet, in 
speaking of them, I must give a loose to my imagi 
nation and my pen; nor can I find either leisure or 
inclination to attend to style. 
</p><p>
First, then, it is a position clear, that we must 
act according to our powers, and not our inclinations. It is, I am afraid, as clear, that your army 
will want subsistence, if kept together. Neither the 
Quarter-master nor Commissary departments can, in 
the mercantile phrase, do the needful while you 
are where you are. I take it, the number of the 
enemy, and the season, are against active operations 
on their part. Their situation, the season, our natural 
and political circumstances, are equally against them 
on our part. To ravage the country, and to cover it 
from being ravaged, are then the two objects. The 
first is base, and, beyond a certain degree, impracti 
cable. The second is, to a certain degree, dangerous 
and ideal. If it is reduced to a question, for in 
stance, whether the counties of Bergen and Westchester shall be protected by our arms, or the losses 
paid for, I am ready to purchase the whole of both 
in fee, and lay them waste, by way of saving money. 
The like, I take it, will hold good with respect to 
the environs of Rhode Island. 
</p><p>
I cannot, therefore, help being of opinion, that few, 
very few, troops should remain in the eastern department; but that many of them, if many there be, 
and a part of your army, should be cantoned along 
through the towns about the middle of Connecticut 
River. The post in the Highlands cannot, indeed, be 
neglected, and perhaps, for the better support of it, 
another post may be necessary about <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a>. 
To supply them with provisions will be very difficult, 
and, whenever the frosts shall become severe, these 
posts will require much fewer men, and therefore it 
may be good policy to place those whose times are 
near expiring on that ground. The sick can, perhaps, 
be better and safer kept at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> than elsewhere; 
and then a part of your force will be there to cover 
them, mount the necessary guards, &c. At <a href='/results.php?city=newark' rel='city'>Newark</a> 
and <a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a>, advanced parties may be posted 
to cover the interior country and communication. A 
considerable body at <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a> will be necessary to 
secure the magazines, which may there be drawn to a point from all the communications, and there, most 
properly, because perfectly secure, and because naturally a good forage country. 
</p><p>
A small body of men will be necessary, for the 
sake of order, at Sussex Court-House, Easton, Coryell's, Brunswic, <a href='/results.php?city=princeton' rel='city'>Princeton</a>, &c. Amboy will, I imagine, be too dangerous, as, by landing at the Blazing 
Star, or, in very cold weather, on the meadows between that and Amboy, they might be cut off. A 
part of the army might be quartered at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>. 
Bordentown, and Burlington, and a part at Valley 
Forge. The wagons of every kind, and horses, should 
be sent away from those not exposed. The advanced 
posts will require a few good horses, but they should 
have very little baggage, and only light, very light, 
artillery. A few good cavalry also may be requisite 
for the videttes. 
</p><p>
I cannot conceive that any clanger can arise from 
such dispersion of the army, and I am confident they 
can in that way be much better fed. My principal 
view is, I confess, this, that almost all the horses of 
the army may travel southward, perhaps as far as 
beyond the Potomac in the two counties of Frederic, 
and in <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> and Barclay counties, there to be 
boarded with the farmers, by which means they will 
be fit for use as early as the season will permit. 
The cavalry might be quartered in little villages, and. 
if the officers are good, the men as well as horses 
might improve. This peace and ease would help recruiting ; but I have said too much already. 
</p><p>
However, as I have disposed of your army, pray 
let me now dispose of their General. I think <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> would be a very proper place for him. In 
short, Sir, you must contrive to spend some time 
near Congress, and I am confident you will do more 
good by establishing a good understanding between 
them and the army, forwarding its business, and the 
like, than can be conceived. To all this I add, that, 
if the General, the Quarter-master, and the Commissary-General are on this spot, all the arrangements for 
the next campaign will be properly made. One thing 
more, and I have done. It is, that I wish most earnestly to see you. Adieu. I am, yours, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>, 12 November, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I have been here near three weeks, without being 
able, as yet, to get a final determination on any part 
of the business I came to transact. On my arrival, 
I discovered that the whole legislative body were 
highly pleased, with a thorough persuasion, that the 
war was at an end, that the British troops were em 
barking, and that there was not the most distant 
probability they would again return to the Continent. 
</p><p>
On Governor Henry's laying your Excellency's letter before the House, I was happy to find it effectually roused them from, their lethargy. They immediately appointed Mr. Mason, Mr. Page, Mr. Nelson, 
and Mr. Parker a Committee, to confer with me on 
the state of the troops belonging to the Virginia line. 
I informed the Committee of the reduction that had 
taken place in the Virginia regiments, owing to the 
great deficiency in the quota assigned to the State; 
that this measure had disgusted a number of the 
officers, who, I was confident, would leave the service 
at the close of the campaign; that it would take two 
thousand seven hundred and thirty-one, rank and file, 
to complete the regiments on the present establishment, making a deduction for eight hundred drafts, 
whose time of service expires in February next ; 
that, by some default in the execution of the act of 
Assembly, one half of the drafts had never joined 
the army, but still remain in their respective counties; recommending proper exertions for apprehending 
them, and obliging them to serve for the time they 
have been absent, agreeably to law; that desertion 
prevails, particularly among the troops raised on the 
frontiers, owing, in my opinion, to that pernicious 
measure of sending a body of men for the protection 
of the settlement on Kentucky, which does not consist of more than sixty men, most of whom are land 
robbers and runaways from the different States, which 
has formed a harbour for deserters, and every other 
species of villains. Besides, the idea was ridiculous 
to think of extending our territory, when we ought_ 
to be making use of every exertion to secure what 
we already occupy. 
</p><p>
That a number of enlistments have expired this 
fall, many of whom might have been reenlisted, had 
your Excellency been made acquainted with the additional bounty allowed by the Assembly, and been 
furnished with the necessary sum to have answered 
that purpose ; that reserving a sufficient tract of 
country for the army, will have a good effect; but 
that opening a Land-Office, at this time, will be a 
means of many officers resigning, will make the men, 
acquainted with the back country, uneasy under their 
confinement, and would, in my opinion, effectually 
prevent the reenlisting any of those whose times of 
service are near expiring; that the most effectual 
mode for raising a sufficient number of men to fill 
up the regiments, will be to hold out a generous 
bounty, to proportion the number of men to be furnished by each county, according to the number of 
their militia, and limit a time by which they shall 
be raised ; in failure of which, an indiscriminate 
draft to take place. By this means it will induce 
every individual, from motives of interest, to contribute towards increasing the bounty, and in effect to 
become recruiting officers ; that offering large rewards 
for apprehending deserters, and to oblige them to 
serve at least double the time of their absence, will 
be attended with good consequences. In all those 
propositions the Committee unanimously concurred, 
and reported them to the House, which were agreed 
to by a great majority of the House, and bills ordered to be brought in agreeably to the resolutions. 
</p><p>
I have preferred the officers memorial respecting 
the lands which they have been promised by Government. It is still depending before a Committee ; 
but I have the pleasure to inform your Excellency, 
that I have the greatest reason to believe they will 
be unanimous in increasing the proportion of both 
officers and men, and that they will reserve a very 
large and valuable part of the back country for their 
use ; indeed, I am happy to find they discover a real 
inclination to make the situation of their troops, in 
every respect, as agreeable as possible. 
</p><p>
A great part of the present session has been taken 
up in considering the grants made by the Cherokees 
to Henderson and Company, which they have at last 
declared totally void. Disagreeable as my present 
situation is, I shall continue here till the bill for 
recruiting the regiments passes, and other matters 
respecting the army are considered; which I am 
afraid will not be long before Christmas, if I am to 
judge from their manner of doing business. What 
makes my stay so very disagreeable is, that my wife 
is in a declining and very dangerous situation, and 
that I had not time to stay more than two days 
with her, on my way from camp. If she should not 
be recovered on my return, I must beg your Excellency's indulgence to stay some short time with her, 
if my absence can be dispensed with. 
</p><p>
I have discovered the most shameful neglects, in 
the Executive Department in this State, respecting 
the clothing and other necessaries furnished by the 
Assembly for the Virginia troops. It appears that 
clothing, liquors, and other necessaries, to the amount 
of near two hundred thousand pounds sterling, have 
been sent on, addressed to a Mr. Hollingsworth, a Deputy Quartermaster-General at the head of Elk, who, 
from every information I can obtain, has sent a great 
proportion of them to the Clothier-General and Continental Stores, instead of forwarding them to the 
Virginia agent, for the use of their troops. I have 
represented this matter to the Assembly, who have 
directed a strict inquiry to be made, which, I hope, 
will be a means of our being better supplied in future. 
</p><p>
I shall be exceedingly happy if my poor endeavours meet with your Excellency's approbation. I 
have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, 
Your Excellency's very obedient servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, 18 December, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>. 
</p><p>
MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Your much esteemed favor of the 5th of October 
was put into my hands a few clays ago by General Lincoln. I sincerely thank you for your recollection 
of me, and for introducing to my acquaintance a 
gentleman of his character and merit. lie is much 
caressed ; and you may be assured that I shall pay 
him, and every other person whom I shall know you 
to regard, all the attention in my power. 
</p><p>
I wish I could prevail on myself to pass over that 
part of your letter, in which you remind me of one long since written by you and unanswered, for I 
really blush when I even think of it; but I cannot 
be silent on the subject, or permit you to entertain 
the most distant idea, that a conduct, which was 
really founded in affection, could have proceeded from a different motive. Believe me, my dear General, the 
true reason of my silence was the uniform declaration of every person who came from your camp, that 
every moment of your time was occupied by important business ; and, though I wished for the continuance of a correspondence which afforded me the highest satisfaction, yet I could not permit myself to add a single feather to the weight which already pressed 
upon you. Affairs, however, now wear an appearance very different from what they did, and I will 
resume, with much pleasure, a correspondence which 
was laid aside with the greatest regret. 
</p><p>
You tell me that matters are much changed in the 
army and politics, since we last parted. God knows 
they are so, and in more senses than one. In many, 
they afford me very sensible concern ; and, if I am 
not much mistaken in my conjectures, the worst is 
yet to come. For, if report, and loud report too, is 
to be credited, that spirit of cabal and destructive 
ambition, which has elevated the factious demagogue 
in every republic of antiquity, is making great head 
in the centre of these States ; and, if not soon extinguished, will do more essential injury to the cause 
of America than the swords of Sir Harry and his 
whole army. I have given my opinion to several 
members of Congress, with great freedom, on this 
subject; and, if the situation of my private concerns 
would admit of it with the least degree of convenience, I would give it them in person. But they are 
much opposed to such a step; and however pleasing 
it might be to me, to give my sentiments of men 
and measures, I must, at present, forego the gratification. 
</p><p>
General Lincoln, it seems, is directed by Congress 
to undertake an expedition against St. Augustine ; 
but I believe it will hardly be attempted tin's winter. The season is now far advanced, and but few 
things in readiness. We have not eighteen hundred 
Continentals in this State ; and your experience,, as 
well as the untimely fate of poor Montgomery, has 
sufficiently taught us how unavailing it is to attempt a siege with an impatient militia. Should he think 
himself obliged to it, I shall wish him success ; but 
if you do not hear that he has planted the Ameri 
can standard on the ramparts of the Castle, you must 
not be disappointed. The reduction of the place is 
certainly of importance to the more Southern States, 
as it affords assistance to the Indians, and a place 
of refuge to banditti, called the Florida Scout, who 
are committing continual depreciations on the fron 
tiers ; and, as they live by plunder, it is not to be 
supposed that they will cease their incursions till 
Augustine is our own. But to have made it so, Congress should have concerted measures earlier and better than they have ; for, attributing to them the best 
intentions, I do not think they will avail. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Middleton and Mrs. Rutledge desire me to 
present their best respects to you ; and I beg that 
you will believe me, my dear General, to be at all 
times and on all occasions, amongst the most sincere 
and affectionate of your friends.

<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, 5 January, <a href='/results.php?year=1779'>1779</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
In my difficult situation, at such a distance from 
you, I am obliged to take a determination by my 
self, which I hope will meet with your approbation. 
You remember that, in making full allowance for 
deliberations, the answer from Congress was to reach 
me before the 15th of last month, and I have long 
since waited without even hearing from them. Nay, 
many gentlemen from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> assure me Congress believe that I am gone long ago. Though my 
affairs call me home, private interests would, how 
ever, induce me to wait for your Excellency's letters, 
for the decision of Congress about an exchange, in 
case I should be taken, and for the last determinations concerning the plans of the next campaign. 
</p><p>
But I think the importance of the despatches I 
am the bearer of; the uncertainty and improbability 
of receiving any others here (my giving intelligence 
at Versailles may be for the advantage of both nations) ; the inconvenience of detaining the fine frigate, on board of which I return; and the danger of 
losing all the men, who desert very fast, are reasons 
so important as oblige me not to delay any longer. 
I am the more of that opinion, from Congress having 
resolved to send, about this time, three fast-sailing 
vessels to Franco, and the Marine Committee having 
promised me to give the despatches to such officers 
as I would recommend. It is a very good way of 
forwarding their letters,, and sending such as your Excellency may be pleased to write me. I beg you 
will send copies of them by the several vessels. 
</p><p>
To hear from you, my most respected friend, will 
be the greatest happiness I can feel. The longer the 
letters you write, the more blessed with satisfaction 
I shall think myself. .1 hope you will not refuse me 
that pleasure as often as you can. I hope you will 
ever preserve that affection, which I return by the 
to nd. crest sentiments. 
</p><p>
How happy, my dear General, I should be to conie 
next spring, principally, as it might yet be proposed, 
I need not to say. Your first letter will let me 
know what I am to depend upon, on that head ; and. 
I flatter myself, the first from me will confirm to 
you that I am at liberty, and that most certainly I 
intend to come next campaign. 
</p><p>
My health is now in the best condition, and I 
would not remember I ever was sick, were it not for 
the marks of friendship you gave me on that occa 
sion. My good doctor has attended me with his 
usual care and tenderness. He will see me on board, 
and then return to head-quarters; but the charge of 
your friend was intrusted to him till I was on board 
the frigate. I have met with the most kind hospitality in this city; and, drinking water excepted, the 
doctor has done every thing he could to live happy. 
He dances and sings at the assemblies most charmingly. 
</p><p>
The gentlemen who, I hope, will go to France, 
have orders to go to head-quarters ; and I flatter my 
self, my dear General, that you will write me by 
them. I beg you will let the "bearer of this, Captain Lacolombe, know that I recommend him to your Excellency for the commission of Major. 
</p><p>
Be so kind, my dear General, as to present my 
best respects to your lady, and the gentlemen of your family. I hope you will quietly enjoy the pleasure 
of being with Mrs. <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>, without any disturbance from the enemy, till I join you again ; I also 
hope you will approve of my sailing, which, indeed, 
was urged by necessity, after waiting so long. 
</p><p>
Farewell, my most beloved General ; it is not with 
out emotion I bid you this last adieu, before so long a separation. Don t forget an absent friend, and believe me, forever and ever, with the highest respect 
and tenderest affection. 
</p><p>
On board the Alliance, 10 January. <a href='/results.php?year=1779'>1779</a>. 
</p><p>
I open again my letter, my dear General, to let 
you know that I am not yet gone ; but, if the wind 
proves fair, I shall sail to-morrow. Nothing from 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> ; nothing from head-quarters. So that 
everybody, as well as myself, is of opinion that I 
shall be WTong to wait any longer. I hope I am

dear and forever beloved friend, adieu.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Although I had not in my power to pay you my 
respects as often as I did wish, the notice you were pleased to take of me, when I came into the country, will, I hope, apologize for the liberty I take of 
asking the honor of your commands for Franco and 
Italy, which I am certain to receive, if lodged with 
the Governor or Mr. Blair, in Williamsburff. 
</p><p>
I am going to Europe with the most sanguine expectations of success in my endeavours to promote 
whatever may be of present and future advantage to 
this Continent. Mr. Harvie and another gentleman 
told me, some time ago, that you had inquired what 
success I have had, and what prospect I have, relative to the new branches of agriculture which I have 
attempted to introduce in our country. Experience 
has convinced me that this country is better calculated than any other I am acquainted with for the 
produce of wine ; but I cannot say the same in regard to oil and lemons. It is true that we cannot 
call what I have had as yet a fair trial, the seasons 
having been, by all accounts, much worse than any 
man remembers. And it is not improbable that the 
same seasons would not have been so detrimental to 
the plants, if they had previously acquired age and 
vigor. One spring as bad as those we have had 
ever since I came, except the last, would, in Italy 
and the south of France, have destroyed all the young 
vines and many of the old. Here many of my vines, 
planted under several disadvantages, have not only 
survived repeated severe spring frosts, but they are 
now more vigorous and luxuriant than vines of the 
same age would be in those countries, and have 
sooner produced grapes in respectable quantity and 
as good. 
</p><p>
Should I be so happy as to succeed in my endeavours abroad, I hope soon to return with the means 
of prosecuting my undertaking with vigor; in which 
case my veneration for your personal merit, and the 
natural desire of seeing the Deliverer of our country, 
must excuse me for assuming to go and give you, in 
person, an account of what I shall have done to that 
place of rural felicity, where I wish you may long 
enjoy the fruits of your heroism. With profound respect I have the honor to be, Sir, your Excellency's 
Most humble and most obedient servant,

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Hearing that you leave this place to-morrow, I beg 
you to accept a short reason why I have not waited 
on you. 
</p><p>
I have been out nowhere for near these two months. 
The part I have taken in an affair, that is yet depending, rendered it most prudent in me to absent 
myself from company, lest I should be asked questions improper to be answered, or subject myself to 
conversation that might have been unpleasant. That there has been foul play somewhere, is clear to every 
one and where it lies, will, I believe, soon come 
out. 
</p><p>
Having thus explained myself, I have to add my 
sincerest wishes for your happiness in every line of 
life, and to assure you that, as far as my abilities 
extend, I shall never suffer a hint of dishonor or 
even a deficiency of respect to you to pass unnoticed. 
I have always acted that part, and am confident that 
your virtues and conduct will ever require it from 
me as a duty, as well as render it a pleasure. 
</p><p>
I never heard either Colonel R. or Colonel T. Lee 
express a sentiment in your disfavor. I can answer 
for nothing farther. I likewise take the liberty of mentioning to you that, at the time some discontents 
from the army and the country last winter wore doing you great injustice, I published the fifth number 
of the CRISIS, in which I hoped, by bringing your former services in view, to shame them out, or at 
least to convince them of their error. I was then at 
<a href='/results.php?city=lancaster' rel='city'>Lancaster</a>, and on my return to <a href='/results.php?city=yorktown' rel='city'>Yorktown</a> I saw the 
Foreign Committee, of which Colonel E. II. Lee was 
chairman, had sent off despatches to France. The 
copy was in his handwriting, and in these despatches 
he inclosed that pamphlet, and spoke of it as "the 
general sentiments of America on what the enemy 
had so boastingly called their successes." 
</p><p>
I am very desirous of bidding you farewell, and 
intend making you a short visit to-day for that purpose, notwithstanding the reasons I have before mentioned. I am, with every wish for your happiness, 
Your obedient, humble servant,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
It is with singular pleasure I congratulate your Excellency on the short relaxation from the utmost 
exertions in the field, where you have rendered your country most essential services, and gained lasting 
honor to yourself. I have not ventured to trouble 
you with letters, truly sensible how many and great 
were the important matters that must necessarily engage your unceasing attention ; but your safety, ho 
nor, and happiness, were ever very near to inc.

I well know the generous goodness of your heart 
in the case of every brave officer, or common sentinel, and that nothing on your part will be wanting 
to alleviate their sufferings ; but the bearer, Major Drake, my neighbour, and of whose integrity I 
have long been convinced, being now on his way to 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, I cannot withhold my particular recommendation of him to your Excellency's notice, and 
hope that Congress will cooperate with you in all 
possible means for the ease and advantage of him, 
and every other officer of distinguished merit. 
</p><p>
It is with much concern I find the resolve of 
Congress, respecting the money emissions of May 
20th, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>, and April 11th, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>, giving great and 
general alarm, tending to depreciate the currency, as 
the holders of these emissions are really deprived of 
the use of their money for six months, as it in a 
great measure ceases to pass here in payments; and, 
what is an additional misfortune, our Assembly have 
laid on an enormous assessment, in payment of which 
not one shilling of this money can be applied, as 
the sheriffs cannot make any part of their collections 
by the 1st of June. Assuredly Congress have not 
taken the whole matter into the account, as I am 
informed that large sums of this money are now in 
the possession of the subjects of Spain upon the Mississippi, they being enjoined by the Governor of Or 
leans to receive it, not to mention many other obvious objections ; so that I am sensible it will be consistent with the wonted justice and prudence of that 
august body, without loss of time, to revise and 
greatly change the terms of that resolve. 
</p><p>
It is now with me conclusive, that nothing will 
VOL. n. 22 
answer our purpose but adopting a former recommendation of Congress in the several States (though 
I then thought it impolitic), that of fixing some 
bounds to our produce, manufactures, &c. ; at the 
same time that I should be for allowing very liberal 
pris, even five or six times as -much as formerly 
(if the demand obliged the purchaser to bid so high), 
and to encourage manufactures in the highest degree; 
but not to suffer the mechanic, the extortioner, those 
in the character of tavern-keepers, and a few others, 
to swallow up the States. Foreign trade will, of 
course, be regulated by the demand for European 
articles ; if they are very high, w T e shall purchase the 
fewer of them. 
</p><p>
Indian affairs do not strike me in an agreeable 
point of view ; for certainly we can expect no real 
friendship from that troublesome and formidable people, till we supply them upon equal terms, at least, 
with our enemies, and convince them, in every other 
respect, of our justice, equality, and moderation to 
wards them. 
</p><p>
I cannot enlarge upon many other matters, having 
already given your Excellency too much trouble ; and 
I shall only add my ardent wishes, that you may 
continue to be the peculiar care of a superintending 
<a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> ; that your life may be prolonged for the 
temporal saving of the United States, and to enjoy, 
with the most perfect felicity, your family, friends, 
and fortunes amidst the grateful acclamations of a 
great and generous people. I am joined by my 
brother and our families. Pray make my compliments agreeable to your good lady. I am, with 
great affection,

FROM THOMAS CRITTENDEN, GOVERNOR OF VERMONT. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=bennington' rel='city'>Bennington</a>, 6 March, <a href='/results.php?year=1779'>1779</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I am directed, by my Council and the General 
Assemby of this State, to recommend to your Excellency the present unhappy situation of the inhabit 
ants of the northern frontiers of this State, and to 
pray your Excellency's interposition for their future 
relief. 
</p><p>
The contiguous situation of those inhabitants to the 
enemy, has rendered their safety peculiarly uncertain, 
from the first commencement of the present war. 
The many alarms, occasioned by the approaches of 
the enemy, have kept its inhabitants in such a fluc 
tuating condition, as has rendered it impracticable for 
them to have secured any considerable supplies of 
provisions for the subsistence of their families before 
hand. The encroachments of the army, under the 
command of Lieutenant-General Burgoyne, into this 
State, in the year <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>, their daring attempt to destroy this town, and the public stores then deposited 
here, commanded the attention, as well as the most 
vigorous exertions of those inhabitants ; and, although there were at that time very plentiful crops of grain, 
corn, hay, &c., on the ground, yet the enemy prevented the inhabitants from securing any considerable part of it. 
</p><p>
By their continuing in service, for the purpose 
of reducing General Burgoyne to a submission, the 
season of the year was so far advanced, as to put 
it out of the power of those inhabitants to make the 
necessary preparations for a crop of winter grain, on 
which they have had their greatest dependence, since 
the first settlement of this part of the country. 
</p><p>
They are, therefore, the principal part of them, reduced to an Indian cake, in scant proportion to the 
number of their families ; and by the destruction of 
their sheep by the enemy, and their loss of them 
otherwise, as well as of their flax, their bellies and 
backs are become co-sufferers. 
</p><p>
In this deplorable situation, may it please your Excellency, they remain firm and unshaken, and being generally well armed and accoutred, are ready, on 
any sudden emergency, and on the shortest notice, 
to face and encounter their inveterate foe undaunted ; but, on viewing their present circumstances, it 
may be your Excellency may be prevailed on to 
make such provision for the security of those frontiers (which are no less so to three other States), as 
to prevent the fatal necessity of continuing those in 
habitants in constant service the ensuing summer. 
</p><p>
With this will be communicated a copy of Briga 
dier-General Clinton's letter, of the 25th ultimo, by 
which your Excellency will perceive his readiness to 
grant every relief in his power. 
</p><p>
In consequence of his advice, I have ordered the 
continuance of the company of militia therein named, 
and an addition of fifty men, exclusive of officers, to 
join them immediately. 
</p><p>
If, after all that has been exhibited on this subject, it should be found inconsistent to adopt any 
other measures in the case, I desire an order may be 
granted for the subsistence and pay of the officers 
and soldiers, that may be found necessary to be raised from time to time, within this State, for the purpose aforesaid. 
</p><p>
The bearer hereof, Joseph Fay, Esq., in whose at 
tachment to the common cause your Excellency may 
repose the greatest confidence, will be able to give 
any further intelligence in the premises, and particularly wait any advice or directions your Excellency 
may please to communicate. I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,

THOMAS CRITTENDEN.

</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 26 April, <a href='/results.php?year=1779'>1779</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
You must permit me most heartily to congratulate 
you upon the very important intelligence which Monsieur Gerard will confidentially communicate to you. 
It is, and ought to be, a secret even from Congress, 
for which I need give you no reasons, as you are 
but too well acquainted with them. Measures have 
already been taken for obtaining the necessary sup 
plies, which the Minister will detail to you. These 
you will undoubtedly assist, as far as may fall within 
your line. 
</p><p>
When the enemy went to the Southern States, I 
considered it as a kind of madness, and I think they 
will feel the consequences ; but certainly it cannot be 
worth while to lose a moment unnecessarily in that 
quarter, for the climate will fight for us during the 
summer, and what shall remain may be completed in 
the autumn, if the other objects succeed. The first 
then should be, to bring on a considerable quantity 
of rice, which, together with flour from the Middle 
States, must be transmitted eastward, for the ulterior 
operations. To accomplish <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, perhaps the 
western detachments may be useful, as a feint; but 
24* 
will it not be still more effectual to risk almost a re 
treat, in case of attack, by detaching to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, as 
if in prosecution of an expedition to Canada, calling 
upon Connecticut, <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and New Jersey, for a 
body of militia, to answer the immediate purpose of 
protecting the country, and the remote purpose of 
more consequence ? This would probably lull the 
enemy into security, and false intelligence might be 
superadded to deceive them. In a few days the 
force, nevertheless, would be collected from Fort Ed 
ward and the Mohawk River to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, brought down to the Highlands by water, and cooperate, &c. 
A part, with the militia of Connecticut and <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, 
might alarm the enemy at Fort Knyphausen, and 
make the necessary preparations to throw a bridge 
over the river at Haerlem. The main body, by possessing themselves of the landing opposite to <a href='/results.php?city=greenwich' rel='city'>Greenwich</a>, 
might, at a proper opportunity, be thrown across. 
The Jersey militia would keep Staten Island in alarm, 
and secure the posts in the rear. The other troops 
might be landed to attack, as the enemy lauded to 
attack you. This, with a fire upon the town, would, 
in all human probability, effect the purpose. 
</p><p>
That point gained, Rhode Island would be an easy 
acquisition, as the whole force might then be turned 
to that object, and then the great end would follow 
in its course. The magnitude and importance of 
things like these speak for themselves. The practicability will, I think, be made evident, when the 
means are considered. You will see the necessity of 
opening yourself fully to M. Gerard upon your designs, and taking, with him, all proper measures. Catr 
tie, carriages for heavy artillery, and the like, should 
be assembled at Portsmouth, or some such convenient 
place. You will have the advantage, on this occasion 
at least, to be sure of your secrets ; and, indeed, such 
steps may be taken, that, in the ignorance of the 
enemy as to the state and probable state of things 
in the West Indies, it will be impossible for them to 
develop the combination of incidents, so distinct as 
those which may be necessary at once to fulfil the 
objects in view, and blind them. 
</p><p>
Excuse the length and tediousness of this letter, 
and believe me, with all the sincerity of private friend 
ship, superadded to public esteem, affectionately, 
Your friend and humble servant, 
</p><p>
GOVERNOR MORRIS.

FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL MCINTOSH. 
</p><p>
Camp [<a href='/results.php?city=pittsburgh' rel='city'>Pittsburg</a>], 27 April, <a href='/results.php?year=1779'>1779</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
In obedience to your Excellency's desire, I am to 
inform you of the situation of the several posts west 
of the mountains, and will add the reasons for estaishing them, which may enable you to judge the 
better of their propriety. 
</p><p>
When I went there first, I found <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a>, in the 
fork of Ohio, Fort Randolph, at the point or mouth 
of Great KenhaAva, three hundred miles down the 
river Ohio, and Fort Hand on Kiskiminitas. fixed 
stations, and garrisoned by Continental troops; and 
they are still kept up, as there is an independent 
company, raised upon the application of Colonel G. 
Morgan, for the sole purpose of maintaining each, 
and would not weaken the force I had to carry on 
the expedition. Besides these, there were thirty or 
forty other little stations, or forts, at different times garrisoned by militia, between Wheeling and <a href='/results.php?city=pittsburgh' rel='city'>Pittsburg</a>, upon the waters of the Monongahela, the Kiskiminitas, and in the interior parts of the settlements, 
which were frequently altered, kept, or evacuated, 
according to the humors, fears, or interest of the 
people of most influence, which General Hand was 
obliged to comply with, as his chief dependence was 
upon militia. Those I endeavoured to break up, as 
soon as I could, without giving too much offence to 
people whose assistance I so much required, as they 
were very expensive, and of little service ; and, for 
that end, authorized the Lieutenants of Monongahela 
and Ohio county, to raise a ranging company, jointly, 
of one Captain, one Lieutenant, one Ensign, three Sergeants, three Corporals, and fifty-four privates, to 
scout continually along the River Ohio, from Beaver 
Creek downwards, where the Indians usually cross to 
annoy these two counties, and would secure them 
equally alike ; and the Lieutenant of Westmoreland 
county to raise two such companies to scour their 
frontiers, and protect them from scalping parties of 
the Mingoes or Northern Indians, which would render their little forts useless, and keep our regulars 
entire for other occasions. 
</p><p>
I found also, upon inquiry, a number of stores, or 
magazines of provisions, built at public expense by 
our Purchasing Commissary, at great distances, difficult 
of access, and scattered throughout all the counties, 
which required a number of men at each, for commissaries, coopers, packers, guards, &c. These I also discharged gave the stores up ; as, by the report of a 
Court of Inquiry, all the provision in them, which 
was intended for our expedition, proved to be spoiled, 
and altogether useless, through neglect; and, in place 
of them, I had one general storehouse built, by a fatigue party, in the fork of the Monongahela River, 
where all loads from over the mountains are now discharged, without crossing any considerable branch of 
any river, and can be carried from thence, at any 
season, either by land or water, to Big Beaver Creek; 
to which place I opened a road, and built a strong 
post, with barracks and stores, by fatigue of the 
whole line, upon the Indian shore of the Ohio River, 
for the reception of all our stores, clear of all ferries 
and incumbrances, while our troops and supplies were 
coming up ; and, in case I was disappointed in both, 
as I had many reasons to apprehend, it would secure a footing so far advanced into the enemy's country, 
be better prepared for another attempt, and show 
them we were in earnest. 
</p><p>
So late as the 3d of November, Mr. Lockhart appeared at Beaver, with the cattle, extremely poor 
after driving them four or five hundred miles, and 
meeting with many obstacles, and could not slaughter 
them for want of salt. The same day I received a 
message from the savages, reproaching our tardiness, 
and threatening all their nations would join to op 
pose my progress to Detroit, at Sugar Creek, a few 
miles below Tuscarawas, where they intend giving 
me battle. Immediately upon this intelligence, I ordered twelve hundred men to be ready to march, 
though we had only four weeks flour, which Mr. 
Lockhart fortunately brought with him, and left Lieu 
tenant-Colonel Campbell, with the rest of the troops, 
at Beaver, to escort and send after me the long looked for supplies, so often and repeatedly promised 
by our Deputy Quartermaster-General, Mr. Steel, when 
they arrived, and, in the mean time, to finish the 
fort and stores. 
</p><p>
We were fourteen days upon our march, about 
seventy miles, to Tuscarawas, as our horses and cattle 
tired every four or five miles from our first setting 
out, and were met there only by some Cochocking 
Delawares and Moravians, who informed me the Chippewas and Ottowas refused to join the other Indians, 
upon which their hearts failed them, and none came 
to oppose our march. But, unfortunately, a letter, by 
express, from Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell, a little 
afterwards, informed me that no supplies came yet, 
and we had very little to expect during the winter, 
nor could he get the staff to account, or give any 
reasons for their neglect and deficiencies, which disappointed all my flattering prospects and schemes, 
and left me no other alternative than either to march 
back as I came, without effecting any valuable purpose, which the world would justly reflect upon me 
for, after so much expense, confirm the savages in 
the opinion the enemy inculcates of our weakness, 
and unite all of them, to a man, against us ; or, to 
build a strong stockade fort upon the Muskingum, 
and leave as many men as our provision would allow, 
to secure it until the next season, and to serve as a 
bridle upon the savages in the heart of their own 
country ; which last I chose, with the unanimous approbation of my principal officers, and we were employed upon it while our provision lasted ; and, in the 
mean time, thought it necessary to make some proposals to all the Indians, if they came in a certain fixed 
time, to offer terms, and prevent our being molested. 
I am the more particular in giving my reasons for 
building Fort Laurens, as Morgan. Steel, and their 
dependents, for want of other matter, have cried it 
down, as a designed slaughtering-pen, impossible to 
maintain ; and endeavoured to prejudice the whole 
country against it, although the former laid the plan, 
that was afterwards adopted, for taking and keeping 
Detroit. 
</p><p>
I always was, and still am, firmly of the opinion, 
that the only way to subdue Indians effectually, is, 
to carry a chain of forts directly into their country, 
so near as to support each other, the last always 
having the most force, and keep possession as we go; 
and to make excursions at pleasure into their towns, 
when in force, and opportunity offers, or retreat to 
them when weak, ill-supplied, or in other cases of necessity, which will often happen in Indian wars, 
and they know well how to take advantage of. 
</p><p>
By the best information I can get, there is no navigation above the Wabash (which is eight or nine hundred miles below <a href='/results.php?city=pittsburgh' rel='city'>Pittsburg</a>) to Lake Erie, equal 
to Muskingum, the way of Cuyahoga, or, the Alleghany, the way of Presrjue Isle ; and both of these 
are very uncertain, to go up against the stream, as 
the waters are often too high and rapid, and oftener 
too low. Yet they may be serviceable at times. The 
Scioto and Hockhocking are mere rapid creeks, of no 
account, and are not much better than Beaver, al 
though traders have frequently brought their loaded 
canoes down each, in time of high freshets. 
</p><p>
For any further particulars, respecting the western 
department, I will attend in person, and beg leave to 
refer you to my general orders, and private instructions and letters. I have the honor to be, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
LACHLAN MCINTOSH. 
</p><p>
P. S. If your Excellency is already determined 
to attack the Seneca nation from the westward as 
well as from the Susquehanna, at the same time, I 
would give it as my humble opinion, that the two garrisons on the Indian side of the Ohio should be 
maintained, and go no farther that way at present ; 
and to erect posts, at proper distances, up along the 
River Alleghany, as far as, or farther than Kushkushing, which may be done by fatigue, when the 
party is going up, if the river is then too low, or, 
if it is in good order for the boats, after they strike 
the blow intended, in concert with the other army. 
And I should apprehend the same would be necessary up the Susquehanna, as far as Tioga, which, I 
think, must undoubtedly remove the northern as well 
as the western tribes over the great Lakes, or bring 
them to terms, as they cannot otherwise think of 
planting so near our garrisons ; and show them we 
mean to retaliate their injuries by keeping possession 
of their country.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
As my business with the Legislature of New Jersey will require my being at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a> on Wednesday 
next, a visit to camp this week, which I intended, 
would be inconvenient, as it would keep me constantly on the roads, with horses not in the best 
order. My being at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a> last week, I believe, 
was favorable to the affairs of the Jersey brigade. 
The officers, under orders of march, sent up a very 
spirited memorial to the Legislature, and strongly 
pointed out the mischiefs which would immediately 
follow, if an equitable provision was not instantly 
made for the officers and men of the brigade. How 
ever true and just, the legislature could not brook 
the thought of being frightened into the measure ; 
and some of the obstinate members talked of rather 
seeing the brigade disbanded, than submit to the 
appearance of being bullied. As I saw that the appearance was now the chief obstacle in the way, I 
proposed to some of the leading members the expedient of withdrawing the memorial, and the Legislature taking the matter up (to all appearance) of their 
own mere motion. This was instantly agreed to on 
all sides, and in a few hours pretty ample resolves 
were made by both Houses. Among the rest it was 
ordered that two hundred pounds be paid to each 
commissioned officer, and forty dollars to each soldier, 
to enable them to pay their debts, and to fit them 
for the campaign. The money for this purpose is 
already gone to <a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a>. 
</p><p>
I am sorry to find that the Legislature is slow 
in all business, particularly in determining on the 
means of recruiting their brigades, in which, as yet, 
they have made but little progress ; but they promise to give it their serious attention this week. 
My business seems to have a favorable reception 
among them; but it must be followed up closely, or 
it may halt by the way. 
</p><p>
Lady Stirling, and, all the gentlemen and ladies of 
these two families, join in their most respectful compliments to your Excellency and Mrs. <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>, with

</p><p>
SlR ; 
</p><p>
The enemy having, as I have informed your Excellency, landed at Teller's Point, on the olst ultimo, 
the troops under my command took a position in the 
Highlands, with their van at the Village. The principal stores being removed from thence, and the enemy having my flanks open on the North River, on 
which he could move undiscovered at night, I judged 
it expedient to retire to this place, to keep open my 
communication with <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, as well as to secure 
the pass in my rear to <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a>. General Parsons 
joined me the 2nd instant. I have now here the three Continental "brigades, and a good body of militia. 
</p><p>
The State has made a very great exertion to 
remove the stores and collect provision. We have 
double the quantity of provision secured which you mentioned necessary in your letter of the 2d, for a 
certain purpose. Yesterday I informed you of the 
enemy's advancing near the Continental Village. He 
retired in the afternoon toward <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>. His con 
duct is exceedingly inexplicable ; and it is extremely 
difficult to determine what is his object. He has now 
been seven days on the river, and has not made the 
despatch which he might, toward <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, if that 
is his object. One thing, however, is very clear, that 
he can pillage the country, by drawing our attention 
to the fort, without any risk, and can always em 
bark. Perhaps these movements may be designed to 
divert us from our western expeditions. 
</p><p>
General Patterson not having returned from furlough ; I appointed General Parsons to command at 
<a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, as he is well acquainted with the post. 
</p><p>
Yesterday Lieutenant-Colonel Sherman, with three companies of light infantry, marched downwards to 
reconnoitre, and skirmish with the enemy. He proceeded to Fort Independence, at the mouth of <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> Creek, but saw nothing of the enemy, although 
his small parties went near <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> ; only heard the 
noise of cattle, driving towards King's Ferry. This 
morning he discovered all their shipping (except two galleys) in <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> Bay, standing downward, and a 
few boats off Fort Independence. 
</p><p>
Sir Henry Clinton commanded in person the body 
which I told you were advancing yesterday. He was 
exceedingly cautious in his advance, and very particular in his inquiries. He asked where I was; whether 
I had destroyed the bridge* over <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> Creek; 
what force I had; whether the militia were alarmed; 
the situation of the country toward <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a>, if strong; 
whether there was a great body of men at West 
Point ; and whether your Excellency's army was in 
motion this way. 
</p><p>
Colonel Burr, whom I sent to General St. Glair, 
returned this morning. The General told him he 
would be at <a href='/results.php?city=new windsor' rel='city'>New Windsor</a> this night. Provisions 
were sent from Newburg to Chester for his troops, 
which has removed the difficulty he apprehended. 
</p><p>
By comparing these accounts, it appears the enemy 
has given over his design against <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>. Fort 
de Lafayette, on Verplank's Point, surrendered the 
1st instant. The inclosed is a copy of a letter of 
Captain Armstrong, who commanded it ; and the terms of capitulation. 
</p><p>
It is now past two o clock, P. M., and I nave no 
account of the enemy's moving up. I have the honor to be,

On the road leading from Fort Montgomery 
towards the Furnace, 11 o clock, A. M., 5 June, <a href='/results.php?year=1779'>1779</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I have this moment seen Captain Christie, who has 
communicated his business, and I am thereby induced 
to send a gentleman, Captain Hughes, a volunteer, on 
to your Excellency with information. The enemy's 
fleet, consisting of about seventy sail, many of them 
very small, are at King's Ferry; a body of their 
troops are on the east side of the river, extending 
from the ferry upwards ; a very few on Stony Point ; 
but the greatest part of their army are on board. 
They have one hundred and fifty flat-bottomed boats 
with them, which are in <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> Cove. 
</p><p>
It is true that they have penetrated as far as the 
Village, and have burnt a few huts, &c. ; but have 
got no stores at all, nor have we sustained any loss, 
but the block-house at the ferry, with eighty men, 
&c., of which, in my opinion, nothing else could be 
expected. 
</p><p>
I command the militia of this State, on the west 
side of the river, and am posted on the cross-road, 
leading from Fort Montgomery (seven miles advanced from the garrison) to the Furnace, with parties advanced on the passes from Haverstraw, and 
scouts as far as that place. 
Your Excellency may be assured that every thing 
in my power shall be done for the defence of the garrison. If a few companies of light infantry could 
be sent me, it would be useful ; if so, they must turn 
off near Junes's, in the clove. 
</p><p>
If your Excellency should want any further intelligence, I shall be happy to furnish it, and render 
every service in my power. General McDougall, 
with Huntington's and Parsons's brigades, is nine miles below <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a> ; Nixon's, opposite the fort. 
The Governor is in the field, with the militia on 
the east side of the river, also with General Mc 
Dougall. General Parsons took command of Fort 
Clinton, on the 3d instant, in the evening. The garrison consists of Learned's, Patterson's, and the 
Carolina brigade, about seventeen hundred strong ; 
the militia with me, as yet, about six hundred. 
</p><p>
If the fort is invested, it will fall. I am clear that the enemy must be opposed in the passes and 
in the woods. I therefore have posted myself here ; 
but without more light troops, not a great deal can 
be expected. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
WILLIAM MALCOM. 
</p><p>
P. S. I am now of opinion that the enemy will 
give up their design against the fort. A few days 
ago I thought it in danger; but I am persuaded, a 
body of troops posted where I am, at all events, 
would answer valuable purposes. The baggage of 
the army, perhaps, will go by "Windsor; but it is 
perfectly safe, and shorter, to cross the troops at 
the fort.

<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 5 June, <a href='/results.php?year=1779'>1779</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I am for some time possessed of your Excellency's 
favor of the 18th ultimo, and perfectly convinced of 
the truth and importance of the contents, but have, 
and shall, punctually observe that degree of reserve, 
which is equally just as it can be agreeable to yourwishes. 
</p><p>
You are not mistaken when, on a late amplification 
of certain powers, you imagine Congress had an eye 
to something particular, or out of the common road. 
</p><p>
The fact was this; that we were taught to believe 
the return of the Count d Estaing to our coasts be 
fore this time, and that, by the assistance of his 
fleet, you will not be surprised that flattering and 
new manoeuvres should be formed in embryo, and the 
event of his coming be followed with hostile attacks 
on the enemy at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and Rhode Island. Those 
sanguine ideas so far operated on the minds of 
some gentlemen, as led them to move, that your Excellency should be directed to recall General Sulli 
van, &c. ; but these motions were so far overruled, as 
to leave you to the exercise of your own judgment, 
on the campaign at large. But upon what ground 
we were amused with the coming of the Count, and 
these hopes have so early died away, are matters 
that to me require some farther explanation. 
</p><p>
The business of finance, although not yet finished 
according to the system proposed, has, nevertheless, 
passed sundry stages apparently proper, and from 
which I expect, at least, a sudden period to the depreciation of our money. Indeed, the mere expectations of the populace, although our resolutions have 
not yet appeared, joined to the efforts of the sundry 
Committees in this State, have not only prevented a 
farther depreciation, but have actually lessened the 
price of several of the more, necessary articles of life. 
</p><p>
Foreign affairs continue to perplex and procrastinate. Who shall be the great men over the water; 
and whether a common right in the fishery shall, like 
other claims of right and convenience, be made an ultimatum, in case Great Britain should offer to concedeour independence ; or whether the fishery, at least for 
the present, shall be left to the effect of our Minister's negotiation, are subjects of tedious and disagreeable debate. It may be feared these points are blended, the business itself, and who shall transact it. 
Whoever wishes to be the Minister, may wish the 
latitude of negotiation. Others apprehend the risk 
might be too great in the hands of a Minister. How 
ever this important matter may be, many things, unjust and impolitic, have been said and propagated 
about it (I mean the fishery), by making unnecessary 
obstacles about it, giving it an undue and unnatural 
weight in the business of peace, as though itself 
should be the only sine qua non of Great Britain. 
And, if left on the easy footing of negotiation, at 
least oblique insinuations have been held up to the 
people, that we might have our independence con 
ceded us whenever we please, and might have had 
peace before now ; and thus have the true grounds of 
the debate been much shaded by a parcel of false 
hypotheses and delusive stuff. 
</p><p>
It is also true, that several gentlemen, far removed 
from any expectation or wish to go to Europe, think 
the fishery ought to be left to the "best terms the 
Minister can make about it; being of opinion, that it 
is not essential to the well-being of these States ; that 
the Eastern States only, or more principally, must begainers by it, viewing it as the only hinge upon 
which peace or war must turn. In this light, I confess, I am neither willing or able to conceive it, believing that the real springs of peace or war must 
arise from sours considerably different from that of 
the fishery. 
</p><p>
The army is also a topic of great consideration ; I 
mean its smallness and dissatisfaction. Glad would I 
have been to have it taken up in a series or chain 
long ago ; but our unpardonable, or at least unac 
countable delays on other business, have prevented 
that design, which, I am persuaded, if not early at 
tended to, must undo our cause. The business of 
half-pay for life, of which I have been fond, as the 
best compound of justice and gratuity to our soldiery, 
I find, will meet with more opposition in Congress 
than I had imagined. Many declaim against the policy of that measure, but say they are ready to agree to something tantamount, by reducing the necessaries 
of life to a moderate price, and making the pay good 
from the beginning, as though there had been no depreciation. Which of these modes Congress ought to 
adopt, I am at a loss to know; but would gladly 
urge the best. 
</p><p>
By a letter of the 6th instant, from Captain Kearsley, I am pleased to find he is returned to the service, and gone up the Susquehanna to join the troops 
with General Sullivan. 
</p><p>
Kearsley I take to be one of those officers, who 
will do his duty from principle, and make no doubt a line from your Excellency will at once please and 
fix him. 
</p><p>
Our reputed success on the 11th of May, near <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, becomes more and more doubtful, and 
may probably turn out to be only a change of route 
or manoeuvre, upon which Pulaski has charged and 
somewhat harassed their rear. Yet may we have some 
good news from General Lincoln, although the enemy's position, said to be in an island, must render 
his access difficult. The enemy's acquisitions of places 
on the North River are very interesting, and must 
call the attention of the States to strengthen the 
army, of which I am afraid little to the purpose can 
be done before the winter. With perfect respect, I 
have the honor to be, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's affectionate, humble servant,

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to inclose you the particulars 
of Colonel Clark's success against St. Vincent's, as 
stated in his letter but lately received; the messenger, with his first letter, having been killed. I fearit will be impossible for Colonel Clark to be so 
strengthened as to enable him to do what he desires. 
Indeed, the express who brought this letter gives us 
reason to fear St. Vincent's is in danger from a large 
body of Indians, collected to attack it, and said, when 
he came from Kaskaskia, to be within thirty leagues 
of the place. 
</p><p>
I also inclose you a letter from Colonel Shelby, 
stating the effect of his success against the seceding 
Cherokees and Chuccamoggas. The damage done them 
was, killing half a dozen, burning eleven towns, and 
twenty thousand bushels of corn, collected probably 
to forward the expeditions which were to have been 
planned at the Council, which was to meet Governor 
Hamilton at the mouth of the Tennessee, and taking as many goods as sold for twenty-five thousand 
pounds. 
</p><p>
I hope these two blows, coming together, and the 
depriving them of their head, will, in some measure, 
effect the quiet of our frontiers this summer. We 
have intelligence, also, that Colonel Bowman, from 
Kentucky, is in the midst of the Shawanee country, 
with three hundred men; and hope to hear a good 
account of him. The inclosed order, being in its nature important, and generally interesting, I think it 
proper to transmit it to you, with the reasons sup 
porting it. It will add much to our satisfaction, to 
know it meets your approbation. I have the honor 
to be, with every sentiment of private respect and 
public gratitude, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
THOMAS JEFFERSON. 
</p><p>
P. S. The distance of our northern and western 
counties from the scene of southern service, and thenesty of strengthening our western quarter, have 
induced the Council to direct the new levies from the 
counties of Youghiogania, Ohio, Monongalia, Frederick, 
Hampshire, Berkley, Buckingham, and Greenbrier, 
amounting to somewhat less than three hundred men, 
to enter into the ninth regiment at <a href='/results.php?city=pittsburgh' rel='city'>Pittsburg</a>. The 
aid they may give there will be so immediate and 
important, and what they could do to the southward 
would be so late, as, I hope, will apologize for their 
interference.

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
In my last I informed that the enemy landed last 
night. At four this morning, the enemy, on their ad 
vance, were met by the militia,, and some skirmishing 
ensued, but without any considerable effect on either 
side. At about six o clock, the troops under General Wolcott and my small detachment of one hundred 
and fifty Continental troops were joined, and took 
possession of an eminence at the north end of the 
town. The enemy advanced in our front, and on our left flank, until about nine o clock, when they were 
checked in their progress by the vigorous exertions 
of the parties of militia and Continental troops sent 
out to oppose them; and, in turn, were compelled to 
retire from hill to hill, at some times in great disorder. We continued to advance upon them until nea releven o clock, when, a column having nearly gained 
our right flank, the militia in the centre gave way, 
and retreated in disorder. This ga*ve the enemy possession of our ground. 
</p><p>
General Wolcott, who commanded, exerted himself, 
on this occasion, to rally the troops, and bring them 
to order again, but without effect, until they had re 
tired about two miles, when some troops, being again 
formed, returned to the aid of the right and left 
wings, who had retired but a small distance and in 
order. With these the enemy were pursued again, 
and retreated with precipitation to their ships. I 
have the pleasure to assure your Excellency the Continental troops, without exception, they being all engaged, behaved with the greatest bravery. Captain 
Betts, who was the first engaged with the enemy, 
and who continued longest in action, deserves particular notice, for his great fortitude and prudent con 
duct in the battle. He continued advancing on the 
enemy until the centre of the main body gave way ; 
and he and his party, advanced near a mile at the 
time, by his prudence were able to effect a regular retreat, without any considerable loss. Captain Eells 
on the right, and Captain on the left, were also 
</p><p>
engaged; and, when obliged to retire, kept their order, and retreated with regularity. A body of the 
militia (I think they were commanded by General 
Porter), and another considerable detachment, deserve 
honorable mention to be made of them. 
</p><p>
I am not yet able to ascertain our own or the 
enemy's loss; but in my next shall be able to give 
you a more particular account. In my handful of 
Continental troops, I have lost five men killed; Lieu 
tenant Gibbs, and six privates, wounded. I do not 
know of any missing. Some loss the militia have sustained. I am satisfied the loss of the enemy must 
have been considerable. About twenty boats landed on 
the west side the harbour, at Sock, and immediately 
began to set fire to the buildings. They completed 
burning the town (Norwalk) at about twelve o clock. 
This appears to have been their sole business, as they 
did not stay to carry off any plunder of considerable 
value. A few Tory houses are left, which, I hope, 
our people will burn, as the owners are here, and 
have committed no act by which the public can seize 
them. I imagine Stamford will be the next object to 
wreak their hellish malice upon. To that place I 
shall repair to-morrow. I am fully persuaded that 
five hundred more men, such as the brave militia I 
have before mentioned, and the one hundred and fifty 
Continental troops, would have given the enemy a 
.tol defeat. The numbers of the enemy were about 
two thousand ; our numbers between nine hundred 
and one thousand. I am, dear General,

SIR. 
</p><p>
I joined the division at the Continental Village, the 
last evening, and arrived at this post at five this 
morning. I now only halt for the return of a reconnoitring party, sent out last night, and shall immediately proceed to execute your Excellency's orders. 
The field-pies you suppose to have been taken on 
with the brigades, are not with them. General Nixon 
informs me there are not any attached to his brigade y those of General Patterson I think to send 
for. 
</p><p>
Colonel Putnam informs me, that <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> would 
be a very precarious situation, as the enemy, by more 
than one road, and by a march of a few hours, might 
post themselves in our rear, and cut off the retreat ; 
and that, without horsemen to act as videttes, we 
could not receive information in time to prevent it. 
If, therefore, there should be occasion to take post in 
this neighbourhood, I shall endeavour to fix on a situation not liable to this inconvenience. 
</p><p>
Lest any difficulty should arise as to the pies, I 
should be much obliged to you, Sir, to send such 
orders as may hasten them to me. I am, Sir, with

Before Verplanck's Point, 17 July, <a href='/results.php?year=1779'>1779</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I am now very near Verplanck's Point, which I 
have been reconnoitring, and shall still more fully 
inspect. "What I discern of the works appears to be 
properly constructed, and seems capable of considerable defence, if the numbers and spirit of the garrison 
are adequate to the task. The troops, except such 
as I have fixed at particular passes, are with me. 
The heavy cannon are, by this time, I hope, at the 
Continental Village ; and I have sent to hasten them 
as fast as possible. The ammunition appointed for 
them was not over the ferry when I left it, I gave 
the officers orders to expedite it. 
</p><p>
Understanding from your Excellency, that the can 
non and the requisites for them had been ordered, 1 
did not presume to interfere before with the detail. 
I doubt not that, if your Excellency's orders have 
been complied with, I shall receive the ammunition 
with the pies ; but the field-pies, I informed you 
this morning, were at <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a>. 
</p><p>
If works should be necessary to be thrown up, I 
am not furnished with one intrenching or other tool 
for the purpose. Should your Excellency think pro 
per, please order them, arid any other articles requi 
site. If the cannon do not get up in time to-day, 
shall retire till I meet them, if their security makes 
it necessary. 
</p><p>
The men are out of provisions to-day, and I have 
no Commissary to apply to for a supply. Will it not 
be convenient to your Excellency to order some, as 
I am without wagons to bring it? I had sent 
videttes down the roads you mentioned, before the 
receipt of your letter; but, as I am entirely unfurnished with horsemen, I was obliged to employ such 
of the country people as Colonel Putnam recommended. 
</p><p>
Early this morning I sent an express to General 
Heath, and am sorry I had not then your Excellency's instructions with regard to horse. If I can pro 
cure an express, I shall send to the general again, 
as horsemen are so essential to our situation. Being 
informed of a militia troop of horse about twelve 
miles distant, I have desired Captain Delaval, who 
commands them, to join me. Whether in this appli 
cation I shall be successful, remains a matter of 
speculation. 
</p><p>
Inclining to make short work of the enemy, I ordered the engineer to reconnoitre their works, which 
he did at a very short distance. He reports, that 
storming them, at present, would be ineligible. I 
take the liberty to refer your Excellency for ournumbers to Lieutenant Slade, not choosing to transmit a written return of them. With the greatest 
respect. I am your Excellency's

Very obedient and humble servant,

P. S. The chaplain of General Patterson's brigadejust informs me that, as he passed our cannon, he 
perceived the horses were jaded, and he thought they 
would not be up to-night. 
</p><p>
I think it necessary to add, that Colonel Putnam 
has informed me there is more danger of being dou 
bled between Continental Village and <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>, than 
between <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> and Verplanck's Point.

Your Excellency's favor of this day is this moment

for few of the artillery, brought here, are accompanied 
with horse-harness. I have, however, directed the 
Quarter-master to write immediately to <a href='/results.php?city=new windsor' rel='city'>New Windsor</a>

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I some time ago inclosed to you a printed copy of 
an order of Council, by which Governor Hamilton 
was to be confined in irons, and in close jail. This 
has occasioned a letter from General Phillips, of which 
the inclosed is a copy. The General seems to sup 
pose that a prisoner on capitulation cannot be put 
into close confinement, though his capitulation shall 
not have provided against it. My idea was, that all 
persons, taken in war, were to be deemed prisoners 
of war ; that those who surrender on capitulation (or 
Convention) are prisoners of war also, subject to the 
same treatment with those who surrender at discretion, except only so far as the terms of their capitulation or Convention shall have guarded them. In 
the capitulation of Governor Hamilton (a copy of 
which I inclose), no stipulation is made as to the 
treatment of himself, or those taken with him. The 
Governor, indeed, when he signs, adds a flourish of 
reasons, inducing him to capitulate, one of which is, 
the generosity of his enemy. generosity, on a large 
and comprehensive scale, seems to dictate the making a signal example of this gentleman ; but waiving that, 
these are only the private motives inducing him to 
surrender, and do not enter into the contract of Colonel Clark. 
</p><p>
I have the highest idea of the sacredness of those 
contracts which take place between nation and nation at war, and would be among the last on earth 
who should do any thing in violation of them. I 
can find nothing in those books, usually recurred to 
as testimonials of the laws and usages of nature and 
nations, which convicts the opinions I have above ex 
pressed, of error ; yet there may be such an usage as 
General Phillips seems to suppose, though not taken 
notice of by these writers. 
</p><p>
I am obliged to trouble your Excellency, on this 
occasion, by asking of you information on this point. 
There is no other person, whose decision will so authoritatively decide this doubt in the public mind, 
and none with which I am disposed so to comply. 
If you shall be of opinion, that the bare existence of a capitulation in the case of Governor Hamilton, privileges him from confinement, though there be no article to that effect in the capitulation, justice shall 
most assuredly be done him. The importance of this 
question in a public view, and my own anxiety, under a charge of a violation of national faith by the 
Executive of the Commonwealth, will, I hope, apologize for my adding this to the many, many troubles 
with which I know you to be burdened. I have the 
honor to be, with the most profound respect and es 
teem, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient, and most humble servant,

THOMAS JEFFERSON. 
</p><p>
P. S. I have just received a letter from Colonel 
Bland, containing information of numerous desertions 
from the Convention troops (not less than four hundred in the last fortnight). He thinks he has reason 
to believe it is with the connivance of some of their 
officers. Some of these have been retaken, all of 
them going northwardly. They had armed themselves 
with forged passports, and with certificates of having 
taken the oath of fidelity to the State, some of them 
forged, others really given by weak magistrates. Imention this to your Excellency, as perhaps it may 
be in your power to have such of them intercepted, 
as shall be passing through Pennsylvania and the 
Jerseys.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have received intelligence, three different ways, 
of the approach of the enemy. One informs me, that 
" several thousands of the enemy were, yesterday, onemile below White Plains, moving towards this place;" 
another, a verbal account, says that about two hundred of their horse were seen on some heights at 
New Bridge, by the informant. As I cannot doubt 
the credibility of these accounts, from the character 
of the persons who gave them, and as, consequently,there is the greatest reason to believe the enemy are 
making this effort to get me between two fires, duty 
and prudence enjoin me to avoid the snare. But, unwilling to risk too much on my own judgment, I have 
consulted that of the Brigadiers, who are of opinion, 
that no time should be lost to effect a retreat. Another express is just arrived, and confirms me in the 
above. I shall take post on the most convenient part

Deprived, as I was by the enemy's advances, of

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
General Wayne, being indisposed, desires that I 
inform your Excellency that I remained to see the 
whole of the troops off the ground, and just as the 
last party moved, a cannonade from the enemy's ships 
began to cover their Landing. At five o'clock they 
took immediate possession of the Point and dismantled works, confining themselves within the morass 
that encircles the Point, on which they placed a 
guard, and confined themselves within their sentries. 
</p><p>
I observed some officers busily pointing from place 
to place, as if they were directing the repair of the 
works. I counted fifty-eight sail of shipping, of different kinds, in view, about twenty of which were 
square-rigged; and about ten of these I took to be 
frigates and sloops of war, from eighteen to thirty 
guns. I think they had landed about six hundred 
men, and were still very busily landing. Four large 
transports were very full of men, that I think nonehad been sent from, as the boats were still plying 
from other vessels. They have many galleys and 
armed boats. The General thought it absolutely necessary your Excellency should have this intelligence 
immediately, and I have given it as circumstantially

FROM WILLIAM FITZHUGH.
 
Lower Marlborough [Maryland], 17 August, <a href='/results.php?year=1779'>1779</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I had the honor to receive your favor of the 25th 
of June, and should have wrote you long before this, 
but, as the meeting of our General Assembly was at 
hand, I waited for the event, in order to give you 
the result of their proceedings, especially relating to 
our army, speculating, engrossing, &c., &c. 
</p><p>
We have passed an act to provide annually for 
our officers one complete suit of regimentals, four shirts, and an allowance of rum, sugar, tea, coffee, 
chocolate, tobacco, &c., at the current prices of such 
articles when the war commenced; and left it at the 
officer's choice to receive, if he pleased, seven hundred and fifty pounds currency, instead of the regimentals and shirts; and have provided an allowance 
of rum and tobacco for the non-commissioned officers 
and soldiers. We have also continued the prohibition 
on the export of all kinds of provision, and passed 
an act to prevent forestalling and engrossing, and to 
appreciate our money, with very severe penalties ; 
and have appointed a Committee in every county to 
see it duly executed. By this act, all provisions purchased, except what may be thought sufficient to 
serve the family of the purchaser twelve months, are 
seizable for the public use; and there is such provision made, respecting the sale of goods and merchandise, as will nearly amount to the stoppage of trade, 
and, I hope, will have a good effect, especially as we 
have, at the same time, laid a tax on all estates, real 
and personal, of thirteen pounds in the hundred, to 
be collected by the first day of November next. 
</p><p>
These several regulations, with heavy taxes, I think 
must shake the speculators, though there are several 
wealthy companies, who have placed their agents from 
one end of the Continent to the other; and, at the 
head of one of them, Don Juan, a Spaniard, at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, called the Spanish Ambassador. And much 
will depend on the measures adopted in other States. 
With respect to filling up our battalions, recruiting is to continue ; and W T C have made an additional allowance, to every recruit, of a suit of clothes, a shirt, 
hat, shoes, and stockings. 
</p><p>
I am greatly obliged to your Excellency for the 
several judicious hints, contained in your letters of 
the 10th of April and 25th of June, particularly 
those relating to our officers, and the black tribe of 
speculators. They had much weight in our Legislature, and assisted our deliberations. I could wish 
that Congress would bend their attention to some 
general regulation respecting trade, forestalling, en 
grossing, and speculations, to be recommended to the 
whole United States. It would remove the evil effects 
of that jealousy which the States entertain of one an 
other, respectively, regarding their trade ; indeed, if 
adopted, the very foundation of its existence, and 
greatly strengthen the Union. 
</p><p>
I have reflected with concern on the long and 
tedious confinement of our prisoners at York and 
Long Island (I mean our officers, for I "believe the 
enemy have disposed of most of our private men) ; 
and on reading the report of our Commissioners, lately appointed to settle a cartel, I find that the British declare they wish not to exchange for the officers 
of the Convention troops (Burgoyne s), until the regiments, to which they belong, are also discharged. 
This is acknowledging an interest in their officers 
remaining prisoners, and, if not removed, will always 
operate against the settlement of a cartel. Separate 
the officers from the men, and the interest ceases. I 
believe it is not the custom of any nation to keep 
officers and privates prisoners of war together ; where 
fore, I presume, this singular instance has proceeded 
from some article of the Convention of <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>, 
Congress resolved that the Convention was broken on 
the part of Burgoyne, and therefore refused to comply with one capital article, which was, suffering the 
troops to embark at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> to be transported to 
Great Britain. 
</p><p>
If the Convention was broken, as I have no doubt 
it was, why comply with any part or article of it? 
Does it not imply a contradiction unfavorable to the 
wisdom or justice of Congress ? I am confident, if 
that honorable body had reflected a moment on the 
impropriety and evil consequences of keeping such a 
number of officers and men together, they never 
would have suffered it, and would even now separate them immediately. The irnpoliey of this indulgence is equally obvious. Had the men been sepa 
rated from their officers, they would have mingled 
with the inhabitants of the several States, and most 
of them become good and useful citizens; we should 
have gained strength, and the enemy been weakened 
by it. Common soldiers, when they have an opportunity, are fond of quitting the military service, and 
especially on a Continent like this, where they can be 
so readily accommodated with the necessaries of life. 
Your Excellency will naturally conceive that 1 am 
rather sanguine on this subject, and may impute 
it to interest. It is true, I have the feelings of a 
father for a captive son, and sincerely regret his 
long detention from his country's service, as well as 
improvement in his profession; but still am clear in 
opinion that justice, sound policy, and the public 
good, require an immediate separation of the officers 
from the soldiers or private men of that army. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to accept my thanks for the kind mention you make of my son. I have not had a letter 
from him since the 10th of July. He was then very 
well, on Long Island, and seems satisfied with every 
thing except his loss of time. The letters, which I mentioned as stopped by an officer on the British lines, were not to have passed by head-quarters, but 
through the hands of our Commissary of Prisoners, 
via <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, I have now requested my son to 
send his letters by way of head-quarters, and I take 
the liberty to inclose you one for him. 
</p><p>
I very sincerely congratulate you on the success 
of our arms at Stony Point. It was a glorious action, 
and reflects much honor and credit on the brave officers and men who performed it. 
</p><p>
I have been lately afflicted with the gout, and am 
so blind that I cannot walk out without a guide. 
These infirmities, I am afraid, will disable me to continue in the public service ; though I am determined, 
if possible, to hold out until there is a happy end to 
the war. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Fitzhugh presents her respectful compliments, 
and joins with me in best wishes for your health 
and success in arms. I have the honor to be, with 
the warmest affection and regard, your Excellency's 
Most obedient and obliged humble servant,

SIR, 
</p><p>
My plan and my dearest desire were, personally 
to take leave of your Excellency, and to go once 
more to admire, in a near view, the greatest man 
and best citizen of America. But a multitude of 
business, some indisposition, and the uncertainty of 
the epoch of my departure, have deprived me of the 
infinite satisfaction which I promised myself from, the 
journey. Receive then, Sir, my adieus in writing, as 
well as the assurances of all my respect, and of all 
my attachment. I shall count it among the most 
flattering events of my life, to have been able to 
merit some share in the esteem and in the confidence of your Excellency. 
</p><p>
France knows as well as America, Sir, that which 
she ought to place in your talents, and in your manner of thinking. Your attachment to the true inte 
rests of your country is the pledge of your dispositions towards the alliance ; and I dare assure your Excellency, that my Court knows how to do you 
justice, and that your personal glory and personal 
happiness are as precious to the French nation as 
they ought to be to the people of America, I have 
the honor to be, with the most respectful attachment,

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
On receipt of your letter of August 6th, during 
my absence, the Council had the irons taken off the 
prisoners of war. When your advice was asked, we 
meant it should decide with us ; and, upon my re 
turn to <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>, the matter was taken up, and 
the inclosed advice given. A parole was formed, of 
which the inclosed is a copy, and tendered to the 
prisoners. They objected to that part of it which re 
strained them from saying any thing to the prejudice of the United States, and insisted on "freedom 
of speech." They were, in consequence, remanded to 
their confinement in the jail, which must be considered as a voluntary one, until they can determine with 
themselves to be inoffensive in word as well as deed. 
</p><p>
A flag sails hence to-morrow to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, to negotiate the exchange of some prisoners, By her I 
have written to General Phillips on this subject, and

FROM COLONEL HAMILTON AND BRIGADIER-GENERAL DUPORTAIL. 
</p><p>
Great Egg Harbour Landing, 26 October, <a href='/results.php?year=1779'>1779</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR. 
</p><p>
We are honored with two letters from your Excellency, of the 10th and 21st, to the contents of which 
we beg leave to assure you of our strictest attention. 
That of the 18th has not yet come to hand. It 
is not improbable it has gone round by Lewistown, 
which has occasioned the delay. 
</p><p>
Colonel Hamilton wrote to your Excellency from 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, acquainting you with our arrival there, 
and our intention to proceed to Lewistown at Cape 
Henlopen; and from Great Egg Harbour, communicating our progress since, and our determination to establish ourselves at Bat Stove Furnace. We have since 
fixed on this place, about forty-four miles from the 
extremity of Cape May (eighteen miles short of the 
Furnace, which we found to be more remote than 
had been represented), and, as far as we are able to 
learn, from one hundred to one hundred and ten miles 
from Sandy Hook about fifty from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
Your Excellency will easily perceive the reasons of 
our choosing this station. It did not appear to us, 
from our inquiries in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, to be a point well 
ascertained that the fleet would stop at the Delaware; 
and the time which had elapsed made it the more 
possible, if the Count should be determined to prose 
cute any further operations on the Continent, that he 
would not lose time by a procedure of this sort, but 
might content himself with sending some transports, 
under escort of a few frigates, to receive the provi 
sions for the fleet, and proceed himself directly on to 
the Hook. On this supposition, our position at Lewistown was entirely ineligible. The distance at which 
we were from the city, as well as from the Hook, 
the delays that would consequently attend our intelligences from every quarter, the difficulty and impossibility sometimes of traversing the Bay, made our first 
situation inconvenient in every respect, in the event 
of the fleet's proceeding immediately to the Hook. 
These considerations induced us to cross the Delaware, 
and take the position at which we now are, where, 
or in the vicinity, we propose to remain till the 
arrival of the Count, till intelligence from him decides the inutility of a longer stay, or till we receive 
your Excellency's orders of recall. 
</p><p>
We have now a better relation to the different 
points in which we are interested, and have taken 
the necessary precautions to gain the earliest notice 
of whatever happens. We have stationed expresses 
at the pitch of the Cape, and have established a regular communication with Major Lee, and with the 
city. If the fleet should appear off the Delaware, we 
can be there in twelve hours after its first appearance ; and if at the Hook, in less than four days, 
provided Major Lee is punctual in conveying the 
intelligence, arid the expresses from either side in 
bringing it. 
</p><p>
By recent information from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> (though 
not quite so distinct and accurate as we could wish), 
we find that, so late as the 4th of this month, the 
Count was yet to open his batteries against the enemy at <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>. The time that will probably intervene between this and their final reduction, the reembarkation of the Count's troops, the dispositions 
for sailing, and his arrival on this coast, may, we 
fear, exhaust the season too much to permit the co 
operation to which our mission relates. We do not, 
however, despair; for, if the Count has been fully 
successful to the southward, and should shortly arrive, 
which may be the case, the enterprise may possibly 
still go on. 
</p><p>
In a letter from Major Lee, of the 22d, he informs 
us that a vessel from Georgia arrived on the 16th, 
since which the two sixty-fours and the Renown, 
which were at the Hook, had fallen down towards 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and the troops at the Hook had em 
barked, and gone to the city. At first sight this 
account alarmed us, and made us apprehensive that 
the enemy had received some favorable advices from 
the southward, which put them out of danger, and 
superseded the necessity of continuing their preparations for defence. But, on further reflection, we think 
it more probable that this is only a change of disposition; and that finding, on close examination, they 
would be unable to defend the Hook, they had determined to relinquish the attempt. This seems the 
more likely, as Major Lee mentions that a part of 
the hulks, sunk in the channel, had gotten afloat 
and drifted ashore. 
</p><p>
To this experience of the difficulty of obstructing 
the channel, may, perhaps, be attributed the change 
we suppose. And we are confirmed in this conjecture by the evacuation of the two posts at King's 
Ferry, which appears, by your Excellency's letter, to 
have taken place on the 21st, five days after the 
supposed arrival of the. vessel from Georgia ; a proof 
that they had not received information of any decisive good fortune on their side, or ill fortune on ours; 
and that they persisted in their defensive plan. We 
are persuaded, too, that their exultation would have 
given wings to any good news they might have received, and that it would have reached us before this. 
Were the season less advanced, we should regret this 
change of disposition, because we believe the attempt 
to defend the entrance of the Hook would have been 
fruitless ; and it might have thrown a part of their 
ships and of their troops into our hands in the first 
instance, which could not fail to facilitate the sucssive operations. 
</p><p>
But, at this late period, it may rather be an ad 
vantage. To force the passage, might have required 
land operations against the Hook, which would lose 
time, and expose the fleet to the hard of winds, 
which would have rendered its situation critical. 
Now, the fleet may probably enter the Bay on its 
first approach, and be in security ; and the whole 
operation will be brought to a point, and may demand less time for its accomplishment. 
</p><p>
As a large number of fascines, ready for use, appears to us essential to any operations that may be 
undertaken, we presume your Excellency has been 
preparing, and will continue to prepare, as many as 
possible. We beg leave to suggest the utility of 
having at the same time a sufficient number of gabi 
ons and sand bags. Of the former, Colonel Gouvion, 
if your Excellency thinks proper, may be charged 
with the construction. The latter may be made under the care of the Quarter-master at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
Several thousands may be necessary. The usual dimensions are fifteen or eighteen inches long, and 
twelve wide. If, notwithstanding the advices from 
Major Lee, any thing by land is to be attempted 
against the Hook, these will be peculiarly useful on 
such a flat, sandy spot ; and, indeed, it would be 
impracticable to construct batteries in any reasonable time without them. We have the honor to be,

I most sincerely congratulate your Excellency upon

I doubt not you will take every necessary measure

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letter, on the discriminations 
which have been heretofore made between the troops 
raised within this State, and considered as part of 
our quota, and those not so considered, was delivered 
me four clays ago. I immediately laid it before the 
Assembly, who thereupon came to the resolution I 
now do myself the honor of inclosing to you. The re 
solution of Congress, of March 15, <a href='/results.php?year=1779'>1779</a>, which you 
were so kind as to inclose, was never known in this 
State till a few weeks ago, when we received printed copies of the journals of Congress. It would be a great satisfaction to us to receive an exact return 
of all the men we have in Continental service, who 
come within the descriptions of the resolution, together with our State troops in Continental service. 
Colonel Cabell was so kind as to send me a return, 
of October, <a href='/results.php?year=1779'>1779</a>, of the Continental regiments, commanded by Lord Stirling, of the 1st and 2d Virginia 
State regiments, and of Colonel Gist's regiment. Be 
sides these, there are the following ; Colonel Harrison's regiment of artillery, Colonel Baylor's horse, 
Colonel Eland's horse, General Scott's new levies (part 
of which are gone to South Carolina, and part are 
here), Colonel Gibson's, regiment stationed on the Ohio, 
Heath's and O Hara's independent companies at the 
same stations, Colonel Taylor's regiment of guards 
to the Convention troops. Of these we have a re 
turn; there may possibly be others riot occurring to 
me. A return of all these would enable us to see 
what proportion of the Continental army is contributed by us. 
</p><p>
We have, at present, very pressing calls to send 
additional numbers of men to the southward. No inclination is wanting, in either the legislative or executive powers, to aid them, or strengthen you ; but 
we find it very difficult to procure men. I herewith 
transmit to your Excellency some recruiting commissions, to be put into such hands as you may think 
proper, for reenlisting such of our soldiery as are 
not engaged already for the war. The act of Assembly, authorizing these instructions, requires that the 
men enlisted should be reviewed and received by an 
officer, to be appointed for that purpose ; a caution 
less necessary in the case of men now actually in 
service, and therefore doubtless able-bodied, than in 
the raising new recruits. The direction, however, goes 
to all cases, and therefore we must trouble your Excellency with the appointment of one or more officers 
of review. Mr. Moss, our agent, receives orders, which 
accompany this, to pay the bounty money and recruiting money, and to deliver the clothing. We have, 
however, certain reason to fear he has not any great 
sum of money on hand ; and it is absolutely out of 
our power, at this time, to supply him, or to say, 
with certainty, when we shall be able to do it. He 
is instructed to note his acceptances under the drafts, 
and to assure payment as soon as we shall have it 
in our power to furnish him, as the only substitute 
for money. Your Excellency's directions to the officer of review, will probably procure us the satisfaction of being informed, from time to time, how many 
men shall be reenlisted. 
</p><p>
By Colonel Matthews, I informed your Excellency 
of the situation of Governor Hamilton and his companions. Lamothe and Dejean have given their pa 
roles, and are at Hanover Court-House. Hamilton, 
Hay, and four others, are still obstinate. They, there 
fore, are still in close confinement, though their irons 
have never been on since your second letter on the 
subject, I wrote full information of this matter to 
General Phillips also, from whom I had received letters on the subject. I cannot, in reason, believe that 
the enemy, on receiving this information, either from 
yourself or General Phillips, will venture to impose 
any new distresses on our officers in captivity with 
them. Yet their conduct, hitherto, has been most successfully prognosticated, by reversing the conclusions 
of right reason. 
</p><p>
It is, therefore, my duty, as well as it was my 
promise to the Virginia captives, to take measures 
for discovering any change which may be made in 
their situation. For this purpose I must apply for 
your Excellency's interposition. I doubt not but you 
have an established mode of knowing, at all times, 
through your Commissary of Prisoners, the precise 
state of those in the power of the enemy. I must,therefore, pray you to put into motion any such 
means as you may have of obtaining knowledge of 
the situation of the Virginia officers in captivity. If 
you shall think proper, as I could wish, to take upon 
yourself to retaliate any new sufferings which may be 
imposed on them, it will be more likely to have due 
weight, and to restore the unhappy, on both sides, to 
that benevolent treatment, for which all should wish. 
I have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem 
and respect, your Excellency's

<a href='/results.php?city=york' rel='city'>York</a>, 28 November, <a href='/results.php?year=1779'>1779</a>. 
</p><p>
MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Your kind favor of the 26th of last month, by some means reached me only a few days ago. I am 
greatly obliged by your concern for my health, which 
is perfectly restored. The confinement absolutely necessary for a member of Congress, who pays the attention he ought to the great concerns of this Continent, is totally inconsistent with my constitution. 
It was with reluctance that I left Congress at the 
time I did; but my disorder, brought on and increased by a sedentary life, compelled me to do so. I am 
never so well as when I take upon me the soldier. 
It may be asked, why I do not engage seriously in 
that line. Believe me, when I tell you, that I have 
often lamented my not taking the field with you 
at the commencement of this war, and there is a 
punctilio at this time that prevents it. To enter 
in a subordinate rank would not suit my own feelings ; and to take rank of the worthy officer who had 
seen the brunt of the war, would wound his feelings, 
and show a want of generosity in myself. 
</p><p>
You have heard, before this day, of our misfortune before <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>. The disappointment was increased 
by our great certainty of success. Some of our allies, 
who suffered in that affair, are now in this town in a 
very sickly condition indeed. The , one of the 
</p><p>
seven ships that were to winter in this Bay, is arrived with about three hundred land forces. The 
others, it is imagined, have borne away for the West 
Indies. Count d Estaing is certainly gone to Europe. 
</p><p>
Our Assembly has been sitting some time, and, 
about a fortnight ago, appointed a Committee of 
Ways and Means, to consider of measures for complying with the requisitions of Congress, as well as 
to support our own credit. I think I may venture 
to say, there will be not the least doubt of both 
being effected by taxes and loans. Congress may 
rely on her quota of money from this State, which, 
I hope, will quickly restore her credit. Never was 
America in more danger than at this time. The 
Continental treasury exhausted; internal commotions 
in some of the States; differences in Congress respecting the back territory claimed by Virginia., which, 
I fear, will be attended with serious consequences. 
It was determined, yesterday, to put all the officers 
and soldiers, who are citizens of this Commonwealth, 
upon the same footing with those in the Virginia line. 
A motion has been made to give the same quantity of land to the officers and soldiers belonging to 
those States that have no back territory, as is provided for our own troops; but, to my great sorrow, 
it failed. I think it would have been but just, arid 
I am sure it would have been politic. The injury 
done to America, if those troops should quit the service, will be as great as if the Virginia line should 
quit it ; for, although I may not think those States 
have the least claim upon our back lands, yet I 
think the officers and soldiers should all be upon an 
equal footing, having, indeed, equal services; and to 
compel the States, so circumstanced, to purchase these 
lands for their troops, is subjecting them to a burden 
which they ought not to bear. I distinguish between 
the citizens of those States and the troops. The for 
mer cannot, upon any principle of justice, insist upon 
that country being thrown into the common stock, 
towards defraying the expenses of the war ; but the 
latter may complain of great injustice done them, 
when they see such a difference made between them 
and their fellow-soldiers, who have all engaged in 
the general defence of the States. Accept my sincere 
wishes for a continuance of your health, an object 
in which no one thinks himself more interested than 
Your friend and obedient servant,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have your Excellency's favor of this date, on the 
subject of the movement of the Virginia troops. I 
should have been very happy to have continued the 
command of them, as they are an excellent body of 
men, and, among the officers, many valuable men for 
whom I have the greatest esteem ; but, in all arrangements of the army, I have always been content 
with the commands that have been allotted to me, and 
I do not doubt I shall have reason to be so in the 
future arrangements. However pleasing the command 
of the Southern army might have been to me, the 
very great esteem I have for General Lincoln would 
prevent my entertaining a wish to take it out of his 
hands. Besides his abilities, the knowledge he has 
acquired of that country points him out as the fittest 
officer for that command, and I am happy he is continued in it. Whatever commands your Excellency 
may commit to my care, you may be assured will be 
executed with cheerfulness and faithfulness; and that, 
with much sincere affection, esteem, and regard, I 
have the honor to be your Excellency's

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I take the liberty of putting under cover to your Excellency, some letters to Generals Phillips and 
Riedesel, uninformed whether they are gone into 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> or not, and knowing that you can best 
forward them in either case. 
</p><p>
I also trouble you with a letter from the Master 
of the Flag, in this State, to the British Commissary 
of Prisoners in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, trusting it will thus be 
more certainly conveyed than if sent to Mr. Adams. 
It is my wish the British Commissary should return 
his answer through your Excellency, or your Commissary of Prisoners, and that they should not pro 
pose, under this pretext, to send another flag, as the 
mission of the present flag is not unattended by circumstances of suspicion, and a certain information of 
the situation of ourselves, and our allies here, might 
influence the measures of the enemy. Perhaps your Commissary of Prisoners can effect the former mode of answer. 
</p><p>
I inclose to you part of an act of Assembly, ascertaining the quantities of land which shall be al 
lowed to the officers and soldiers, at the close of the 
war, and providing means of keeping that country 
vacant which has been allotted for them. 
</p><p>
I am advised to ask the attention of your Excellency to the case of Colonel Bland, late Commander 
at the barracks in Albemarle. When that gentleman 
was applied to, to take that command, he attended 
the Executive here, and informed them, that he must 
either decline it, or be supported in such a way as 
would keep up that respect which was essential to 
his command, without, at the same time, [sacrificing] 
his private fortune. 
</p><p>
The Executive were sensible, that he would be ex 
posed to very great and unavoidable expense. They 
observed that his command would be in a department 
separate from any other, and that he actually relieved a Major-General from the same service. They did 
not think themselves authorized to say what should 
be done in this case, but undertook to represent the 
matter to Congress, and, in the mean time, gave it 
as their opinion that a decent table ought to be 
found for him. On this he undertook the command, 
and, in the course of it, incurred expenses which 
seem to have been unavoidable, unless he would 
have lived in such a way as is hardly reconcilable to the spirit of an officer, or the reputation of 
those in whose service he is. Governor Henry wrote 
on the subject to Congress. Colonel Bland did the 
same ; but we learn that they have concluded the 
allowance to be unprecedented and inadmissible in 
the case of an officer of his rank. The Commissaries, 
on this, have called on Colonel Bland for reimbursement, A sale of his estate was about to take place. 
when we undertook to recommend to them to sus 
pend their demand till we could ask the favor of 
you to advocate this matter with Congress, so far as 
you may think it right ; otherwise the ruin of a very 
worthy officer must inevitably follow. I have the ho 
nor to be, with the greatest respect and esteem, your Excellency's

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
The requisitions to the several States for reenforcements to the army, proposed in your letter of the 
18th November last, are not yet adopted by Congress, and a fresh application from your Excellency 
appears to me necessary for promoting that important 
business. A report has been long since made on the 
subject, and been several times under the consideration of Congress ; but an opinion has been lately 
suggested, and I fear with too much effect, "that the 
number of men enlisted for the war is already sufficient, and that reinforcements are not necessary for 
the army in this quarter." Should this sentiment 
prevail, or the requisitions be much longer delayed, 
we shall probably lay the foundation of an inactive 
campaign, if not of greater misfortunes ; and renew 
the uneasiness of the Court of France, who last year remonstrated in very friendly, but expressive terms, 
against the delays of our military preparations for 
that campaign. As the measures of our good ally 
for the establishment of our independence, as well as 
those of the common enemy against it, are prosecuted with the greatest vigor, it appears to me that 
we are urged by every principle of policy, generosity, 
and honor, to be equally vigorous and decisive, and 
I have been thus induced to trouble your Excellency 
on the subject. 
</p><p>
I hope that the measures taken and such as are 
under the consideration of Congress, for obtaining 
supplies of provisions, will effectually relieve the 
wants of the army, which, I confess, distress me ex 
ceedingly. I am, Sir, with every sentiment of respect 
and esteem,

</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=carlisle' rel='city'>Carlisle</a>, 12 January, <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The present distressing aspect of our public affairs 
compels me to add to your Excellency's present troubles the reading of the following lines. About this 
time I hoped to have heard of your being in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and fully intended writing at some greater 
length than the haste of the bearer will now admit. 
</p><p>
I need not take up the train, much less the 
causes, of our present most critical and dangerous 
situation. The flames of political destruction are enkindled all around us, and have made their formidable progress but too obvious even to common reflection; nor have I ever separated the great public con 
cern from, that peculiar degree of anxiety, which 
must possess your mind, on the languishing state of 
our finance. On the subtile subject of finance, my 
pretensions are truly small; but on the necessity of 
some different measures from any yet adopted, what 
man can shut his eyes ? To say nothing of the various aerial schemes which have been thrown out, one thing is clear, that even such as have been tried, 
from their show of more reason and solidity, either 
from their being inadequate in their nature, or too 
late in their application, have palpably failed of the 
effect. For some time past we have resembled a patient far gone in disease, given up by his physicians, 
and left to the mere efforts of nature. Now, whether 
we shall proceed in this same natural, or rather 
slothful and timid way, leaving our internal commerce to regulate itself, and take chance for the 
event, or attempt the plain highway of law and pub 
lic authority, in the regulation of prices generally, 
appears to be the question, and that without an alternative that can promise success. 
</p><p>
The latter, however degraded by merchants, or exploded by some politicians of more refined sentiments, if I have any opinion at all, is the better, 
if not the only fundamental means of our political 
recovery. I know there are powerful objections to 
this doctrine of regulation of prices by law, or rather 
they are powerfully made; for, at this time I must in 
truth declare, I think their whole operation impertinent, inconclusive, and lost in the superior force of 
those arguments, which inevitably result from the 
present circumstances of this country ; whereby the 
great law of necessity is now clearly introduced for 
the trial of a legal regulation of prices, and must, at 
least, fully justify the experiment. I know the grand 
difficulties, as well as the niceties attending such 
regulations, must lie in the execution and penalties 
of this law. Hard they may be, but ought not to 
be supposed insurmountable. True, the virtue of the 
populace is very low, but not altogether extinct, the 
latent remains whereof must yet instrumentally save 
us. If so, how are we to animate these remains, when 
the natural springs thereof are so much relaxed ? 
No other probable, or perhaps possible way, but by 
the salutary stimulus of public authority, and the encouragement they may derive from a near prospect 
of peace, or at least of retrenching the extra expenses of the civil staff of the army, which would 
naturally lead to some further observation; I mean 
such as arises on the remarks, sentiments, and tem 
per of many people far out of your sight and hearing. 
</p><p>
But now Colonel Davis waits with impatience, and 
obliges me to conclude. Your Excellency will easily 
conceive my design, in these hasty lines, arises from a wish that your helping hand may be put to this 
business, although out of your strict sphere of action, 
as it is to be apprehended that different sentiments 
on politics may obstruct the measure. I am, with 
great truth and respect, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and affectionate humble servant,

P. S. I could sincerely wish the policy of Virginia, respecting their Land-Office and extent of terri 
tory, were otherwise timed, and more disinterested.

<a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a, 16 January, <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to inform your Excellency that 
early yesterday morning the corps under my command crossed the sound at Do Hart's Point, and proceeded towards the watering place. The enemy having received previous intelligence of our movements,a surprise was out of the question ; and as their works 
Avere well situated, and appeared otherwise strong, an 
assault was deemed unadvisable, as it would probably 
have cost us more than we could have gained by 
success. We found, too, contrary to our expectation, 
that the communication between the Island and New 
York was open. 
</p><p>
Immediately on our arrival in front of the enemy's 
works, they sent off a boat to the city and in the 
evening several vessels came down from thence to 
the Island. As, from this circumstance, there was no 
hope of reducing them, for want of provision or 
fuel, and a reenforcement might have rendered our continuance dangerous, we determined to march off 
this morning. The retreat was effected in good order, and with very little loss. A party of the enemy's horse charged our rear-guard, under Major Ed 
wards, but was immediately repulsed. The Major had 
three men killed, and killed one of the light horse 
men, and took his horse. Some of the men were 
frost-bitten, and, though we took all the pains in our power to have all those unable to march transported 
in sleighs, yet I imagine a very few may have been 
left behind. We took a few prisoners, and had a 
few deserters from the enemy. 
Immediately after crossing, a party was detached 
under Lieutenant-Colonel Willett, to Decker's Point. 
The corps there had been alarmed, and barely made its escape. The house (as a garrison place), and 
eight or nine small vessels near it, were burnt. A 
considerable quantity of blankets and other stores 
were found. 
</p><p>
While the troops were upon the Island, a number 
of persons from this side took advantage of the 
occasion to pass upon the Island, and plunder the 
people there in the most shameful and merciless 
manner. Many of them were stopped on their re 
turn, and their booty taken from them; in addition 
to which, I have sent an order for publication, requiring those who had eluded the search, to restore 
the articles in their possession, and exhorting the 
good people at large to assist in detecting them. All 
the soldiery, on re-crossing the ice, were searched, 
and the little plunder they had, taken from them ; 
and their names noted, that they may be brought to 
punishment. The articles recovered are and will be 
deposited with the Reverend Mr. Caldwell (who is 
exerting himself in the affair), to be returned to the 
owners. I am happy to inform your Excellency that a very inconsiderable part indeed of the troops dishonored themselves by participating in these enormities. 
</p><p>
The officers and men, in general, showed a good 
disposition; and I only regret there was no opportunity of turning it to advantage. I have the honor 
to be, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and humble servant,

FROM THE CHEVALIER 1)E LA LUZERNE, MINISTER FROM FRANCE. 
</p><p>
(Translation.) 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 23 January, <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Advis recently received from Europe, make mention of the efforts, which the English have made in 
Germany to procure recruits and new levies, and of 
the difficulty they have experienced, even on the part 
of those Courts with whom they have before treated. 
The greatest part of the German Princes, who have 
sold soldiers to the Court of London, now blush at 
these sales, which have excited their subjects against 
them, and which, besides, have drained their States. 
They are reluctant to give troops to a power that is 
making war against France, with whom they have 
always preserved amicable tics ; and I am. assured, 
that it is even doubtful whether the English will be 
able to procure a few recruits to complete the corps 
they have in America. 
</p><p>
I am informed that these circumstances have determined the British Government to make every effort 
to obtain men in America, whom they cannot procure 
in Europe \ and that Mr. Clinton has received orders 
to spare no pains to effect the exchange or deliverance of the troops of the Convention of <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>, and 
of other prisoners who are in the hands of the 
Americans. It is added, that the want of the Court 
of London for soldiers is so pressing, that General 
Clinton has been authorized to surmount all the difficulties which may arise in the negotiation of this 
exchange; and that he is even permitted, in case of 
absolute necessity, to treat with Congress, or their 
Ministers, on terms of perfect equality, and as with 
an independent power. He has also equally full 
liberty to agree upon the number of private soldiers 
who may be given in exchange for an officer of any 
rank whatsoever ; and they order him simply to re 
member, in treating of this matter, that an English 
soldier, transported to America, is of an infinite price 
to England, and they exhort him to employ all his 
efforts to bring about an exchange, whatever may be 
the conditions. 
</p><p>
I hasten to communicate these interesting ideas to 
Congress ; and I have learned that they were confirmed by the event, and that Major-General Phillips had 
in effect drawn on a negotiation, the progress of 
which had been entirely confided to your Excellency. 
They prayed me, at the same time, to send you a 
communication of these objects, which the Congress 
think ought greatly to influence the measures which 
it will be in your power to take, when you know 
that the English Commissioners have orders to pass 
over all difficulties, and to grant all the demands 
which may be made, rather than to lose the occasion 
of reenforcing the army they have upon this Continent, 
</p><p>
I join to this some extracts, the contents of which 
have appeared to me of a nature to interest your Excellency. You will see, besides, Sir, by the des 
patch of the British Minister, with what affectation 
he seeks to make the Thirteen States to be considered as subjected to the English domination, and you 
will judge of what importance it is to you to treat 
with the Court of London upon the footing of perfect equality, and how useful an act of this nature 
may be to the negotiations of Congress in Europe, 
when they can add to all the facts, of which the 
Court of Madrid makes mention in its memoir, a cartel regulated on the footing of perfect parity, and 
which would prejudge, beforehand, the question of 
your independence. I congratulate myself that this 
negotiation is in your hands and I am well persuaded that nothing will pass derogatory to the part 
which my Court has taken, in acknowledging the 
independence and perfect sovereignty of the United 
States. 
</p><p>
I shall intrust to your Excellency, that the King is 
disposed to send over succours to this Continent, of 
arms and ammunition ; but, as the events of the sea 
are uncertain, I believe that it will be proper to make 
no change in the measures which may have been taken 
otherwise to procure them. This news not having 
reached me till yesterday, I have not yet been able 
to make a communication of it to Congress. 
</p><p>
As you may be retained in your quarters by important considerations, I propose to go to pay you my 
respects in the course of the next month, and confer with your Excellency on objects of great importance, and relative to the measures necessary to push 
the next campaign with vigor, and to put the Ame 
rican army in a condition truly proper to hold the 
enemy in check upon the Continent, whilst his Majesty and the King of Spain shall display, in the 
other parts of the world, all their forces, to secure 
advantageous terms of peace to the allies. 
</p><p>
I am, with respect, Sir, 
</p><p>
LUZEIIXE. 
</p><p>
P. S. This letter will be delivered to your Excellency by M. de Gal van, who has been raised to the 
rank of Major by your goodness. He desires to 
merit it anew, and prays me to solicit you to put his 
zeal in activity. I shall be very grateful for what 
you may be pleased to do for him. He was particularly recommended to me by the Minister of France. 
He appeared to me to merit a great deal from his 
zeal, and from his personal attachment to your Excellency.

MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I was so unfortunate as not to be acquainted with 
the intended attempt upon Staten Island ; otherwise 1 
certainly would not wish to be absent. But the mis 
fortune I most regret is, that nature had not formed 
her bridge previous to the dissolution of the light 
corps ; for, be assured, we remained some days, wishing and anxiously waiting for that event, after the 
state of our magazines, together with your orders, 
rendered a separation inevitable. 
</p><p>
I am confident that your Excellency will do me 
the justice to believe that, if any opening had offered 
to strike the enemy with a prospect of success, and 
where the object would have justified the attempt, 
not one moment would have been lost in asking your permission and final direction. 
</p><p>
In addition to my former request respecting the 
command in the light corps, I beg to be employed 
on every occasion where your Excellency may think 
me worthy of trust, either as a volunteer, or in any 
other character that you may deem most conducive 
to the benefit of the service; and to believe me, with 
the truest esteem, your very affectionate, and 
Most obedient, humble servant,

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
It is possible you may have heard that, in the 
course of last summer, an expedition was meditated 
by our Colonel Clark against Detroit; that he had 
proceeded so far as^ to rendezvous a considerable 
body of Indians, I believe four or five thousand, at 
St. Vincent's ; but, being disappointed in the number 
of whites he expected, and not choosing to rely principally on the Indians, he was obliged to decline it. 
We have a tolerable prospect of reenforcing him this 
spring, to the number which he thinks sufficient for 
the enterprise. We have informed him of this, and 
left him to decide between this object and that of 
giving vigorous chastisement to those tribes of Indians whose eternal hostilities have proved them incapable of living on friendly terms with us. It is our opinion his inclination will lead him to determine on 
the former. 
The reason of my laying before your Excellency 
this matter, is, that it has been intimated to me that 
Colonel Brodhead is meditating a similar expedition. 
I wished, therefore, to make you acquainted with 
what we had in contemplation. The enterprising and 
energetic genius of Clark is not altogether unknown 
to you. You also know (what I am a stranger to) 
the abilities of Brodhead, and the particular force 
with which you will be able to arm him for such an 
expedition. We wish the most hopeful means should 
be used for removing so uneasy a thorn from our side. As yourself alone are acquainted with all the 
circumstances necessary for well-informed decision, I 
am to ask the favor of your Excellency, if you 
should think Brodhead's undertaking is most likely 
to produce success, that you will be so kind as to 
intimate to us to divert Clark to the other object, 
which is also important to this State. It will, of 
course, have weight with you in forming your determination, that our prospect of strengthening Clark's 
hands sufficiently is not absolutely certain. It may 
be necessary, perhaps, to inform you, that these two 
officers cannot act together, which excludes the hopes 
of insuring success by a joint expedition. I have 
the honor to be, with the most sincere esteem, your Excellency's

</p><p>
MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The propositions I made to Congress, respecting 
the formation of the army, of which I had the honor 
of transmitting your Excellency a copy, remain yet 
on their table, without any decision thereon. They 
have, however, set aside the report of the Board of 
War on a motion for reducing the battalions, as you 
will perceive by the resolve annexed, so that all reduction or incorporation is now out of the question ; 
and for next campaign the regiments in the line will 
be augmented more or less by the respective States. 
What is to be done with the additional regiments 
and the cavalry, Congress cannot or will not decide; 
though I am rather led to believe their delay in this 
matter proceeds from the grand cause of all our mis 
fortunes, the bad state of our finances, which will 
not allow the recruiting of men, or purchasing of 
horses. 
</p><p>
I observed to you, my dear General, in my last, 
that every wheel of the machine seemed stopped. 
Of the truth of this observation I become more and 
more convinced, and must confess, that to me our situation appears very critical. The late resolves respecting the money, though attended with all the 
success that can be wished, cannot make any immediate alteration for the better. Some months must 
elapse before their good effects will be felt; and, during this time, we are disabled from doing any thing, 
whilst, at this very moment, the greatest exertions 
are necessary. 
</p><p>
My anxiety for our Southern affairs, I cannot help 
saying, is considerably increased by the last accounts, 
which seem to announce a determination of General 
Lincoln to defend <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> with all his force; this, 
to me, appears to be playing a hardy game. , 
</p><p>
Another danger which threatens us, and which is 
much to be dreaded, is the declared division between Virginia and Pennsylvania; the latter State 
having actually passed a law for the raising fifteen 
hundred men to defend their pretended rights. All 
these things offer but a dull prospect, rendered still 
more dull by the cabals and factions which reign 
among us. The civil departments of the army, at a 
time when their whole attention should be taken up 
in providing for the approaching campaign, are in 
such a state of dissatisfaction and confusion, that I 
am very apprehensive they will make things still 
worse than they are. 
</p><p>
You will perhaps think, my dear General, that I 
am in anxiety for things which are out of my sphere ; 
but when you consider that all my happiness depends 
on our success, you will not blame me for,, the interest I take , in the cause. The same motives make 
me apprehensive that the necessary arrangements will 
never be firmly established without your personal 
assistance ; and I submit to you, my dear General, 
whether your presence is not absolutely necessary at 
Congress, in the present critical situation of our affairs. Your right to the confidence, both of Congress and the people, is too well founded not to command 
the greatest attention to every thing you propose. 
The time is precious, and the prospect before us 
threatening. Your presence will animate our counsels, as it does our armies. My attachment to the 
cause, and the respectful confidence I have in your person, indus me to express, in the strongest terms, 
the desire I have to see you here. I have the honor 
to be, your Excellency's

A new Constitution of Government being generally

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
After a forced march of five hundred and five 
miles, which we performed in thirty days, I had 
the pleasure of throwing my troops into town in 
good health and spirits, by the only passage now 
left open. We arrived on the 7th, at two o clock, to 
the great joy of the garrison. Our embarkation was 
made on the east side of Cooper River, distant from 
town nine miles. 
</p><p>
So far as my indisposition would enable me to 
make myself acquainted with the situation of matters, they stand nearly thus. 
</p><p>
Their ships, to the number of nine, passed Fort 
Moultrie yesterday afternoon, at five o clock. The 
fire from both sides was warm, but, the wind being 
fair and blowing very fresh, they passed with much 
more ease than I expected, and I fear with less 
damage. All that we can discover is, one of the 
frigates lost her foremast ; a ship ran aground in 
her passage up, but got off with the evening's flood, 
and, in attempting to come up in the night, was set 
on fire and blew up, whether from the fire of the 
fort, or by what other means, or of what force she 
was, we are not informed, having heard nothing from 
Fort Moultrie since the ships have taken their station before the town, at two and a half miles distance. If they can get past the obstructions in the 
mouth of Cooper River, they will enfilade our works, 
and the consequences will be fatal, besides entirely 
cutting off all communication with the country. Our batteries are strong, and the artillery numerous ; but 
it appears to me they will not be so well manned as 
I could wish. Some part of the lines are rather low, 
and I think the men off duty will be much exposed 
when their batteries open. 
</p><p>
Their army crossed the Ashley the 29th of March, 
and the first of this month they broke ground in our front. Their nearest work is upon our right, at six 
hundred yards distance from ours, and they fall off 
from eight and nine, to eleven hundred yards on our left. They have done a good deal of work ; their 
battery upon the Cooper is in the greatest forwardness. It does not appear they can open for several 
days, unless they do it partially, which, I suppose, 
will not be the case. They have been employed, for 
several days and nights, in opening lines of communication between their batteries, which appear in 
great forwardness. Exclusive of these, they have a 
battery upon our left flank at Wappoo Cut, and 
some galleys, brought in by the passage of Stono 
River. These are mounted with thirty-two and twenty-four pounders; but the distance is at least one mile and a quarter from our left, too far to do any 
considerable execution. 
</p><p>
The garrison appears in high spirits, and our arrival seemed to give them fresh confidence. My want 
of experience, in the defence or attack of a place, 
will not enable me to give your Excellency my 
opinion upon the whole of our situation, with any 
degree of precision. 
</p><p>
On our arrival he-re, the officers of the Virginia line, that came out last year, have applied to General Lincoln for a new arrangement of the regiments. 
I cannot, at present, inform your Excellency what will 
be done in it; but I shall oppose any alteration at 
this critical juncture, upon the principle of its doing 
mischief. And, as it was done by authority of the 
Board of War for this expedition, and I have been 
at much pains and infinite fatigue to get them properly organized for service, an alteration at this time 
will occasion much confusion, and make the troops 
of the line much less serviceable in the siege than 
they would be to remain as they are till it is ended, 
at least, or till your Excellency's pleasure, or that of 
the Board of War, is known. 
General Scott is here ; Colonel Buford's battalion 
on its march, but where I cannot inform you ; nor 
can I say any thing, with certainty, about the State 
troops on their march, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Porterfield. I shall think it my duty to take 
every opportunity of writing your Excellency from 
this place; and have to request, that you will be pleased to give my respectful compliments to all the 
General Officers, and the gentlemen of your family, 
and to be assured that I am, with the greatest respect and affection, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,

SIR, 
</p><p>
I have received, with all the gratitude possible, 
the news which your Excellency has been pleased to 
give me of Don Juan.* I begin to flatter myself 
that the cares he has received from you, and from 
all those who surround him, will reestaish him. 
</p><p>
I cannot sufficiently express to you, Sir, my sentiments in this respect, and for the kindnesses, without 
number, which you have heaped upon me during the 
time passed with you. I shall render an account to 
my Court of all that I saw at the army; of the good 
order and discipline of the troops ; of the zeal and 
talents of the officers; of the good disposition reigning among them ; as well as of the respect and public 
confidence in the Commander-in-chief. These circum 
stances united form an augury the most favorable 
for the enterprises which your army may be in condition to undertake, when it shall be completed, in 
consequence of the measures that have been just 
taken. I am certain, beforehand, that his Majesty 
will take a true satisfaction in learning details so interesting to a power so dear to him. 
</p><p>
I dare supplicate your Excellency to receive anew 
the assurances of the sentiments of veneration and 
respect, with which you have inspired me, and with 
which I have the honor to be,

</p><p>
In Congress, <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 4 May, <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>. 
</p><p>
MY DEAR GENERAL, 
We are here in anxious suspense for the fate of 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>. It is not to be wondered at, when 
we consider the greatness of the stake, and the uncertainty and importance of the event. The Gover 
nor, Council, and magistrates have shut themselves 
up in the town, determined to share the glory of 
preserving it, or to perish in the attempt. We understand that this resolution was submitted to with 
reluctance by the principal officers of the army, and, 
in my opinion, it is rather a display of heroism than 
of deliberate policy. The influence of government 
would have been well employed, as far as we can 
judge at so remote a distance, in preparing againsta disaster, and drawing the internal strength of the 
country to some point for its defence. On the present plan, the loss of the whole State seems to be 
harded with the capital. 
</p><p>
We learn from a Mr. Cannon, who left the neighbourhood of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> on the 12th, and parted with 
General Lincoln on the 9th, that the garrison and in 
habitants were greatly elated on the arrival of the 
Virginia line, and in full expectation of success ; and 
it is his opinion, that if the Maryland line were near the scene of action, Sir Henry Clinton would be glad 
to raise the siege. We have endeavoured to learn 
from him the sentiments of General Lincoln on the 
fate of the town ; but it appears that he is as re 
served in his conversation as his letters, though his activity and vigor inspire the highest respect ana 
confidence. These circumstances do not appear in 
any correspondence; and I conclude, though they are 
not very material, you will not think them too trivial 
to be communicated. 
</p><p>
We are exerting every means in our power to expedite the march of the reenforcement destined for 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>. It is committed to the joint efforts of the Board of War and the Treasury, and I hopeevery obstacle is surmounted. I have but one wish 
left, that Virginia may, on so decisive and interesting 
an occasion, be able to detach a body of militia, 
which, in conjunction with the Continental reenforcements, will be sufficient to support the communication 
between the town and country, and harass the besiegers in their rear. The reluctance against the 
southern service, though easy to be accounted for, is 
much to be deplored ; and I reconcile myself to the 
embarrassments which our weakness in that quarter 
super adds to all our other difficulties. 
</p><p>
In spite of the disagreeable aspect of our money 
affairs, I look forward to a happy termination of our arduous conflict. We have not experienced half the 
distresses which, considering the power of our enemies, every contemplative mind must have expected. 
I am, in this view, much engaged in another attempt 
to get the Confederation accomplished, which, in my 
opinion, would fully compensate for the temporary 
loss of any city on the Continent. It gives me great pleasure to assure your Excellency that the Delegates 
from Virginia are warmly disposed to give it all the 
aid in their power ; and they have the fullest expectation that our joint exertions will succeed, and the 
future safety and tranquillity of the States be fixed 
on a permanent basis. Without a federal alliance, 
peace itself, independence, and security from external 
assaults, would scarcely deserve the name of a blessing. The flame of disaffection to the British Administration has, at length, reached the bosom of our enemies. He monstrans and complaints, always terrible to an arbitrary government, cannot fail of producing embarrassment in public councils, or of enfeebling the national exertions. We have a right to 
hope that they will be attended with serious consequences, and put an end to their operations against 
these States. If Britain, unsupported by friends or 
allies, and rent asunder by domestic jars and discon 
tents, can continue an unjust and unpopular war against the joint efforts of America, France, and 
Spain, she will exhibit an example of obstinacy and 
of vigor unparalleled in history. 
</p><p>
To hold a place in your Excellency's confidence 
and friendship, is an honor which I most highly prize, 
and which I shall always regard as one of the most 
happy circumstances of my life ; for no man can be 
more entirely attached to you, by every tie of affection, esteem, and gratitude, than, my dear General, 
Your most obedient and most faithful servant, 
</p><p>
JAMES DUANE. 
</p><p>
P. S. Be pleased to present my most respectful 
compliments to Mrs. <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> and the gentlemen

finance. The Connecticut traders have done them 
selves great honor, as well as the principal farmers. 
The former, in an address to the Assembly, declare 
their readiness to receive the new money at its value 
specified for by congress, in payment for their commodities. <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, I am persuaded, will concur; 
and their example will probably bring all the States

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
The providing the troops, under my command, with 
every necessary for their march, has been attended 
with many difficulties and delays, which it was not 
in my power to remove as soon as I could have 
wished- and, therefore, I was not able to give a 
satisfactory account to your Excellency before now. 
</p><p>
The Board of War have fixed upon <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> as 
the place of rendezvous for the whole. The two brigades embarked at the Head of Elk; the artillery, 
ammunition, and baggage, proceeded by land. I shall 
set out to-morrow morning. I should have done it 
many days ago, had I not been detained by the 
Board of War and of the Treasury. I should have 
been happy to see the Marquis de Lafayette, but 
would not lose a moment in going on. 
</p><p>
From <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, I will write to your Excellency the situation of the troops, the number of recruits 
joined on the march, and the measures I shall take to march with most expedition. I have the honor to be, with great respect,

</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, 17 May, <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
You will have probably heard of the surrender of 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, by the time you will receive this letter. 
I arrived there the 25th of April, at seven o'clock 
in the morning, after having past, during the night, 
in the middle of the enemy, through the woods, with 
the assistance of good guides. I found the town in a 
desperate state, almost entirely invested by the British army and fleet, which had passed the bar, and 
Fort Moultrie. They had surmounted difficulties which 
were generally looked upon as insurmountable, with 
out experiencing scarce any resistance. The enemy 
had brought their trenches, upon the Neck, within 
about one hundred and twenty or one hundred and 
thirty yards from the fortifications; in a word, the 
fall of the town was unavoidable, unless an army 
came to her assistance, which then did not appear likely. 
</p><p>
After having examined the situation of things, I 
thought an evacuation highly advisable, and proposed 
it ; but the Council found an impracticability in the 
measure, although, for my part, it only appeared to 
me difficult and ardous, and such as we ought to 
risk, in our present situation. That plan being rejected, the only object was to protract the term of 
our capitulation. I have done, on my part, every 
thing that was in my power to fulfil that object, in 
the same manner as Colonel Laumoy had, before my 
arrival; but time brought us to close sight of the term of our resistance. 
</p><p>
The enemy succeeded in draining part of our ditch, 
which was in front of our intrenchments, and raised 
new batteries in the third parallel. The day they 
opened them, they sent a flag, with a letter, to summon General Lincoln to surrender. Upon this a 
Council of General and Field-Officers was called; and, 
after having asked whether terms ought to be pro 
posed to the enemy, it was carried in the affirmative, 
by a great majority. I myself was of that number. 
The first proposals were from the enemy. We might 
expect advantageous conditions; I had even some 
hopes that we might have saved the garrison. Be 
sides, a positive refusal to treat with an enemy who, 
within a few days, would have been in a condition 
of giving us the law, appeared imprudent and unseasonable. It was then determined, in Council, that 
propositions should be made; but afterwards, by an 
extraordinary oversight, they left to the General Officers the care of determining whatever might be pro 
posed. 
</p><p>
This is the moment where I left off taking any 
part in what has been done, being of a contrary 
opinion to that of the General Officers. They agreed 
to propose that the Continental troops should be prisoners of war. I opposed that measure with all my 
might, I represented that, if even our situation required it, it was not our business to propose it, and 
that we showed an ignorance of what is practised in 
those cases, which would make us appear in a ridiculous light. I represented that, if I had been of 
opinion with the greatest number to propose terms 
to the enemy, I meant that they should be honor 
able terms, both advantageous to the army and the 
Continent; as, for instance, to surrender the town 
alone, with the artillery, stores, and ships, but to 
save the troops. That, if the army must be prisoners 
of war, it was more eligible to hold out, in order to 
justify such unfavorable conditions, by a longer resistance and a more distressing situation. 
</p><p>
My representations had not the desired effect. The 
propositions were made such as you will see them. 
Fortunately, such as they were, the enemy would not 
grant them, and proposed others less advantageous, 
which General Lincoln did not, however, think proper 
to accept. The truce was broke, and the operations 
of the siege vigorously continued. But the second 
day after, the militia refused to do duty. General 
Lincoln thought from this that the capitulation was 
absolutely necessary, and called the Council, who 
countenanced the measure. For my own part, I 
thought that we ought to try before, to bring the 
militia to their duty by all possible means, by acts 
of authority, and, if necessary, by exemplary punishments. This was likely deemed impracticable, and 
the capitulation took place, to my great regret; not 
that I thought we could have held out longer than 
three or four days, but that time would have put 
the enemy in such a situation as to render a further 
resistance on our part blamable to everybody. Then 
our defence would have done us much more honor. 
It is true that, in that case, the conditions would 
not have likely been the same ; but I was for sacrificing that advantage to a little more glory. 
</p><p>
Fortunately, in all this the honor of the American 
arms is secure, and the enemy have not yet great 
subject to triumph. To remain forty-two days with 
open trenches before a town of an immense extent, 
fortified by sandy intrenchments, raised in two months, 
without covered way, without outworks, open in several places on the water, and exposed everywhere to 
an open attack, and defended by a garrison which 
was not sufficient by half; to remain, I say, forty-two 
days before such a place, and display all the apparel 
of a regular siege, is nothing very glorious. The 
British General has, perhaps, followed the rules of 
prudence in this conduct ; but, at least, the troops 
under his command will never have subject of boasting of their audaciousness and enterprising spirit. 
The American troops, on the contrary, have given 
certain proofs of their firmness in supporting a tremendous fire, and remaining all the while exposed 
to the danger of a surprise and open attacks, of 
which the success was almost certain, if the enemy 
had taken proper measures. I have the honor to be, 
with the greatest respect, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most humble and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
DUPORTAIL.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Yesterday, at five o clock, P. M., I received your Excellency's letter of the 15th, with the inclosed to 
Major-General Heath. As it was of importance he 
should have it as soon as may be, I immediately 
went with it to <a href='/results.php?city=roxbury' rel='city'>Roxbury</a>, and delivered it to him. I 
told him I would assist him in inquiring for information relative to the particulars mentioned in your letter, and, if I should obtain any worth notice, I 
will communicate it to your Excellency .* 
</p><p>
It appears probable the enemy have got information of what is intended; for they know, by a packet 
arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> from England, that a squadron 
of men-of-war, with troops, had sailed from Brest for 
this part of America; and last Thursday a vessel, 
which arrived here on Saturday, saw a number of 
ships standing to the eastward, which the people judged were going to <a href='/results.php?city=halifax' rel='city'>Halifax</a> ; probably the same which, 
on that day, we received intelligence had some days 
before sailed from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> with two thousand troops 
on board. These repeated drafts, one would think, 
must so much weaken <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, as to make it impressible by a force not very large ; so that in such a divided state of their troops, both places may fall 
into our hands, if we spiritedly cooperate with our allies ; which, so far as this State may be concerned, 
I doubt not will be the case, when their arrival is 
known, or rather, when your Excellency shall make 
the requisition. 
</p><p>
I am much obliged for the intelligence concerning 
the state of things at <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>. Our direct intelligence is to the 27th of April, and that on the 22d, 
at night, an attack of the enemy was repelled, with a loss on their part of eight hundred, as appears by 
our last newspapers. What was their real loss, I 
think is uncertain. Fervently wishing their total defeat there, and a successful campaign on our part, I 
have the honor to be, with the most respectful regards, Sir, your Excellency's

<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, 11 June, <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Major Galvan, as recommended by your Excellency, 
was despatched to his station without delay, and has 
been furnished with every thing he desired, as far as 
we were able. The line of expresses formed between 
us, is such as will communicate intelligence from one to the other in twenty-three hours. I have forwarded 
to him information of our disasters in the south, as 
they have come to me. 
</p><p>
Our intelligence from the southward is most lamentably defective. Though <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> has been in 
the hands of the enemy a month, we hear nothing 
of their movements which can be relied on. Rumors 
are, that they are penetrating northward. To remedy 
this defect, I shall immediately establish a line of 
expresses from hence to the neighbourhood of their 
army, and send thither a sensible, judicious person, 
to give us information of their movements. This intelligence will, I hope, be conveyed to us at the rate 
of one hundred and twenty miles in the twenty-four hours. They set out to their stations to-morrow. I 
wish it were possible, that a like speedy line of 
communication could be formed from hence to your Excellency's head-quarters. Perfect and speedy in 
formation of what is passing in the south, might put 
it in your power, perhaps, to frame your measures 
by theirs. 
</p><p>
There is really nothing to oppose the progress of 
the enemy northward but the cautious principles of 
the military art. North Carolina is without arms. 
We do not abound. Those we have are freely imparted to them; but such is the state of their re 
sours, that they have not been able to move a 
single musket from this State to theirs. All the 
wagons we can collect have been furnished to the 
Baron de Kalb, and are assembled for the march of 
twenty-five hundred men, under General Stevens, of 
Culpepper, who will move on the 19th instant. I have 
written to Congress, to hasten supplies of arms and 
military stores for the Southern States, and, particularly, to aid us with cartridge-paper and boxes, the 
want of which articles, small as they are, renders our stores useless. The want of money cramps every 
effort. This will be supplied by the most unpalat 
able of all substitutes, force. Your Excellency will 
readily conceive that, after the loss of one army, our eyes are turned towards the other, and that we comfort ourselves, if any aids can be furnished by you, 
without defeating the operations more beneficial to 
the general Union, they will be furnished. At the 
same time, I am happy to find that the wishes of 
the people go no further, as far as I have an opportunity of learning their sentiments. Could arms be 
furnished, I think this State and North Carolina 
would embody from ten to fifteen thousand militia 
immediately, and more if necessary. 
</p><p>
I hope, ere long, to be able to give you a more 
certain statement of the enemy's as well as our situation, which I shall not fail to do. I inclose you a 
letter from Major Gal van, being the second I have 
forwarded to you. With sentiments of the most perfect esteem and respect, I have the honor to be,

<p>
FROM JOSEPH JONES ; IN CONGRESS. 
</p><p>
19 June, <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have your favor of the 31st ultimo, in answer 
to my several letters ; and was then impressed with, 
and still feel great anxiety on account of, our public 
affairs. The present distress is to he ascribed, in 
great part, to the resolution not to issue any more 
bills of credit before a sufficiency of money is provided, and supplies procured, for the army. Had 
proper precaution been taken in these matters, and 
the new scheme of finance been ready for the public 
consideration, the determination not to increase the 
quantity of money, and the alteration introduced by 
the new system, would not have been so sensibly 
felt, or occasioned the distress, in the several departments, they have produced. From these, I think, we 
are nearly emerging, as the new money is coming 
into use in the several States, and will probably 
greatly relieve us. 
</p><p>
But, by these and several other proceedings, Congress has been gradually surrendering, or throwing 
upon the several States, the exercise of powers they 
should have retained, and, to their utmost, have exercised themselves, until, at length, they have scarce 
a, powder left but such as concerns foreign transactions ; for, as to the army, the Congress is at present 
little more than the medium through which the wants 
of the army are conveyed to the States. This body 
never had, or, at least, in few instances ever exercised, powers adequate to the purposes of war ; and, 
such as they had, have been, from embarrassment 
and difficulties, frittered away to the States ; and it 
will be found, I fear, very difficult to recover them. 
A resolution passed, the other day, desiring the States 
to inform us what they had done upon certain requisitions for some time past, that we might know what 
we had to rely on. This may probably serve as a 
basis for assuming powers, should the answers afford 
an opening. 
</p><p>
Other resolutions are now before us. By one of 
them, the States are desired to give express power 
for calling forth men, provisions, and money, for carrying on the war, for the common defence. Others 
go to the assumption of them immediately. The first, 
I have no doubt, will pass this body, but will, I expect, sleep with the States. The others, I believe, 
will die where they are ; for, so cautious are some 
of offending the States in this respect, a/ / gentleman, 
the other day, plainly told us, upon a proposition to 
order some armed vessels to search the/ vessels going 
out, to prevent the exportation of flour, though, if an 
embargo was laid in the Delaware, as in this State, 
he consented to the measure, otherwise he never 
would agree to such exercise of power. 
</p><p>
The merchant bankers in this city are making 
generous exertions to procure and send forward to 
the army a supply of flour, and will afford us great 
help in that article. The Massachusetts Delegates 
read us letters, whereby it appears their State have 
raised four thousand men for the army, and are em 
bodying four thousand more, to be ready, if wanting. Gates, Weedon, and Morgan, are ordered to the 
Southern department. Five thousand militia are required from Virginia to join that army, and three-thousand to be held in readiness from North Carolina, four thousand, and two thousand to be held in 
readiness. Twenty-five hundred of the Virginia militia were to march yesterday. By our accounts, it 
would seem those States are somewhat roused from 
their slumber, but have rejected the scheme of finance 
of the 18th March last, which, I fear, will have a 
bad effect on the credit of the money of the other 
States that have agreed to the measure. 
</p><p>
Governor Jefferson has transmitted us a state of 
the Virginia troops, taken from the last returns, by 
which it appears we have, in the different corps, four-thousand and eleven men in service to the 30th September, and for the war, or longer period than the 
30th September next, including those captured in 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>. This surprises me. But the fact appears 
to be so ; and where they are, or what is become of 
them, is strange. I cannot inform you whether our Legislature have ordered a draft to fill up the deficiencies, as we have no mail this week from the 
southward, it stopping at <a href='/results.php?city=annapolis' rel='city'>Annapolis</a>, for want of a 
rider to bring it to this place, the late rider having quitted the business. With great esteem, I am, 
dear Sir,

Your obedient, humble servant,

JOSEPH JONES.

FRANK EPPES TO GENERAL LEE.
</p><p>
Kemp's, 31 March, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I congratulate you on your appointment and arrival, and shall 
immediately proceed to execute the commands I had the honor 
to receive this night. At present I can only say, that Lord 
Dunmore's intrenchment is near a quarter of a mile in length, 
running nearly in a straight course from cove to cove, including Tucker's Mills and bake-house, with about two acres of 
land, in which they keep their hospital and exercise the blacks, 
whose number is between two and three hundred. These, together with about forty regulars of the fourteenth regiment, the 
marines of the Liverpool, Otter, and sometimes the Roebuck, 
and the Tory volunteers of Norfolk, who may perhaps amount 
to near a hundred, compose Lord Dunmore's whole force, unless you include the sailors on board a fleet of seventy or eighty 
sail of small vessels, with a few large ones, whose numbers it 
is impossible to ascertain. 
</p><p>
The fleet are furnished with water from the distillery on one side of the river, and Tucker's Mills on the other side; the 
former within two hundred yards of the Dunmore, and in convenient reach from the Otter; and the latter, included within 
the intrenchment, and under the command of the Liverpool and 
Otter, which have stationed themselves in the best manner for 
the protection of it. The ground near it is rather higher than 
the retrenchment, but has no shelter for near a half mile be 
fore you get to it, being an open old field. The depth of the 
ditch, through which the water runs, is above eight feet, the 
width uncertain. 
</p><p>
I cannot, as yet, learn the number of cannon his Lordship has 
mounted, nor how many men constantly reside within their lines. 
They are supplied with many conveniences from Portsmouth, 
and the Western Branch; and, if we had not continued at this 
post, the whole county of Princess Anne would have lain at 
their mercy, and the communication between Carolina arid the 
fleet have been opened, to the very great advantage of the latter. The scouting parties from this place have hitherto effectually prevented on this side of the river, and if the 
same steps had been taken on the other side and on the Western Branch, they would have been reduced to greater distress 
than they are at present. 
</p><p>
By an intrenchment, in the mouths of the cannon at the distillery, we might, perhaps, greatly annoy the enemy for a while, 
but there is no mode of preventing it on the other side of 
the river, without the possession of Tucker's Mills. In short, 
I do not think we can prevent them from watering with the 
force we have here. Besides the Liverpool, King Fisher, Otter, 
and Roebuck ships of war,, there are the Dunmore, the William, the Anna, ships of force, and a great number of armed 
tenders. If a raft could be privately constructed, we might do 
immense mischief to the crowd of vessels lying at Norfolk. 
</p><p>
I shall be able to give you a fuller account upon my re 
turn, which shall be with great expedition. There are many 
valuable effects belonging to the Tory prisoners in this county. 
I should be glad to receive some orders about them. In con 
sequence of a late act of Parliament, upon which the inclosed 
proclamation is founded, Lord Dunmore has seized upon all the 
vessels at Norfolk, whose owners are not on board, and confiscated them to the King's use. There has been a very heavy 
firing yesterday and last night. I dare say above live hundred 
cannon in the Bay, or at sea. From the change of place, there 
seems to have been a smart pursuit. I sent out a party on 
horseback last night, who are not yet returned. 
</p><p>
I am, Sir, very respectfully, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
FRANK EFPES.

FROM GENERAL LEE TO GENERAL ROBERT HOWE, EDENTON, NORTH CAROLINA. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>, 5 April, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>.
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I had the pleasure of receiving yours the day before yesterday, and think myself very much flattered by the good opinion you have conceived of me. I wish you may never have 
reason to think you have formed it without foundation. I should 
have been extremely sorry had you put off your necessary 
jaunt to Carolina merely through attentions to me. Your presence there, at this time, must be of the greatest importance, 
and I fancy it will become every day more important. 
</p><p>
My own situation is extremely disagreeable from an uncertainty of the enemy's designs. I know not where to turn me, 
where to fix myself. I may be in the north, when, as Richard 
says, I should serve my sovereign in the west. I would willingly take a certain step, but, from the excessive prudence and 
economy of this Committee of Safety, am totally unprovided with 
the necessary materials. The distribution of their troops is like 
wise a masterpiece. I wonder they did not carry it still further, and post one or two men, by way of general security, in 
every individual gentleman's house. 
</p><p>
I beg, Sir, should Mr. Clinton land, and attempt to take 
post, that you will immediately inform me, by express, of his 
situation, circumstances, and force, as likewise of the state of 
your troops, regulars, militia, &c., of their numbers and quality, 
of their wants and deficiencies. Any assistance that we can afford yon, you may depend upon. I must apprise you that we 
have little or no cannon, and not a single tool for field works. 
How are you off in the article of intrenching tools? You can 
expect no arms. You will naturally ask what I mean by assistance, with these exceptions. I mean, if the enemy make 
your Province their object, I will immediately march myself, 
with whatever troops can be spared. In the mean time, believe 
me, Sir, to be, with the greatest respect, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
CHARLES LEE.

<p>
THE COMMITTEE OF SAFETY TO GENERAL LEE. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>, 10 April, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 
</p><p>
The Committee of Safety, taking into consideration the state 
of this Colony, and supposing General Lee may wish to be 
fully advised of local circumstances, and with the steps which 
have been taken by the General Convention of this Colony, or 
the Committee of Safety under their appointment, respecting the 
army, have thought proper to represent, that the forces raised 
by the General Convention of Virginia, for the defence of this 
Colony, as well the two old regiments there raised as the seven 
battalions to be raised, were, by an ordinance of the Convention, put under the direction of the Committee ; and this Board 
was directed to provide for them arms, ammunition, tents, bed 
ding, clothing, provisions, and all necessaries, in such manner 
as the circumstances of this country would admit. The clothing is to be paid for by the soldiery ; all the rest to be furnished at the expense of the public. 
</p><p>
By a clause in this ordinance, founded on a hope that the 
whole nine battalions would be taken into Continental pay, it 
is ordained, " That the whole should be under the command 
of one Major-General, and two Brigadier-Generals, to be appointed by Congress, and the field and other officers to be appointed and commissioned by Convention," with a proviso, " That 
all appointments and commissions of Convention should become 
void, when Congress should commission the same officer, or 
appoint another in his stead." The Convention, also, considering the place of attack by the enemy uncertain, and knowing 
the whole coast from Norfolk to <a href='/results.php?city=alexandria' rel='city'>Alexandria</a> on the Potomac 
equally exposed, were pleased to direct the stations of the troops 
as follows ; two regiments on the south side of James River, 
two between York and Rappahannoc Rivers, and two in the 
Northern Neck, with a proviso, " That on any emergency the 
Committee of Safety should have power to call them from those 
stations, but, so soon as the exigency ceased, they should be 
ordered back to their respective stations." 
</p><p>
In pursuance of this command of Convention, this Committee 
directed the rendezvous of the eight battalions (the ninth being raised for the sole defence of the Eastern Shore) at convenient places within the districts described, leaving it to the 
commanding officers of each battalion to station them at any 
place therein they should judge best for the service. And, in 
pursuance of the direction of Convention, this Committee made contracts for victualling these battalions by the ration, at an 
agreed price, to be furnished at the particular stations, and varying in price according to the conveniency of each station. These 
contractors have accordingly laid in provisions, in proportion 
only to the number of troops allotted at such stations, and now 
serve all the troops. The Congress having as yet made no pro 
vision for such purposes. 
</p><p>
The Committee have also purchased clothing and necessaries 
to a very considerable amount, and stored them under the directions of proper persons, as Commissaries of Stores at this 
place and at <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a>, at the head of the Rappahannoc 
River, a place through which all stores from the northward 
must come, central with respect to our back country, whence a 
considerable quantity of linen is expected, and most convenient 
for supplying the two regiments in the Northern Neck, and one on the south side of the Rappahannoc River. Out of these stores 
the whole eight battalions have been indiscrimitely furnished 
with clothing and necessaries ; and even since it has been known 
that six of them have been taken upon the Continental estaishment, the latter have also been paid out of our treasury? 
from necessity, to avoid any uneasiness through the want of a 
Continental fund here. 
</p><p>
This Committee, being advised that General Lee has been pleased to order the four northern battalions to this place, think 
it expedient to lay this short state of matters before him, (wishing to refer him to the ordinance of the Convention for his 
fuller information), with a view of learning from the General 
how far he expects this Board should be assisting in the departments heretofore assigned to this Committee by the Convention, observing that all the contracts for victualling the troops 
must become void, so soon as the troops are finally removed 
from the particular stations. 
</p><p>
And we beg leave farther to observe, that the inhabitants 
of this Colony in general are badly armed, and that those in 
particular in and about the several stations, having spared their 
best arms to the soldiery intended for their immediate protection, will be more exposed than ever, and may be exceedingly 
alarmed, when the troops are called at a great distance from 
them, while the measures of the enemy, or their intended place 
of attack, are altogether unknown. This Committee beg General 
Lee to be assured, that they place entire confidence in his 
great military abilities, and sincerely congratulate the inhabit 
ants of this Colony on his acceptance of the chief command 
here, and will, as far as in their power, confine themselves to 
such a line of conduct as shall not interfere with his better 
judgment ; and therefore will most cheerfully cooperate with 
General Lee in every thing, in which he may think they can 
be of service; and to this end they wish to have a conference 
with General Lee upon the subject-matter of this representation, and upon all other occasions, when he shall judge it necessary.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMMITTEE OF SAFETY. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>, 10 April, <a href='/results.php?year=1770'>1770</a>. 
</p><p>
The Committee, taking under their most serious consideration a letter from Major-General Lee, urging the necessity of removing the inhabitants of Norfolk and Princess Anne counties from 
the neighbourhood of our enemy, together with several letters 
from the Secretary of State, lately intercepted, and other papers ; 
and having been repeatedly informed, upon oath, by every per 
son that has escaped from Lord Dunmore's ships and the fleet at 
Norfolk, that there is a constant intercourse kept up between the 
inhabitants on the Norfolk side, who furnish the enemy with pro 
visions, and give intelligence of all our measures, which conduct 
has likewise been experienced frequently and complained of by 
the foregoing, and many other pregnant proofs, with a full conviction of the inimical disposition of many of the inhabitants in 
the neighbourhood of our enemy; and, convinced that all others 
who may be well disposed, and really attached to the common 
cause, must be exposed to the depredations of the enemy ; 
</p><p>
Do unanimously Resolve and Order, That all the inhabitants 
of Norfolk and Princess Anne counties at present residing between the enemy and our posts at Great Bridge and Kemp's 
Landing, and in a direct line from Kemp's Landing to the ocean, 
be immediately removed to some interior parts of this Colony ; 
and that those who are unable to remove themselves, be assisted 
by the public. And, for the better effecting such removal, it is 
further ordered that all live stock of the said inhabitants be immediately taken possession of by our army, and removed to a 
place of safety for the use of the owners ; and such part thereof 
as the owners may be willing to part with, be purchased by the 
Commissaries for the use of the forces, except where it may 
happen to be the property of such as have already retired to, or 
may hereafter join, Lord Dunmore. 
</p><p>
This Committee, considering the intelligence contained in the 
aforementioned letters from the Secretary of State, and reflecting on the uniform policy of the British Court, and the measures 
lately adopted in North Carolina, are fully convinced that our enemies are solely encouraged to make their wicked attempts 
upon such Colonies wherein they can expect the best assistance 
from the persons disaffected to the American cause ; and are of 
opinion that the most likely means of securing this Colony from 
such attempts, will be to remove all suspicious persons beyond 
the influence of the enemy. This Board do therefore order, that 
all persons within the counties of Norfolk and Princess Anne, 
who have heretofore repaired to Lord Dunmore's standard and 
taken the oath prescribed by him, who thereby may have a reliance on them to aid his measures, do immediately remove them 
selves to some interior parts of this Colony, at least thirty miles 
from the enemy ; and, the better to enforce such removal, it is 
further ordered, that all the male slaves of such suspected per 
sons, above the age of thirteen, and also the like slaves of the 
persons within the limits afore described, be immediately taken 
into the custody and safe-keeping of some officer at our posts in 
Norfolk and Princess Anne, to be conveyed to some place off 
navigation, and to be returned to the owners, after they shall 
have settled at some secure place, upon the further order of this 
Committee. 
</p><p>
Resolved, That a sum of money, not exceeding one thousand 
pounds, be advanced to Willis Reddick, James Murdaugh, and 
Andrew Meade ; and they are hereby empowered and requested 
to make proper provision for these necessary purposes, and, in 
general, to superintend this important business, and be assisting 
in the execution thereof, in the most humane manner the nature 
of the case will admit of. And it is earnestly recommended to 
all persons who can provide habitations for such persons so re 
moving, to give notice thereof in the Virginia Gazette as speedily as possible.

GENERAL LEE TO GENERAL ARMSTRONG. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>, 10 April, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 
</p><p>
It has ever been the opinion of General Lee, that instructions 
to an officer how to act, in a distant command, is impertinence 
and mere pedantry. He desires, therefore, Brigadier-General 
Armstrong to use his own judgment and discretion in his command, lie only requires that, immediately upon his arrival in 
South Carolina, he (General Armstrong) should make out returns 
of the strength, condition, and quality of the different corps, and 
in general of the force of the whole Province ; that he should 
likewise inform himself, not only of the strength of Georgia, but 
of the politics and disposition of the people, and transmit the 
substance of his information on these subjects to General Lee, 
directed to Brigadier-General Howe in North Carolina, who will 
forward them to head-quarters, wherever they happen to be. 
</p><p>
He hopes and recommends it to General Armstrong, that he 
will be jealous of ceding an inch of ground, as in slave countries 
so much depends on opinion, and the opinion -which the slaves 
will entertain of our superiority or inferiority will naturally keep 
pace with our maintaining or giving ground. For these reasons, 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> must be defended with the utmost obstinacy. If the 
enemy appear on the coast of South Carolina, and show an 
intention of lodging themselves in that Province, the Brigadier is 
to send an express immediately to the Major- General, and he is 
to assure the inhabitants, as an encouragement to act with vigor, 
that a strong force shall be immediately marched to their assistance.

GENERAL LEE TO THE COMMITTEE OF SECRECY OF THE PROVINCE OF NORTH CAROLINA. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>, 13 April, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 
</p><p>
GENTLEMEN, 
</p><p>
I had yesterday the honor of yours of the 9th. The real 
ardor and public spirit of your Province, not only reflect great 
honor on its own character, but there is reason to think that 
your example will inspire others with that vigor and decision 
which are alone wanting to insure victory. Your resolution to 
raise a body of light-horse is, in my opinion, most judicious. It 
is a species of troops without which an army is a defective and 
lame machine. I have proposed and urged it in this Province. 
They talk of adopting the measure, but nothing is as yet done. 
I could wish, Gentlemen, that your horses may be of the strongest sort, so that, on pressing occasions, a dragoon may be able 
to carry a foot soldier behind him. 
</p><p>
I am sorry you are so deficient in powder. I have wrote to 
Congress on the occasion, and hope soon to be able to supply 
you. As to arms, I believe it will be impossible to procure 
them, unless you have on the frontiers a sufficient number of 
rifles. For my own part, I like them even better for the batta 
lions than muskets, particularly if you can conciliate your men 
to the use of spears. I never had in my life any opinion of 
bayonets. My opinion may appear singular, but it is certain 
they never have been used, though we hear so frequently of marching with bayonets. For these reasons, I would propose that you 
should collect all the rifles possible. After having regulated the 
necessary business of this Province, I shall pay my respects, in 
person, to your Committee, and thank them, viva voce, for the 
good opinion they are pleased to express of me ; and am, Gentle 
men, your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
CHARLES LEE. 
</p><p>
P. S. It is of the utmost importance that you provide a sufficient number of proper boats for the transportation of troops over 
your respective rivers.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
We think it our duty to inform you that the body of British 
troops, under the command of Cornwallis, supposed to consist of 
three thousand men, are to land at Little River, about thirty miles 
to the south of Cape Fear ; from thence to penetrate by the Lake Wiggaman into the interior parts of this Province, expecting a 
junction with the disaffected inhabitants, Highlanders and Regulators, whose residence and influence are principally in that vicinity. The Regulators and Highlanders, notwithstanding our late success against them, are by no means subdued. Upon the 
least encouragement of receiving support from Governor Martin 
and his expected friends, we doubt not they will again be in 
motion. 
</p><p>
An intestine enemy in our bosom, a large body of British 
troops expected upon our sea-coast, only two regular regiments 
yet embodied for the service of this Colony, our militia diffused 
through a large, extensive Province, and the great difficulty of 
drawing them to act together at a point, with a great scarcity of 
fire-arms, are circumstances which induce us to wish for your presence here immediately, and suggest the necessity of your affording us assistance from the Province of Virginia with all 
possible expedition, as the troops from Britain are every hour expected, and in all probability are now off this coast. Our militia are scarce recovered from the fatigue of their last campaign. 
You may, however, be assured that every thing may be expected 
from them, within their abilities, that the warmest attachment to 
the American cause and true spirit can inspire. Your presence 
would give them great confidence, and have a happy influence 
upon the whole military arrangements of this Colony. We have 
the honor to be, with great respect, Sir,

Your most obedient, humble servant,

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I am at present occupied in clearing the country of the Tories. 
My perplexity with respect to the enemy's real design is, you 
may easily conceive, very considerable, since the overthrow of 
their plans by Colonel Caswell's victory. I cannot persuade my 
self that your Province will be their aim, but rather this or 
South Carolina. I am apt to think that their appearance at 
Cape Fear is rather a feint. However, I may be mistaken. In 
deed, I can alone act from surmise. 
</p><p>
If any further circumstances give you reason to believe that 
they really intend to make an impression in your Province, I 
beg you will inform me of it. You will likewise send me a 
minuie detail of your strength and your weakness, in what you 
are abundant, in what you are deficient. I will myself immediately join you, and bring with me what force you require, and I 
can procure. I am, Sir,

SIR, 
</p><p>
I had the honor of laying your obliging favor of the 4th 
before the Committee of Safety, who are perfectly satisfied of 
your intention not to encroach on the civil authority, but to 
confine your operations to the proper line of military duty, of 
which you are so good a judge. On our parts, we beg leave 
to assure you, Sir, we shall be always ready to give you every 
necessary assistance in our power for accomplishing the great 
purpose we all have in view. When we reflect on the several 
reasons by you assigned for your proceedings at Portsmouth, 
we must approve of the whole of your conduct to those people ; 
it being one of the inevitable consequences of this kind of war, 
that legal modes of inquiry must yield to necessity, and what 
the public safety seems to require should be immediately done, 
even though some injury may arise to innocent individuals, to 
whom the community may render compensation when tranquillity 
is restored. 
</p><p>
On this last consideration, we request you will give directions 
to retain the molasses, salt, and other articles for the use of 
the public, and that, in the inventory thereof to be returned, 
each individual's property may be distinguished, as far as possible ; that, if in any future period they can satisfy the legislature of their innocence (which, however improbable, is yet 
possible), the quantum of their loss may be ascertained. We 
are pleased that you confined the conflagration at present to 
the houses of a few of the most notorious offenders, since, al 
though the reasons you urge appear forcible for the destruction 
of the whole, it may give more general satisfaction to have the 
subject first discussed by the representatives of the people, to 
whom, in their approaching session, we will communicate your favor, and transmit to you their resolution thereupon.

GENERAL LEE TO DANIEL OF ST. THOMAS JENIFER, PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF SAFETY OF MARYLAND. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>, 6 May, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I find that I am extremely censured, not only by your Board, 
but by a multitude of others, for my letter to Mr. Purviance, 
with respect to the seizure of Mr. Eden's person and papers. 
But I really think, when the circumstances are explained, that 
the censure will appear unjust, and that I was neither violent, 
assuming, nor precipitate. 
</p><p>
When the Secretary of State's letter to your Governor was 
put into my hands, I naturally concluded that, could we possess ourselves of all Mr. Eden's papers, the whole machinations 
of the Ministry might be discovered, that this discovery might 
enable us to prevent their effects, and perhaps defeat the whole 
plan. The possession of these papers could not be hoped for 
without previously securing his person, and, to accomplish this, 
the utmost secrecy and expedition were necessary. Now, Sir, 
as I imagined you had no troops at <a href='/results.php?city=annapolis' rel='city'>Annapolis</a> to execute the 
purpose (but in this I find I was mistaken), and as I knew there were troops in readiness at <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>, and as there was 
no Continental General or other officer in Maryland, Mr. Purviance, Chairman of the Committee, on the spot where I had 
conceived troops alone to be stationed, occurred to me as the 
only person to whom I could with propriety and effect make 
application. Had I known, Sir, that a regiment or any troops 
were stationed at <a href='/results.php?city=annapolis' rel='city'>Annapolis</a>, I should undoubtedly have addressed 
myself to you, as President of the Council of Safety. 
</p><p>
It is said, Sir, that Maryland was out of the district of my 
command ; that, consequently, to intrude myself into the business and concerns of that Province was assuming and arrogant. 
I really conceive, Sir, that when the safety or very being of 
the whole community appears at stake, the part I have acted 
in this affair cannot with justice be esteemed arrogance. I did 
not presume authoritatively to order, but, as one servant of the 
public, earnestly to entreat and conjure another servant, who 
alone appeared to me to have the means in his hands, to take a certain step of the last importance to the public cause. I 
must repeat, Sir, that my reason for addressing myself to Mr. 
Purviance at <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>, proceeded entirely from my ignorance 
of there being any troops at <a href='/results.php?city=annapolis' rel='city'>Annapolis</a>, and not (as I have 
been told has been thrown out) from any diffidence in your virtue and decision. I suppose the Committee of Safety here 
viewed it in the same light, for I read my letter to them, and 
it was approved of. 
</p><p>
In times like these, Sir, I conceive, that when we have received sufficient evidences of any treasonable practices being 
carried on, and that when it appears to us that the immediate seizure of a particular traitor's person may lead to discoveries on which the salvation of the State may depend, and 
when the utmost secrecy and expedition are necessary to the 
seizure of his person, it is the duty of a good citizen not to 
delay a single instant, if a single instant's delay may prevent 
the execution. This was the manner I thought it my duty to 
proceed in, in the case of Mr. "Wbrmeley. On the discovery of 
his correspondence with the enemy, I gave orders for the security of his person and papers, and then referred the affair to 
the proper tribunal, the Committee of Safety; the measure was 
so far from giving umbrage, or creating jealousy, that it met 
with their unanimous approbation. If this method is proscribed, 
at a juncture like the present, the great check on dangerous 
correspondence and conspiracies will be taken off. If councils 
are to be held previously to the seizure of any traitor's per 
son or papers, notwithstanding the strongest evidences against 
him, I am much mistaken if every traitor does not slip through 
your hands. 
</p><p>
I must now, Sir, conclude with assuring you, and the respectable body over which you preside, that, if they suppose 
me capable of aiming or wishing to extend the military authority, or trespass on the civil, they do me the most cruel in 
justice. Although I was bred in the army, I thank God the 
spirit and principles of the citizen were ever predominant; and 
I solemnly declare that, if I thought it possible I should ever 
be so far intoxicated by military command, as to harbour a wish 
injurious to the civil supremacy in all thing.-, I would now, 
whilst I retain my senses, beg leave to divest myself of my 
present office, and serve as a volunteer in the glorious cause 
in which I have embarked my person, fortune, and reputation. 
What I did in this affair, I did in the character of a common, zealous member of the community, not of an officer; what 
appeared irregular or offensive in the mode, I hope I have, 
explained to your satisfaction ; and I entreat, that it may be 
entirely attributed to a mistake, for which I am heartily concerned, as it has prejudiced me in the opinions of men whose esteem I am most ambitious of obtaining.

I am, &c.,

<a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>, 7 May, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I find the part I have acted in the business of Mr. Eden 
has given great umbrage to the Council of Maryland. I take 
the liberty of inclosing to you a copy of my letter to that 
Board on the occasion, as I hope it will appear to the Congress a fall explanation and justification of my conduct. I shall 
not trouble them any more on the subject. 
</p><p>
Five transports with troops are arrived at Cape Fear. I shall therefore set out on Thursday for <a href='/results.php?city=wilmington' rel='city'>Wilmington</a>, by the way of 
<a href='/results.php?city=halifax' rel='city'>Halifax</a>. When we consider, Sir, the vast extent of the vulner 
able parts of this country, the numerous navigable intersecting 
waters, the multitude of slaves, that we have not more than 
five thousand regulars fit for duty in the Province, that of these 
five thousand not more than three are properly armed, that to 
arm them (defectively as they are) the Province has been drove 
to the necessity of disarming the minute-men ; I say, Sir, when 
these circumstances are considered, I shall appear, I hope, reason 
able in entreating the Congress to spare us, if possible, some 
battalions, and of those battalions which are best armed. If 
indeed our minute-men were properly furnished with muskets and 
ammunition, if our rivers were already secured in the manner 
I propose, I should think myself capable of baffling all their 
attempts with our present force ; but, situated as we are, my 
anxiety for the common safety obliges me to solicit a reinforcement. 
</p><p>
A letter from one of your members informs me, that five 
thousand blankets and five thousand pair of shoes are on the 
road for the use of this army. They are much wanted. The 
number is. I believe, sufficient. We are, as I observed before, 
wretchedly in want of medicines, as well as of a director to 
our hospital. Dr. McClurg is a very able man, and univer 
sally esteemed qualified for the office. The pay of the regimental Surgeons, established by Congress, is so low that it is, 
in this part of the world (where the common country practice 
of surgery is singularly lucrative) impossible to find capable 
men who will accept. But I am in hopes that the Convention will make such additions, out of the provincial purse, as 
to enable us to fill the commissions with proper and competent 
persons. 
</p><p>
Now I am on the subject of pay, Sir, I must beg leave to 
urge the necessity of considerably increasing that of the Engineers. It is impossible that men qualified for this important 
office should be prevailed upon to serve on such miserable terms. You have no American Engineers. They must, of course, 
be foreigners, and foreigners expect, in their language de quoi 
manger ; that is, something which will enable them to eat and 
drink. Twenty dollars a month will not enable them to eat, 
drink, and wear linen, or indeed any kind of clothes. Besides, 
it must be considered that these gentlemen are obliged, by the 
nature of their duty, to make more journeys than other officers, 
that horses must be purchased and fed. that the expenses of 
travelling are, in these southern provinces, very high. For these 
reasons, and many others, the pay of Engineers ought to be, as 
it is in all other services, greater than that of other officers. 
Upon the whole, Sir, I really do not think that they ought or 
can do with less than forty dollars per month, and rations at 
least for their horses. On more moderate terms I am persuaded you cannot procure men equal to the task, as the corps 
is distinct, and not numerous. This necessary addition of pay 
will be an expense beneath the consideration of the Congress. 
</p><p>
Colonel Richard Henry Lee informs me, that it was not the 
intention of the Congress that Captain Innes's company should 
be reduced to make way for Arundel's, but that they should both 
be established. I think, Sir, it would be a useless expense. 
Captain Innes, who must, I am sure, be an excellent officer 
in any other department, professed himself ignorant iu this 
branch ; his officers were equally ignorant. Arundel has got 
possession of the company, and, by his activity and knowledge, 
will, I am persuaded, make them fit for service. Indeed, to establish an artillery company, Captain, subalterns, and non 
commissioned officers being entirely composed of novices, can answer no end or purpose. It is my opinion, therefore, that, in 
stead of these two companies proposed, the addition of thirty 
or forty men to Captain Arundel's, and two subaltern officers, 
Avill not only be better, but that it promises more advantage 
to the service. 
</p><p>
Now I am on the subject of Captain Arundel, I beg leave 
to remind the Congress of what I mentioned with respect to 
his expenses on the road. There is one circumstance, of which 
I could wish to be ascertained. Is the expense of the defence 
of these rivers, that is, the construction of row-galleys, floating batteries, tenders, &c., to be brought to the account of the Continent or of the Province ? I wish to be ascertained on this 
head, because, if it is at the expense of the latter, I shall 
regularly propose to the Convention or Committee of Safety 
every scheme, which may be attended with expense, before it 
is entered upon. If the Quartermaster-General, or his depu 
ties, when they despatch any teams from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> with 
powder or other necessaries, were to purchase the horses through 
out for the Continental use, instead of hiring them, the saving 
would be considerable, for, in this country, the hire is intolerably dear, so great indeed, that I have ventured to order a 
number of teams to be purchased. 
</p><p>
I have just received a vague return of the forces of North 
Carolina, of their powder and cannon. It does not appear that 
they have, of effective regulars, properly armed, more than two 
thousand; of powder, more than two tons and a half; and, as 
to cannon, they are almost totally destitute. As the enemy's 
advanced guard, if I may so express myself, is actually arrived, 
I must, I cannot avoid detaching the strongest battalion we have 
to their assistance ; but I own I tremble, at the same time, at 
the thoughts of stripping this Province of any part of its in 
adequate force. I am puzzled to know how to direct my motions, from the uncertainty of the enemy's plan, but not dispirited, as I am confident that the Congress will afford me 
every relief in their power, and am not in the least diffident 
of the courage and zeal of the men and officers. I am, &c. 
</p><p>
CHARLES LEE. 
P. S. I have, as yet, heard nothing of Mr. Stabler, the En 
gineer. I ought, in fact, to have at least half a dozen, for we 
have a variety of posts to throw up, and there is not a man 
or officer in the army that knows the difference betwixt a 
chevaux-de-frise and a cabbage garden. I wish the Congress 
would indulge me with Mr. Smith, whom I know to be an 
able and active man. Massenbourg is a treasure. A little hurt 
in my hand obliges me to write by the pen of my secretary.

GENERAL LEE TO EDMUND PENDLETON, PRESIDENT OP THE CONVENTION OF VIRGINIA. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>, 9 May, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
As I am obliged, by the arrival of the enemy, to repair to 
North Carolina, and am not less prompted by my zeal and affection for this Province, than obliged by my duty, to take every 
precaution for its safety before my departure ; on this principle, 
I beg leave to lay before the Convention the following measures, 
which I conceive to be necessary. 
</p><p>
1st. To devise some means for establishing a corps of cavalry ; without which, an army is so extremely defective in every 
part of the world, and in none more than in this, for reasons 
which it might be tedious to enumerate. 
</p><p>
2dly. Without delay to order some able pilots of every river 
to examine accurately the narrowest part of the channel of each 
river; what is the nature of the shoals which form these channels ; whether they are solid, firm sand, gravel, or rock ; what is 
the distance of the nearest part of the channel from either shore ; 
what is the nature of the shore, whether it is high or low ; for I 
am sanguine enough to hope, when these circumstances are ascertained, the navigation of most of the rivers may be shut up to 
the enemy, by means of batteries, either floating or fixed. 
</p><p>
Sdly. As these purposes cannot be effected without a large 
body of carpenters, smiths, and artificers of every sort, to establish some companies of them, subject to the military laws; for, 
without a coercive power, it is difficult, in this part of the world, 
to prevail on them to work. 
</p><p>
4thly. As I understand there are prodigious flocks of sheep 
and cattle on the islands near the Eastern Shore, and as my 
authority does not extend to whatever concerns property, that, 
you will order immediately all this stock to be transported to 
the continent; and, if this is impracticable, to kill them, as 
otherwise they must indisputably fall into the hands of the enemy. 
</p><p>
5thly. As the eastern counties are, from their great abundance of all the necessaries of life, so tempting objects to the 
incursions of the enemy, and as I understand there will be no 
difficulty in procuring good men, I would humbly propose to the 
Convention to augment Colonel Fleming's regiment to the same 
strength of numbers with the other battalions. 
</p><p>
I must now, Sir, beg leave to mention to the gentlemen of 
the Convention a very important matter of consideration ; no less 
than the preservation of the lives of your soldiers. The Continental allowance to Surgeons and Surgeons Mates of the regiments is so miserably small, and at the same time the common 
country practice of surgeons is so very lucrative in this Province, 
that it is not possible to find men, qualified for the station, who 
will accept; and, as I cannot venture to propose to the Continental Congress the increase of the pay of the Surgeons of the 
whole army, merely because this increase is necessary in my 
division, I must submit it to the judgment of the Convention, 
whether such an addition as to bring up the pay of these gentlemen to the original Provincial ordinance, will not be money 
well and necessarily expended. 
</p><p>
I am, Sir, with the greatest respect, yours, 
</p><p>
CHARLES LEE.

<a href='/results.php?city=wilmington' rel='city'>Wilmington</a>, 1 June, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
The whole enemy's fleet have sailed from Cape Fear, the first 
division on Wednesday, the last yesterday ; but it is far from 
being ascertained whether they have steered their course to the 
northward or to the southward. The people here are all of 
opinion that <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> is their object. For my own part, I do 
not see on what they ground this persuasion. However, as South 
Carolina is weaker in numbers than Virginia, I have ordered 
Muhlenberg's regiment, at a venture, to <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> immediately ; 
as also a detachment of seven hundred men from this place. I 
have been also under the necessity of stripping this Province of 
sixteen hundred pounds of gunpowder, which I must replace from 
Virginia. 
</p><p>
As this Colony is now apparently no longer in danger, I shall 
send an express to stop your militia, as they may be wanted 
more in their own Province, and will now be an unnecessary 
expense. I shall myself set out for <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> to-morrow, but at 
the same time confess, I know not whether I shall go to or from 
the enemy ; but if that capital is really their object, their whole 
force will be collected in one point, their operations will be 
more regular, and, consequently, my presence, as Commander-in-chief of the district, more requisite ; whereas, if Virginia is their 
object, it is possible and probable their operations may be merely 
predatory and piratical. If such are their intentions, I am 
confident that your own officers will have little or no occasion 
for the advice or assistance (such as they are) of, Sir, &c., 
</p><p>
CHARLES LEE. 
</p><p>
P. S. As I have not much time, and indeed there being no 
absolute necessity of troubling the Congress with any circum 
stances farther than expressed in this letter, I must entreat, Sir, 
that you will send a copy of it to the Congress.

</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, 21 June, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
It is a certain truth, that the enemy entertain a most fortunate 
apprehension of American riflemen. It is equally certain, that 
nothing can contribute to diminish this apprehension so infallibly, 
as a frequent ineffectual fire. It is with some concern, therefore, 
that I am informed that your men have been suffered to fire at a most preposterous distance. Upon this principle, I must entreat 
and insist that you consider it as a standing order, that not a 
man under your command is to fire at a greater distance than 
an hundred and fifty yards, at the utmost ; in short, that they 
never fire without almost a moral certainty of hitting their object. 
Distant firing has a double bad effect; it encourages the enemy, 
and adds to the pernicious persuasion of the American soldiers, 
namely, that they are no match for their antagonists at close 
fighting. To speak plainly, it is almost a sure method of making 
them cowards. 
</p><p>
Once more, I must request that a stop be put to this childish, 
vicious, and scandalous practice. I extend the rule to those who 
have the care of the field-pies. Four hundred yards is the 
greatest distance they should be allowed to fire at. Transgression 
of this rule will be considered as the effect of flurry and want 
of courage. Those who are accused of transgressing will be proceeded against, as acting from these principles. I have, Sir, the 
greatest opinion of your good sense and spirit, and flatter myself 
that you will not only issue orders of restriction on this head, 
but that you will be attentive that they are vigorously put in 
execution ; and am, Sir, &c., 
</p><p>
CHARLES LEE. 
</p><p>
P. S. I am likewise informed that your men pass, without 
order or orders, to Long Island. Is this wise? Is it soldier 
like? Is it to show the enemy where our weakness is?

<p>
GENERAL LEE TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, 2 July, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I should have done myself the honor sooner of informing the 
Congress of the attack made by the enemy's squadron on Sullivan's Island, and their repulse, but conjectured that, by waiting a day or two, I might probably be furnished with the means of 
sending a more minute, full, and satisfactory account. My conjecture was right ; for, yesterday, five seamen made their escape, 
one of whom is a more intelligent fellow than commonly found 
amongst men of his level. Inclosed is a copy of their narrative. 
Some parts of it are, perhaps, too whimsical and trivial to merit 
the attention of Congress ; but I think it my duty to present it 
as it is, without adding or curtailing a circumstance. I think, 
Sir, I may venture to congratulate the Congress on the event. 
Not only the advantages must be considerable, but the affair reflects no small credit on the American arms. 
</p><p>
On Friday, about eleven o clock, the Commodore, with his 
whole squadron, consisting of two line of battle ships and six frigates (the rates of which are marked in the inclosed narrative) 
anchored at less than half musket-shot from the fort, and commenced one of the most furious and incessant fires I ever saw 
or heard. It was manifestly their plan to land at the same time 
their whole regulars at the east end of the Island, and of course 
invest the fort by land and sea. As the garrison was composed 
entirely of raw troops, both men and officers, as I knew their 
ammunition was short, and as the bridge by which we could 
reenforce or call off the troops from the Island was unfinished, 
you may easily conceive my anxiety. It was so great, that I 
was in suspense whether I should evacuate it or no. Fortutely, whilst I was in this state of suspense, some ammunition arrived from the town ; and my Aid-de-camp, Mr. Boyd, returning 
from the Island with a flattering report of the garrison's spirits, 
I determined to support it at all hards. 
</p><p>
On this principle, I thought it my duty to cross over to the 
Island, to encourage the garrison by my presence ; but I might 
have saved myself that trouble, for I found, on my arrival, they 
had no occasion for any sort of encouragement. I found them 
determined and cool, to the last degree. Their behaviour would, 
in fact, have done honor to the oldest troops. I beg leave, there 
fore, to recommend, in the strongest terms, to the Congress, the 
commanding officer, Colonel Moultrie, and his whole garrison, as 
brave soldiers and excellent citizens; nor must I omit, at the 
same time, mentioning Colonel Thompson, who, with the South 
Carolina rangers and a detachment of the North Carolina regu 
lars, repulsed the enemy in two several attempts to make a lodgment at the other extremity of the Island. 
</p><p>
Our loss, considering the heat and duration of the fire, was in 
considerable. We had only ten men killed on the spot, and 
twenty-two wounded, seven of whom lost their limbs ; but, with 
their limbs, they did not lose their spirits, for they enthusiastically encouraged their comrades never to abandon the standard 
of liberty and their country. This, I do assure you, Sir, is not 
in the style of gasconading romance, usual after every successful 
action, but literally fact. I with pleasure mention the circum 
stance, as it augurs well to. the cause of freedom. At eleven the 
fire ceased, having continued just twelve hours, without the least 
intermission. 
</p><p>
What the enemy's intentions are now, it is impossible to 
divine. I am inclined to think they will (if they can repass the 
bar) bend their course to the Chesapeake or Hampton Bay. Per 
haps shame and rage may prompt their land forces to some 
attempt before their departure. On my part, I shall spare no 
pains to discover their intentions and to baffle their schemes. 
</p><p>
As Georgia is a district of the command with which you have 
honored me, I thought it prudent to request some of their members to a conference with the President of this Province and 
myself. They accepted the invitation, and gave us great satisfaction from their intelligence and good sense. Inclosed is the sub 
stance of their deliberation. 
</p><p>
The Province is certainly of the last importance to the common cause ; and the mode of protecting it, pointed out by these 
gentlemen, is, in my opinion, in all its parts, wise and necessary. 
They had conceived a notion that I had powers to augment their establishment. I assured them I had no such powers, but both 
Mr. Rutledge and myself gave it as our opinion that any expenses, manifestly beyond their faculties, which they might incur in the common cause, would be repaid by the Congress ; and, in 
this persuasion, we ventured to encourage them to augment their 
cavalry, without loss of time, and make the proposed present of 
cattle to the Indians. Indeed, Sir, without a strong corps of 
cavalry, I do not see how it is possible to protect these Southern 
Colonies ; and with one thousand good cavalry, I think I could 
insure their protection. From the want of this species of troops, 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> and its dependencies had certainly been lost, if the 
enemy had acted with the vigor and expedition we had reason to 
expect; but a most unaccountable languor and inertness on their 
part have saved us. 
</p><p>
If the scheme I proposed in Virginia had been approved and 
adopted, it would have been not only a security, but considerable 
economy. The forage was to have been the only expense. Now 
I am upon the subject, I cannot help mentioning, that I have 
been informed that the project has been considered by some gentlemen as a sort of presumption in me in arrogating such a 
power; but I fancy the affair was not properly understood. I 
saw the immediate necessity of such a corps. I knew they could 
be raised immediately by these means, and at the same time I 
was given to understand, by several gentlemen of the Virginia 
Convention, that, should the Continental Congress disapprove of 
the expense (trifling as it was), there was little doubt of their 
Convention defraying it. But, in fact, the measure seemed necessary for the salvation of the Provinces, and not a day was to be 
lost, which I hope will fully justify my conduct; and I must 
beg leave to repeat my assertion, that, without cavalry, these 
Provinces cannot easily be defended. I wish some means could 
be devised of reducing East Florida to an American Province ; 
had I force sufficient, I should, with your permission, certainly 
attempt it. The advantages would be great and manifold. The 
augmentation of the Georgian cavalry I sincerely hope may be 
approved of by the Congress. Inclosed is the establishment and 
pay proposed for them. 
</p><p>
I think the terms not high. I shall now, Sir, conclude with expressing the high satisfaction I have received from the zeal, 
activity, and public spirit of the gentlemen and inhabitants of this 
city and Province, from the President and Council down to the 
lowest order of the people ; and with assuring you, that I have 
not, in my military capacity, met with the least obstruction or 
difficulty; but that we have all worked, in concert and harmony, 
for the common good. I most earnestly request you will pay 
my respects to the Congress, and be persuaded, Sir, that I am, 
most entirely and devotedly, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
CHARLES LEE. 
</p><p>
P. S. The Georgia troopers have, according to the establishment of their Congress, fifty shillings sterling a man, and rations 
for themselves, but find arms, horses, and forage. The Captain's 
pay is ten pounds sterling per month ; the Lieutenants , six 
pounds ; the Quarter-master's, four pounds. 
</p><p>
Lord Dunmore has, I believe, at present with him only one ship of war. If any part of the Continental fleet should happen 
to visit Hampton Bay, at this juncture, it would defeat the whole 
scheme of the enemy's operations, at least for this campaign. 
But it is impossible to say how long his Lordship -may remain 
in this weak condition.

SIR, 
</p><p>
A certain Walker was, by a most whimsical concurrence of wind and tide, hurried into the midst of our sentinels at the end 
of Sullivan's Island. He says he is master of a brig transport, 
and has the principal property in the vessel. As the man would 
probably be ruined by this odd accident, Mr. Rutledge, President, 
of the Province, and myself, would propose to you an exchange 
of this Walker for Ethan Allen ; or, if he is not at present in 
your fleet or army, for any two of the Connecticut privates who 
were taken prisoners with Allen. I confess honestly to you, Sir, 
that I am extremely desirous of redeeming Allen and his whole 
party. You, I am sure, are liberal enough to compassionate the 
sufferings of those who think, at least, they are engaged in a 
righteous cause. In this persuasion, I propose to you an ex 
change, man for man, of these people with the soldiers of the 
fourteenth, who were taken prisoners at the Great Bridge, in Virgina. If, therefore, any of his party are at present in your custody, you will oblige me much in releasing them. I pledge my 
word and honor that an equal number of the fourteenth shall be 
sent from the place of their confinement to Lord Dunmore's 
camp, or wherever you think proper. 
</p><p>
I take the liberty to request you will accept of a small quantity of fruit and vegetables, which, perhaps, in your situation, are 
not easily procured. This, I hope, you will consider as a testimony of the regard I have for your personal qualities. The 
President joins with me in a high opinion of Mr. Clinton.

I have, I am told, an intimate friend and comrade in your corps, Captain Primrose Kennedy, of the forty-fourth. I entreat 
you will assure him of my love and friendship, and send him a

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
When I requested you to collect a number of boats for the 
transportation of troops to the Island, it was my intention to 
transport the greatest force I could possibly muster, to take the 
command in person, and endeavour to bring the enemy to a battle. Had we been victorious, there would have been an end of 
all their southern operations ; had we been defeated, it is true 
the loss would have been great, but not irreparable. Upon the 
whole, balancing the important consequences of victory, and the 
disadvantages of a defeat, I should have been justifiable in risking a general action ; but the number of boats collected would 
never have answered this purpose. They would contain, at the 
utmost, only twelve hundred men ; a body too small to be detached on such an errand. In fact, islands present such manifold 
advantages to the enemy over us, that we must never venture 
on them without an assurance or great probability of a complete 
victory ; because, if defeated, we have no possibility of retreat. 
</p><p>
As the post on Long Island, and all schemes of attack, are 
now ended, I may mention these things to explain the motives 
of my putting you to the trouble of collecting the boats ; the 
whole may be now undoubtedly returned. Captain tells 
</p><p>
me that, in this fleet of craft, there is one wooden boat, belonging to Major Caper?, which might, with little alteration, be converted into an excellent galley. As we all agree a fleet of galleys may be of the greatest use, and that it should be established without loss of time, I should think that every boat which, 
with little trouble, can be thrown into that form, ought to be 
purchased. I am, &c.,

P. S. I wish you would turn your thoughts to the defence of 
Georgia, and what regiment can best be spared from your Pro 
vince for that purpose.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I think it my duty to apprise you that the enemy's fleet and 
army are now, in all human probability, on their departure from 
this coast ; their troops are all reembarked ; the Commodore's ship 
and the Solebay have repassed the bar ; the Experiment and five 
other ships alone remain on this side, but are preparing to pass 
the next tide. It is impossible to say where they will bend their 
course, but I am myself inclined to think Virginia will be the 
scene of their operations. The deserters, indeed, assert, that it is 
their intention to proceed to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> ; but it appears to me, 
from Lord George Germain's intercepted letter, that General 
Clinton is restricted to these southern Colonies. Perhaps they 
may try Georgia, the weakness of which Colony, and the expectation of a powerful cooperation on the part of their Indian 
allies, may allure them; but, on the other hand, the distressed 
situation of their fleet and army, from the want of good water, 
fresh provisions, and vegetables, will make the temptation of the 
table which Lord Dunmore, I understand, has spread for them 
on Gwyn's Island, irresistible. Upon the whole, I must repeat 
that I am persuaded Virginia will be their object. I hope and 
make no doubt, Sir, that you will be prepared for their reception. 
I think it necessary, for the common service, to inform you 
that a corps of at least fifteen hundred men will be assembled 
on the Cherokee line in less than three weeks from the present 
date. This number is supposed to be adequate to the end pro 
posed; that is, the destruction of the crops of the Lower Nation, 
and of course striking a necessary terror into the minds of the 
other nations. I mention this, as I apprehend the expedition projected against the Overhill Cherokees, from your Province, may 
have some dependence on the measures of the Carolinas against 
the Lower Nation. But although, being ignorant of the geography and circumstances of the country, I speak in the dark with 
regard to the relation which one expedition may have with the 
other, the informing you of the number of the Carolina corps, 
and the time they may be expected to enter the enemy's country, can be of no less service. As soon as I can be ascertained 
of the enemy's designs, I shall set out for the point of action, in 
hopes to render all the service in my power to the place at 
tacked, as well as the common cause.

I am, Sir, with the greatest respect,

CHARLES LEE.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I wrote you on the 30th ultimo, advising you of the approach 
of the enemy. On the 1st instant the second division of their 
army arrived, in forty bateaux, about twenty men in each, and 
landed on the eastern shore of the Lake, opposite the Three-Mile 
Point. Yesterday they received a third reinforcement, in sixty 
bateaux. They have done little yet of any consequence, but continue playing their old game with the savages. Yesterday, in the 
afternoon, a party of these, with some Canadians and a few regu 
lars, in the whole about two hundred and fifty, under the command of Captain Frazer, of the forty-seventh, attacked our picket 
guard of fifty men, and drove them in ; then advanced, and for a 
short time kept up a scattering fire on the French lines. Our troops behaved with great coolness and resolution, and, after a 
few shots, made them retire to the woods. The loss the enemy 
sustained in this little brush is uncertain. We had one Lieu 
tenant and five privates killed, and a Lieutenant and seven men 
wounded. These skirmishes are of infinite service to our troops, 
who are in general raw and undisciplined. They serve as preparatives to an action of the last importance, which we have rea 
son hourly to expect. 
</p><p>
Two Hessians have deserted to us, both very intelligent fel 
lows. They agree that Burgoyne commands the army, and, under 
him, General Riedesel the German forces. Carleton has staid 
behind as Governor of Quebec and General of the troops in Canada. They have brought all the Hessians with them ; in the 
whole, seven regiments and one battalion, besides four companies 
of dragoons. Their regiments consist in general of six hundred 
men. Their dragoons are not mounted, but come in expectation 
of getting horse at this place. Their supply of provisions is very 
short, from which it appears they mean a coup de main, and not a siege. 
</p><p>
We are daily receiving additions to our strength. Colonel 
Warner is expected to-day with six hundred Green Mountain 
Boys. We also hourly look for General Schuyler, with a large 
body of militia from below. The spirits of our men were much 
raised yesterday with an account of a signal victory gained by 
General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> over the enemy. We fired thirteen guns asa feu de joie on the occasion, just as we perceived a reenforcement of the enemy coming up. 
</p><p>
To-morrow we shall give them a salute of the same kind, being the anniversary of the ever-memorable 4th of July, 177G, on 
which day we broke off all connection with slavery, and became 
the free and independent States of America. 
</p><p>
In a letter of the 26th ultimo, I told you of my being a 
patient in the General Hospital. I have now the pleasure to in 
form you my complaint is removed, and my health perfectly 
restored. In the absence of General Schuyler, I have the honor 
of acting as Aid-de-camp to General St. Clair. You know his 
abilities too well to be informed of them by me. He is cool and 
determined, ever vigilant, and unruffled by every appearance of 
danger. I flatter myself with the hopes of announcing to you, in a few days, the welcome news of the total defeat of the enemy. 
I am, dear Sir, with every sentiment of esteem and affection, 
Yours, sincerely,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
My last was on the 12th. In that I acquainted you with the 
evacuation of <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, and the consequences resulting there 
from. I have the pleasure now to inform you that General St. 
Clair has joined us with his army. General Nixon's brigade is 
also arrived. Our force now, in Continental troops, is two thou 
sand five hundred. The militia are about two thousand. With 
these is an army of six thousand regular disciplined troops to be 
opposed. The probability of success, under these circumstances, 
I leave you to judge of. A stand is to be made about three miles below this, at a place called Moses Creek, there being some 
advantageous heights to fortify. For my own part, I trust more 
to the woods for security than any fortresses we can raise. The 
enemy scarcely ever attack us in our works. "When they do, they 
generally succeed. 
</p><p>
General Burgoyne, finding it almost impracticable to come by 
Wood Creek (the passage of which we had obstructed by felling 
trees into it), has returned to <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, in order to come by 
the way of Fort George. For this purpose they are carrying their 
bateauxs from Lake Champlain into Lake George. We have 
been so fortunate as to get off all our stores from Fort George, 
which were very considerable ; and yesterday the garrison left it, 
after setting fire to the Fort, Hospital, Barracks, and other buildings. In removing our stores we left only two wagons, which 
were cut off by a scout of Indians. 
</p><p>
We have no news from the westward, since my last. General 
Johnson has called a meeting of Indians, with intent, no doubt, to 
persuade those who are our friends to remain neutral, and permit him to pass through their country. General Burgoyne, on 
the back of his proclamation, has sent a summons to the people 
of the Grants to meet Governor Skene at Castleton, to be there 
acquainted with the terms on which they are to hold their property ; and threatening with immediate death all who refuse their 
attendance. General Schuyler has sent them an address in answer to this. Copies of both, and also of the proclamation, I will 
send you as soon as I can find time to make them out. They 
begin to dispense their protections in great numbers. Those who 
take them, and are discovered, we send immediately to jail. I 
shall be punctual in transmitting you every intelligence of consequence, and shall be happy in hearing from you in return. 
I am your affectionate son,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Inclosed you will receive copies of Mr. Burgoyne's proclamation, his summons to the people of the Grants, and General 
Schuyler's answer thereto. Few occurrences of moment have 
transpired since my last of the 17th. Yesterday we received a 
flag from Skenesborough, by which Mr. Burgoyne was so polite 
as to return General Poor's baggage, and send home a prisoner 
or two on parole. The flag brought a letter from Colonel Skene to General Schuyler, desiring a personal conference with him on 
public affairs. The General, in answer, told him he could not 
open a correspondence in a public character with him while his 
superior officer commanded at Skenesborough ; that he should 
always be willing to receive flags from General Burgoyne, or the 
officer commanding any detachment of the army ; and that, if 
they were desirous of a conference, they should appoint an officer to hold it, and he would send one of equal rank on his side to 
meet him. 
</p><p>
An Indian scout of ours returned this morning, and brought 
with them five prisoners. The enemy, not knowing we had Indians in our service, were decoyed, thinking them their own. 
The prisoners were taken near Skenesborough. They inform 
that the enemy are cutting a road to Fort Anne to bring up 
their cannon, and mean an attack on this place. I fancy they 
will find the game gone, it being the General's intention to move 
to a place five miles below this. Our strength is considerably 
reduced since my last, a great part of the militia being dismissed 
to reap their harvests. They were a most disorderly set, and 
deserted by whole companies. 
</p><p>
Sir John has done little at the westward. Some of his savages scalped a Captain and killed a few men belonging to Gansevoort's regiment, at Fort Schuyler. I shall be happy in receiving a letter from you.

Major "Wait, who was sent to take possession of Mount Independence, found nothing of consequence, excepting several boats

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO GENERAL WASHINGTON. 
</p><p>
Manor of Livingston, 14 January, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I was honored with your Excellency's favor of the 27th of 
December, and am greatly obliged by your favorable mention 
of my brother. In my recommendation of him, I was influenced 
more by my hope of rendering him further useful to his country, than by any partial desire of serving him, without having 
the most distant wish of engaging your Excellency in any promise 
that might lead to a preference, to which he is not justly entitled, 
since neither his interest nor honor renders his continuance in 
the army necessary, his fortune putting him above the first, and 
the reputation he has already acquired, together with your Excellency's approbation, fully satisfying the last. 
</p><p>
That I. may not, however, seem to have been without warrant 
in my recommendation of him, I take the liberty to inclose to 
your Excellency an extract of a letter to him, written under General Arnold's directions, by a gentleman of his family, he being 
unable to hold the pen himself. After a warm recommendation 
of his conduct, both in the camp and the field, and giving him and his regiment a full share of the honor of the battle of the 
19th of September (in which General Arnold, not being present, 
writes only from the report of those who were), he adds, " On 
the 7th of October, the conduct of your corps fell more immediately under the inspection of General Arnold. He thinks it but 
justice to you and them to observe, that great part of our success on that day was owing to the gallant part they acted in 
storming the enemy's works, and the alertness and good order 
they observed in the pursuit." I did not, in my letter to your Excellency, allude to the dispute between Colonels Cortlandt and 
Livingston, having never interested myself further therein than to 
endeavour to prevail with my brother to yield up that preference 
to which I conceived Colonel Cortlandt's seniority entitled him, 
though it may, in some measure, be superseded by the resolutions 
of Congress. 
</p><p>
But I ask your Excellency's pardon for permitting any thing 
of a private nature to trespass long upon that time, which you 
generously devote to the public, and will proceed to one of more 
general concern, in which also, as an individual, I am deeply interested I mean the defence of this State, and the erection of 
works on Hudson's River. I have seen your Excellency's letter 
on that subject to Governor Clinton. I wish the delicate situation in which he stands would have permitted him to have been 
more explicit in his answer, which he has also communicated to 
me. This I conceive the general permission, which your Excellency has given me, to write my sentiments fully, and the attention with which you have honored my letters, together with the 
losses, which, through mismanagement, I have already sustained, 
in some measure entitle me to be. 
</p><p>
The military arrangement in this department is far from being 
satisfactory. The officers of Commissary, Quarter-master, &c., are 
generally unsupplied with money ; public credit is stretched beyond all reasonable bounds ; certificates, which are the only cash 
of these several officers, have lost their credit, from the uncertainty 
and difficulty that attend their payment ; and force alone affords a scanty supply to the army. This renders it impossible to lay 
up magazines, opens a wide door for frauds, and is attended with 
the most mischievous effects upon husbandry, and the tempers of 
the people. I learn, by a letter from Mr. Lee, the demands of 
the Southern army. No great quantity of cattle are raised in 
this State, except in the county of Westchester, from whence the 
enemy draw considerable supplies, though nothing would be easier 
than to cover it from their depredations, and to supply our army 
at <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> from it. Flour may be procured, when the Commissaries are properly supplied with money, and their whole attention turned to the business of their department. It would be 
happy for us, if those engaged in the civil departments of the 
army were bound by an oath not to engage in trade. 
</p><p>
But I am wandering from my subject. Your Excellency is 
fully impressed with the importance of fortifying Hudson's River. 
The want of men and money must make this work go on heavily, 
or, indeed, by leaving it unfinished, waste what shall be expended. 
Your Excellency will see the necessity of pressing Congress for 
supplies of both, more especially the last. I would submit it to 
your Excellency, whether it would not be more advisable to select a body of the ablest men out of the general regiments at 
<a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>, to carry on the works, allowing them additional pay 
as a compensation for their labor and the wear of their clothes, 
than to work in the ordinary way. Might not the troops stationed 
at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, also, be drawn down to that post, or part of them, at 
least ? 
</p><p>
Your Excellency is not ignorant of the extent of General Putnam's capacity and diligence ; and, how well soever these may 
qualify him for the management of this work, a most important 
command, the prejudices to which his imprudent lenity to the disaffected, and a too great intercourse with the enemy, have given 
rise, have greatly injured his influence. How far the loss of Fort 
Montgomery, and the subsequent ravages of the enemy, are to be 
imputed to him, I will not venture to say, as this will necessarily 
be determined by a Court of Inquiry, whose determinations I 
would not anticipate. Unfortunately for him, the current of popular opinions, in this and the neighbouring States, and, as far as I 
can learn, in the troops under his command, runs strongly against 
him. For my own part, I respect his bravery and former services, and sincerely lament that his patriotism will not suffer him to take that repose, to which his advanced age and past service justly entitle him. Your Excellency sees the necessity of 
spirit and activity, in this department of our officers, who in a 
fertile genius can find resources against the multiplied wants of 
this situation. Cannon should be procured and the forges set at 
work in making a chain. Twelve or fourteen twelve-pounders 
may be obtained at Salisbury furnace. Carriages should be prepared. In short, Sir, unless we make use of the present moment, 
the well-affected will be unwilling to remain in this State next 
summer. 
</p><p>
Having drawn this out to a most unreasonable length, I must 
fear trespassing upon you, and defer some other matters upon 
which I propose writing to your Excellency. In the mean while, 
I must only flatter myself that your Excellency will not only excuse, but consider the freedom with which this is written as a 
new proof of the confidence I have ever found myself inclined to 
repose in your Excellency, and which you have so frequently 
encouraged as to persuade me that I run no other hard in 
speaking freely of men and measures, than that of sometimes trying your Excellency's patience. We have various accounts of 
their being in great dread of an unwelcome visit at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
during this winter. I suppose their apprehensions will be some 
what allayed by the arrival of the seventy-first and three Hessian regiments, which have lately got in from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. I 
have the honor to be, with the greatest respect and esteem, 
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

</p><p>
Head- Quarters, <a href='/results.php?city=valley forge' rel='city'>Valley Forge</a>, 12 March, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I should have answered your letter of the 14th of January 
before this time, had I not been daily in hopes that I should 
be able to give you a satisfactory account of a change of men 
and measures in the North River department. It has not been 
an easy matter to find a just pretence for removing an officer from his command, where his misconduct rather appears to result 
from want of capacity, than from any real intention of doing 
wrong; and it is, therefore, as you observe, to be lamented, that 
he cannot see his own defects, and make an honorable retreat 
from a station in which he only exposes his own weakness. 
</p><p>
Proper measures are taking to carry on the inquiry into the 
loss of Fort Montgomery, agreeably to the directions of Congress ; 
and it is more than probable, from what I have heard, that the 
issue of that inquiry will afford just grounds for a removal of 
General P. But whether it does or not, the prejudices of all 
ranks in that quarter against him are so great, that he must, at 
all events, be prevented from returning. I hope to introduce a 
gentleman in his place, if the general course of the service will 
admit of it, who will be perfectly agreeable to the State and to 
the public. In the mean time, I trust that General Parsons will 
do every thing in his power to carry on the works, which, from 
his last accounts, are in more forwardness than I had expected. 
</p><p>
I wish that all the men in the upper part of the river had 
been drawn down to the Highlands, instead of being kept to 
carry on an expedition, in which I never was consulted, but 
which I saw from the beginning could never succeed, from a 
variety of reasons, which it would be needless to give to you, or 
any man acquainted with the state of the country through which 
it was to have passed. Those who were the most sanguine, I 
fancy, now see the impracticability of it. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> and the neighbouring posts were, by a resolve of 
Congress, included in the Northern department, and the care of 
carrying on the works put under the direction of the officer commanding in that district. General Gates being, soon after the 
resolve, called to the Board of War, he had no opportunity of 
doing any thing towards it. Whether there will be any alteration 
in the extent of the command this campaign, I cannot tell. But, 
if it falls again into that department more immediately under my 
particular command, you may depend that all the attention due 
to posts so important shall be paid to them. 
I am, &c., 
</p><p>
GEORGE WASHINGTON.
