</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been honored with your very kind and 
obliging letter of the 4th instant and should sooner 
have replied, but I am kept here in a kind of suspense by the very slow manner of proceeding in the 
Assembly of this State. I am Financier electa, but 
that is all; for had I taken the oath and my commission, my seat in the Assembly must have been 
vacated. And I think it of the utmost consequence 
to preserve my right of appearing there, until the 
tender and penal laws are totally repealed ; for I 
consider those laws as destructive of all credit, even 
amongst private people in dealings with one another. 
But to the public officers, after the experience we 
have had, it is evident that the existence of such 
laws much longer, must totally preclude them from 
every possibility of credit; and in our circumstances 
the war cannot be carried on without it. I have already made such an impression on this siihject, that 
I feel pretty sure those laws will be repealed in this 
State within these few days ; and I expect the other 
Legislatures will readily follow the example. 
</p><p>
I am also pressing our Assembly to levy effective 
taxes in hard money. There are stronger objections 
made to this than the other measure, and they are 
more pertinaciously insisted on. But still they will, 
either wholly or partially, come into this also; and if 
once the ice is broken, they will see such advantages 
flowing from these foundations, as will readily induce 
them to follow up the plans that evidently prove, in 
the operation, how beneficial they are to the country. 
</p><p>
Insuperable obstacles have hitherto prevented me 
from bending my course towards your camp, and it 
seems yet uncertain when it may be in my power ; 
for although I stipulated with Congress that they 
should not rest any part of the present campaign on 
me, yet they cannot refrain, and already much of 
my time and attention is engaged in that way. 
Not having taken any commission, prevents me from 
calling on the several departments for such returns 
as I should choose to have with me when I wait on 
your Excellency ; for my objects are to reduce our 
public expenditures as nearly as possible to what 
they ought to be, and to obtain revenues in our own 
country, to meet those expenses as nearly as can be; 
and then to show foreign nations, engaged in the 
war, that we must look to them for the balance. 
And I am very confident, when they shall see exertions on one hand, and economy on the other, they 
will be willing to assist us all they consistently can. 
The promise you so cheerfully make, of granting all 
the support in your power, increases my own confidence, and I will, before long, engage in the duties 
of my department, with all the energy I am master 
of; that is, provided these tender and penal laws 
are done away. I have the pleasure to hear, that 
Mr Lowry has sent one thousand barrels of flour 
to camp. From <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>, I have not yet 
heard. I have the honor to be. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most devoted, humble servant,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 27th, from Chatham, has just 
been delivered to me by Colonel Miles, and, in consequence, I have advised him to secure the assistance 
of the President and Council of this State, in case it 
should be necessary. But, as a preferable mode of 
procuring the craft, I advise his engaging to pay 
them in a short time after the service is performed; 
and, if needful, I shall join in this assurance, and 
finally see it performed. 
</p><p>
I directed the Commissary-General, immediately on 
my return from camp, to cause the deposit of three 
hundred barrels of flour, three hundred barrels of salt 
meat, and twelve hogsheads of rum, to be made at 
the Head of Elk, and pointed out the means of obtaining them. For this purpose, he sent down a 
Deputy some clays since, and I expect all will be 
ready there. I have written to the Quarter-master of 
Delaware and Maryland, Mr. Donaldson Gates, to exert himself in procuring the craft. I am much more 
apprehensive on the score of craft in Delaware and 
Chesapeake. I have written to the Governor, and 
several of the most eminent merchants in <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>, to 
extend their assistance and influence in expediting this 
business. Foreseeing the necessity of supplies from 
Maryland and Delaware, I have written, in the most 
pressing terms, to the Governors and Agents, to have 
the specific supplies required of them by Congress in 
readiness for delivery to my order; and now that 
your movements must be unfolded to them, I shall 
still more strongly show the necessity, and stimulate 
their exertions by holding forth what is due to their 
own immediate interest and safety. But still I fear 
you will be disappointed in some degree as to the 
shipping, and that I shall be compelled to make purchases of provisions, which, if it happens, must divert 
the money from those payments to the army that I 
wish to make. I have already advised your Excellency of the unhappy situation of money matters, and 
very much doubt if it will be possible to pay the detachment a month's pay, as you wish. Therefore it 
will be best not to raise in them any expectation of 
that kind. Should it come unexpectedly, so much the 
better. I do not think it practicable to provide the 
salt provisions here, even if a disappointment happens 
in New England; but have particularly recommended 
attention to the article in Maryland, which is to furnish ten thousand five hundred barrels of beef and 
pork. 
</p><p>
No news here yet of the Count de Grasse ; but I 
have had occasion to lament that too many people have, for some clays past, seemed to know your Excellency's intended movements. This city is filled with 
strangers, so that Colonel Miles cannot procure private 
lodgings, and my family being chiefly at Springetsbury, affords me the opportunity of appropriating my 
house in town to your use. I believe we can accommodate your Aids, &c., with mattresses, but our beds 
are chiefly in the country; and as what I have cannot possibly be appropriated to a better use, I beg 
your Excellency will consider and use my house, and 
what it affords, as your own. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, your devoted servant,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I take this earliest opportunity of acknowledging 
your Excellency's letter of the 25th, which I received 
last evening, and in which you request me to have 
ready my letters to the officers you are sending to 
the Eastern States, so as that they ma}' go by the 
next post. I would willingly comply with your Excellency's desire most literally, but I have rather 
wished to transmit my sentiments to you, that you 
may send them to the gentlemen, either in the whole 
or in part, as you shall think proper, and with such 
observations as may occur to you. 
</p><p>
Recruiting the army is certainly of importance, 
and ought therefore to be urged upon the several 
States ; but, should it be necessary to expend money 
for that purpose, it must not be considered as a part 
of the quota called for by Congress for the service 
of the current year. I shall make an application on 
this subject to Congress, and endeavour to have certain principles established, by which those States who 
exert themselves to bring their quota of troops early 
into the field may have full justice done them, and 
those States which are negligent be charged in proportion to that negligence. I mention these things, 
Sir, to obviate mistakes, which might be productive 
of very evil consequences. You who, being on the 
spot, and knowing my situation and arrangements, are 
better informed than any person how necessary it is 
that the money called for from the several States 
be punctually paid, without any deduction whatever; 
you are, I am sure, convinced, that if my measures 
are obstructed, jour own designs must prove abortive. 
And therefore you will, I am persuaded, take care to 
prevent an application of those funds to the recruiting service, which are necessary to the support and 
operation of those who are already enlisted. But as 
it ma} obviate those doubts, which are too apt to 
start in the minds of such gentlemen as compose the 
respective Legislatures, I repeat to your Excellency 
my assurance, that I will exert myself to have full 
justice done to those States who may bring their 
proportion of men into the field at an early period. 
</p><p>
Should you send officers who are now with the army, 
I expect that they will be able to give full information, from what they have seen of the benefits which 
result from the present mode of administration ; and 
I am sure that you are fully convinced of the superior cheapness with which supplies are obtained from 
what they were formerly. In order, then, that the army may be well and cheaply maintained, it is necessary that the States grant money. 
</p><p>
In considering the situation of the army, and comparing the wants with the means of satisfying them, 
it became necessary for me to arrange those wants so 
that the relief in my power might be properly extended. Feeding the army appeared to be an object 
of the first necessity ; clothing them was almost, if 
not altogether, as indispensable. After feeding and 
clothing them, the equipment for service demands attention, under which head must be classed the arms, 
ammunition, military stores, tents, camp equipage, and, 
in short, the whole of the Quarter-master's department. 
To the equipment for service succeeds the attention 
which is to be paid to the sick and wounded, an object in which justice and humanity combine most forcibly together. The pay of the army must, of necessity, be placed last in this list j but though last, it is 
by no means least, in my mode of contemplating it. 
Your Excellency knows so well my solicitude on this 
subject, that it is unnecessary to mention it here. 
But I should ill deserve the high trust reposed in 
me, if I permitted any consideration to divert me 
from that line which reason points out as my duty 
to walk in. 
</p><p>
The officers you may employ on the present occasion, will. I am sure, be men of good sense and candor. They will, therefore, judge properly of my reasonings, and give them their due weight to others. 
I may, perhaps, have misarranged the wants of our 
army ; but I think not. It is, however, proper to observe, that under the head of clothing I comprehend 
those means for clothing the officers, which I have 
now in contemplation, and had the honor of mentioning to your Excellency. If I am right in my ideas as to what is the proper mode of applying the public money, then every prudent officer will, instead of 
urging the States to grant a little money for the purpose of paying them, urge the grant of so much as 
will support and equip the army, and still leave a 
sufficiency for the pay. To increase the means of 
payment by retrenching every other expenditure, is 
my constant object ; to increase the means of payment by grant of money, the States alone are competent to. I hope, therefore, that the gentlemen you 
employ will join me in urging such grants, with all 
their force and abilities. 
</p><p>
It is from the same conviction which you feel of 
the advantages which must result to our country from 
an early and vigorous campaign, that I have spent 
money and stretched my credit to the utmost extent 
which I dare, in order that you might take the field 
at an early hour, and in a respectable manner. I 
have confided in the States, and the consequences of 
being deceived will be such that it is better you 
should conceive than I describe them. If they do 
not grant the sums called for by Congress, I cannot 
give that aid to your operations which I know to be 
indispensably necessary. But if they do grant me 
those sums, I pledge myself to support you fully in 
all your views; and you shall then have the pleasure 
of seeing your brave troops as regularly paid as they 
are now fed; — and then, knowing them to be well 
appointed, and in all respects fit for service, you will 
be enabled to accomplish those plans for the defence 
and salvation of our country which lie nearest your 
heart. That this may be speedily the case, is the 
most fervent wish of your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and humble servant,
