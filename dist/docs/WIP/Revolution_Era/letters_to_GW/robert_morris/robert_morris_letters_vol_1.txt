DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have just received yours of yesterday, and will 
duly attend to those things you recommend to my 
consideration. At present I have to inclose you a 
letter from Congress, which I suppose contains their 
resolves of the 20th instant; but as the President 
does not say, in his letter to me, that they are in 
closed to you, and as it is necessary you should 
have them, I take the liberty to send herewith a copy of them.
</p><p>
I am well pleased to see the attention they pay 
General Lee ; and I shall make it a point to collect 
and send your Excellency, soon as possible, the 
one hundred half Johannes they order. You will 
observe Mr. Clymer, Mr. Walton, and myself are appointed a Committee to transact the Continental business here, that may be necessary and proper ; and I 
apprehend that it will frequently be necessary that 
we should know the substance of your correspondence with Congress.! Your letters to the President, 
if sent open under our cover, shall always meet despatch, and their contents kept secret; and when you 
think it improper we should see them before the 
Congress, seal them, and they shall go forward untouched ; and, if you do not approve of submitting 
them to our inspection at all, write us freely, and 
your wishes in that respect shall be complied with. 
</p><p>
We have just heard of your success at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>. The account is but imperfect ; but we learn you are 
master of that place, and all the baggage and stores our enemy had there, and of three hundred prisoners and that your troops were still in pursuit of the 
flying enemy. I have just wrote to Congress, and 
told them thus much, as the substance of an account 
just come down; and I told them further, I had been 
informed that you had executed in this matter your 
part of a well-concerted plan; that <a href='/results.php?tla=wih' rel='colleague'>General Heath</a>,- at Hackensack, had orders from you, and that General Ewing and Colonel Cadwalader, also, had orders to 
cross the Delaware at the same time you did, but had been prevented by driving ice. 
</p><p>
Good news sets all the animal spirits to work. 
The imagination is heated, and I could not help adding , that I expected <a href='/results.php?tla=wih' rel='colleague'>General Heath</a> was to continue 
his march towards Brunswick, which would draw the 
attention of any troops posted there and at Prince 
ton, while you would pursue the flying heroes to Bordentown and Burlington, where Ewing and Cadwalader would stop them, and cut off their communication with the two thousand Hessians and 
Highlanders, that came after Griffin ; nay, I almost 
promised them that you should, by following up this 
first blow, finish the campaign of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a> with that 
eclat that your numerous friends and admirers have 
long wished for. I congratulate you most heartily on 
what is done ; and am, with perfect esteem, dear Sir, 
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I have just received your favor of this day, and 
sent to <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a> to detain the express until 
I collect the hard money you want, which you may 
depend shall be sent, in one specie or other, with this 
letter, and a list thereof shall be inclosed herein. 
</p><p>
I had long since parted with very considerable 
sums of hard money to Congress; therefore must collect from others, and, as matters now stand, it is no 
easy matter. I mean to borrow silver, and promise 
payment in gold, and will then collect the gold in 
the best manner I can. Whilst on this subject, let 
me inform you that there are upwards of twenty 
thousand dollars in silver at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>. They have 
no particular use for it, and I think you might as 
well send a party to bring it away, and lodge it in 
a safe place convenient for any purposes for which 
it may hereafter be wanted. 
</p><p>
I gave Mr. Commissary Wharton an order for forty 
thousand dollars this morning, and pressed him to at 
tend most diligently to your supplies. I will send 
for him again, know what is done, and add springs 
to his movements, if I can. I wish he was more 
silent, prudent, &c. : but I fancy he is active. What 
ever I can do shall be done for the good of the service. I ever am, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rom" rel="me">ROBERT MORRIS</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. Hearing that you are in want of a quarter cask of wine, I have procured a good one, which Mr. Commissary Wharton will send up.

SIR, 
</p><p>
I was honored with your favor of yesterday by 
Mr. Ho well, late last night, and, ever solicitous to 
comply with your requisitions, I am up very early 
this morning to despatch a supply of fifty thousand 
dollars to your Excellency. You will receive that 
sum with this letter; but it will not be got away so 
early as I could wish, for none concerned in this 
movement, except myself, are up. I shall rouse them 
immediately. It gives me great pleasure that you have engaged the troops to continue, and if further 
occasional supplies of money are necessary, you may 
depend on my exertions either in a public or private capacity. 
</p><p>
The year <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a> is over. I am heartily glad of it, 
and hope you nor America will ever be plagued with 
such another. Let us accept the success at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a> 
as a presage of future fortunate events; and under 
that impression, I do most sincerely wish you a successful campaign in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1777">1777</a>, to crown you with immortal honors, in reward of the dangers and fatigues of 
war; and that you may, for many, many years after, 
enjoy the sweets of peace and domestic happiness, in 
reward of your social virtues. With sincere esteem 
and regard, I ever am, Sir,

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I am honored with yours of the 2d instant. The 
good opinion you are pleased to entertain of me, 
makes me very happy, because there is no man's 
opinion I reverence more ; and that very circumstance 
is, at the same time, the source of trouble in my 
mind, as you force me to abandon that idea of security which I was desirous of maintaining. It is 
truly lamentable, that we have never been able to 
this day to conquer that fundamental error made in 
the outset by short enlistments. It was not until 
conviction of the absolute necessity__of it, stared every 
man in the face, that frltr -wholesome measure of enlisting for three years, or during the war, could be 
carried in Congress; and since it was carried there, 
it meets with insuperable obstacles, raised by the 
former practice ; for the bounties, high wages, and 
short service, have vitiated the minds of all that class of people, and they are grown the most mercenary beings that exist. 
</p><p>
I do not confine this observation to the soldiery 
merely, but extend it to those who get their livings 
by feeding and entertaining them. These are the 
harpies that injure us much at this time. They keep 
the fellows drunk while the money holds out ; when 
it is gone, they encourage them to enlist for the 
sake of bounty, then to drinking again ; that bounty 
gone, and more money still wanted, they must enlist 
again with some other officer, receive a fresh bounty 
and get more drink, &c. This scene is actually carrying on here daily, and does immense injury to the 
recruiting service ; but still I hope our new army 
will be got together before long, at least so many as 
will enable you to put a good face towards your 
enemies ; and if that is accomplished, I think they 
will not venture this way at present. It seems to be 
their object ; and, in your situation, I really do not 
see what is to f prevent their taking possession of it, 
unless the want of stores, forage, &c., retards their 
movements, or renders it impracticable for them to 
come on. In the mean time, the public stores are 
removing, and Congress has adjourned back to this 
place, many of the members are come up, and the 
rest on the road. I do not expect they will make a 
House sooner than Monday; but your late despatches 
shall be delivered to the President as soon as he 
arrives. 
</p><p>
I wish with you, Sir, that they had complied with 
General Lee's request; and when I sent forward those despatches to <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>, I wrote my sentiments to 
some of the members ; and although it would have 
been inconvenient for me, and I urged not to be 
appointed on that errand, yet I would have gone rather than he should have been disappointed. Whether they will take up the matter again, I do not

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have not taken the liberty of giving you any 
trouble for some time past; and, indeed, I never do 
it but with great reluctance, because I know how 
much your attention and time must be engaged in 
the most important pursuits. 
</p><p>
The bearer of this, the Marquis Armand de la Rouerie, is entitled to my warmest recommendations, 
because he brought from his own country letters to 
me that I am obliged to attend to, and put great 
faith in, as they come from persons worthy of the 
utmost credit. One of them is from Mr. Deane, who 
not only mentions him as a gentleman of rank., good 
family, and fortune, but also as a man of great merit ; desiring my particular attention to him, and that 
I should supply him with money, which will be repaid in France by a gentleman to whom America 
is under the most important obligations. You will, 
therefore, excuse and oblige me at the same time by 
your favorable attention to Monsieur Armand, for he 
chooses to pass by that name ; and, should he want 
money, I will pay his drafts for what he stands in 
need of. I find he is a little disgusted at an appointment made for him by Congress this day; and 
I believe it was through the inattention of a committee, which I shall get set right again in a short 
time. I am, dear Sir, with the greatest esteem and 
affection, 
</p><p>
Your obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
