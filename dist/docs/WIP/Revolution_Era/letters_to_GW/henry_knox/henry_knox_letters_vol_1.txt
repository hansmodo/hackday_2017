I arrived here yesterday, and made preparation to go over the Lake this morning, but <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a> reaching here before day, prevents my going over for 
an hour or two. He has given me a list of stores on the other side, from which I am enabled to send an inventory of those which I intend to forward to camp. 
The garrison at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> is so weak, the conveyance from the fort to the landing is so difficult, the 
passage across the Lake so precarious, that I am afraid it will be ten days, at least, before I can get them on this side. When they are here, the conveyance from hence will depend entirely on the sledding ; if that is good, they shall immediately move forward; without sledding, the roads are so much gullied, that it will be impossible to move a step. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a> will do every thing possible to forward this business. I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient humble servant,

</p><p>
P. S. <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a> assures me, that although the navigation through Lake George should be stopped, yet, if there is any sledding, they shall move on another way.

I returned from <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> to this place on the 
15th instant, and brought with me the cannon, &c.; it 
having taken nearly the time I conjectured it would 
to transport them here. It is not easy to conceive 
the difficulties we have had in getting them over the 
Lake, owing to the advanced season of the year, and 
contrary winds; three days ago it was very uncertain whether we could have gotten them over until 
next spring ; but now/ please God, they shall go. I 
have made forty-two exceedingly strong sleds, and 
have provided eighty yoke of oxen, to drag them as 
far as Springfield, where I shall get fresh cattle to 
carry them to camp. 
</p><p>
The route will be from here to Kinderhook, from 
thence into Great Barrington, in Massachusetts Bay, 
and down to Springfield. There will scarcely be any 
possibility of conveying them hence to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> or 
Kinderhook, but on sleds, the road being very much 
gullied. At present the sledding is tolerable to Sara 
toga, about twenty-six miles ; beyond that, there is 
none. I have sent for the sleds and teams to come 
up, and expect to begin to move them to <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a> on 
Wednesday or Thursday next; trusting that between 
this and that period we shall have a fine fall of snow, which will enable us to proceed further and make 
the carriage easy. If that should be the case, I hope 
iri_^^teenjor t seventeen x days to be able to present to 
your Excellency a noble trarn~of artillery, the inventory of which I have inclosed. I have been particular with respect to their dimensions, that no mistake 
may be made in making their carriages, as there are 
none here, or implements of any kind. I also send 
a list of those stores, which I desired Colonel McDougall to send from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. I did not then know 
of any thirteen-inch mortars, which was the reason 
of my ordering but few shells of that size; but I 
now write to him for five hundred one-inch, two 
hundred five-and-seven-tenths inches, and four hundred seven-and-one-half inches. If these sizes could 
be had there, as I believe they can, I should imagine 
it would save time and expense, rather than have 
them cast. If you should think otherwise, or have 
made provisions for them elsewhere, you will please 
to countermand this order. 
</p><p>
There is no other news here of <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>Colonel Arnold</a>, 
than that, from Colonel McLean's having burnt the 
houses round Quebec, <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>Colonel Arnold</a> was obliged to 
go to Point-aux-Trembles, about six miles from the 
city, and that <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague'>General Montgomery</a> had gone to join 
him with a considerable body of men, and a good 
train of artillery, mortars, &c. 
</p><p>
There are some timid, and some malevolent spirits, 
who make this matter much worse ; but from the different accounts which I have been able to collect, I 
have very little doubt that <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague'>General Montgomery</a> has 
Quebec now in his possession. I am, with the utmost 
respect, your Excellency's

SIR, 
</p><p>
A resolution, of the 30th ultimo, has been shown 
to me by some French officers attached to the corps of artillery under my command, ordaining that all officers of artillery, engaged by Mr. Deane in France, 
shall take rank, in the American artillery, according to the dates of their brevet commissions in the French service. 
</p><p>
I believe the Congress did not sufficiently consider 
the consequences of such a resolution, or that they 
had not full information to form it, consistent with 
that justice which is due their own officers. 
</p><p>
The French Minister of Marine, or Minister of the 
Colonial Department, gave these officers brevet commissions, to be in force in their Colonies only, or 
rather on this Continent, of superior rank to those 
which they then held in France, in order to give 
them an ideal rank here. They have had the rank 
given to them implied in their brevet commissions, 
and some higher than they expected. But this resolution of Congress gives them another superiority, 
which perhaps was not intended. Nearly all the Captains now in the Continental artillery served for the 
last two campaigns as Captain-Lieutenants, and are 
such only of that class as distinguished themselves 
by their abilities and special services. They are arranged, in the different battalions of artillery, according  to their seniority, but do not take rank as full 
Captains until the commencement of the present year ; 
whereas the French officers brevet commissions are 
dated in November and December, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>. 
</p><p>
The resolution of Congress pervades all the different ranks in the artillery, of Captains, Captain-Lieu 
tenants, and Lieutenants, and supersedes all the officers in these different stations. 
</p><p>
I confess that it surprises me much, and that I am 
totally unacquainted with the principles upon which 
it is founded. No military ones most certainly can be 
assigned. These French gentlemen, in general, have never been in so much actual service as the American officers, who are not accused of any demerits ; 
hut. on the contrary, their reputation, as a corps, is 
equal to any in the service. Why, then, should they 
all be superseded and disgraced ? They have exerted 
themselves to recruit their companies on the new establishment, and marched them to camp. 
</p><p>
I conceive the most fatal consequences will arise to 
the artillery, except this resolution be repealed, at 
least so far as respects the seniority of rank. All 
that can with propriety be done, is to give them commissions dated at the same time that Congress accepted their services. Any thing more will occasion the 
resignation of every officer of spirit in the corps, who, 
though they are actuated by every tie of attachment 
and interest in the service of their country, yet will 
infinitely prefer serving as volunteers, than under people who can have no other tie than the pay they receive, and who cannot give a single order that can 
be understood. 
</p><p>
In justice to the merit of the officers under my command, and to promote the good of the sendee, I make 
this representation to your Excellency, begging that 
you would be pleased to transmit it to the Honorable 
Congress for -their information. If they repeal the 
resolution, I shall be happy. If they do not, I shall 
be clear of any bad consequences which may follow. 
I am, with the greatest respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
