Agreeably to my promise, my dear Sir, I write 
you from this place, and flatter myself with the hope 
that, although my letter contains no important intelligence, yet it may not be unpleasing to you. 
</p><p>
Your calm retreat of <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a> must be a 
source of ineffable delight to you. You can from 
thence take a retrospective view of the critical exigencies of the w^ar, and see a thousand ways by 
which the issue might have been the reverse of what 
it is. And your happiness must be in proportion to 
the extreme difficulties and dangers of the contest, 
and the immense blessings secured to your country 
by the glorious peace, contrasted with the miseries 
consequent upon an unfortunate termination. 
</p><p>
We have little or no politics; all commerce frozen 
up by the uncommon severity of the season ; but better prospects in the spring. There are now upon the 
stocks, in different parts of the State, for the fisheries 
and other branches of trade, upwards of eight hundred vessels, which will be at sea early in the summer. 
</p><p>
New Hampshire and this State have come into the 
impost exactly as proposed by Congress; and it appears to be pretty certain that Rhode Island and 
Connecticut will be induced to come into it. Many 
sensible men are for the powers of the Union being 
high braced ; but no measures are proposed to effect it. 
</p><p>
The <a href='/results.php?city=cincinnati' rel='city'>Cincinnati</a> appears, however groundlessly, to 
be an object of jealousy. The idea is that it has 
been created by a foreign influence, in order to change our forms of government. And this opinion 
is strengthened by a letter from one of our Ministers 
abroad. Burke's pamphlet has had its full operation. 
The cool, dispassionately sensible men seem to approve 
of the institution generally, but dislike the hereditary 
descent. The two branches of the Legislature of this 
State, namely, the Assembly and Senate, have chosen 
a Committee, " to inquire into any associations or 
combinations to introduce undue distinctions into the 
community, and which may have a tendency to create 
a race of hereditary nobility, contrary to the Confederation of the United States, and the spirit of the 
Constitution of this Commonwealth." They have not 
yet reported, and perhaps 'they will not. The same 
sentiments pervade New England. The Society here 
have had a respectable meeting in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, on the 
10th instant, at which <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a> presided. <a href='/results.php?tla=wih' rel='colleague'>General Heath</a> w^as not present. A Committee was 
chosen to attend the general meeting at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> 
next day ; â€” General R. Putnam, Colonel Cobb, Lieutenant-Colonel Hull, Major Sargent and myself Probably only two will attend. It was thought prudent 
not to make any honorary members at present. The 
officers and soldiers conduct themselves in an exemplary manner, and are generally as industrious as any 
part of the community. 
</p><p>
I wrote your Excellency from <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a> on the 
3d ultimo, inclosing the returns, and a particular account of matters there, which I hope met your approbation. And I also wrote you a line on the 9th of 
the same month, the day I set out from thence. We 
reside at Dorchester, about five miles from town, in a 
very agreeable situation. I shall hope for the pleasure of hearing from you at your leisure. Mrs. Knox 
presents her sincere and ardent affection to Mrs. 
Washington, and proposes to write particularly to her 
soon; and I also beg my respectful compliments may 
be added. I am, my dear Sir, your truly

My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have now been here nearly one week, and nothing of importance has been decided upon, owing to 
the contrariety of sentiments concerning the powers 
vested in Congress to raise troops, in time of peace, 
for any purpose. There appears but one sentiment 
respecting the necessity of having troops for the frontiers ; but the difficulty is, how to obtain them. The 
Southern States are generally of opinion that the 
Confederation vests Congress with sufficient powers for this purpose ; but the Eastern States are of a different opinion. The eastern Delegates are willing to 
recommend the raising troops for the western posts. 
But the gentlemen from the southward say this would 
be giving up a right, which is of importance to preserve, and they cannot consent to recommend, when 
they ought to require ; so that, from this cause, it is to 
be feared that there will not be any troops raised; 
and there are many difficulties as to sending those 
which are raised, and at <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, &c. I shall 
stay until the point is finally decided, or until Congress adjourn, provided it be on the 3d of next month, 
as it is agreed. 
</p><p>
I am, &c.,

My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I thank you for your kind favor of the 28th ultimo, which I received last evening, with its inclosures; 
and I sincerely hope I shall not be under the necessity of troubling you so much again. But, in the 
present instance, I am under the necessity of mentioning that Major Winthrop Sargent has repeatedly 
informed me, that a certificate from you would be one 
of the most desirable and acceptable things to him. 
I at length promised him that I would request it of 
you. He is really clever, and was an excellent artillery officer. 
</p><p>
I will endeavour to make an arrangement of the 
lime-stone, in the manner that shall be the least expensive ; but our spring is so backward, that we have 
but little prospect of getting the stone from the eastward before the month of June. It shall be forwarded by the earliest opportunity to your house, or 
<a href='/results.php?city=alexandria' rel='city'>Alexandria</a>. The weather is now as severe as at any time during the winter, and the snow and ice are nearly three feet upon a level. 
</p><p>
I am highly delighted with the delicate gratitude 
of Virginia, and am at the same time charmed with 
your sentiments and reasoning upon it. I sincerely 
hope, circumstanced as you are, that you may find a 
mode of declining the intended appropriation, so as 
to enhance the respect and affection of your fellow citizens. My jealousy for your fame is so high that 
I should prefer seeing you, Cincinnatus-like, following 
your plough, rather than accept the least pecuniary 
reward whatever. Your services are of that nature as 
to demand the approbation and admiration of succeeding generations, but cannot be rewarded by money. 
Thank the Supreme God, you are happily placed above 
the necessity of receiving any assistance ! 
</p><p>
Perhaps, my dear Sir, you could intimate to the 
Legislature, in a manner which would be clear of 
every indelicate imputation, that, should they think 
proper to apply the produce of this fund to the 
maintenance of the widows, and the support and education of the children, of those men of their own line 
who sacrificed their lives in defence of their country, 
and of the maimed soldiers, that the measure would 
rear an eternal monument to the virtue of the Commonwealth of Virginia. An event of this kind, which, 
I am persuaded, has been among the number of expedients conceived by jou, would rank Virginia 
higher in the annals of America than any other 
State ; and the idea coming from you, would place 
your warm and disinterested attachment to suffering 
in a durable and glorious point of view. Let my affection plead my excuse for this freedom. 
</p><p>
The Mall, in this town, has been repaired, and the 
trees replaced. But I believe the gravel walk is only 
upon the common principle, without any cement 
whatever. I will, however, inquire, and if there should 
he any improvement, I will with pleasure communicate it. 
</p><p>
You may probably have heard that Congress have 
been pleased to appoint me Secretary at War. I 
have accepted of the office, and expect to be in New 
York about the 15th of next month. From the habits imbibed during the war, and from the opinion 
of my friends that I should make but an indifferent 
trader, I thought, upon mature consideration, that it 
was well to accept it, although the salary (twenty-four hundred and fifty dollars) would be but a slender support. I have dependence upon an umvieldy 
estate belonging to Mrs. Knox's family, and upon the 
public certificates given for my services; but neither 
of these are productive, and require a course of years 
to make them so. In the mean time, my expenses 
are considerable, and require some funds for their 
supply. Congress have rendered the powers and duties of the office respectable, and the circumstances 
of my appointment were flattering, being without solicitation on my part, and nine States out of eleven 
voting for me. For this favorable opinion of Congress, I conceive myself indebted to your friendship. 
I do not intend to move my family to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
until next June. Mrs. Knox, who, with her little 
ones, are well, unites with me in presenting our affectionate respects to Mrs. Washington. I am, my dear 
Sir,

I thank you, my dear Sir, for your kind favor of 
the 26th ultimo, which I received on the 7th instant. 
 On the dispersion of the insurgents at Worcester, 
which was dictated more by the inclemency of the 
weather, and the consideration of having effected their 
object, than by any apprehensions of coercion from 
Government, many people were of opinion that the 
disorders were at an end, and that Government would 
resume its tone. They did not reflect that the Court, 
which w^as the great object of the insurgents assembling, was adjourned ; and that, having no further 
business at that time, they went to their respective 
homes. But, as soon as any object presented, they 
again reassembled in sufficient numbers to effect it. 
This was the case at Springfield, in the county 
of Plampshire, the inferior Court of which was to 
have met on the last Tuesday of December, but was 
prevented from doing any business by a party of 
about three hundred armed men. The Government 
of Massachusetts are now convinced that all lenient 
measures, instead of correcting, rather inflame the disorders. The Executive, therefore, have determined on 
coercion ; and they will soon try this remedy, under 
the direction of our friend Lincoln. I believe, with 
you, had this measure been tried in the first instance, 
the rebellion would not have arisen to its present 
height. But it can scarcely be imagined that it 
should now fail, if the arrangements should be well 
taken on the part of Government. If it is not administered now, it may be too late in the spring or 
summer ensuing. 
You ask, what prevented the Eastern States from 
attending the September meeting at <a href='/results.php?city=annapolis' rel='city'>Annapolis</a>. It is 
difficult to give a precise answer to this question. 
Perhaps, torpidity in New Hampshire ; faction, and 
heats about their paper money, in Rhode Island ; and 
jealousy, in Connecticut. Massachusetts had chosen 
Delegates to attend, who did not decline until very 
late ; and the finding other persons to supply their 
places was attended with delay, so that the Convention had broken up by the time the new-chosen Delegates reached <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
</p><p>
With respect to the Convention proposed to meet 
in May, there are different sentiments. Some suppose 
it an irregular assembly, unauthorized by the Confederation, which points out the mode by which any 
alterations shall be made. Others suppose that the 
proposed Convention would be totally inadequate to 
our situation, unless it should make an appeal to the 
people of every State, and a request to call State 
Conventions of the people, for the sole purpose of 
choosing Delegates to represent them in a General Convention of all the United States, to consider, revise, amend, or change the federal system, in such a 
manner as to them should seem meet, and to publish 
the same for general observance, without any reference to the parts, or States, for acceptance or confirmation. Were this mode practicable, it would certainly be the most summary, and, if the choice of 
Delegates was judicious in proportion to its importance, it might be the most eligible. There are 
others who are of opinion that Congress ought to 
take up the defects of the present system, point them 
out to the respective Legislatures, and recommend 
certain alterations. The recommendations of Congress 
are attended with so little effect, that any alterations 
by that means seem to be a hopeless business. Indeed, every expedient which can be proposed, conditioned on a reference back to the Legislatures, or 
State Conventions, seems to be of the same nature. 
</p><p>
Some gentlemen are apprehensive that a Convention, of the nature proposed, to meet in May next, 
might devise some expedients to brace up the present defective Confederation, so as just to serve to 
keep us together, while it would prevent those exertions for a national character, which are essential to 
our happiness ; that in this point of view, it might 
be attended with the bad effect of assisting us to 
creep on, in our present miserable condition, without 
a hope of a generous Constitution, that should at once 
shield us from the effects of faction and despotism. 
</p><p>
You will see by this sketch, my dear Sir, how 
various are the opinions of men, and how difficult it 
will be to bring them to concur in any effective Government. I am persuaded, if you were determined 
to attend the Convention, and it should be generally 
known, it would induce the Eastern States to send 
Delegates to it. I should therefore be much obliged 
for information of your decision on this subject. At 
the same time, the principles of the purest and most 
respectful friendship, induce me to say that, however 
strongly I wish for measures which would lead to 
national happiness and glory, yet I do not wish you 
to be concerned in any political operations of which 
there are such various opinions. There may, indeed, 
arise some solemn occasion, in which you may conceive it to be your duty again to exert your utmost 
talents to promote the happiness of your country. 
But this occasion must be of an unequivocal nature, 
in which the enlightened and virtuous citizens should 
generally concur. 
</p><p>
Notwithstanding the contrary opinions respecting 
the proposed Convention, were I to presume to give 
my own judgment, it would be in favor of the Convention; and I sincerely hope that it may he generally attended. I do not flatter myself that the 
public mind is so sufficiently informed and harmonized 
as that an effective Government would be adopted by 
the Convention, and proposed to the United States ; 
or, if this w^ere practicable, that the people of the 
several States are sufficiently prepared to receive it. 
But it seems to be highly important that some object should be held forth to the people as a remedy 
for the disorders of the body politic. Were this done 
by so respectable a set of men as would be sent to 
the Convention, even if it were not so perfect in the 
first instance as it might be afterwards, yet it would 
be a stage in the business, and men's minds would 
be excited on the subject, and towards a good Constitution. Were strong events to arise between this and the time of meeting, enforcing the 
necessity of a vigorous Government, it would be a 
preparation which might be embraced by the Convention to propose at once an efficient system! 
</p><p>
Although it may be confessed that a Convention, 
originating from the respective Legislatures, instead 
of the people themselves, is not the regular mode 
pointed out by the Confederation, yet, as our system, 
in the opinion of men of reflection, is so very defective, it may reasonably be doubted whether the constitutional mode of amendment would be adequate to 
our critical situation. If, on an examination, this 
should be found to be the case, the proposed Convention may be the best expedient that could be 
devised. Unrestrained by forms, it would be able to 
consider every proposition fully, and decide agreeably 
to the sentiments of the majority. But, in a body 
constituted as Congress is, a single member frequently 
may frustrate the opinions of seventeen eighteenths 
of the United States, assembled by representation in 
that body. There are a variety of other reasons which, 
in my mind, have the influence to induce a preference for the Convention. But the different opinions 
respecting it will probably prevent a general attendance. 
</p><p>
In my former letters, I mentioned that men of reflection and principle were tired of the imbecilities 
of the present Government ; but I did not point out 
any substitute. It would be prudent to form the plan 
of a new house, before we pull down the old one. The 
subject has not been sufficiently discussed, as yet, in 
public, to decide precisely on the form of the edifice. 
It is out of all question that the foundation must be 
of republican principles, but so modified and wrought 
together, that whatever shall be erected thereon, 
should be durable and efficient. I speak entirely of 
the Federal Government, or, which would be better, one 
Government, instead of an association of Governments. 
Were it possible to effect a General Government of 
this kind, it might be constituted of an Assembly or 
lower House, chosen for one, two, or three years ; a 
Senate, chosen for five, six, or seven years ; and the 
Executive, under the title of Governor-General, chosen 
by the Assembly and Senate, for the term of seven 
years, but liable to an impeachment of the lower 
House, and triable by the Senate. A Judicial, to be 
appointed by the Governor-General during good behaviour, but impeachable by the lower House, and triable by the Senate. The laws passed by the General Government, to be obeyed by the local Governments ; 
and, if necessary, to be enforced by a body of armed men to be kept for the purposes which should be 
designated. All national objects to be designed and 
executed by the General Government, without any 
reference to the local Governments. This rude sketch 
is considered as the Government of the least possible powers to preserve the confederated Governments. To attempt to establish less, will be to hazard 
the existence of republicanism, and to subject us 
either to a division of the European powers, or to a 
despotism arising from high-handed commotions. 
</p><p>
I have thus, my dear Sir, obeyed what seemed to be your desire, and given you the ideas which have 
presented themselves from reflection and the opinion of others. May heaven direct us to the best means for the dignity and happiness of the United States! 
</p><p>
I hinted, in the former part of this letter, that the 
Executive of Massachusetts were determined on coercion, under the auspices of <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a>. He will 
begin his operations on the 20th instant, with a body 
of four thousand men, including six companies of artillery with field-pieces. They will be drafted from 
the militia for a certain time. If the insurgents decline meeting him in force at Worcester, the 23d 
instant, to which time the Court of Common Pleas is 
adjourned, he will proceed to Hampshire county and 
Berkshire, at which places the Courts will also sit. 
If the insurgents decline meeting him at those places, 
he will detach parties to bring in the most culpable, 
in order for a trial by law. The process of this business will be interesting, and its issue important; both 
of which I shall do myself the pleasure of informing 
you of

Mrs. Knox thanks Mrs. Washington and you, with

Influenced by motives of delicacy, I have hitherto 
forborne the pleasure, my dear Sir, of writing to you 
since my return from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. I have been apprehensive, that the stages of the business of the 
Convention might leak out, and be made an ill use 
of by some people. I have therefore been anxious 
that you should escape the possibility of imputation. 
But, as the objects seem now to be brought to a 
point, I take the liberty to indulge myself in communicating with you. 
</p><p>
Although I frankly confess that the existence of 
the State Governments is an insuperable evil in a 
national point of view, yet I do not well see how, in 
this stage of the business, they could be annihilated ; 
and perhaps, while they continue, the frame of Government could not, with propriety, be much higher 
toned than the one proposed. It is so infinitely preferable to the present Constitution, and gives such a 
bias to a proper line of conduct in future, that I 
think all men, anxious for a National Government, 
should zealouslv embrace it. 
</p><p>
The education, genius, and habits of men on this 
Continent, are so various, even at this moment, and 
of consequence their views of the same subject so 
different, that I am satisfied with the result of the 
Convention, although it is short of my wishes and of 
my judgment. But, when I find men of the purest 
intentions concur in embracing a system, which, on 
the highest deliberation, seems to be the best which 
can be obtained under present circumstances, I am 
convinced of the propriety of its being strenuously 
supported by all those who have wished for a National Republic of higher and more durable powers. 
I am persuaded that the address of the Convention, 
to accompany their propositions, will be couched in 
the most persuasive terms. I feel anxious that there 
should be the fullest representation in Congress, in 
order that the propositions should receive their warmest concurrence and strongest impulse. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Knox and myself have recently sustained the 
severe affliction of losing our youngest child, of about 
eleven months old, who died on the 11th instant, of 
a disease incident to children cutting their teeth in 
the summer season. This is the third time that Mrs. 
Knox has had her tenderest affections lacerated by 
the rigid hand of death. Although her present grief 
is sharp indeed, we hope it will be assuaged by the 
lenient hand of time. I am, my dear Sir,

By this time, my dear Sir, you will have again renewed your attention to your domestic affairs, after 
the long absence occasioned by the Convention. I flatter myself with the hope that you found Mrs. Washington and your family in perfect health. 
</p><p>
Every point of view in which I have been able to 
place the subject, induces me to believe that the moment in which the Convention assembled, and the result thereof, are to be estimated among those fortunate circumstances in the affairs of men, which give 
a decided influence to the happiness of society for a 
long period of time. Hitherto every thing promises 
well. The new Constitution is received with great joy 
by all the commercial part of the community. The 
people of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> are in raptures with it as it is, but 
would have liked it still better had it been highertoned. The people of Jersey and Connecticut, who 
are not commercial, embrace it with ardor. There has 
not yet elapsed sufficient time to hear from the interior parts of the other States, excepting this, which, 
however, does not seem to have decided on its plan 
of conduct. It will not probably, however, be among 
the first which shall adopt it; but I presume the 
powerful circumstance of interest will ultimately induce it to comply. As the information now appears, 
Virginia probably will give the new plan the most 
formidable opposition. The unanimous resolve of Congress to transmit it to the respective States, will not 
lessen the general disposition to receive it. But, notwithstanding my strong persuasion that it will be 
adopted generally, and in a much shorter time than 
I some time ago believed, yet it will be opposed, 
more or less, in most of the States. 
</p><p>
The germ of opposition originated in the Convention itself. The gentlemen who refused signing it, 
will most probably conceive themselves obliged to 
state their reasons publicly. The presses will groan 
with melancholy forebodings, and a party of some 
strength will be created. This is an evil, but it is 
an infinitely lesser evil than that we should have 
crumbled to pieces by mere imbecility. I trust in 
God that the foundation of a good national Government is laid. A way is opened to such alterations 
and amendments, from time to time, as shall be judged necessary; and the Government, being subjected 
to a revision by the people, will not be so liable to 
abuse. The first Legislature ought to be the ablest 
and most disinterested men of the community. Every 
well-founded objection which shall be stated in the 
course of the discussions on the subject, should be 
fairly considered, and such fundamental laws enacted 
as would tend to obviate them. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Knox unites with me in presenting our most 
affectionate respects to Mrs. Washington.

My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
It is with the most sincere satisfaction that I congratulate you on the unconditional adoption of the Constitution by the Convention of this State. The 
particulars of this important event are contained in this clay's paper, herein inclosed. 
</p><p>
Messrs. Jay, Hamilton, and the rest of the federalists, have derived great honor from their temperate 
and wise conduct during the tedious debate on this subject. Nor ought those gentlemen who were opposed to the Constitution in the first instance, but 
afterwards voted for its adoption, be deprived of their due share of praise for their candor and wisdom in assuming different conduct, when it became apparent 
that a perseverance in opposition would most probably terminate in civil war ; for such, and nothing short of it, were the prospects. 
</p><p>
We have now, thank Heaven, eleven States which have adopted the system. Conduct and wisdom, almost superior to the lot of humanity, will be required 
in the first outset of the new Constitution. Congress will soon publish an ordinance for the necessary elections and organization. The times of election and 
period of organization will not be difficult to be determined; but the place where they shall assemble will be warmly contested. The two places generally 
thought on are <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. At present it is difficult to say in favor of which it will 
be determined. A few days more will explain the matter. 
</p><p>
I shall set out in a few days for the Province of 
Maine, and be absent six weeks or two months. On 
my return, I shall do myself the pleasure of addressing you. I have hitherto refrained from acknowledging the receipt of your kind favor of the 17th of 
June, as the affairs in the Convention were so gloomily circumstanced. But it is now dissipated. <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a> has most perseveringly opposed the Constitution ; and, from being in the majority during almost the whole time, he has found himself so much 
deserted as to be in the minority. A precise history 
of his conduct is difficult to be written, and must be 
left to him to explain.

It is a long time, my dear Sir, since I have had 
the pleasure of addressing you, owing to my having 
been into Massachusetts and the Province of Maine, 
during the period of the last four months. I have 
received your favor, inclosing some foreign applications 
for admission into the <a href='/results.php?city=cincinnati' rel='city'>Cincinnati</a>. These papers are 
placed on the files of the Society, but cannot be 
acted on until the next general meeting, to be held

In the States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, 
and Connecticut, the great object of organizing the 
new Constitution, engrosses the attention of the people. It is with sincere satisfaction that I can assert, 
from personal observation, that the affection for the 
new system is increasing in these States, and that it is 
daily becoming highly popular. The Senators of those 
States are characters calculated to inspire confidence 
in the new Government, and are all highly federal. 
I am persuaded the Representatives will generally, if 
not entirely, be of the same description. As to Rhode 
Island, the majority are in such a train that nothing 
good can at present be expected from them; their 
paper money system and tender laws are sufficiently 
characteristic of their pursuits. <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> are also 
laboring under errors of conduct; but, from the powerful party in favor of the new system, something 
may be hoped from their ensuing elections. New 
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland are 
right. The late choice of Representatives in Pennsylvania, may be considered as a new and fair appeal 
to the people, as it respects their approbation of the 
new Government. Although the party in favor of 
their local Constitution have been brought to operate 
against the General Constitution, yet it appears the 
majority of the people are its firm supporters. 
</p><p>
Mr. John Adams will probably have the plurality 
of votes for Vice-President. From his principles of 
government, as well as his professions of regard to 
the character universally decided on for the President, 
he will probably make a good Vice-President. 
</p><p>
Major Haskell, who is going to Europe, is very 
solicitous to obtain your Excellency's certificate of his

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
The serious crisis of affairs in which the United States are involved with the Creeks, requires that every honorable and probable expedient that can be 
devised should be used to avert a war with that tribe. The untoward circumstances of the case are such that no degree of success could render a war 
either honorable or profitable to the United States. 
</p><p>
Events may be expected soon to arise, which will interrupt the present tranquillity. The headlong passions of the young Creek warriors are too impetuous 
to be restrained by the feeble advice of the Chiefs, even supposing their authority exerted to that end. But, where the dispositions of the Creeks generally 
favorable to peace, the corrosive conduct of the lawless whites inhabiting the frontiers, may be supposed to bring on partial quarrels. These may be easily 
fomented, and the flame of war suddenly lighted up, without a possibility of extinguishing it, but by the most powerful exertions. 
</p><p>
A war with the Creeks, besides being attended 
with its own embarrassments, may lead to extensive 
and complicated evils. Part of the lower Creeks, or 
Seminoles, reside within the territory of Spain ; and 
a strong connection appears to subsist between the 
Creeks generally and the Colonies of East and West 
Florida, belonging to that power. In case of a war 
with the Creeks, and they should be pushed to take 
refuge within the limits of either of the aforesaid 
Colonies, the United States would be reduced to a 
most embarrassed predicament ; for they must either 
follow the Creeks, in order to extinguish the war, establish posts in their country, or retire. In the first 
case, they would seriously be embroiled with Spain ; 
in the second, the operation would be extremely hazardous and expensive ; in the third, the impression 
made would not be attended with permanent or adequate effects to the expense incurred by the expedition. 
</p><p>
This subject, therefore, in every point of view in 
which it can be placed, has an unfavorable aspect to 
the interests of the United States. Acting under this 
impression, my mind has been anxiously employed in 
endeavouring to avoid, if possible, so injurious an 
event. In examining the proposition of the late Commissioners, to send the draught of a treaty for the 
Creeks to sign, and, in case of their refusal, to declare war against them, it appears as if the measure 
proposed would inevitably precipitate an event, which 
it is the interest of the United States to avoid. For, 
if such treaty should be transmitted to the Creeks, 
with a declaration that they must receive and sign 
it, or war should ensue, it is highly probable that the 
latter event would take place, by an irruption of the 
Creeks long before the messenger would reach the 
seat of Government. 
</p><p>
In search of expedients to avert the evils impending on this subject, I have been led into repeated 
conversations with the <a href='/results.php?tla=bnh' rel='colleague met'>Honorable Benjamin Hawkins</a>, Senator for North Carolina, who is well acquainted 
with the influential characters among the Creeks. He appears to entertain the opinion, pretty strongly, that 
the designs and character of Alexander McGillivray, the influential Creek Chief, are opposed to a war 
with the United States, and that he would, at this time, gladly embrace any rational mean that could 
be offered, to avoid that event. It seems probable to <a href='/results.php?tla=bnh' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Hawkins</a>, arising from former intimations of McGillivray, that he might at this time be influenced 
to repair to the seat of the General Government, provided that every facility and security should be offered for that purpose. 
</p><p>
In maturely contemplating this idea of <a href='/results.php?tla=bnh' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Hawkins</a>, and confiding in his knowledge and judgment of the character alluded to, I am inclined to conclude 
that it is an expedient deserving experiment, and that, let its success be what it may, the result cannot 
fail of being honorable to the United States. For it is proposed, although the overture shall have the aspect of a private transaction, yet that it shall have 
so much of the collateral countenance of Government as to convince Mr. McGillivray that he may safely confide in the proposition, as it relates to his own 
and the other Chiefs' personal security, until their return to their own country. 
</p><p>
I have shown <a href='/results.php?tla=bnh' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Hawkins</a> the inclosed draft of a letter to Alexander McGillivray. It has received his 
approbation, and he is willing to copy and sign the 
same, adding thereto some circumstances relative to a 
former correspondence on some philosophical inquiries. 
</p><p>
The hearer of the letter ought to he a man of real 
talents and judgment. Although the ostensible object 
of his mission should be the charge of the letter, yet 
the real object should be much more extensive. He 
should be capable of observing the effects of the proposition on the mind of McGillivray and the other 
Chiefs. He should be of such character and manners 
as to insinuate himself into their confidence ; to obviate their objections to the proposition ; to exhibit, 
in still stronger colors than the letter, the ruinous 
effects of a war with the Creeks. In the prosecution of his designs he should not be in a hurry, 
but wait with attention and patience the symptoms 
of compliance ; confirm them in such dispositions ; 
and be calm and firm, when opposed. And if, after 
all his labors and exertions, he should fail of success, 
he should be capable of giving a clear narrative of 
the means he used, and the obstacles which prevented his success. On this person's negotiation would 
depend much blood and treasure ; and, in any event, 
the reputation of the United States. 
</p><p>
The object, therefore, of the mission would require 
an important character, who, although not invested 
with any apparently dignified public commission, ought 
to have such private powers and compensation as 
would be a sufficient inducement to a performance of 
the intended service. 
</p><p>
The time, which the proposed negotiation would require, might be four months, or one hundred and twenty days. If the compensation should be eight dollars a 
day, the amount would be nine hundred and sixty dollars. The expenses would probably amount to four 
hundred dollars in addition. Should several of the 
Chiefs repair to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, the expenses for that purpose would amount, at least, to one thousand dollars ; 
so that the expense of one thousand three hundred and 
sixty dollars, at least, and perhaps two thousand three 
hundred and sixty, would be incurred by the proposed measure. And this sum would be independent 
of the probable expenses of presents, and returning 
the Chiefs to their own country, which would require 
a much larger sum. But there cannot be any doubt 
of the economy of the proposed application of the 
money herein required, when compared with the expense which must attend a war. 
</p><p>
The proposed experiment would probably be attended with either one or the other of the following 
consequences. 
</p><p>
First ; that it would be successful, and thereby prevent a war. For, most probably, if Mr. McGillivray 
and the other influential Chiefs should embrace the 
measure, and repair to the seat of Government, their 
dispositions would be sufiiciently pacific to conclude 
a treaty, especially as no terms, inconsistent with the 
principles of justice or humanity, would be imposed 
on them. 
</p><p>
Secondly; in case the proposition should be unsuccessful, the fair and honorable dispositions of the 
United States would be highly illustrated; and, however great the evils which might afterwards result 
from hostilities, the Executive Government would not 
in any degree be responsible for them. 
</p><p>
But, as this transaction may be liable to the most 
unworthy imputations, arising from some former local 
prejudices against <a href='/results.php?tla=bnh' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Hawkins</a>, in consequence of his 
services and zeal for the honor and justice of the 
United States while a Commissioner of Indian Affairs, 
it seems fair and reasonable that his conduct, in this 
instance, should receive its just approbation, and be 
shielded from all malevolence and misrepresentation. 
I have the honor, therefore, humbly to submit the measure herein proposed to your consideration. If you 
should be pleased to approve the principal parts thereof, your direction appears to be essential on the following points. 
</p><p>
First ; your approbation of my request to <a href='/results.php?tla=bnh' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Hawkins</a>, in writing, to copy and sign the letter to Alexander McGillivrav. 
</p><p>
Secondly; an ample passport for the protection of 
Mr. McGillivray, and such Chiefs as shall accompany 
]iim, from the time of their entering the limits of the 
United States to their return to their own country. 
</p><p>
Thirdly; a direction to me to make the necessary 
expenditures of money in pursuance of the plan proposed, and to appoint a suitable person to conduct 
the business. I have the honor to be. Sir, with the 
greatest respect. 
</p><p>

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of 
your separate letter of the 4th instant, and also of 
your joint letter of the same date, to the heads of 
the departments. By the information from Fort Harmar, of the 17th, and Pittsburg, of the 31st, it would 
appear that the Delawares and Wyandots are committing depredations, and that they will be joined in 
the war against us. But, what is still more disagreeable, it is to be apprehended that the Senecas, mainly, 
may be in the same predicament. For a party of 
Munsey or Delaware Indians, who reside upon the 
waters of the Allegiiany, towards Lake Erie, on the 
21st ultimo, murdered nine men, women, and children, 
within twenty miles of <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a>, on the west side of 
the Alleghany. 
</p><p>
This was on the day the Cornplanter set out from 
<a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a>. The inhabitants were so blindly enraged, 
as to suspect the Cornplanter and his party, and agitated plans to cut him off. Had they proceeded and 
succeeded, it would have completed the business, and 
the war would indisputably have become general. 
Lieutenant Jeflfers, of the federal troops, accompanied 
Cornplanter, and would probably have shared his fate. 
</p><p>
Every exertion must be made to prevent the Six 
Nations from joining the western Indians. The post 
at French Creek must be strengthened, and perhaps 
a party sent to protect the Cornplanter's settlements 
from the fury of the whites. Affairs being so critical 
with the Six Nations, I have judged it advisable to 
assemble them as soon as possible, in order to brighten the chain of friendship, and to prevent all jealousies. I have accordingly desired <a href='/results.php?tla=tip' rel='colleague'>Colonel Pickering</a>, who may be depended upon, to invite them to 
a meeting, at some convenient place, at an early 
day, and that, in the mean time, he should repair to 
this city for particular orders. I shall lay this subject before the Vice-President, and the other heads 
of departments to-morrow, for their approbation. 
</p><p>
The recruiting service proceeds well. I judge we 
have about three hundred regulars and levies enlisted 
in different places, to Connecticut, inclusively. One 
company of levies, well clothed, will march from <a href='/results.php?city=carlisle' rel='city'>Carlisle</a> about the 25th, and the rest as fast as recruited. The marching of the regulars will commence by 
companies, I hope by the 1st of May, and follow in succession as fast as recruited. Present appearances 
indicate that the main force will be collected by the 15th of July, as originally designed. 
</p><p>
Brigadier-General Butler was directed to have set 
off for Maryland on the 6th; but he has delayed it 
until this day. But, as the Virginia and Maryland 
levies will not have far to march, I hope they will 
be on the frontiers by the 15th or 20th of June. I 
have the honor to be, with the highest respect, 
Your obedient, humble servant,

Sir, 
</p><p>
Colonel Procter has just arrived in this city by 
the way of <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a>. He was unable to go forward 
to the western Indians without an escort of the Six 
Nations. He would have obtained such an escort, 
after counselling with them at Buffalo Creek, from 
the 23d of April until the 15th of May ; but the 
Indians could not proceed either in canoes along the 
Lake, or by land, but required a vessel. He applied 
to Colonel Gordon, Commanding Officer at Niagara, 
for a vessel, either public or private, for which he 
would pay ; but he could not obtain one. The design, 
therefore, of inviting the hostile Indians to peace, 
previously to striking them, has been frustrated. 
</p><p>
Brant, with thirty warriors, having Girty and McKee with him, set out from Grand River to the western Indians about the 11th of May. The Senecas 
say, his design is peace ; that he will return in June 
to the treaty at the Painted Post, and the others go 
forward to oblige the western Indians to peace. 
</p><p>
The Cornplanter continues his attachment to the 
United States; but he is exceedingly suspected by 
Brant's people, who are in an opposite interest. The 
Six Nations are for peace. Colonel Procter transmitted from <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a> a full account of his proceedings 
to <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague'>General St. Clair</a>. He will, therefore, be no longer 
in cloubt about pushing forward the Kentucky expedition. Colonel Procter has not made a written report yet, but he will do it soon, I have thought it 
proper to submit the substance of his mission to you.

The Minister of France has written me a letter, of 
which the inclosed is a copy. As this crisis of affairs 
eminent support during the late war, and being for 
the purpose of quelling an internal rebellion, no foreign nation can take umbrage at the measure. As 
it can be afforded without impediment or injury to 
the public service, and, as all the stores in the arsenals are under your direction, as President of the 
United States and Commander-in-chief, I feel but

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
Since the letter I had the honor of transmitting 
the 21st instant, I have received a letter from Governor Blount, dated the 4th instant. A meeting of 
the Cherokees, at Estanaula, had taken place, which 
lasted from the 24th of June to the 1st of July, at 
which the Little Turkey and many other Chiefs were 
present ; but the Bloody Fellow, and John Watts, 
whom the Governor, in his former letter, styled "the 
champions for peace," were absent. But most of the 
others who composed the delegation were present. 
The dispositions manifested were friendly. A number 
of Chiefs were selected to protect the boats, which 
were to pass down the Tennessee with the goods designed for the Conference to be held with the Chickasaws and Choctaws, at <a href='/results.php?city=nashville' rel='city'>Nashville</a>. But the Little 
Turkey expressed considerable dissatisfaction at the 
line towards Cumberland, alleging it to be the hunting grounds of the Four Nations, to wit, the Creeks, 
Cherokees, Choctaws, and Chickasaws. It is to be 
observed that this man is the most influential Chief 
of the Cherokees, and that he was neither at the 
treaty of Hopewell, in <a href='/results.php?year=1785'>1785</a>, nor Holstein, in <a href='/results.php?year=1791'>1791</a>. I 
have had some doubts, whether that part of the line 
was agreeable to the opinion of the Cherokees generally ; and it really appears to me that something 
will yet be to be arranged on that subject. 
</p><p>
Some Indians, supposed to be Creeks, have committed several murders at <a href='/results.php?city=nashville' rel='city'>Nashville</a>, and have wounded General Robertson and his son. The Governor 
has had discretionary power to call forth such portions of militia as he should judge expedient for the 
protection of the exposed parts of his Government, 
and he has, at different periods, actually called for 
five companies of militia, most of which are now in 
service. The Governor expected the Chickasaws and 
Choctaws to meet him, at <a href='/results.php?city=nashville' rel='city'>Nashville</a>, about the 25th 
instant. The goods for the Conference at <a href='/results.php?city=nashville' rel='city'>Nashville</a> 
left Holstein, under the charge of Mr. Allison, the 3d 
instant, under a proper escort, besides the Indian 
Chiefs before mentioned. The Governor and <a href='/results.php?tla=anp' rel='colleague'>General Pickens</a> were to set out for <a href='/results.php?city=nashville' rel='city'>Nashville</a> on the 5th instant, to cross Cumberland Mountains, escorted by 
some horse, which he called out for the occasion. 
</p><p>
The Governor has transmitted the affidavits of two 
men, recently from the Creek country, tending to 
prove the interference of the Spanish Agent to prevent the Creeks from running the line ; and also of 
some parties of Creeks making depredations on the 
Cumberland settlements. It -would seem the Creeks 
consider the Cumberland settlers as intruders on the 
joint lands of the Four Nations, and therefore they 
have a right to steal horses, and, in case of opposition, 
to kill. It is to be hoped the Governor may devise 
some measures to prevent the progress of those depredations, which lead to a general confusion and war 
with the Creeks and Cherokees. I shall write him 
by the way of <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a>. 
</p><p>
No information yet of Colonel Hardin or Major Trueman. <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague'>General Wayne</a>, on the 20th, gives information of some recent depredations by small parties 
in Ohio county About three hundred and twenty 
effectives of his troops had arrived. The information 
of recruits, since the last return, is agreeable to the 
within. The desertions of the troops, on the march, 
are excessive. Out of about three hundred and fifty, 
nearly fifty deserted from Reading to <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a>. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague'>General St. Clair</a> has returned from the western 
parts of this State. I have intimated to him your 
desire of his repairing to his Government ; but he 
says it will be extremely inconvenient to him to do 
it, as he has a lawsuit to be tried in September next. 
He seems to think that it would not be proper or 
necessary for him to be present at the trial of Ensign 
Morgan. He is to deliver me his evidence in a week 
or ten days, when I shall order Mr. Morgan to join 
the army, for his trial.

Sir, 
</p><p>
Yesterday afternoon Mr. Vigo arrived here from 
Fort Washington, and brought despatches from Brigadier-Generals Putnam and Wilkinson to the 9th of 
July, as will appear by the abstracts of Brigadier Wilkinson's letter of the 9th of July, herein inclosed. 
I have the honor to inclose, for your consideration. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a>'s letter, giving his opinion of the 
operations proper to be pursued. On this letter I 
shall, by the next post, submit to your view some 
observations. The fate of poor Trueman is but too 
probably sealed, and perhaps that of Hardin too. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a>, in his letter of the 5th of July, which principally contains the same information as that mentioned in Wilkinson's letters, states it as his 
opinion, that a treaty ought to be concluded, as soon as possible, with the Wabash Indians, and presents be made. Being firmly persuaded of the soundness 
of this opinion, I shall direct the measure. It is more especially necessary, as Mr. Vigo informs me, 
that the said Indians would not come even to Fort Washington, much less to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. Brigadier Wilkinson's attention to all parts of his duty, and 
his activity, render him a great acquisition to the public. 
</p><p>
A banditti, without any fixed residence, consisting of about ten Cherokees, thirty Creeks, and fourteen Shawanese, outcasts from their respective tribes, are 
perpetually committing depredations on the Cumberland settlements. They have lately attacked a military station near <a href='/results.php?city=nashville' rel='city'>Nashville</a>, and carried it. Twentyone men were killed, or taken ; but the Cherokees 
compelled the said banditti to deliver up their prisoners, amounting to six. These are the same rascals, probably, who attacked ]Major Doughty in the year 
<a href='/results.php?year=1789'>1789</a>. I have this information from Mr. Vigo. The necessity of the case will justify the measure of empowering Governor Blount to call out sixty or one 
hundred mounted riflemen, to cut off, if possible, the said banditti. He has that number at present in 
service ; and, as he has been empowered to retain in service as many as he shall judge proper, there can 
be no doubt but he will keep them up as long as necessary.

Sir, 
I have the honor to submit herein, inclosed, a letter to the Governor of Georgia, and one to Mr. Seagrove ; the former draughted by the Attorney-General, 
and both approved by the same, and the Secretary 
of the Treasury. The principles you were pleased to 
suggest have been the basis of these papers. The 
manner of treating the Spaniards and McGillivray, 
was unanimously considered as the most proper to be 
adopted in the present conjuncture. One of the 
Spanish Commissioners is at present in Virginia, and 
the other in the country, but will return either today or to-morrow. I shall see him, and, conformably 
to the advice of the gentlemen, mention the affair 
verbally and informally; the result of which I will 
have the honor to transmit to you. 
</p><p>
Letters have just been received from Major-<a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague'>General Wayne</a>. All quiet. He has transmitted his ideas of 
the further progress of the war, in case the negotiations should fail, which shall be transmitted by the 
next post. I have directed that the express be furnished with one hundred dollars, out of which he 
will return the money you were pleased to advance 
him. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c.,

Sir, 
</p><p>
As it is understood that the bill for fortifying the ports and harbours has passed into a law, I beg leave respectfully to lay before you the following 
thoughts upon the manner of executing this business. The operation of the Federal Government upon the State Governors and State officers, it is well known, 
has been, in general, rather irksome than otherwise, 
as it has tended to lessen their patronage and influence, and perhaps, in their opinion, of course somewhat to impair their dignity, when compared with 
their situation under the Confederation. The Governors are Commanders-in-chief of the militia of their 
respective States, and, as such, were the last year called upon, in the name of the President of the United States, to perform certain unpleasant duties 
relative to the preservation of our neutrality. 
</p><p>
These observations are made with this view, that it would most probably be a conciliatory and grateful measure to them, as Commanders of the militia, 
to be the Agents of the United States, in a certain degree, of the proposed fortifications. For instance, the Engineers might be desired to consult and take 
the opinions of the Governors upon the points most proper to be fortified, and to report to them the reasons on which their opinions should be founded, which 
opinions the Governors might confirm or reject, and transmit the result to the Secretary of War, in order to be submitted to the President of the United 
States. The Governors might also be required to appoint some suitable person to superintend the erection of the works, the keeping of the accounts, &c., 
and also of the mounting of such cannon as are to be mounted in, or furnished by, the respective States. 
</p><p>
By an arrangement of this sort, it is conceived that the Governors would be kindly brought to act by system to support the General Government, and that, 
unless something of this nature shall be devised, they might be displeased and disgusted. Some Agents must be appointed. The Governors are on the spot. 
and well acquainted with characters, and really possess higher responsibility than any other individuals. 
It may, therefore, perhaps be expedient, in an economical as well as political view, to request their assistance on this occasion. Whether these ideas be 
well founded, or not, is respectfully submitted. 
</p><p>
I am, &c.,

My dear Sir,
</p><p> 
I cannot refrain from trespassing on your time, by expressing to you the perfect satisfaction, which the 
people of New England possess, by the operations of the General Government. The unanimity of the Legislature of this State was such, as to overbear all 
dispositions of a disorganizing nature. Had the Legislature conceived it proper, or Constitutional, they 
would have expressed their approbation in the highest degree. But they conceived this would be a two-edged sword. <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Adams</a>, the Governor, may console himself with his good intentions, but he has no 
credit for them in the opinion of the wise and enlightened part of his countrymen. 
</p><p>
The whole country, from Maryland to New Hampshire inclusively, may be considered as a phalanx of good order and attachment to the administration of 
the General Government. A conviction of the existence of this disposition, and the most cordial affection to you, must afford you sensations of satisfaction 
which are inexpressible, especially after the gloomy threatenings of anarchy, which prevailed but in too many places the last summer. May this satisfaction never be clouded for a moment ! 
</p><p>
I am, with perfect attachment, &c., 
</p><p>

</p><p>
My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Possessing, as I do, a thousand evidences of your 
friendship, I am persuaded that you will readily believe me, -when I say that my silence of late has 
been the effect of my unwillingness to intrude, lest I 
should for a moment prevent the consideration and 
different views you give to the important subjects incessantly before you. 
</p><p>
Although the same cause continues to prevent my 
interruption, yet I am apprehensive sometimes that 
you may think me unmindful of your kindnesses, 
especially after the receipt of your affectionate letter 
by <a href='/results.php?tla=wib' rel='met'>Mr. Bingham</a>, the last summer. The loss of two 
lovely children, on which you condoled in that letter, 
has been recently revived and increased by the death 
of our son, of seven years of age, bearing your name. 
His health has always been delicate, having been 
born prematurely. We flattered ourselves that his 
constitution would mend with his years, but we have 
been disappointed. Unfortunate, indeed, have we been 
in the death of eight of our children, requiring the 
exercise of our whole stock of philosophy and religion. We find ourselves afflicted by an irresistible, 
but invisible power, to whom we must submit. But 
the conflict is almost too great for the inconsolable 
mother, who will go mourning to her grave. 
</p><p>
We have lately come from St. George's to pass the 
winter in this town. Indeed, this is our general plan. 
We may, however, as we grow older, find it inconvenient. We are distant about two hundred miles by 
land, which we may easily ride in six days, the snow being on the ground, or with wheels with a little 
improvement of a small portion of the road. The 
taverns on the route are as good as on any other 
two hundred miles on the Continent. 
</p><p>
I am beginning to experience the good effects of 
my residence on my lands. I may truly say that 
the estate is more than double in its value, since I 
determined to make it my home. The only inconvenience we experience, is the want of society. This 
will probably lessen daily. Our communication by 
water to this town is constant and cheap. We can 
obtain the transportation of any article from this town 
to St. George's, cheaper than the same can be carted 
from any store to the vessel. This egotism would require an apology to any other person than yourself 
</p><p>
For your own sake, I rejoice at the near approach 
of your retirement. In it, I pray God that you may 
enjoy all the felicity, of which the human condition 
is susceptible. The consciousness of having acted well, 
would, under any circumstances, have elevated your 
soul above the peltings of storms raised by malice 
and envy But in addition to this consciousness, the 
consecration of your retirement by the unlimited gratitude of your country, must present, in the decline of 
your life, the most perfect reward. 
</p><p>
I flatter myself, before you leave the helm, you 
will have dissipated the clouds raised by the causeless jealousy of the French Administration. If not, 
we must appeal from them, mad and drunk with 
power as they may be, to the time when they shall 
have recovered their senses. We have not injured 
them, but have only taken those due precautions, 
which our own happiness required. If they madly 
continue to war against our innocent and rightful 
commerce, we must make an account thereof, and 
look for compensation through all the events of ages, 
and we shall assuredly find it at some period or 
other, with full interest. But I hope we shall not, 
under any circumstances, at present, attempt reprisals. 
Their fit of insanity cannot last long. St. Domingo 
is, and will be in the course of this winter, the victim of the villany of its Administration. The whites 
will either he starved or murdered by the blacks. 
</p><p>
It cannot be expected that there will be any danger of the French attempting an invasion of our 
country. But if they should, we must resist. And 
this appears to be the only case in which we should 
suffer ourselves to be dragged into the war. What 
an eventful winter this will be at Paris ! Especially, 
if the army of Italy should be arrested, or defeated, 
in addition to the retreat of the two armies of Jourdan and jNIoreau, from Germany. From information 
generally circulating here, and particularly from , 
</p><p>
who has the last autumn arrived from France, in 
which he resided for several years, no doubt rests in 
my mind, but the measures of the French Administration towards this country, have been excited by 
the Americans in Paris, in consequence of letters received from persons of the same opinions in the United States. 
</p><p>
I had not intended to intermix any politics in this 
letter, which I meant solely as the recognition of a 
grateful heart. But they have thrust themselves in 
unawares. Mrs. Knox unites with me in presenting 
our respectful and affectionate attachments to you and 
Mrs. Washington. And I am, &c., 
</p><p>
