Sir, 
</p><p>
There being no established principles to govern the 
appointments to the vacancies of officers in the artillery, some doubts have arisen since the last regulation of the army, whether the right of appointment 
is in Congress, as generally has been the case, or in 
the States in which the regiments of artillery are apportioned, as part of their quotas. This uncertainty 
has operated to the prejudice of the service, by keeping vacant many second Lieutenantcies, which are 
highly necessary to be filled, as there is a great deficiency of officers of that rank. 
</p><p>
The regiments of artillery having different origins, 
the appointments, of course, have been derived from 
different authorities. Colonels Lamb's and Crane's 
regiments were raised, and the officers appointed, by 
virtue of powers given your Excellency in December, 
<a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. Colonel Harrison's regiment was raised and 
appointed by the State of Virginia, under the authority of Congress. Colonel Proctor's was originally 
raised by Pennsylvania, as a State regiment, and afterwards taken upon the Continental establishment 
by a resolve of Congress. The new appointments, 
which have taken place since the first formation of 
the regiments, have been made by Congress, in consequence of the request and certificates of the officers 
commanding regiments, countersigned by the General Officer commanding the corps. 
</p><p>
The promotions have been regimental to, and including, the rank of Captains, and to Field-Officers in 
the line of the corps at large. It is this principle 
which connects the regiments of artillery, and forms 
them into one corps, and which, if taken away, will 
reduce it to so many distinct regiments, independent 
of each other, without cement or any other quality 
which will enhance its utility and reputation. If the 
States interfere in the appointments, it is apparent 
the connection between the different regiments will 
be destroyed ; for the same power, which has a right 
to appoint, will claim a right to promote in case of 
vacancies; one is the consequence of the other. The 
distinction between the right of appointment and promotion, is too nice to be observed, or rather cannot 
be made. 
</p><p>
We have the experience of our own service, in addition to that of others, that rank is esteemed an 
unalienable right, and the acquisition of it the highest reward of military virtue. The principles of promotion, therefore, ought to be fixed and certain, and 
so clear as not to be liable to be misunderstood. 
The artillery, being composed of troops from different States, no one State can have the direction of 
the promotion of the whole, or even a part ; as a 
single promotion must affect the whole line. Congress only, with propriety, can make the appointments and promotions. 
</p><p>
The qualifications requisite for an officer of artillery being materially different from those for an officer of infantry, great care ought to be taken that 
none are appointed but such as possess a proper 
proportion of knowledge of the mathematics, and 
other necessary abilities for the nature of the service. 
It is from the talents of the officers of artillery, improved by experience, that America may expect to 
derive an essential part of her military character. 
That the greatest caution should be observed in 
making the appointments, I would humbly propose that they should originate with the Colonels of the 
regiments, who shall certify that the person recommended appears possessed of a proper proportion of 
mathematical knowledge, and such other qualifications 
as to make a good officer of artillery, and that this 
certificate should be countersigned by the General Officer commanding the corps, and by him transmitted to Congress ; that the promotions should be regimental to Captains, and to Field-Officers in the line 
of the corps at large ; and that the principles of the 
appointments and promotions be expressed in the most 
explicit terms. 
</p><p>
I am persuaded, that unless the Honorable Congress immediately establishes a system for the appointments and promotion of artillery, the corps will 
soon be involved in the utmost confusion. The best 
of the officers, seeing the uncertainty of promotion, 
will be disgusted, and leave the service ; and the present state of the artillery, which has been the work 
of years, may be ruined in an hour, by the premature promotion of an individual State. If your Excellency should view this matter in the same point 
of light, I beg you would be pleased to make such 
a representation to Congress, as may prevent the 
evils apprehended. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with the highest respect 
and esteem, &c., 
</p><p>

Sir, 
</p><p>
I came to this place to-day, to take your Excellency's ultimate directions when the park should join 
the army, and to take any other orders your Excellency should please to give me ; but I was disappointed by the army and your Excellency having 
moved. I presume the laboratory preparations will 
be in such forwardness by Sunday next, that we 
might then move without retarding any thing material. The artificers must remain longer. 
</p><p>
If your Excellency should think fit to alter the 
time of the arrival of the stores from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, I 
pray you to write to the Board of War on the subject. If your Excellency should be engaged in any 
operations, which jou intend to lead to immediate action, I hope I may with confidence expect your summons, even previous to the time mentioned above. I 
beg the favor of a speedy answer; and am 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
111 pursuance of our Excellency's instructions to 
me, dated the 7th ultimo, I proceeded to the States 
of Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New 
Hampshire, and delivered the despatches, with which 
I was charged, to the Governors and to the President, to whom they were addressed. 
</p><p>
The Legislatures of Connecticut and Rhode Island, 
unfortunately, were not sitting. The Governor of the 
former State, by having the powers of the Assembly 
in its recess, respecting the exigencies of the war, delegated to him, jointly with a certain Council, supposed 
that it would be unnecessary to call the Legislature 
on the matter of my mission, and that his Council 
would be competent to do every thing necessary on 
the occasion; for which purpose he proposed to call 
them together the next day after I had the honor 
of conversing with him, which was on the 11th ultimo. <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague met'>Governor Trumbull</a> fully coincided in sentiment 
with me, in respect to the gratuity of the three half Johannes, in preference to any pay in paper money, 
as a matter that would be more efficacious to quiet 
the minds of the troops, and render them happy; 
and also as a measure which the New England States 
could execute with as much ease, under present circumstances, as the three months' real pay in paper. 
He was clearly of opinion, that to attempt to obtain 
both the gratuity and three months' pay, would be 
to attempt more than could be performed consistently 
with their present exertions in order to put their 
finances on a tolerable footing. The Governor pledged 
himself to exert his utmost interest to have the gratuity and deficiency of clothing given to the troops 
immediately; and requested me to impress on the 
Governors and official gentlemen in the other States, 
the necessity and propriety of New England adopting similar measures. I believe the Governor religiously performed his part, and I am happy to believe I did not fail in mine. 
</p><p>
At <a href='/results.php?city=lebanon' rel='city'>Lebanon</a> I saw His Grace the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='colleague met'>Duke De Lauzun</a>, 
who pressed me to write an account of the revolt of 
the Pennsylvania line to the General, <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague'>Count De Rochambeau</a>. This I intended to have done when I 
should have reached <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, as a matter which I 
presumed would be agreeable to your Excellency's 
sentiments. It was only anticipating it a few hours. 
Therefore, in conformity to the Duke's solicitations, I 
wrote to His Excellency <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague'>General Rochambeau</a> the 
letter marked number One. 
</p><p>
Governor Greene, of Rhode Island, immediately 
called the Legislature of that State to meet him 
at Greenwich the 18th ultimo. 
</p><p>
I was more happy, in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, to find the Assemblies of those States 
convened. To them I represented, in the strongest 
terms I was capable, the distresses of the army in 
general; of the troops of their lines in particular; 
and of the probable means that would conciliate the 
affections of the soldiers, and make them quiet and 
happy. I take the liberty to annex, in paper number two, a summary of the arguments which I urged 
to these Assemblies, as far as they applied to their 
troops ; and these were the principal arguments which 
I urged to the States respectively. 
</p><p>
Massachusetts were pleased to adopt the measures 
proposed, as appears by their acts, contained in the 
paper number Three. New Hampshire also adopted 
the measures, as far as the circumstances of their 
troops required. That is, they agreed immediately to 
grant a gratuity of twenty-four silver dollars per man 
to their soldiers enlisted for the war, and coats sufficient to complete their line. The State of Rhode 
Island thought proper to adopt a different mode, as 
appears by a copy of their proceedings, hereunto annexed, number Four, and certified by the Secretary 
of that State. But I hope, as their quantity of hard 
money will be as much as that of the other States, 
the effects will be equally good. The Council of Connecticut determined upon nothing final, but appeared 
to intend to follow the example of Massachusetts. 
They were to meet at <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a> the 5th instant, on 
this business. The Governor informed me he had 
but little doubt that they would adopt similar measures to Massachusetts. But, if they should decline, 
he would immediately call the Legislature, when he 
presumed the matter would be made certain. 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to assure your Excellency, that 
all ranks of people, as well unofficial as official, from 
the private farmer up to the Governor, in the four 
States through which I passed, appear perfectly well 
principled in the contest, and fully determined to 
make every sacrifice of property and personal ease 
to insure the happy termination of the war. The 
universal sentiment was, that the army ought to be 
supported, and should be supported at every reasonable expense. 
</p><p>
The business of obtaining recruits for their battalions proceeds with great vigor and spirit, — for three 
years only, indeed; but the prejudice or sentiments 
of the recruits, who generally are the farmers' sons 
of the country, are against engaging for an indefinite 
term of time. I believe it would be easier to engage recruits from New England for seven years, than for 
the undefined term, for the ivar. 
</p><p>
I hope I have executed this business agreeably to your Excellency's ideas and if so, a line of approbation would render happy, yours, &c., 
</p><p>
