Dear General,
</p><p>
Very much fatigued, I arrived in New Hampshire 
in seven days from the time I left you, and am 
very happy to acquaint you that the people of New 
Hampshire behave with the greatest spirit. The six 
hundred men required, are, for the general part, on 
their march ; the nine hundred, I hope, will be ready 
to march by the middle of next week; and, by their 
present exertions, I cannot doubt but by that time 
they will be on the move. Some of them have already marched. I have directed them, at first, to 
rendezvous at Springfield. The way of Claverac is 
certainly much out of the route to the present station of the army; but, nevertheless, if you have any 
particular reasons for their moving by Claverac, let 
me know, and your orders shall be punctually complied with. 
</p><p>
I have conferred with the Committee. They tell 
me they have wrote, and are surprised their letters 
have not reached you. The State has collected, and 
are still collecting, cattle for the use of the army. 
Every one seems sanguinely determined to do something of importance this campaign. As soon as the 
main body has moved, I shall follow. Springfield 
will he my first stop. There I hope to hear from 
you ; but, if not, shall move agreeably to my instructions. I am, dear Sir, with much respect and esteem, 
Your most obedient, humble servant,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The impaired state of my health and the situation 
of my family, together with the unsettled state of 
my accounts with New Hampshire, render my presence there, the ensuing winter, very necessary. I 
have never, as yet, settled my depreciation, nor received any cash, on that head, from them. I should 
be very glad to do it this winter, without which 
it will be in a manner impossible for me to subsist 
in the army. 
</p><p>
The brigade that I have had the honor to command; are now ordered to join their respective States' 
troops; therefore it is not probable that it will be in 
my power to render my country any essential service until the opening of another campaign. 
</p><p>
The many favors I have received, and the known 
zeal you have shown for your officers, together with 
your care of their interest, strongly invite me to 
ask the favor of absence until the spring. That 
this request may be granted, is the ardent desire of 
Your Excellency's obedient servant, 
</p><p>

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The lingering illness, which occasioned my leaving 
camp, still attends me. But notwithstanding my physical ills, I have undertaken the business of sending 
the recruits of this State to the army, and have detained several officers that were on furlough in the 
State, to conduct parties. I hope that this measure, 
which has every appearance to be for the public good, 
will meet your approbation. With this letter, I suppose you will be joined by about fifty levies. Between 
forty and fifty have already marched from Exeter, 
and I expect about fifty more will march, by the last 
of this week. 
</p><p>
A number of deserters have come voluntarily and 
delivered themselves up to me, since my arrival in 
the State. I could wish that their treatment might 
be as favorable as possible. I am persuaded, if an 
act of grace was published, a great number of soldiers, now prevented from delivering themselves up, 
for fear of punishment, would return to their duty 
with pleasure. 
</p><p>
I attended the General Assembly last week, and 
urged all in my power their exertions for filling up 
the quota of troops for the army ; and am happy to 
acquaint you, that I think they will do as well as 
their abilities will permit. It is entirely uncertain, when I shall be able to join the army ; but as soon 
as the situation of my health will justify the measure, 
I shall lose no time in repairing to my duty. In 
the mean time, that health may attend you, and success your glorious undertakings, is the ardent wish 
of, my dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I now acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 
the 25th ultimo, which was delivered a few days ago. I shall set out for <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a> The beginning of 
next week, and on my passage shall hold a treaty 
with the Green Mountain Boys. But not having seen, 
or been acquainted with those turbulent sons of freedom, for several years, I am at a loss to determine 
my reception; but hope it will be such as shall tend 
to the general good. I shall endeavour to give you 
a more particular account on my arrival at <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>. 
</p><p>
My health is not fully restored, but perhaps competent to my new command. That the operations of 
the campaign may be such as shall render the American arms glorious in the eyes of the world, and the 
conclusion produce a peace, honorable and lasting, is 
the ardent desire of, dear Sir, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Since my arrival at New Hampshire, I have been 
exercised with almost every perplexity, pain and trouble, that a shattered constitution could entail. During the course of the winter, and greater part of the 
spring and summer, I was scarce able to ride five 
miles; but, as the autumn begins to advance, I find 
my health gradually returning, and had thoughts of 
taking a ride to camp, in case I could have found 
cash enough in the State to defray my expenses. 
But, after repeated applications for a sum voted me 
by Congress in the month of September, <a href='/results.php?year=1781'>1781</a>, I am 
at length informed (trifling as the sum is) that the 
money is not in the Treasury of the State, and no 
immediate prospect of matters being in a better situation. In this case, I would beg your Excellency's 
advice. Money I have none, and my private fortune 
scarce competent to the support of a numerous offspring, which Heaven has been pleased to bestow. 
Congress undoubtedly expected that the State would 
pay me what they voted, and the requisition the 
General Assembly agreed to accept ; but the Treasury 
is empty, and no money in the State to replenish it. 
However, should your Excellency think my presence 
at any place in the army necessary for the good of 
my country, I will endeavour, upon the shortest notice, 
to prepare myself to comply with your commands. 
</p><p>
This State has exceeded all expectations in raising 
their recruits ; yet there is still a number deficient, 
which probably may not be got very soon. And, 
indeed, it is not surprising that the affairs of this 
State should be very irregular, during its present 
complicated, unsettled form of government. 
</p><p>
The General Assembly, sensible of the impracticability of paying the tax for this year in cash, have 
resolved the same be paid in the different species 
of the produce of the country; in consequence of 
which, a considerable number of beef-cattle has been collected, and many more will no doubt be soon raised, for the use of the army. 
</p><p>
Most sincerely wishing you success, that your path 
on the theatre of glory may still continue to shine 
with its usual splendor, and that you may soon be 
able to restore to your country a safe, honorable, 
and lasting tranquillity, is the ardent desire of your 
most obedient, 
</p><p>
Most devoted, and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jhs" rel="me">John Stark</a>.
