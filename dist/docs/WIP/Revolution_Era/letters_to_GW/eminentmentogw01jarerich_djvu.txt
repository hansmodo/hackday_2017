PREFACE. 



WHILE I was employed in preparing " Washing 
ton s Writings" for the press, I made a selection 
from letters written to him, and copies were taken 
from the autographs. It was then my intention to 
publish the letters thus selected, as a sequel to 
that work, but various causes have intervened to 
delay the publication till the present time. 

In making the selection from several thousand 
letters, it was not possible to adopt any precise 
rule, but it was the aim to choose such as would 
enlarge the reader s knowledge of the events, 
characters, and opinions of the period which they 
embrace. All the letters are here printed entire. 
Having been written by various hands, and on 
different subjects, they are not, in any instance, 
repetitions of each other ; and hence there was no 
occasion to omit any parts of them on this account, 
as in the case of Washington s own letters ; nor 
was there the same reason for omissions to save 
space, in order to secure more valuable materials, 
and exhibit a continuous chain of events. In fact, 



VI PREFACE. 

such an attempt would be impracticable in a series 
of disconnected and miscellaneous letters. The 
editorial revision has been performed with such 
care, as the condition of the manuscripts admitted 
or required. Errors of grammar, and obvious 
blunders, the result of hasty composition, have been 
corrected. 

The letters from Count Rochambeau w r ere writ 
ten in English, either by himself, or by a Secre 
tary who had but an imperfect knowledge of the 
language. Hence the style partakes of the French 
idiom. The same characteristic appears in the 
letters of Lafayette and some of the other fo 
reign officers. A large portion of the original 
letters from Lafayette were returned to him from 
Mount Vernon, at some time after Washington s 
death. A copy of these \vas furnished to me in 
part by Lafayette himself, and the remainder by 
his son. Such of them as are selected for this 
work, are printed from that copy. The letters 
from Gouverneur Morris, written while he was in 
Europe, were copied from his letter-books. In 
most instances, the translations of letters written 
in a foreign language are the same that were 
found in the files at Mount Vernon. 

The remarkable letter from the Reverend Ja 
cob Duche, written from Philadelphia in October, 
1777, soon after the British took possession of 
that city, was transmitted by Washington to the 
President of Congress. As the original is not to 
be found among the papers of that time in the 



PREFACE. Vii 

Department of State, it has probably been lost. 
In the present work it is reprinted from Riving- 
ton s Gazette. There are discrepances, of minor 
importance, between this copy and another pub 
lished a few years ago from a manuscript copy, 
the origin of which was not known. As Riving- 
ton s Gazette was in the British interest, the let 
ter may be presumed to have been inserted in 
that paper with the knowledge of the author ; but 
it has evidently suffered from the carelessness of 
transcribers or printers. 

Although these volumes are intended to illus 
trate various parts of Washington s Writings, yet 
their contents have an independent value as con 
veying numerous original facts of history, drawn 
from the highest sources. The writers were among 
the most prominent actors in the political and mi 
litary events of the time, and, as they wrote with 
a full understanding of what was passing around 
them, and generally on topics of immediate import 
ance, their statements possess a weight of authority 
and a freshness, which insure their accuracy, and 
enhance their interest. Moreover, the characters 
of the writers, their respective qualifications, and 
relative agency and influence in public affairs, are 
here unfolded in a clear and impressive manner 
by the best of all testimony, a personal declara 
tion of their acts, opinions, and designs. As au 
thentic records of history, and as faithful memo 
rials of eminent patriots, these letters may be 
equally valued. 



VIM P HE FACE. 

The Appendixes to the first and second vo 
lumes comprise miscellaneous letters, designed to 
contribute additional facts concerning some of the 
large operations of the war, in which Washington 
was not engaged, except by a general supervision 
as Commander-in-chief, but which affected in a 
greater or less degree his own movements and 
plans. A few of these letters have been printed 
before, but they have mostly been taken from ori 
ginals among the papers of Generals Schuyler, 
Gates, Lee, Lincoln, Sullivan, Stark, and others. 
Together they will be found to lend some new 
aids towards filling out the narrative, and explain 
ing the events to which they relate.

CORRESPONDENCE 



RELATING TO THE 



AMERICAN REVOLUTION 



FROM NICHOLAS COOKE, GOVERNOR OF RHODE ISLAND. 

Providence, 12 July, 1775. 

SIR, 

I beg leave to congratulate your Excellency upon 
your being appointed General of the Armies of the 
United Colonies, which hath given sincere pleasure 
to every friend of America, and will, I hope, prove 
glorious to yourself, and be attended with essential 
advantages to your country.* 

The General Assembly of this Colony have the 
deepest sense of the necessity of a strict union, and 
the most vigorous efforts, of the Colonies to preserve 
them from unlimited servitude ; and their utmost ex 
ertions in the common cause may be depended upon. 

I also assure your Excellency, that I shall give 
you every possible assistance in my power; and that 
I am with very great regard, Sir, your Excellency s 
Most obedient humble servant, 
NICHOLAS Co ORE. 

* Washington arrived in Cambridge on the 2d of July, and took com 
mand of the army there the next day.

2 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM JONATHAN TRUMBULL, GOVERNOR OF CONNECTICUT. 

Lebanon, 13 July, 1775. 

SIR, 

Suffer me to join in congratulating you, on your 
appointment to be General and Commander-in-Chief of 
the troops raised, or to be raised, for the defence of 
American liberty. Men, who have tasted freedom, 
and who have felt their personal rights, are not 
easily taught to bear with encroachments on either, 
or brought to submit to oppression. Virtue ought 
always to be made the object of government. Jus 
tice is firm and permanent. 

His Majesty s ministers have artfully induced the 
Parliament to join in their measures, to prosecute 
the dangerous and increasing difference between Great 
Britain and these Colonies with rigor and military 
force y whereby the latter are driven to an absolute 
necessity to defend their rights and properties by 
raising forces for their security. 

The Honorable Congress have proclaimed a Fast to be 
observed by the inhabitants of all the English Colonies 
on this continent, to stand before the Lord in one day, 
with public humiliation, fasting, and prayer, to deplore 
our many sins, to offer up our joint supplications to 
God, for forgiveness, and for his merciful interposition 
for us in this day of unnatural darkness and distress. 

They have, with one united voice, appointed you to 
the high station you possess. The Supreme Director 
of all events hath caused a wonderful union of hearts 
and counsels to subsist among us. 

Now, therefore, be strong and very courageous. 
May the God of the armies of Israel shower down 
the blessings of his Divine Providence on you, give 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 3 

you wisdom and fortitude, cover your head in the 
day of battle and danger, add success, convince our 
enemies of their mistaken measures, and that all their 
attempts to deprive these Colonies of their inestimable 
constitutional rights and liberties are injurious and 
vain. I am, with great esteem and regard, Sir, 
Your most obedient humble servant, 

JONATHAN TRUMBULL. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL PHILIP SCHUYLER. 

Saratoga, 15 July, 1775. 

DEAR SIR, 

Since I did myself the honor to write to your Excel 
lency from New York, nothing very material occurred 
until yesterday, when I received the inclosed letters. 
The accounts contained in that marked Number One are 
truly alarming, in the present defenceless state of the 
counties of Tryon and Albany, and especially as the 
assistance I can afford them either of men or money is 
next to nothing ; the few troops at Ticonderoga, &c., 
being at too great a distance, and not more than suffi 
cient to guard the posts they occupy. I should have 
been at Ticonderoga this day, had not the informa 
tion from Tryon county arrived, which may make my 
presence there absolutely necessary, if it should be 
confirmed. I therefore propose remaining here until 
to-morrow, when I hope to be further informed. 

I wish I may be able to proceed to Ticonderoga, 
as I am very much wanted there, the greatest confu 
sion having taken place in the controversy between 
the officers claiming the command in that quarter. 
Some have taken the liberty to disband troops, others 



4 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

refused to serve unless this or that particular person 
commanded. The sloop is left without either captain 
or pilot, both of which are dismissed or come away; 
much provision wasted or embezzled,, and on the 7th 
instant only one barrel of flour at Ticonderoga. I 
shall have an Augean stable to clean there. 

I do myself the honor to inclose a return of the 
forces in this colony.* It is doubtless imperfect, as 
I have been under a necessity of forming it out of 
the returns which were evidently so. I hope soon to 
send you a more complete one. 

Be assured, my General, that I shall use my best 
endeavours to establish order and discipline in the 
troops under my command. I wish I could add, that I 
had a prospect of much success in that way. It is ex 
tremely difficult to introduce a proper subordination 
amongst a people where so little distinction is kept up. 

Our accounts of the disposition of the Canadians and 
Canada Indians continue to be favorable, though the 
intelligence is nothing very authentic. I am your 
Excellency s 

Obedient and most humble servant, 

PHILIP SCIIUYLER. 



FROM GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 

Lebanon, 17 July, 1775. 



SIR, 

On the 1st instant I met the Honorable Assembly 
of this Colony, to deliberate on the request and press 
ing reasons sent us from the Massachusetts for an 



* See this return in Washington s Writings, Vol. III. p. 43. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 5 

immediate augmentation of troops from this Colony. 
Our Assembly agreed to augment with two regiments 
of seven hundred men each, who are now raising to 
join the Continental Army. It w^as wished that we 
could have the advice and direction of the Congress, 
or your Excellency, before we took this step, but 
thought the present critical situation of our affairs 
would not admit the delay of obtaining it. Since 
your arrival at camp before Boston, views and con 
siderations of their situation and circumstances, I shall 
gladly be advised, and shall attend your request 
for the hastening and marching the men. 

There are thirteen hundred and ninety-one barrels 
of flour come to the care of Colonel Jedediah Hunt- 
ington, at Norwich, for the use of the army, which I 
have ordered forward. The busy season with the 
farmers renders its speedy transportation difficult. 
Please to advise of the need of hurry, and where it 
shall be ordered to be delivered. 

Our Assembly supplied Major-General Schuyler with 
fifteen thousand pounds in cash, and forty barrels of 
another necessary article. Accounts from the north 
ward are favorable. The brig Nancy, Thomas Davis, 
master, which arrived at Stonington with molasses, is 
removed to Norwich. She hath on board eighteen or 
nineteen thousand gallons. The Committee of In 
spection and Correspondence, I trust, will take proper 
care respecting both vessel and cargo. 

The road by my door being the nearest for post-rid 
ing from Cambridge to Philadelphia, I shall be obliged, 
wiienever your Excellency has occasion to send to 
that city, if the rider may be directed this way, and 
to call on me, for the convenience of any despatches 
I may have occasion to forward by him. Fessenden 
has passed this way more than once.

LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

I am, with great esteem and regard, Sir, your obedi 
ent and most humble servant, 

JONATHAN TRUMBULL. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Ticondcroga, 18 July, 1775. 

DEAR SIR, 

I do myself the honor to inform your Excellency 
of my arrival at this place early this morning- and, 
as a person is just going to Hartford, I sit down to 
give you the little information I have procured. 

A Canadian, who twelve days ago left St. John s, 
advises me that General Carleton has about four 
hundred men at that place ; that he has thrown up 
a strong intrenchment, covered with chevaux-dc-frise; 
picketed the ditch, and secured it with an abatis; 
that he has an advanced post of fifty men, intrenched 
a league on this side ; that there are many Indians 
in Canada; but believes neither they, nor the Cana 
dians, will join him; the latter he is sure will not, 
unless compelled by force. 

You will expect that I should say something about 
this place and the troops here. Not one earthly thing 
for offence or defence has been done ; the commanding 
officer has no orders, he only came to reinforce the garrison, 
and he expected the General. But this, my dear General, 
as well as what follows in this paragraph, I pray may 
be entre nous, for reasons I need not suggest, About 
ten, last night, I arrived at the landing-place at the 
north end of Lake George ; a post occupied by a Cap 
tain and one hundred men. A sentinel, on being 
informed I was in the boat, quitted his post to go 
and awaken the guard, consisting of three men, in 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 7 

which he had no success. I walked up and came to 
another, a sergeant s guard. Here the sentinel chal 
lenged, but suffered me to come up to him, the whole 
guard, like the first, in the soundest sleep. With a 
penknife only I could have cut off both guards, and 
then have set fire to the block-house, destroyed the 
stores and starved the people here. At this post I 
have pointedly recommended vigilance and care, as 
all the stores from Fort George must necessarily be 
landed there. But I hope to get the better of this 
inattention. The officers and men are all good-look 
ing people, and decent in their deportment, and I 
really believe will make good soldiers as soon as I 
can get the better of this nonchalance of theirs. 
Bravery, I believe, they are far from wanting. As 
soon as I am a little settled, I shall do myself the 
honor to send you a return of my strength both on 
land and water. 

I inclose to your Excellency a copy of a letter 
from Colonel Johnson, with a copy of an examina 
tion of a person lately from Canada, contradictory 
of the accounts I gave you in my last from Sarato 
ga. You will perceive that he is gone to Canada. 
I hope Carleton, if he should be able to procure a 
body of Indians, will not be in a hurry to pay us 
a visit. I wish to be a little more decently pre 
pared to receive him; in doing which be assured I 
shall lose no time. 

I have no way of sending you any letters, with 
a probable hope of their coming to hand, unless by 
express, or by the circuitous route of Hartford; by 
which only I can expect to be favored with a line 
from you. 

Generals Lee and Gates share with you in my 
warmest wishes. I shall devote the first hour I can 



8 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

call my own to do myself the honor to write them. 
I am, most sincerely, your Excellency s 

Obedient and humble servant, 

PHILIP SCHUYLER. 

P. S. Permit me, Sir, through you, to inquire the 
health of Colonel Reed, Major Mifflin, and Mr. Griffin. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Ticonderoga, 31 July, 1775. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

Since my last I have been most assiduously employed 
in preparing materials for building boats to convey me 
across the Lake. The progress has hitherto been slow, 
as with few hands I had all the timber to cut, mills to 
repair, to saw the plank, and my draught-cattle ex 
tremely weak for want of feed, the drought having 
scorched up every kind of herbage. I have now one 
boat on the stocks, which I hope will carry near three 
hundred men ; another is putting up to-day. Provi 
sions of the bread kind are scarce with me, and there 
fore I have not dared to order up a thousand men 
that are at Albany, lest we should starve here. 

I have had no intelligence from Canada since my last 
to you. Major Brown has been gone nine days, and 
I expect him back, if all is well, by Saturday next* 

2 August. 

I have not had a return from General Wooster 
since my arrival. I am therefore under the neces 
sity of making you a return of the troops here only. 

* See Major Brown s letter to Governor Trumbull, August 14th, in 
the APPENDIX. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 9 

I inclose your Excellency copies of two affidavits 
made by persons from Canada. I have transmit* 
ted other copies to the Congress. 

I am extremely anxious to hear from your part 
of the world. Reports prevail that a body of troops 
have left Boston, and are gone to Canada. If so, I 
fear we shall not be able to penetrate into Canada, 
or even attack St. John s with success, though at 
all events I am ordered to go there. I am 

Your Excellency s most obedient 

and most humble servant, 

PHILIP SCHUYLER. 

P. S. I wish I could make you a regular return 
even of the troops at this place and Crown Point, but I 
have not yet got these people to be regular in any 
thing, and therefore beg you to dispense with the 
following statement. 

Fit for duty, one colonel, three majors, nine cap 
tains, one captain-lieutenant, twenty-one subalterns, 
thirty-four sergeants, eighteen drums and fifes, nine 
ty-three rank and file, one chaplain, two adjutants, 
one quarter-master, one surgeon, and two mates. 
Sick, one lieutenant, four sergeants, two drums, 
one hundred and three rank and file. 



FROM GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 

Lebanon, 31 July, 1775. 

SIR, 

By the resolve in Congress of the 19th instant, it 
is recommended to the New England Colonies to com 
plete the deficiencies in the -regiments belonging to 
them respectively. 



10 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

I have not been informed of any deficiency in the 
number of troops sent from Connecticut, It is recom 
mended also to this Colony to complete and send for 
ward to the camp before Boston, as soon as possible, the 
fourteen hundred men lately voted by our Assembly. 
The 25th instant I sent orders to the Colonels of the 
last raised regiments to march forthwith to the camp 
before Boston, by subdivisions, if all were not in readi 
ness. I. expect many of the companies will begin 
their march this day, and that the whole will move 
forward very soon. 

The Honorable President Hancock, in his favor of 
the 22d instant, informs that you had recommended, 
and the Congress have appointed, Mr. Joseph Trumbull 
Commissary-General of the American Army. I am also 
informed that you have taken Mr. John Trumbull into 
your service and family.* These instances of kindness 
shown them justly claim my most grateful acknowledg 
ments. A performance of their duty, answerable to 
your expectation, will meet your approbation and 
continuance of regard, and afford me peculiar satis 
faction and pleasure. 

The Rose, Swan, and Kingfisher, ships of war, with a 
small tender, the 26th instant came into the harbour at 
New London. On the 27th some men landed near the 
light-house, broke off the nuts, and plugged up with old 
files three or four cannon. They sailed out again on 
Friday last. It is reported Mr. Collector Stuart is pack 
ing up his effects, in order to leave that port, I am, 
with great truth and regard, your Excellency s 
Most obedient and humble servant, 

JONATHAN TRUMBULL.

an artist. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 11 

FROM GOVERNOR COOKE. 

Providence, 31 July, 1775. 

SIB, 

I am favored with your Excellency s letter of the 
26th instant. Having just before the receipt of it had 
accounts "by a private hand of the sailing of a number 
of men-of-war and transports from Boston, which I con 
jectured were designed to supply the enemy with fresh 
provisions, I immediately sent the intelligence to Block 
Island, together with a quantity of powder, ball, and 
flints, to enable them to defend their property, and give 
them assurances of further assistance if necessary. 

We have no account of this fleet from any part of 
our coast; so that I think it probable they were des 
tined to the eastward. 

I desire your Excellency to oblige me with a return 
of the army ; and when any thing of importance occurs, 
I shall esteem an early communication of it a favor. I 
am, with great truth and regard, Sir, your Excellency s 
Most humble and most obedient servant, 

NICHOLAS COOKE. 



FROM RICHARD HENRY LEE.* 

Philadelphia, 1 August, 1775. 

DEAR SIR, 

After the fatigue of many days, and of this in par 
ticular, I should not sit down, at eleven o clock at night, 
to write to a gentleman of whose goodness of heart I 



A member of the Continental Congress from Virginia. 



12 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

have less doubt than I have of yours ; but well knowing 
that you will pardon what flows from good intentions, 
I venture to say that my hopes are, you will find from 
what the Congress has already done, and from what I 
hope they will do to-morrow, that it has been a capital 
object with us to make your arduous business as easy 
to you as the nature of things will admit. The business 
immediately before us being finished, the approaching 
sickly season here, and the great importance of our 
presence in the Virginia Convention, have determined a 
recess of a month, it standing now, that the Congress 
shall meet here again on the 5th of September. The 
capital object of powder we have attended to as far as 
we could by sending you the other day six tons, and 
to-morrow we shall propose sending six or eight tons 
more, which, with the supplies you may get from Con 
necticut, and such further ones from here as future 
expected importations may furnish, will, I hope, enable 
you to do all that this powerful article can in good 
hands accomplish. 

We understand here, that batteries may be con 
structed at the entrance of the Bay of Boston, so as 
to prevent the egress and regress of any ships what 
ever. If this be a fact, would it not, Sir, be a sig 
nal stroke to secure the fleet and army in and before 
Boston, so as to compel a surrender at discretion? 
While I write this I assure you my heart is elated 
with the contemplation of so great an event; a deci 
sive thing that would at once end the war, and vin 
dicate the injured liberties of America. But your 
judgment, and that of your brave associates, will 
best determine the practicability of this business. 

I think we have taken the most effectual measures 
to secure the friendship of the Indians all along our 
extensive frontiers, and, by what we learn of the spirit 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 13 

of our Convention now sitting at Richmond, a spirit 
prevails there very sufficient to secure us on that quar 
ter. The particulars of their conduct I refer you to 
Mr. Frazer for, who comes fresh from thence, and who 
goes to the camp a soldier of fortune. You know him 
better than I do, and I am sure you will provide 
for him as he deserves. 

We are here as much in the dark about news from 
England as you are, the London ships having been 
detained long beyond the time they were expected. 
The indistinct accounts we have, tell us of great confu 
sion all over England, and a prodigious fall of the 
stocks. I heartily wish it may be true, but if it is not 
so now, I have no doubt of its shortly being the case. 

I will not detain you longer from more important 
affairs, than to beg the favor of you, when your leisure 
permits, to oblige me by a line by post, to let us know 
how you go on. 

There is nothing I wish so much as your success, 
happiness, and safe return to your family and country, 
because I am with perfect sincerity, dear Sir, your 
affectionate friend and countryman,* 

RICHARD HENRY LEE. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Ticonderoga, 6 August, 1775. 

I thank you, my dear General, for your very kind 
and polite letter of the 28th ultimo, which I just had 
the honor to receive.f 

* See the answer to this letter in Washington s Writings, Vol. III. p. 68.- 
f Washington s Writings, Vol. in. p. 41. 



VOL. I. 



14 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

Immediately on my arrival here, I issued such orders 
respecting the provisions and stores, (which I found 
had been most scandalously embezzled or misapplied,) 
as I hoped would effectually have brought matters 
into a right train ; but it is the misfortune of the 
people here, that they do not know how to obey, 
although they should be willing. 

I have therefore directed the Deputy Commissary- 
General to send up a person, (whom I named and 
knew to be equal to the business,) to examine the 
Commissaries at the several posts on the communica 
tion, and to give them such directions as will, I 
hope, introduce regularity in future. Mr. John N. 
Bleeker is now employed in that essential business. 

With respect to the returns of the army, you will 
see, by the last letter I had the honor to write you, 
that I have had no success in getting them properly 
made, although I have drawn and given them forms, 
which I thought so clear that no possibility of mis 
taking them remained. 

I foresaw, my dear Sir, that you w r ould have a 
Herculean labor, in order to introduce that proper 
spirit of discipline and subordination, which is the 
very soul of an army ; and I felt for you with the 
utmost sensibility, as I well knew the variety of 
difficulties you would have to encounter, and which 
must necessarily be extremely painful and disgust 
ing to you, accustomed to order and regularity. I 
can easily conceive, that my difficulties are only a 
faint semblance of yours. Yes, my General, I will 
strive to copy your bright example, and patiently 
and steadily persevere in that line, which only can 
promise the wished-for reformation. 

Since my last I have had a verbal confirmation, by 
one of my scouts, of the intelligence contained in the 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 15 

affidavits which I sent you. I am prepared, with the 
utmost diligence, to obey my orders and move against 
the enemy, unless your Excellency or Congress should 
direct otherwise. In the course of a few days I expect 
to receive the ultimate determination. Whatever it 
may be, I shall try to execute it in such a manner as 
will best promote the just cause in which we are en 
gaged. 

Not a man from this Colony has yet joined me, 
except those I returned to you, and who were raised 
and paid by the Committee of Albany. Nor have I 
yet received those necessary supplies, which I begged 
the New York Provincial Congress to send me as 
long ago as the 3d of last month, and which the 
Continental Congress had desired them to do. 

The troops here are destitute of tents. They are 
crowded in vile barracks, which, with the natural 
inattention of the soldiery to cleanliness, has al 
ready been productive of disease, and numbers are 
daily rendered unfit for duty. 

I am so unfortunate as not to have one carriage for 
field artillery, so that if I am ordered to attack St. 
John s, and am able to get down the Sorel River, I 
shall labor under vast difficulty to bring up the can 
non through a very swampy country. They will be 
few, indeed, as I shall have less than a ton of pow 
der, when the troops are completed to twenty-four 
rounds a man. 

Congress has appointed Commissioners for Indian 
Affairs. As one of them, I have ordered messen 
gers to be sent into their country, to invite them 
to a conference at Albany. I have also requested 
the Caghnawagas to meet me at this place. The 
whole family of the late Sir William Johnson have 
held a line of conduct, that evinces the most inimical 



16 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

sentiments to the American cause. Sir John John 
son has had four hundred men, partly Scotch High 
landers, in arms, to protect a scoundrel sheriff, who 
had repeatedly insulted the good inhabitants of that 
country, which at length they retaliated. The inha 
bitants have, however, drove off the sheriff, and 
made the knight promise he would interfere no fur 
ther. I should not have hesitated one moment to 
have secured him and his adherents, had I not been 
apprehensive of evil consequences from the Indians. 
I therefore thought it most prudent to advise Con 
gress of the whole matter. 

Although, Sir, I am much in want of men, and 
would wish to have the three New Hampshire com 
panies, mentioned in the copy of your letter of the 
27th ultimo; yet they are so happily posted, either 
to awe the Missisque and St. Francois Indians, or to 
march to the relief of the inhabitants of this Colo 
ny, living to the westward of where these troops are 
now posted, on what are commonly called the New 
Hampshire Grants, that in case of an attack from the 
savages I have mentioned, who, if any, are most our 
enemies, I could wish them to remain under orders 
there for that purpose. 

I am extremely happy to learn that you are so 
well supplied with provisions. I have now a tolera 
ble stock of flour, but very little pork. Fat cattle 
are, however, coming up, so that I do not apprehend 
we shall suffer in that article. 

My best wishes attend Colonel Heed and Major 
Mifflin. I am, most respectfully, your Excellency s 
obedient 

Very humble servant, 

PHILIP SCHUYLER. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 17 

FROM GOVERNOR COOKE. 

Providence, 8 August, 1775. 
SlR, 

Last evening Colonel Porter delivered me your letter 
of the 4th instant, to which I have paid all the atten 
tion the importance of it demands. 

This Colony, the last fall, not confiding entirely in 
the precarious supply of powder that might be expect 
ed from the merchants, imported a considerable quan 
tity, though not so large as was ordered. The sup 
plying the inhabitants, who were in a manner utterly 
destitute, the army near Boston, and our armed ves 
sels, has so exhausted this stock, that the powder 
now left, which is all in this place, is greatly insuffi 
cient to resist even a short attack upon it. Our 
situation is the same with respect to lead. So that 
at present none of either article can be spared from 
the Colony. 

By a vessel, which arrived here on the 30th ul 
timo from Cape Francois, we are informed that the 
captain of the vessel, sent from this port to the 
Cape for a quantity of warlike stores, in which the 
Committee of Safety for the Colony of the Massa 
chusetts had interested themselves, had executed his 
commission, and was to sail with a large quantity in 
a day or two, so that she may be hourly expected. 
This Colony, about four weeks ago, despatched a 
suitable vessel with money to purchase fifteen tons 
of powder and other warlike stores, which may also 
soon be expected. Of these vessels we have the 
highest reason to think the enemy have gained in 
telligence ; the ships of war upon this station hav 
ing for several days past cruised continually off 
2 * 



18 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

Block Island, and from thence to Montauk Point, 
and up the Sound. 

This hath made us think it absolutely necessary to 
send the smallest of our armed sloops to cruise with 
out the ships of war, and endeavour, at all hazards, 
to speak with the vessels expected with powder, and 
order them to another port. She will sail this day. 
The other armed sloop, by being within the river, 
prevents the cutters and barges from committing de 
predations, so that she cannot be spared; nor, indeed, 
is a vessel of her force required for the enterprise 
you mention. 

We have, in this harbour, a very fine sailing packet 
that would answer the purpose extremely well ; which 
might be equipped with swivels, manned with about 
twenty men, and be ready to sail in less than two 
days. But as I do not think it prudent that her sole 
dependence should be upon getting powder at Ber 
muda, it will be necessary to send a sum of money 
to purchase a quantity at some other port, in case 
of a disappointment at Bermuda. In the present state 
of the Colony, I do not think it probable that a 
sufficient sum can be procured here for that purpose 
before the sitting of the General Assembly ; and there 
fore advise that application be made to the General 
Court of the Massachusetts Bay to advance part of 
the sum necessary. I believe we may be able to 
supply one half the sum here. Colonel Porter hath 
been at Bedford, and along the Eastern Shore, but 
can hear nothing of Harris. He is now bound as far 
as New London, to endeavour to meet with him; but 
is greatly apprehensive that he is fallen into the 
hands of the enemy. 

We have information that several ships of war and 
transports were, the day before yesterday, at New 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 19 

London; and that the country round were alarmed 
and mustering. We also hear that they have taken 
some stock off the east end of Long Island. 

Sensible of the great scarcity of lead in the coun 
try, I some time ago wrote to the Congress of the 
Massachusetts Bay, and to our delegates at the Con 
tinental Congress, recommending that a part of the 
large quantity of lead at Ticonderoga should be im 
mediately brought down; and still think the measure 
necessary. 

I shall immediately give orders to the Committee 
of Safety to purchase, for the use of the Colony, all 
the tow-cloth that can be had. 

If the powder, supposed to be at Bermuda, be pri 
vate property, it must be immediately paid for. If 
not, I imagine it will be settled with our other dis 
putes. This is a matter that ought to be known 
and provided for. 

Upon further consideration, I am very doubtful 
whether a vessel can be immediately provided with 
men here ; and therefore am of opinion that twen 
ty-five or thirty sailors had better be drafted from 
the army, and held in readiness to embark immedi 
ately upon the arrival of Harris. 

This letter waits upon you by my son, whom I 
beg leave to recommend to your favorable notice. I 
am, with very great esteem, 

Sir, your most obedient 

And most humble servant, 

NICHOLAS COOKE. 



20 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM GOVERNOR COOKE. 

Providence, 11 August, 1775. 

SIR, 

Since my last to you, Mr. Ward, one of the Dele 
gates, hath returned from the Congress. He informs 
me that some of the Bermudians had been at Phila 
delphia, soliciting for liberty to import provisions for 
the use of the Island. They gave information of the 
powder mentioned in your letter to me, and were of 
opinion it might be easily obtained. They were told 
by the Delegates, that every vessel they should send 
to the northward with powder should be permitted to 
carry provisions to the Island. Whether their situa 
tion will not probably prevent them from bringing 
the powder, I submit to your Excellency. Mr. Porter 
and Mr. Harris are both here. To Mr. Porter, who 
can fully inform you in the matter, I refer you. 

I have forwarded about thirteen hundred pounds 
of lead, which is air that can be procured at pre 
sent, that article being extremely scarce among us. 
In my last to you, I mentioned that I thought it 
might be brought from Ticonderoga with more ease 
than it can be procured in any other way; I am 
still of the same opinion. 

I have given orders to the Committee of Safety 
to purchase all the tow-cloth that is to be bought in 
the Government; but I am afraid the quantity will 
be small, the scarcity of coarse linens in the Colony 
having occasioned a great use of that article in fami 
lies. I am, with great esteem, Sir, your Excellency s 
Most obedient humble servant, 
NICHOLAS COOKE. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 21 

FROM GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 

Lebanon, 11 August, 1775. 

SIR, 

Yesterday, at twelve o clock, I received your letter 
by Major Johnson. I immediately gave the neces 
sary directions. Some companies I ordered to New 
London; others to New Haven; Colonel Webb, with 
the companies that way, if not marched, to take his 
station at Greenwich. Same day, at eleven o clock, 
I received a letter from Brigadier-General Wooster, 
dated the 9th, at the Oyster Ponds, on Long Island. 
He had with him four hundred and fifty men, besides 
militia, designing to preserve the stock at that place. 
The people on the Island had left it. He applied to 
me for three hundred pounds of powder, before I 
had made my answer and order for the powder, 
which I gave, notwithstanding our exhausted condi 
tion. On receipt of yours, I inserted an extract from 
it, for his observation. 

I am informed a quantity of powder for the camp 
is to be at Hartford this evening, and more to fol 
low soon. We have none lately arrived, which is 
daily expected. I request your direction, that of the 
next quantity that comes to Hartford, there may be 
lodged there so much as you shall judge expedient. 
Of what is expected do arrive in the mean time, I 
shall have no occasion to use your allowance. 
I am, most respectfully, 

JONATHAN TRUMBULL. 



22 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SCIIUYLER. 

Albany, Sunday, 27 August, 1775, 6 o clock. 

DEAR SIR, 

Your Excellency s favors of the 15th and 20th in 
stant were delivered me last night* 

I left Ticonderoga on Thursday, the 17th instant, 
and hoped to have returned in four days ; but, on 
my arrival at Saratoga, I received information, that a 
large body of Indians of the Six Nations were to be 
here on Tuesday last, and that my presence Avas in 
dispensably necessary. I therefore attended, and on 
Wednesday the congratulatory ceremony w r as per 
formed, and on Friday the treaty, agreeably to their 
request, was opened by them, by giving an answer 
to the messages that had been sent them by the 
Committee of this place. In this speech they antici 
pated part of what we had in charge to deliver them. 
Being (as we conceived) apprehensive that we should 
request them to take up arms in our cause, they ex 
plicitly declared, that, as it was a family quarrel, 
they would not interfere, but remain neuter, and 
hoped we would not desire more of them. 

We have not got above half through what w r e are 
directed to say to them, and, although 1 hardly know 
how to leave them, yet such is the nature of the in 
telligence contained in the papers, which I do myself 
the honor to inclose to your Excellency, I consider 
myself under the necessity of leaving the Indian 
business to my colleagues, and repairing immediately 
to the army. 

That Governor Carleton and his agents are exert- 



* Washington s Writings, Vol. III. pp. 60, 62. 



TPIE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 23 

ing themselves to procure the savages to act against 
us,, I have reason to believe from the various ac 
counts which I have received, but I do not believe 
he will have any success with the Canada tribes, 
though I make no doubt that he is joined by some 
of the more remote Indians, who, I believe, will as 
sist him as scouts from St. John s. I should, there 
fore, not hesitate one moment to employ any Indians 
that might be willing to join us. 

I thank your Excellency for the honor you have 
done me in communicating to me your plan for an 
expedition into Canada. The inclosed information of 
fires, which corroborates not only the information of 
Major Brown (that contained in the two affidavits), 
but every other we have had, leaves not a trace of 
doubt on my mind, as to the propriety of going into 
Canada, and to do it has been my determined reso 
lution (unless prevented by my superiors), for some 
time; and I have, accordingly, since my arrival here, 
requested General Montgomery to get every thing in 
the best readiness he could, for that I would move 
immediately, weak and ill-appointed as we were; 
and I learn with pleasure, that he has, since the re 
ceipt of Griffin s information, ordered the cannon to 
be embarked, and he will probably be off from Ticon- 
deroga so soon, that I shall only be able to join him 
at Crown Point. Such being my intentions, and such 
the ideas I have formed of the necessity of penetrat 
ing into Canada without delay, your Excellency will, 
easily believe that I felt happy to learn your inten 
tions, and only wished that the thought had struck 
you sooner. The force I shall carry is far short of 
what I could wish. I believe it will not exceed 
seventeen hundred men, and this will be a body in 
sufficient to attempt Quebec with, after leaving the 



24 LETTEES TO WASHINGTON. 

necessary detachments, (at St. John s, Chamblee, and 

Montreal, should we succeed and cany those places,) 
which would be respectable to keep an open and 
free communication with Crown Point, &c. 

Having now given your Excellency the time, force, 
and latest intelligence I have had, together with my 
opinion of the sentiments of the Canadians, I proceed 
to inform you of the enemy s strength, as far as I 
have been able to learn it; three hundred and fifty 
or four hundred at St. John s; one hundred and fifty 
or two hundred at Chamblee ; about fifty at Mon 
treal; and one company at Quebec. These are regu 
lar troops, besides between three hundred and five 
hundred Indians, Scotchmen, and some few Canadians 
with Colonel Johnson at La Chine. Of this party the 
Indians that are at St. John s are a part. Whether 
any ships of war are at Quebec, I cannot say. As 
none have been mentioned to me, I am rather in 
clined to believe there are none. Should the detach 
ment of your body penetrate into Canada, and we 
meet with success/ Quebec must inevitably fall into 
our hands. Should we meet with a repulse, which 
can only happen from foul play in the Canadians, I 
shall have an opportunity to inform your party of it, 
that they may carry into execution any orders you 
may give, in case such an unfortunate event should 
arise. 

Your Excellency will be pleased to be particular 
in your orders to the officer that may command the 
detachment, that there may be no clashing, should 
we join. 

I shall leave orders at Ticonderoga to forward all 
the lead that can be spared. 

Excuse these scraps of paper. Necessity obliges 
me to use them, having no other fit to write on. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 25 

Be pleased to make my compliments to tlie gen 
tlemen of your suite. Colonel Reed will be so good 
as to excuse my not answering his letter, as I really 
cannot find time. I am, dear Sir, with the most re 
spectful sentiments, 

Your Excellency s obedient humble servant, 

PHILIP SCHUYLER. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL WOOSTER. 

Oyster Ponds, Suffolk County, 29 August, 1775. 

SIR, 

I haye with me at this place four hundred and 
fifty of my regiment. I should before this time 
have returned to my station at Haerlem, but General 
Schuyler having ordered the three companies raised 
upon this end of Long Island for the Continental 
service to join their regiment at Ticonderoga, the 
County Committee requested me to remain here till 
the return of an express, which they sent to New 
York, to beg of their Congress, if possible, to pre 
vent the three companies from being removed. The 
express has now returned, with liberty for the com 
panies to remain here ten days from last Friday. 
It is thought best that I keep my station near New 
York, though I shall not return there till I know 
the destination of the fleet, which I understand, from 
your Excellency s information to Governor Trumbull; 
has sailed out of Boston. I hope and expect such 
measures will be pursued, as will prevent their 
taking the stock from this, or the adjacent islands. 

The inhabitants here think that, had General 
Schuyler known their very exposed situation, he 

VOL. i. 3 



26 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

would not have ordered the companies away. The 
New York Congress suppose they have no right to 
counteract his orders. They might indeed have sent 
to him, and received an answer in season, but they 
are so refined in their policy, have so many private 
views to answer, and take such infinite pains to 
keep out of the plain path, conscious, perhaps, of 
their own superior wisdom, that they do nothing like 
other people. It is now too late to send to General 
Schuyler. The Committee of Safety have therefore 
desired me to request your Excellency to continue 
their troops upon this station. I shall only say, that 
I know of no place so much exposed to the ravages 
of the enemy; and if the companies raised here, who 
have a great part of the good arms in the country, 
should be removed, and their places not supplied, I 
know of none so defenceless as this. It is my opi 
nion, after all the soldiers are gone, that two hun 
dred men might ravage the country, notwithstanding 
all the inhabitants could do to prevent it. From 
this representation I doubt not your Excellency will 
think proper to continue the troops raised here upon 
this station, or order others in their room. I am, 
with great truth and regard, your Excellency s 

Most obedient humble servant, 
DAVID WOOSTER. 



FROM GOVERNOR COOKE. 

Providence, 30 August, 1775. 



SIR, 

Your Excellency s letter of the 14th instant is 
now before me, the contents of which I have duly 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 27 

considered. When it came to hand, our small sloop 
of war was out upon the cruise which I men 
tioned to your Excellency in a former letter. She 
hath since returned. The sending her on the enter 
prise you propose could not be done without some 
new and further powers from the General Assembly, 
which sat here last w r eek ; and the nature of the 
business was such, that I did not think proper to 
lay it before so large a body. I therefore procured 
a committee to be appointed to transact all business 
necessary for the common safety during the recess 
of the Assembly, particularly with power to employ 
the two vessels of war in such service as they should 
think necessary. The committee is summoned to 
meet this day, before whom I shall lay your letter. 
At present the undertaking appears to me extreme 
ly difficult. The most suitable man we have for the 
purpose is confined to his bed by sickness. 

We have accounts that a number of vessels have 
sailed lately from Boston, which we apprehend are 
designed to plunder the stock along the coast. The 
General Assembly have ordered it all to be removed 
from all the islands in this Colony, excepting Rhode 
Island. We have now about three hundred men em 
ployed in that business. I am requested, by the 
General Assembly, to apply to you to give direction 
to the Commissary-General, that all the stock taken 
from the islands that are fit to kill be taken for the 
use of the army, in preference to any stock which 
is secure in the country. The drought hath been 
so severe along the sea-coast this summer, that there 
is no possibility of providing for this stock in any 
other way. 

The scarcity of coarse linens hath caused such a 
demand for tow-cloth for family use, that upon in- 



28 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

quiry I find there is scarcely any of that article to 
be had in the Government at any rate. 

The vessel our small sloop was cruising for, arrived 
on the 28th instant at Norwich. She hath brought 
powder, lead, flints, and small arms. What quantity 
of each I am not certain. They are now on their 
way by land. 

This letter waits upon your Excellency by Captain 
Joseph Brown, who is an eminent merchant here, a 
true friend to the liberties of his country, extremely 
well respected among us, and noted for his superior 
mechanical genius. If he hath any thing to propose 
for the service of the common cause, I have no 
doubt of your paying attention to it, and giving it 
the weight it shall appear to you to deserve. I am, 
with very great esteem and regard, Sir, your Excel 
lency s most obedient and 

Most humble servant, 

NICHOLAS COOKE. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Ticondcroga, 31 August, 1775. 

DEAR SIR, 

I arrived here last night, and immediately received 
orders for sending you the lead (my former ones 
not having- come to hand). It will leave Crown 
Point this afternoon, and be forwarded without loss 
of time to you. 

General Montgomery leaves Crown Point to-day, 
with twelve hundred men and four twelve-pounders. 
I follow him this evening, and have ordered the 
whole strength I can spare to join me at Isle aux 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 29 

Noix without delay. When they arrive there, which 
I hope will be in five days, I shall then be near 
two thousand strong. I am still of opinion that the 
Canadians and Indians will be friendly to us, unless 
[for] the imprudence of a Captain Baker, who, without 
my leave, went upon a scout, and, contrary to the 
most pointed and express orders, seeing some people 
in a boat that belonged to us, attempted to fire on 
them, but, his gun missing, he was instantly shot 
through the head and expired. His party consisted 
of five men, and the other of an equal number, one 
of which, an Indian, was only seen to paddle away. 

I will neither detain your Excellency, nor waste 
my time (which is precious) in giving you a detail 
of the many wants I labor under. I hope they will 
serve for an evening chat at some future day. 

You would have cause to blame me for not send 
ing a return of the forces under my command, but I 
cannot get one that may in the least be depended 
upon. I know the reason, but so critical is my 
situation, that I sacrifice every thing to the grand 
object. I have sent on only six ; but I have 

promised not to complain. Adieu, my dear General. 
I am, with the most respectful sentiments, 

Your most obedient servant, 

PHILIP SCHUYLER. 

P. S. My situation will apologize for this utter 
scrawl. Since writing the above, I have received 
the papers, of which a copy is inclosed.

30 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM GOVERNOR COOKE. 

Providence, 2 September, 1775. 

SIR, 

I am favored with your Excellency s letter, of the 
31st of last month, by Captain Baylor, who hath 
purchased the warlike stores imported by Messrs. 
Clarke & Nightingale. The prices appear to be very 
high ; but, considering the cost, expenses, and risk, I 
believe they are as low as can reasonably be expected. 

In the letter I did myself the honor to write you 
by Mr. Brown, I mentioned the extreme scarcity of 
tow-cloth in the Colony. There is indeed none to 
be purchased. 

The Committee, appointed to act during the recess 
of the General Assembly, have given your proposal 
for taking the powder from Bermuda a full con 
sideration, and have come to a resolution to make 
the attempt. Captain Abraham Whipple, the com 
mander of the two armed vessels in the service of 
this Colony, who hath been very ill, but is now 
upon the recovery, hath been consulted, and will 
undertake the enterprise as soon as his health will 
permit. He is deemed the most suitable person to 
conduct it that we have. He requests your Excel 
lency to give him a line under your hand, assuring 
the people of Bermuda that, in case of their assist 
ance, you will recommend it to the Continental Con 
gress to permit them to fetch provisions for the use 
of the Island. He does not propose to make any 
use of it, unless he shall find it utterly impracticable 
to obtain the powder without their assistance. I am, 
with much esteem and respect, Sir, your most obe 
dient Humble servant, 

NICHOLAS COOKE. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 31 

FROM GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 

Lebanon, 5 September, 1775. 

SIR, 

Your Excellency s favor of the 2d instant was 
delivered to me last night.* This afternoon I re 
ceived General Schuyler s, of the 31st of August. 
He has ordered the lead to Albany, with directions 
to forward it by the most direct route to your camp. 

We are infested by ministerial ships and trans 
ports. I gave your Commissary-General a narrative 
yesterday, and beg leave to refer you to him, from 
the haste of this express. Our coasts are kept in 
continual alarm. Three ships of war, with thirteen 
other vessels of divers sorts, were seen off Fisher s 
Island, and in the Sound, yesterday. They have 
gained no provisions from the main. Have heard 
nothing from Montauk, or any part of Long Island. 
New London is in great fears, and Stonington ex 
pects another attack. I have ordered the new-raised 
levies to guard and defend those two places, and 
the coasts as far as Connecticut River. There are 
likewise four companies of them beyond the river, for 
defence in those parts. This appears absolutely ne 
cessary for their security at present. Hope this use 
of them, till these dangers are over, will neither in 
jure nor hinder any of your operations. 

Whether these are the same ships your Excellency 
noticed us of, remains uncertain. Yesterday, ordered 
the best intelligence to be gained, to render that 
matter more certain. 

Lord s day morning, constrained by the weather, 



* Washington s Writings, Vol. III. p. 74. 



32 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

came into the harbour at New London a schooner, 
taken by the Rose, Captain Wallace, at Stonington; 
four hands on board ; one, a white man, sent to Wind- 
ham gaol; the other three, negroes, two belonging to 
Governor Cooke and one to Newport, ordered to be 
returned to their masters, and the schooner to her 
owner. General Schuyler s army is moved forward 
a few days will determine the event. 

I have ordered our Commissaries in the several 
counties to send to your camp all the hunting shirts 
they can procure. I am, with great esteem and re 
gard, Sir, your very obedient and 

Most humble servant, 

JONATHAN TRUMBULL. 



FROM PEYTON RANDOLPH.* 

G September, 1775. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have it in command to transmit to you the 
thanks of the Convention of Virginia for the faithful 
discharge of the important trust reposed in you, as 
one of their Delegates to the Continental Congress. 
Your appointment to an office of much consequence 
to America, and incompatible with your attendance 
on this duty, was the only reason that could have 
induced them not to call you to the Convention. 
Your brother Delegates were unanimous in their ac 
knowledgments ; and you will believe it gives me the 
greatest satisfaction to convey to you the sentiments 



* The first President of the Continental Congress, and at this time 
President of the Convention of Virginia. 



JHE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 33 

of your countrymen, and at the same time to give 
you every testimony of my approbation and esteem. 

The Convention appointed Mr. Henry Colt Com- 
mander-in-Chief of the army of observation to be 
raised, which is to consist of one thousand men, to 
be divided into two regiments. Mr. William Woodford 
commands the second. The Lieutenant-Colonels are 
Christian and Scott. Besides these, the Colony being 
divided into sixteen districts, each district is to be 
trained and disciplined, and to be paid during the 
time of training, and while in actual service. Mr. 
Henry is excluded from the Congress, the Convention 
having resolved that an officer commanding in the 
military shall not be a member of the Congress, Con 
vention, or Committee of Safety. Mr. Pendleton and 
Mr. Bland both resigned, and in their room Colonel 
Nelson, Mr. Wythe, and Colonel Frank Lee,* are ap 
pointed delegates to the Congress. 

I am much obliged to you for your letters. That 
relating to the action of the men-of-war and transports 
did not come to hand till the account had been in 
Virginia some time. 

I shall be much obliged to you to remember me to 
Edmund. 

I am your obedient servant, 

PEYTON RANDOLPH.

34 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM GOVERNOR COOKE. 

Providence, 9 September, 1775. 

SIR, 

I am to acknowledge the receipt of your Excellen 
cy s letter of the 6th instant, and to inform you, 
that, zealous to do every thing in our power to 
serve the common cause of America, the Committee 
have determined, instead of the small armed sloop, 
to send the large vessel, with fifty men, upon the 
Bermuda enterprise ; with orders to Captain Whipple 
to cruise ten days off Sandy Hook for the packet 
expected from England; and, if he is so fortunate as 
to meet her, to put the letters ashore at South 
Hampton, and send them by express to your Excel 
lency. She will sail, wind and weather permitting, 
the beginning of the week. 

There is in this town a Mr. De Ville. a French 
man, who hath made several voyages from this port 
during the last four or five years, and is esteemed a 
person every way w r ell qualified, and to be depended 
upon, for the execution of the plan he proposes. 
He was with Captain Hopkins the last voyage, 
when lie imported the ammunition, &c,, lately pur 
chased of Messrs. Clarke & Nightingale for the 
army; and hath brought with him a set of papers 
to qualify a brig as a French bottom. 

His scheme is to proceed to Bayonne, in France, 
where he is w r ell acquainted, and there to take in a 
load of powder, which he says can be effected in 
three days. This despatch will be so great, that in 
telligence of the vessel cannot be sent to England 
timely enough for any measures to be taken to in 
tercept her upon her return. I think the plan prac- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 35 

ticable, and likely to be attended with success. We 
have here a brig, a fast sailer, and otherwise a suit 
able vessel for the voyage, which will bring about 
eighty tons, and we will undertake to fit one quar 
ter of her, and to supply the money to purchase one 
quarter part of the quantity of powder; which is 
the most we can do here. 

I have written to Governor Trumbull upon this 
subject, and desired him, if the plan meets with his 
approbation, to despatch a trusty person to confer 
with you upon it ; who can return through Provi 
dence, and let me know the result, so that we may 
immediately equip the vessel for the voyage. 

I have communicated to Messrs. Clarke & Night 
ingale that part of your letter that related to them. 
They desire me to present to you their respectful 
thanks for the polite notice you have taken of them. 

I have the honor to be, with much esteem and

FROM GOVERNOR COOKE 

Providence, 14 September, 1775. 

SIR, 

I am favored with a letter from Governor Trum 
bull, in answer to mine proposing a voyage to Ba- 
yonne, in which he informs me that the Council of 
the Colony of Connecticut are summoned to meet 
this day to take the scheme into consideration. 
This, Sir, is the time to exert ourselves in sending 
to Europe for powder, as the vessels may perform 
their voyages and return upon this coast in the

winter, when the enemy s ships are unable to cruise. 
I have written to our Delegates, strongly recommend 
ing it to them to use their influence, that measures 
may be taken to procure sufficient quantities of that 
necessary article. I have also advised them to move 
in Congress for opening some lead mines immedi 
ately, as the depending upon a precarious supply by 
sea, when we have such quantities in our own coun 
try, seems to me very preposterous. And I believe 
the article in this way will cost us less money than 
it can be imported for. 

Captain Whipple sailed on Tuesday, with sixty-one 
men on board; his vessel being clean, and every 
way in good order. I have given him instructions 
to cruise fourteen days off Sandy Hook for the 
packet, and, if he is so fortunate as to meet her, to 
take her at all events; to take out of her the arms, 
ammunition, and warlike stores, and to land the let 
ters at South Hampton, and forward them imme 
diately by express. After the taking of the packet, 
or the expiration of the time, he is immediately to 
proceed to Bermuda, and, if possible, take the pow 
der into possession, without any communication with 
the inhabitants. I have given to him strictly in 
charge not to make any use of your Address, unless 
in case of absolute necessity.* 

The noble example set by the Lord Mayor, Alder 
men, and Livery of London, in their late Address to 
the King, will, I hope, have a good effect in the 
other parts of the kingdom, and, together with the 
disaffection of the people of Ireland to the iniquitous

count of Captain Whipple s cruise, in Washington s Writings, Vol. III.

measures now pursuing against the Colonies, added to 
our own efforts, compel the ministry to depart from 
their favorite plan of establishing arbitrary power in 
America. 

This letter waits on you by Joshua Babcock, Esq. 
He is a gentleman of a genteel fortune, a member 
of our General Assembly, and hath highly distin 
guished himself in the glorious cause in which Ame 
rica is embarked. I beg leave to recommend him to 
your Excellency s notice, and am, with great esteem 
and regard, Sir, 

Your most obedient humble servant, 

NICHOLAS Co ORE. 



FROM GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 

Lebanon, 15 September, 1775. 

SIR, 

I have received your Excellency s letter of the 8th 
instant by the express, who was detained by sick 
ness, and did not deliver it till the 12th, in the 
evening; and my own bodily indisposition is some 
hinderance. Your peremptory requisition is fully com 
plied with; all our new levies will be at your camp 
with all convenient expedition. 

At the time they were by your direction to re 
main in the Colony on some reason to suspect a 
remove from Boston to New York, that they might 
be able to give them more speedy opposition, I 
ordered Colonel Webb, of our seventh regiment, his 
men being raised in the western part of the Colony, 
to take his station, with three or four companies, at 
Greenwich, the nearest town of this Colony to New 
VOL. i. 4 



38 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

York his Lieutenant-Colonel and company at New 
Haven; the residue of his and Colonel Huntington s, 
who were forward in their march, one company to 
Norwich and the rest to New London. Last week I 
sent orders to Colonel Webb to march the companies 
with him to New Haven, to be on his way so much 
nearer to your camp. 

I am surprised that mine of the 5th instant was 
not received, or not judged worthy of notice, as no 
mention is made of it. 

Stonington has been attacked and severely cannon 
aded, and by Divine Providence marvellously pro 
tected. 

New London and Stonington are still so menaced by 
the ministerial ships and troops, that the militia can 
not be thought sufficient for their security, and it is 
necessary to cast up some intrenchments. We are 
obliged actually to raise more men for their security, 
and for the towns of New Haven and Lyme. I 
hoped some of the new levies might have been left 
here till these dangers were over, without injury to 
your own operations. I own that must be left to 
your judgment; yet it would have given me plea 
sure to have been acquainted that you did con 
sider it. 

I thank Divine Providence and you for this early 
warning to great care and watchfulness, that so the 
union of the Colonies may be settled on a perma 
nent and happy basis. 

I have before me your more acceptable letter of 
the 9th instant. The necessities of the Colony to 
supply our two armed vessels, to furnish the men 
necessarily raised for defence of our seaports and 
coasts, and to raise the lead ore, which appears very 
promising, prevent our being able to spare more 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 39 

than half a ton, which is ordered forward with expe 
dition. Before the necessity of raising more men 
appeared, we intended to send a ton. 

You may depend on our utmost exertions for the 
defence and security of the constitutional rights and 
liberty of the Colonies, and of our own in particular. 
None have shown greater forwardness, and thereby 
rendered themselves more the objects of ministerial 
vengeance. I am, with great esteem and regard for 
your personal character, Sir, your most obedient and 

Very humble servant, 

JONATHAN TRUMBULL. 

P. S. The Glasgow and Rose men-of-war are 
now at Newport, and threaten that, on the return of 
the Swan from Boston, probably with men for the 
purpose, they will attack New London and Stoning- 
ton. All the regiments in the Colony, at a great 
expense, have been disciplined ; and one quarter of 
them on the sea-coast are situated, equipped, and 
held in readiness as minute-men for every emer 
gency* 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Ticonderoga, 20 September, 1775. 

DEAR SIR, 

The day after I did myself the honor to write 

your Excellency from Albany, I set out for this 

place and arrived here on the 30th ultimo, much

40 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

indisposed with a bilious fever. Next day I fol 
lowed General Montgomery, whom I overtook on the 
4th instant at the Isle-la-Motte, he having "been 
detained by adverse winds and rainy weather. On 
that day we moved on to Isle-aux-Noix, twelve miles 
south of St. John s. On the 5th I drew a Declara 
tion, (but was so ill that it is not such as I could 
wish, a copy of which you have inclosed,) which I 
sent into Canada by Major Brown and Mr. Allen; 
and as we judged that going to St. John s, weak as 
we were, (our numbers not exceeding one thousand, 
and the little artillery we had not come up,) might 
have a good effect on the Canadians and encou 
rage them to join us, we resolved upon the measure, 
and landed our baggage and provisions, except for 
four days, and early on the 6th embarked, and, with 
out any obstructions, proceeded towards St. John s. 
When we arrived in sight of it, and at the distance 
of about two miles, the enemy began to cannonade, 
but did us no damage. We approached half a mile 
nearer and then landeH without opposition, in a close, 
deep swamp, which extended to very near the fort. 
Here we formed, and marched in the best order 
we could towards the fort, to reconnoitre. Major 
Hobby, of Waterbury s, with a detachment flanked 
the left wing, and was something advanced before 
the main body, when he was attacked, in crossing a 
deep muddy brook, by a party of Indians, from 
whom he received a heavy fire; but our men push 
ing on, they soon gave way and left us the ground. 
In the rencounter we had a sergeant, a corporal, 
and three privates killed, and one missing ; eight pri 
vates wounded, three of whom died the ensuing 
night; Major Hobby shot through the thigh, Captain 
Mead through the shoulder, and Lieutenant Brown 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 41 

in the hand. These gentlemen are all out of dan 
ger. Night coming on, and the swamp being almost 
impassable, we drew our men together, and east up a 
small intrenchment to defend ourselves in case of an 
attack in the night. In the evening a gentleman, 
Mr. (whose name I can only mention to 

jyour Excellency, not having even ventured it to the 
( Congress, and therefore beg you to erase the scored 
part of the letter after persual,) came to me and 
| gave me the following account; "That there were 
no regular troops in Canada, but the twenty-sixth 
regiment; that all these, except fifty at Montreal, 
were at St. John s and Chamblee ; that there were 
then at St. John s about one hundred Indians, and 
that there was a considerable body with Colonel 
Johnson; that the fortifications were complete and 
strong, and plentifully furnished with cannon; that 
the vessel was launched, and had one mast in and 
the other ready to raise; that she would be ready 
to sail in three or four days, and is to carry six 
teen guns; that he does not believe that our army 
will be joined by one Canadian; that they wish 
to be neuter on the occasion, but if we should 
penetrate into Canada, it would not displease them, 
provided their persons and properties were safe, and 
w r e paid them in gold and silver for what we had ; 
that in the situation we were in he judged it 
would be imprudent to attack St. John s, and ad 
vised us to send some parties amongst the inhabit 
ants, and the remainder of the army to retire to 
the Isle-aux-Noix, from whence we might have an 
intercourse with Laprairie. He told me that in 
the afternoon s engagement five Indians were killed 
and four badly wounded, besides several others the 
condition of whose wounds he did not know, and 
4* 



42 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

Captain Tyce, of Johnstown, who was "badly wound 
ed in the belly." 

On the 7th, in the morning, (having "been undis 
turbed through the night excepting by a few shells, 
which did no other damage than slightly wound 
ing Lieutenant Mills,) I called a council of war 
of all the field officers present, to whom I com 
municated the information I had received, and in 
close a copy of their opinion, which, being perfectly 
consonant to my own, I immediately ordered the 
troops to embark, and we retired. 

On my return to Isle-aux-Noix I immediately 
began to fortify the place, and to throw a boom 
across the channel, until my artillery should come 
up. On the 9th I received a letter from Canada, 
without signature, but which I knew to be writ 
ten by Mr. James Livingston (copy inclosed). As 
I had through other channels a collaboration of 
the intelligence contained in the former part of his 
letter, I resolved, as I had not yet iny artillery, 
to detach five hundred men into Canada, and gave 
orders on the 9th for their embarkation on the 10th, 
with an additional number of about three hundred, 
to cover their landing and bring back the boats. 
(Copy of my instructions to the commanding officer 
inclosed.) 

For the event of this intended expedition, see 
the paper which was drawn and delivered me by 
one of the party, and, from what I can learn, is 
just. 

This body returned on Monday, the llth. On 
Tuesday, the 12th, I found I had upwards of six 
hundred sick, Waterbury s regiment being reduced 
to less than five hundred. General Montgomery (for 
I was too ill to leave my bed) perceived, how- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 43 

ever, with pleasure, that the men were unable to 
bear the reproach of their late unbecoming beha 
viour ; and, taking advantage of this happy return 
to a sense of their duty, on the 13th I issued 
the orders contained in the paper Number Six. 
The 14th proved rainy, and retarded the embarka 
tion of the cannon. On this day Colonel Allen 
arrived and made the report, Number Seven; and I 
found myself so much better that I liad hopes of 
moving with the army, but by ten at night my 
disorder reattacked me with double violence, and 
every fair prospect of a speedy recovery vanished. 
Great part of the 15th rainy, the embarkation 
much retarded by it. On the same day I received 
the letter of which Number Eight is a copy. On 
the 16th I was put into a covered boat, and left 
Isle-aux-Noix ; and as it rained part of the day, I 
do not suppose that General Montgomery could 
move until the 17th, which proved fair. 

The mode of the intended attack on St. John s, 
as judged best both by General Montgomery and 
myself was as follows; to land as near the fort 
as we did the first time we went down ; the two 
row-galleys carrying a twelve-pounder each, and well 
manned; the sloop and schooner and ten bateaux 
with picked men, to lay in the river, ready to 
attack the enemy s schooner (which is complete and 
carries sixteen guns) in case she should attempt 
to destroy our boats, or get to the southward of 
them, and thereby effectually cut off all communi 
cation between this place and the army. After 
this naval arrangement (which will take three hun 
dred and fifty men), five hundred men to be sent 
as a corps of observation to intercept any succours 
between St. John s and Chamblee, and to keep as 



44 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

near the former as possible; two hundred men at 
the proposed landing to cover the boats and secure 
a retreat for the men in the vessels and boats, 
should the enemy s vessel [intercept them] ; the re 
mainder of the army to invest the place, make the 
approaches, and erect the batteries. 

You will perceive, by Number Five, that some of 
the enemy s boats fired on our people. Captain 
Douglas, who commands one of our armed boats, 
pointed and fired a twelve-pounder, loaded with ball 
and grape-shot, at them, and we have accounts that 
about thirty of the unfriendly Canadians were killed 
or drowned. In the first engagement, on the 7th, 
we killed them six Indians, two Caghnawagas, as 
many Mohawks, (Daniel, and Williani, a bastard 
son of Sir William Johnson s,) one Connasadago, 
and one Huron; and w j e are informed, by a Cagh- 
nawaga and Huron whom I left at Isle-aux-Noix, 
that not an Indian remained at St. John s, and 
which I believe to be true. Four deputies, who 
were sent by the Six Nations, and left Isle-aux-Noix 
on the 10th, to request the Canadian Indians to re 
main neuter, were not returned when I left Isle-aux- 
Noix. I have taken the liberty to desire General 
Montgomery to make a present, in the name of the 
Congress, to the Canadian Indians, if he should 
think it necessary. 

Since the affair of the 10th, the army at Isle-aux- 
Noix, which then consisted of thirteen hundred and 
ninety-four effectives, all ranks included, has been 
reinforced by Captain Livingston s company of New 
Yorkers, nearly complete; on the 16th, by Colonel 
Warner, whom I met, an hour after my departure 
with one hundred and seventy Green Mountain Boys 
(being the first that have appeared of that boasted 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 45 

corps) ; he left this with about fifty more, "but they 
mutinied, and the remainder are at Crown Point. 
Captain Allen s company, of the same corps, arrived 
here last night, every man of which was raised in 
Connecticut. About one hundred men of Colonel 
Bedel s, from New Hampshire, (his corps was to 
have been up a fortnight before, the remainder, one 
hundred and fifty of that body, were yet to come) 
joined, the 16th, at night; and I suppose the artil 
lery company, under Captain Lamb, will join them 
to-day. These last were indispensably necessary, as 
we had none that knew r any thing of the matter; so 
that the whole reinforcement consists of about four 
hundred. Yesterday I sent off sixty of Easton s, and 
one hundred and forty more are just embarking; 
this is the whole of that corps. About one hundred 
and twenty-five, of the first New York battalion, will 
embark early to-morrow, together with the company 
of Green Mountain Boys, consisting of about seventy. 

Two hundred and sixty, of the third New York 
battalion, remain here, which I will forward on as 
soon as I can procure craft, which is building slow 
ly, as most of the carpenters are gone home sick. 

Your Excellency s letter, of the 8th instant, I re 
ceived yesterday. I am happy to learn that the 
troops under the command of Colonel Arnold were 
to march so soon. I hope our people will commit 
no depredations in Canada; all possible care will be 
taken of it; but yet I have many fears on that 
score, as they stole thirty-two sheep at Isle-aux-Noix, 
contrary to the most pointed orders. 

Be assured, Sir, that I shall not fail of giving you 
the most early intelligence of every occurrence wor 
thy your attention. 

I find myself much better, as the fever has left 



46 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

me, and hope soon to return where I ought and 
wish to be, unless a "barbarous relapse should dash 
this cup of hope from my lips. 

The number of sick is incredible, and I have 
very little assistance to afford them. I wish I could 
make you a return of the army under my com 
mand; but I cannot get one; a great deal of foul 
play is carrying on. 

I am indebted to General Lee and Colonel Reed 
for a letter, but I am too feeble to write. Be 
pleased to assure them of my respect, and be so 
good as to make my compliments acceptable to all 
the gentlemen of your suite. I am, dear Sir, your 
Excellency s 

Most obedient and most 

Humble servant, 

PHILIP SCHUYLEP. 



FROM COLONEL ARNOLD. 

Fort Western,* 25 September, 1775. 
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 

My last, of the 19th instant, from Newburyport, 
advising of the embarkation of the troops, I make 
no doubt your Excellency received. 

The same day we left Newbury, and arrived safe 
in the river next morning, except a small vessel 
which ran on the rocks, but is since off without da 
mage, and arrived safe. I found the bateaux com 
pleted, but many of them smaller than the directions 
given, and very badly built ; of course I have been 



* On the Kennebec River, opposite the present town of Augusta. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 47 

obliged to order twenty more, to bring on the re 
mainder of the provisions, which will be finished in 
three days. Many of the vessels were detained in 
the river by running aground and head winds, which 
delayed us a day or two. The 23d instant I des 
patched Lieutenant Steel, of Captain Smith s com 
pany, with six men, in two birch canoes, to Chaudiere 
Pond, to reconnoitre, and get all the intelligence he 
possibly could from the Indians, who I find are hunt 
ing there. The same day I despatched Lieutenant 
Church and seven men with a surveyor and pilot, to 
take the exact courses and distances to the Dead 
River, so called, a branch of the Kennebec ; and 
yesterday, the three companies of riflemen, under the 
command of Captain Morgan, embarked with forty- 
five days provisions, as an advanced party to clear 
the roads over the carrying-places. Colonel Greene 
and Major Bigelow march to-day with the second 
division of three companies. Major Meigs goes off 
to-morrow with the third division, and Colonel Enos 
the next day with the remainder. As soon as the 
whole are embarked, I propose taking a birch canoe 
and joining the advanced party. I have found it 
necessary to divide the detachment for the conve- 
niency of passing the carrying-places, at the first of 
which there are some carriages to be procured. I 
design Chaudiere Pond as a general rendezvous, and 
from thence to march in a body. 

Inclosed is a letter to Mr. Coburn, from the party 
I sent to Quebec, by which your Excellency will see 
all the intelligence I have received. I have con 
versed with the party, who saw only one Indian, one 
Natanis, a native of Norridgewock, a noted villain; 
and very little credit, I am told, is to be given to 
his information. 



48 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

The Indians with Higgins set out by land, and 
are not yet arrived. I have engaged a number of 
good pilots, and believe, by the best information I can 
procure, we shall be able to perform the march in 
twenty days \ the distance about one hundred and 
eighty miles. 

I intended Colonel Greene should have gone on 
with the first division of one company of riflemen,, 
and two companies of musketeers. This was ob 
jected to by the Captains of the rifle companies, who 
insist on being commanded by no other persons than 
Captain Morgan and myself. This, Captain Morgan 
tells me, was your Excellency s intention but, as I 
was not acquainted with it before I came away, 
I should be very glad of particular instructions on 
that head, that I may give satisfaction to the field- 
officers with me. There is at present the greatest 
harmony among the officers, and no accident has 
happened except the loss of one man, supposed to 
be wilfully shot by a private, who is now taking his 
trial by a court-martial. 

Major Mifflin could not send money for the ba 
teaux. The Commissary has been obliged to pay for 
them, with one hundred pounds I have lent him, out 
of the pay received for the month of September, 
and has been obliged to draw an order in favor of 
the bearer, Mr. John Wood, who has engaged to de 
liver this to your Excellency. I have promised him 
his time and expenses paid. I should be glad the 
manifestoes might be forwarded on by him, if not 
sent with the last intelligence from General Schuyler, 
to whom I intend sending one of the Indians as 
soon as they arrive. I have the honor to be, very 
respectfully, your Excellency s most obedient 

Humble servant, 
BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 49 

P. S. Since writing the foregoing, I have received 
a letter from Colonel Reed, with the manifestoes;* 
and the court-martial have condemned the man who 
shot the other, to be hanged, which sentence I have 
approved, but have respited him until your Excel 
lency s pleasure in the matter is known, and design 
sending him back in one of the transports. Inclosed 
are all the papers relative to the matter, with his 
confession at the gallows before respited. 

The three first divisions of my detachment are 
gone forward ; the last goes to-morrow, when I shall 
join Captain Morgan as soon as possible. 



FROM GOVERNOR COOKE. 

Providence, 26 September, 1775. 

SIR, 

In consequence of your letter of the 18th instant, 
we have sent out our small armed vessel with orders 
to Captain Whipple to relinquish the voyage to Ber 
muda, and to prolong his cruise for the packet to 
the 6th day of October. 

Agreeably to your advice I have communicated 
the proposed adventure to Bayonne to the Congress, 
and most heartily wish it may be pursued, as the 
ability and integrity of De Ville are perfectly relied 
upon here. The following extract from Governor 
Trumbull s letter to me, of the 18th instant, will in 
form you of his sentiments respecting the enterprise, 
and his reasons for declining to take a part in it.

50 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

"In mine of the llth instant, in answer to your 
esteemed favor of the 9th, I acquainted you with my 
purpose to lay your letter before my Council, on 
Thursday, the 14th, which I did. They approve your 
proposition ; the way appears to them promising at 
the same time we have advanced money so largely 
for that article, and have great reason to expect a 
supply in a similar method, that they judge it not 
expedient for us to proceed further at this time. It 
is an article which requires our attention, and wish 
every method, that appears probable to obtain it, may 
be pursued. I hope General Washington will hearken 
to your application, and suitably encourage and pro 
mote your generous design." 

The time for which the combined army w r as en 
listed being nearly expired, it is of great importance 
to provide some method of reenlisting them, in order 
to keep up a sufficient force to restrain the enemy 
during the winter, and to take the field in the 
spring. My anxious concern on this head, which ap 
pears to me to be of the last importance, will excuse 
my suggesting to you the necessity of giving it the 
earliest attention, as I greatly fear difficulties may 
arise which will require time to obviate, and I can 
safely assure you of the concurrence of this Colony 
in every prudent measure for the effecting this most 
essential point. I am, with great truth and respect, 
Sir, your Excellency s most humble and 

Most obedient servant, 

NICHOLAS COOKE. 

P. S. Since the sailing of the small vessel, I 
observe, in the New York papers, that a packet is 
arrived there from Falmouth, which I take to be the 
same that Captain Whipple was sent after. If so, 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 51 

the opportunity is lost ; but by extending his cruise 
a little longer, he may have a chance for the August 
packet. 



FROM RICHARD HENRY LEE. 

Philadelphia, 26 September, 1775. 9 

DEAR SIR, 

Two days ago I arrived here from Virginia, which 
the late short adjournment just allowed me time to 
visit and return from. I brought two letters from 
thence for you, which come with this. Having some 
business with Colonel Mason, I travelled that road, 
and having sent to your lady to know if she had 
any commands this way, had the pleasure to learn 
that all w r ere well at Mount Vernon. As I suppose 
it will be agreeable to you to know what is passing 
in Virginia, I have inclosed you the proceedings of 
our last Convention, with two of Purdie s Gazettes. 

I am greatly obliged to you for your favor of 
August the 29th, and you may be assured I shall 
pay great attention to it. When I mentioned secur 
ing the entrance of the harbour of Boston, it was 
more in the way of wishing it could be done, than 
as conceiving it very practicable. However, the rea 
sons you assign are most conclusive against the at 
tempt. I assure you, that so far as I can judge 
from the conversation of men, instead of there being 
any who think you have not done enough, the won 
der seems to be, that you have done so much. I 
believe there is not a man of common sense, and 
wiio is void of prejudice, in the world, but greatly 
approves the discipline you have introduced into the 



52 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

camp ; since reason and experience join in proving, 
that without discipline armies are fit only for the 
contempt and slaughter of their enemies. Your 
labors are no doubt great, both of mind and body, 
but if the praise of the present and future times 
can be any compensation, you will have a plentiful 
portion of that. Of one thing you may certainly 
rest assured, that the Congress will do every thing 
iii their powder to make your most weighty business 
easy to you. I think you could not possibly have 
appointed a better man to his present office than Mr. 
Mifflin. He is a singular man, and you certainly 
will meet with the applause and support of all good 
men, by promoting and countenancing real merit and 
public virtue, in opposition to all private interests 
and partial affections. You will see, in the proceed 
ings of our Convention, that they have agreed to 
raise the pay of our rifle officers and men to the 
Virginia standard. It may, perhaps, encourage them 
to be told this. 

We have no late accounts from England ; but from 
what we have had that can be relied on, it seems 
almost certain, that our enemies there must shortly 
meet with a total overthrow. The entire failure 
of all their schemes, and the rising spirit of the 
people, strongly expressed by the remonstrance of 
the Livery of London to the King, clearly denote 
this. The ministry had their sole reliance on the 
impossibility of the Americans finding money to sup 
port an army, on the great aid their cause would 
receive from Canada, and consequent triumph of their 
forces over the liberties and rights of America. The 
reverse of all this has happened ; and very soon, now, 
our commercial resistance will begin sorely to dis 
tress the people at large. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 53 

The ministerial recruiting business in England has 
entirely failed them ; the ship-builders in the royal 
yards have mutinied ; and now they are driven, as 
to their last resort, to seek for soldiers on the High 
lands of Scotland. But it seems the greatest wil 
lingness of the people there cannot supply more 
than one or two thousand men, a number rather cal 
culated to increase their disgrace, than to give success 
to their cause. 

I beg your pardon for engaging your attention so 
long, and assure you that I am, with unfeigned 
esteem, dear Sir, 

Your affectionate friend and countryman, 

RICHARD HENRY LEE. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Ticonderoga, 26 September, 1775. 

SIR, 

I did myself the honor to address you in a long 
letter of the 20th, which I hope will come safe to 
hand. 

The day before yesterday I was favored with a 
letter from General Montgomery (copy of which in 
closed), on the contents of which, and on the report 
of the Indian deputies, I do myself the pleasure to 
congratulate your Excellency. I have made some 
explanatory notes on General Montgomery s letter, 
which I conceived might be necessary for you.* I 
made a short speech to the Indian deputies, gave 
them a present, and they left me in high good humor, 
and with a very good opinion of our army. 

*See this letter, in the Appendix, dated 19th September.

54 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

The vexation of spirit under which I labor, that a 
barbarous complication of disorders should prevent me 
from reaping those laurels for which I have unwea- 
riedly wrought, since I was honored with this com 
mand ; the anxiety I have suffered since my arrival 
here, lest the army should starve, occasioned by a 
scandalous want of subordination and inattention to 
my orders, in some of the officers that I left to com 
mand at the different posts ; the vast variety of 
disagreeable and vexatious incidents, that almost every 
hour arise in some department or other, not only 
retard my cure, but have put me considerably back 
for some days past. If Job had been a General in 
my situation, his memory had not been so famous for 
patience. But the glorious end we have in view, 
and which I have confident hope will be attained, 
will atone for all. 

I have discharged, or ordered to be discharged, 
every man that was so ill as to be rendered unfit for 
further service during this campaign, and that was 
able to return to the place of his abode. Those that 
were not, I have sent to the hospital. The former 
already amount to seven hundred and twenty-six, as 
per the inclosed return. 

My best wishes attend your Excellency and the 
gentlemen with you. I am, dear Sir, with the most 
sincere esteem, 

Your very obedient humble servant, 

PHILIP SCHUYLER. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 55 

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 30 September, 1775. 

SIR, 

Your letters, Numbers Four and Five, and two other 
letters not numbered, with the inclosures, have been 
duly received and laid before the Congress. 

As there are sundry matters contained in your 
letters, which are of great importance, and on which 
the Congress;, before they come to a final determina 
tion, are desirous to have the advantage of your ex 
perience and knowledge, they have appointed three 
of their members, namely, Mr. Lynch, Dr. Franklin, 
and Mr. Harrison, to wait on you, and confer with 
you and the Governors of Connecticut and Rhode 
Island, the Council of Massachusetts Bay, and the 
President of the Convention of New Hampshire, to 
whom I have wrote on the subject, by order of Con 
gress, and such other persons as to the said Commit 
tee shall seem proper, touching the most effectual 
method of continuing, supporting, and regulating a 
Continental Army. They will set out as soon as 
possible, and expect to be with you by the 12th of 
next month. 

I have the honor to be, with the greatest esteem, 
Sir, &c., 

JOHN HANCOCK, President. 



56 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 5 October, 1775. 

SIR, 

The Congress having this day received certain in 
telligence of the sailing of two north-country -built 
brigs, of no force, from England, on the llth of 
August last, loaded with six thousand stand of arms, 
and a very large quantity of powder and other stores 
for Quebec, without convoy; and as it is of great 
importance, if possible, to intercept them, I am or 
dered by the Congress to give you this information, 
and to desire you immediately to apply to the Coun 
cil of Massachusetts Bay for two armed vessels in 
their service, and despatch the same, with a suffi 
cient number of people, stores, and particularly a num 
ber of oars, in order, if possible, to intercept said 
brigs and their cargoes, and secure the same for 
the use of the Continent. It is also their desire, 
that you give orders to the commanders of the ves 
sels you send on this service, to seize and take any 
other transports, laden with ammunition, clothing, or 
other stores, for the use of the Ministerial Army or 
Navy in America, W 7 hich they may meet with, and 
secure them in the most convenient places for the 
purpose above mentioned; that you give the com 
mander or commanders such instructions as are neces 
sary, and also proper encouragement to the marines 
and seamen that shall be sent on this enterprise ; 
that the instructions you shall give be delivered to 
the commander or commanders, sealed up, with orders 
not to open the same until out of sight of land, on 
account of secrecy. 

If the vessels in the service of the Massachusetts 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 57 

Bay can be readily obtained, you are to employ 
them, and others, if you should think more neces 
sary, to effect the purposes aforesaid if they can 
not, you will employ such as can be soonest fitted 
out. At the same time I am directed to inform you, 
that the Rhode Island and Connecticut vessels of 
force, if possible, will be sent directly after, to the 
assistance of those you send out ; for which purpose 
I write, by order of Congress, to those governments, 
by this conveyance. 

For the encouragement of the men employed in 
this service, I am to inform you that the Congress 
have determined that^ on this occasion, the master, 
officers, and seamen, shall be entitled to one half of 
the value of the prizes by them taken, the wages 
they receive from their respective Colonies notwith 
standing. It is farther resolved, that the ships or 
vessels of war, employed in this service, are to be 
on the Continental risk and pay during their being 
thus employed. 

For further intelligence I must refer you to the 
inclosed, which I have not time to copy, as I am 
ordered immediately to despatch the express. 

I have the honor to be, &c., 

JOHN HANCOCK, President. 

P. S. The inclosed please to order to be delivered 
to the Council of Massachusetts Bay. 



58 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM GOVERNOR COOKE. 

Providence, 10 October, 1775. 



I have this moment received, by express, orders 
from the Honorable Continental Congress to despatch 
the two armed vessels belonging to the Colony, on a 
cruise after two brigs that sailed from England on 
the llth of August last for Quebec, with six thou 
sand stand of arms, powder, &c. I think it my duty 
to inform your Excellency, that the large sloop hath 
not yet returned from her Bermuda expedition, and 
that the small one is unfit for service, unless it be 
in our rivers ; so that it is not in my power to 
take any measures for intercepting those vessels. I 
also give the same information to Governor Trumbull. 
I am, Sir, 

Your Excellency s most humble servant, 

NICHOLAS COOKE. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Ticonderoga, 12 October, 1775. 

DEAR SIR, 

I did myself the honor to write your Excellency 
on the 26th ultimo, which I sent by the way of 
Albany. On the 4th instant I received the originals 
of the inclosed, except that marked Number Two, 
which came to hand yesterday. It chagrins me much, 
that I have not more frequent opportunities of ad 
dressing myself to you. 

I am extremely apprehensive that a want of pow- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 59 

der will be fatal to our operations. I have sent ex 
press to Albany and New York, but have not yet 
learnt whether I shall be supplied or not. 

The army is now supplied with provisions to the 
30th instant, but all the pork that is to be had is 
gone ; and although we have a sufficiency of fat cat 
tle, I fear we shall want salt. 

I inclose your Excellency a return of the dis 
charged men from this army. Exclusive of this, one 
hundred and fifty, at least, occupy the general hos 
pital at Fort George, and I fear as many more are 
ready to enter it. 

I begin to gather strength ; my fever has left me, 
and I hope soon to be able to join the army. Gene 
ral Wooster s regiment, I suppose, will be this even 
ing at Fort George ; they will be pushed off imme 
diately on their arrival here. 

Be pleased to make my best respects to General 
Lee, General Gates, and the gentlemen of your suite. 
I hope we shall all meet at a merry Christmas. 

Adieu, my dear General; my best wishes attend 
you through life, happy if I can have an opportunity 
of evincing how sincerely I am, dear Sir, 

Your most obedient humble servant, 

PHILIP SCHUYLER. 

P. S. This moment your Excellency s despatches 
of the 4th came to hand. Captain Buell waits for 
this; can therefore only thank you for them. 



60 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 



FROM GENERAL ARNOLD. 

Second Portage from Kennebec to the Dead River, 
13 October, 1775. 

MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 

A person going clown the river presents the first 
opportunity I have had of writing to your Excellency 
since I left Fort Western ; since which we have had 
a very fatiguing time. The men in general not un 
derstanding bateaux, have been obliged to wade, and 
haul them more than half way up the river. The 
last division is just arrived- three divisions are over 
the first carrying-place, and as the men are in high 
spirits, I make no doubt of reaching the Elver Chau- 
diere in eight or ten days, the greatest difficulty 
being, I hope, already past. We have now with us 
about twenty-five days provisions for the whole de 
tachment, consisting of about nine hundred and fifty 
effective men. I intend making an exact return, but 
must defer it until I come to Chaudiere. 

I have ordered the Commissary to hire people ac 
quainted with the river, and forward on the provi 
sions left behind (about one hundred barrels) to the 
Great Carrying-place, to secure our retreat. The ex 
pense will be considerable, but when set in competi 
tion with the lives or liberty of so many brave men, 
I think it trilling- and if we succeed, the provisions 
will not be lost, I have had no intelligence from 
General Schuyler, and expect none till I reach Chau 
diere Pond, where I expect a return of my express, 
and to determine my plan of operation, of which, as 
it is to be governed by circumstances, I can say no 
more than, if we are obliged to return, I believe we 
shall have a sufficiency of provisions to reach this 



THE AMEKICAN REVOLUTION. 61 

place, where the supply I ordered the Commissary to 
send forward will enable us to return on our way 
home, so far that your Excellency will be able to re 
lieve us. If we proceed on, w r e shall have a suffi 
cient stock to reach the French inhabitants (where 
we can be supplied), if not Quebec. 

Your Excellency may possibly think we have been 
tardy in our march, as we have gained so little; but 
when you consider the badness and weight of the 
bateaux, and large quantity of provisions, &c., we 
have been obliged to force up against a very rapid 
stream, where you would have taken the men for 
amphibious animals, as they were a great part of the 
time under water; add to this the great fatigue in 
portage; you will think I have pushed the men as 
fast as they could possibly bear. The officers, volun 
teers, and privates in general, have acted with the 
greatest spirit and industry. I am, with the greatest 
respect, your Excellency s 

Most obedient humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 

P. S. I have inclosed a copy of my journal, which 
I fancied your Excellency might be glad to see.*

62 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM GEORGE MASON. 

Gunston Hall, Virginia, 14 October, 1775. 

DEAR SIR, 

I wrote you in July, a little before my being or 
dered to the Convention, congratulating you upon 
an appointment which gives so much satisfaction to 
all America, and afterwards, in August, from Rich 
mond ; since which I have to acknowledge your 
favor of the 20th of August, which nothing but want 
of health should have prevented my answering sooner, 
as I shall always think myself honored by your cor 
respondence and friendship. I hinted to you, in my 
last, the parties and factions which prevailed at Rich 
mond. I never was in so disagreeable a situation, and 
almost despaired of a cause which I saw so ill con 
ducted. Mere vexation and disgust threw me into such 
an ill state of health, that, before the Convention rose, 
I was sometimes near fainting in the House. Since 
my return home, I have had a severe fit of sickness, 
from which I am now recovering, but am still very 
weak and low. 

During the first part of the Convention, parties 
ran so high, that we had frequently no oilier way of 
preventing improper measures, but by procrastination, 
urging the previous question, and giving men time 
to reflect. However, after some weeks, the babblers 
were pretty well silenced, a few weighty members 
began to take the lead, several wholesome regulations 
were made, and, if the Convention had continued to 
sit a few days longer, I think the public safety 
would have been as well provided for as our present 
circumstances permit. The Convention, not thinking 
this a time to rely upon resolves and recommenda- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 63 

tions only, and to give obligatory force to their pro 
ceedings, adopted the style and form of legislation, 
changing the word enact into ordain; their ordinances 
were all introduced in the form of bills, were reoru- 

O 

larly referred to a Committee of the whole House, 
and underwent three readings before they were 
passed. 

I inclose you the ordinance for raising an armed 
force, for the defence and protection of this Colony ; 
it is a little defaced, by being handled at our Dis 
trict Committee, but it is the only copy I had at 
present by me. You will find some little inaccu 
racies in it ; but, upon the whole, I hope it will 
merit your approbation. The minute plan I think is 
a wise one, and will, in a short time, furnish eight 
thousand good troops, ready for action, and composed 
of men in whose hands the sword may be safely 
trusted. To defray the expense of the provisions 
made by this ordinance, and to pay the charge of 
the last year s Indian War, we are now emitting the 
sum of three hundred and fifty thousand pounds, in 
paper currency. I have great apprehensions, that 
the large sums in bills of credit, now issuing all over 
the Continent, may have fatal effects in depreciating 
the value ; and therefore opposed any suspension of 
taxation, and urged the necessity of immediately lay 
ing such taxes as the people could bear, to sink the 
sum emitted as soon as possible; but was able only 
to reduce the proposed suspension from three years to 
one. The land and poll tax (the collection of which 
is to commence in June, 1777,) will sink fifty thou 
sand pounds per year ; and instead of the usual 
commissions for emitting and receiving, the Treasurer 
is allowed an annual salary of six hundred and 
twenty-five pounds. 



64 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

Our friend, the Treasurer, was the warmest man in 
the Convention, for immediately raising a standing 
army of not less than four thousand men, upon con 
stant pay. They stood a considerable time at three 
thousand, exclusive of the troops upon the western 
frontiers ; but, at the last reading, (as you will see 
by the ordinance), were reduced one thousand and 
twenty, rank and file ; in my opinion, a well-judged 
reduction, not only from our inability to furnish, at 
present, such a number with arms and ammunition, 
but I think it extremely imprudent to exhaust our- 
ourselves before we know when we are to be at- 
tacked. The part we have to act, at present, seems 
to require our laying in good magazines, training 
our people, and having a good number of them ready 
for action. An ordinance is passed for regulating 
an annual election of members to the Convention 
and County Committees ; for encouraging the making 
saltpetre, sulphur, and gunpowder ; for establishing a 
manufactory of arms, under the direction of Com 
missioners ; and for appointing a Committee of Safety, 
consisting of eleven members, for carrying the ordi 
nances of the Convention into execution, directing 
the stations of the troops, and calling the minute- 
battalions and drafts from the militia into service, if 
necessary, &c. 

There is also an ordinance establishing articles for 
the government of the troops, principally taken from 
those drawn up by the Congress, except that about 
martial law upon life and death is more cautiously 
constituted, and brought nearer to the principles of 
the common law. 

Many of the principal families are removing from 
Norfolk, Hampton, York, and Williamsburg, occa 
sioned by the behaviour of Lord Dunmore, and the 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 65 

commanders of the King s ships and tenders upon 
this station. 

Whenever your leisure will permit, it will always 
give me the greatest pleasure to be informed of your 
welfare, and to hear what is doing on the great 
American theatre. 

I most sincerely wish you health and success equal 
to the justice of our cause ; and am, with great 
respect, dear Sir, 

Your affectionate and obedient servant, 

GEORGE MASON. 

P. S. I beg the favor of you to remember me 
kindly to General Lee, and present him my respect 
ful compliments. 



FROM RICHARD HENRY LEE. 

Philadelphia, 22 October, 1775. 

DEAR SIR, 

I thank you for your obliging favor of the 13th, 
and assure you, that no man living approves the 
vigorous measures you mention, more than myself. 
Great bodies, you know, move slow, and it is as sure, 
that the most palpable and glorious events may be 
delayed, and the best causes finally lost by slow, 
timid, and indecisive counsels. We must be content, 
however, to take human nature as we find it, and 
endeavour to draw good out of evil. You will, no 
doubt, have heard the disgraceful conduct of our 
Norfolk [people], in suffering Lord Dunmore, with a 
few men, to take away their printing-press. 

It happened when the good men of that place 
6* 



66 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

were all away, and none but Tories and negroes re 
mained behind. Virginia is much incensed; and five 
hundred men are ordered immediately down to Nor 
folk. I expect, by every post, to hear of the demo 
lition of that infamous nest of Tories. 

By a vessel in twenty days from Quebec, which I 
believe brings us later intelligence than you had from 
thence when the last express left camp, we learn 
that the Lieutenant-Go vernor had twelve companies 
of Canadians in training, and that they were gene 
rally on their guard. But the same account says, the 
Government was so suspicious of the attachment of 
its troops, that they were trusted with no more than 
four rounds of cartridges. This still gives us some 
hopes of success in that quarter. Before this reaches 
you, you will have heard of Colonel Allen s unlucky 
and unwise attempt upon Montreal ; nor have we, from 
the last accounts, much prospect of success from St. 
John s. The ministerial dependence on Canada is so 
great, that no object can be of greater importance to 
North America, than to defeat them there. It ap 
pears to me, that we must have that country with 
us this winter, cost what it will. Colonel Stephens 
writes me from Fort Pitt, that the Indians on that 
quarter came slowly in to the Commissioners, and that 
they evidently appear to be waiting the event of 
things in Canada, when they will surely, according 
to custom, join the strongest side. We have so many 
resources for powder, that I think w r e cannot fail 
of getting w r ell supplied with that most necessary 
article. 

Hemeniber me, if you please, to General Gates, 
and to all my acquaintances with you. I am, with 
great esteem and sincerity, dear Sir, your affectionate 
and obedient servant, 

HICHARD HENRY LEE. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 67 

P. S. Monday Morning. T is with infinite concern 
I inform you, that our good old Speaker, Peyton 
Randolph, Esquire, went yesterday to dine with Mr. 
Harry Hill, was taken, during the course of the din 
ner, with the dead palsy, and at nine o clock at night 
died without a groan. Thus has American liberty 
lost a powerful advocate, and human nature a sincere 
friend ! 



FROM GOVERNOR COOKE. 

Providence, 25 October, 1775. 

SIR, 

Captain Whipple returned here from his voyage to 
Bermuda on Friday last. He had received authentic 
intelligence of the arrival of the packet at New York, 
before the first time limited for his cruise was ex 
pired, and immediately sailed for Bermuda. He had 
light, flattering winds for several days, and when near 
the Island met with a violent gale, which drove him 
three or four degrees to the southward, and oc 
casioned his having a long voyage. He put in at 
the west end of the Island, where the inhabitants, 
taking him to be an armed vessel belonging to the 
King, were thrown into the utmost confusion, and 
the women and children fled into the country ; but 
upon showing his commission and instructions, were 
satisfied, and treated him with great cordiality and 
friendship. They informed him, that, upon the pow 
der being removed, the Governor had given General 
Gage an account of the part they had taken in the 
transaction, who had despatched a sloop of war, and 
a transport of six hundred tons, to take all the pro- 



68 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

visions sent to the Island. They then lay at George 
town, and treated the islanders as rebels. Captain 
Whipple had five of the King s Council on board 
his sloop, who all assured him, that the inhabitants 
were hearty friends of the American cause, and 
heartily disposed to serve it. As the assistance they 
gave in the removal of the powder hath made them 
obnoxious to the enemy, and reduced them to a disa 
greeable situation, I think they ought to be treated 
with every mark of friendship. I submit to your 
Excellency the propriety of our representing their 
case to the Continental Congress, and recommending 
them to favor. 

We are fitting out Captain Whipple for a cruise to 
the Eastward, with all possible expedition, which I 
hope will prove more fortunate than his last. I am, 
with acknowledgment of the polite treatment I re 
ceived from you at Cambridge, and with great respect, 
Sir, 

Your humble, and most obedient servant, 

NICHOLAS Co ORE. 

P. S. I inclose your Address to the inhabitants 
of Bermuda, 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SCIIUYLER. 

Ticondcroga, 26 October, 1775. 

DEAR SIR, 

At two, this afternoon, an express from General 
Montgomery arrived at this place. Copy of his 
letter, with copies of the papers it inclosed, I do 
myself the honor to transmit your Excellency by 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 69 

express. The irresistible force of necessity having 
drove us to arms, success cannot be attended without 
pleasure ; and, therefore, I congratulate your Excel 
lency on the good account these papers contain. 
The reduction of Chamblee will, in all probability, be 
followed by that of St. John s, especially as General 
Montgomery has now a supply of powder, of which 
he stood in such need, that a very few days more 
would have expended his all. 

I wrote your Excellency that I should not .send 
on General Wooster ; but, as his regiment refused to 
go without him, I was obliged to suffer him to go. 
But, lest any detriment should accrue to the service, 
I thought it proper to write him a letter, of which I 
inclose a copy, as also a copy of his answer. 

I am in hopes that the next accounts I receive 
will announce the arrival of Colonel Arnold (whose 
success seems now certain), and the reduction of St. 
John s. I have requested General Montgomery to 
send me an express, as soon as he receives any 
certain intelligence from Colonel Arnold. As I can 
easily conceive that your Excellency s anxiety must 
be extreme, I shall forward what intelligence I re 
ceive by express. The great dread I was in, lest we 
should suffer for provisions, induced me to have all 
brought up that could be got; and it was very lucky, 
as the late heavy rains have carried aw r ay almost all 
the bridges between Fort George and Albany, and 
rendered the roads impassable, in which state they 
will continue at least a week hence. 

I am, dear Sir, with the best wishes for your health, 
your happiness, and prosperity, 

Your Excellency s most obedient humble servant, 

PHILIP SCHUYLER. 



70 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL SULLIVAN. 

Portsmouth, 29 October, 1775. 
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 

I arrived here in about twenty-four hours after I 
left you; have collected powder, so as to make up 
near thirty barrels, and have since been preparing to 
set an example to the other seaports, by setting the 
fleet at defiance. Upon my arrival, I was surprised 
to find that the boom, so much talked of, was not 
prepared ; that the bridge intended for crossing from 
the main to the islands, whereon stands the prin 
cipal fort (called Fort Washington), had nothing 
more done than one pier sunk ; that there was not 
a foot of the parapet, over which a man might 
fire, or even see his enemy ; that the embrasures 
at the foot were horizontal, as well as the top of 
the parapet; and, in short, not a moment s defence 
could be made, or annoyance given to the enemy, 
either with cannon or small arms. 

I immediately collected a number of gondolas, 
moored them head and stern, laid pieces from one 
to the other, and plank across, and soon completed 
the bridge. I then turned my attention to the 
boom, and in two days got it across, but found it 
could not stand the rapidity of the tide ; it soon 
broke, and W T C have again fixed it, so that I hope 
it may hold; but lest it should deceive us, I have 
taken a number of ships, and moored them above, 
with a great quantity of combustible matter in 
them, and shall to-morrow have them chained to 
gether, and, in case the boom should give way, 
set those vessels in flames. I have also a great 
number of fire-rafts, ready to let loose upon them. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 71 

I have altered the works, and I trust made them 
fit for defence, and I doubt not will, in two or 
three days more, be completely prepared. I am 
extremely thankful to your Excellency for the rifle 
men sent to our assistance ; it has indeed filled 
our people with gratitude ; and that my coming 
down was equally agreeable, your Excellency will 
see by the inclosed letter from their Committee 
of Safety. 

I have seen some men that were on board the 
fleet after the destruction of Falmouth. Captain 
Mowat showed his orders, which were, to burn all 
the seaports east of Boston.* When he departed 
from Falmouth, he told them that he must go to 
Boston, and take a recruit of shells, carcasses, &c., 
and then would visit Portsmouth. I expect him 
daily, but in case he does not arrive in a few days, 
shall despair of his coming. I must beg your Ex 
cellency to give me intelligence of any movement 
of their ships, with any orders you may think pro 
per with respect to my conduct while here. I shall 
give the earliest intelligence of any thing material; 
and remain, with great esteem, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

JOHN SULLIVAN. 

P. S. I inclose a letter from the eastward, which 
was inclosed in one to me, signed by one Major 
Goodwin, of Pownalborough. That infernal crew of 
Tories, who have laughed at the Congress, despised 
the friends of liberty, endeavoured to prevent fortify 
ing this harbour, and strove to hurt the credit of

Washington s Writings, Vol. III. p. 520. 



72 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

the Continental money, and are yet endeavouring 
it, walk the streets here with impunity, and will, 
with a sneer, tell the people in the streets, that all 
our liberty-poles will soon be converted into gal 
lowses. I must entreat your Excellency to give 
some directions, what to do with those persons, as I 
am fully convinced, that if an engagement was to 
happen, they would, with their own hands, set fire 
to the town, expecting a reward from the ministry 
for such hellish service. Some, who have for a long 
time employed themselves in ridiculing and discou 
raging those, who were endeavouring to save the 
town, have now turned upon me, and are flying 
from one street to another, proclaiming that you 
gave me no authority to take the ships to secure 
the entrance of the harbour, or did any thing more 
than send me here, to see the town reduced to 
ashes, if our enemies thought proper. Sir, I shall 
wait your directions respecting these villains, and 
see that they are strictly complied with. 



FROM JOSIAH QUINCY. 

Braintree, 31 October, 1775. 
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 

My worthy and dear friend, Dr. Franklin, the Hon 
orable Mr. Bowdoin, Dr. Winthrop, and Dr. Cooper, 
were the last week so kind as to honor me with 
a friendly visit, The conversation naturally turned 
upon the savage cruelty we are daily suffering 
from the unrelenting vengeance of a tyrannical Go 
vernment. In the course of it, the stopping up 
the harbour of Boston, as one salutary measure, 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 73 

was thought well worthy the attention of our State 
pilots; and upon my saying I had once, if not 
more than once, hinted the scheme to your Excel 
lency, they desired me to communicate my senti 
ments to you once more, in writing, especially as 
I had lately received a letter from the Honorable 
John Adams, Esquire, in Philadelphia, in answer 
to one of mine, which seemed to throw new light 
upon the subject. This, Sir, I beg may be a suffi 
cient apology for transmitting to you the follow 
ing extracts of those letters, with what has further 
occurred to my mind since they were wrote. In 
my letter I thus write. 

"In my former letter I said, the harbour might 
be blocked up, and both seamen and soldiers made 
prisoners at discretion; which seems to you in 
credible. Please to read, at your leisure, the fol 
lowing explanation. There are but two channels 
through which ships of burden can safely pass to 
and from Boston. One of them runs between the 
west head of Long Island and the Moon (so called), 
and is about a mile across. This is too shallow 
for any ship of war above twenty guns. The other 
is called the ship-channel, and runs between the 
east head of Long Island and the south point of 
Deer Island, and is something better than a mile, 
from side to side. This, the only channel through 
which capital ships can pass, leads, outward bound, 
through the Narrows between Gallop s Island and 
Lovell s Island, where the channel is not wider 
than the length of a fifty-gun ship. In the open 
ing between Gallop s Island and George s Island is 
Nantasket Road, where one frigate is always sta 
tioned, to guard the Narrows from being stopped 
up. Upon these facts I thus reason; 

VOL. i. 7 



74 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

"The Moon Island communicates, at low water, with 
Squantum Neck, almost dry-shod. A defensible fort, 
therefore, may be so placed upon Squantum as to 
cover the retreat not only from the Moon, but from 
Squantum to the main. One upon the east head of 
the Moon, and another on the west head of Long 
Island, secure that passage, and cover the retreat 
from the latter to the former. Another upon the 
summit, in the middle of Long Island, covers the 
shore on both sides, so as that no force can land 
without being greatly annoyed, if not entirely pre 
vented. Another strong fort, with heavy cannon, at 
the east head of Long Island, would command not 
only the ship-channel that runs by it, but the Nar 
rows and Nantasket Road, so that no ship could re 
main there with safety ; and consequently we might, 
by sinking hulks in the Narrows, prevent any ship 
of force from going out or coming in. If the pas 
sage through the Narrows is not stopped, I am sen 
sible that a ship, with a fresh gale of wind and 
flood tide, which is rapid between Long Island and 
Deer Island, might run through without any great 
hazard ; but, after the east head of Long Island is 
fortified, I can foresee nothing to hinder the Narrows 
being reduced to such a depth of water as that no 
vessel of force can pass through there. 

" This being effected, as I said above, both seamen 
and soldiers, if they do not escape by a timely 
flight, must become prisoners at discretion. I have 
been told there is, in one of the late English Ma&lt;ra- 

7 O O 

zines, an accurate draught of the harbour, which, 
upon examination, will enable you to determine, 
with precision, the bearings and distances from 
island to island, and the depth of water between 
them; and, consequently, whether such a scheme is 
practicable or not." 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 75 

Mr. Adams, in answer, writes thus : 

"I am much obliged by your kind explanation of 
your opinion, that the harbour might be blocked up. 
I must confess, although I was born so near it, I 
never understood before the course of the channel, 
and the situation of the harbour, so well. I have 
carefully compared your description of Squantum, 
the Moon, Long Island, Gallop s Island, Lovell s 
Island, and George s, the Narrows, and Nantasket 
Road, with A Plan of the Town and Chart of the 
Harbour of Boston, exhibiting a view of the Islands, 
Castle Fort, and Entrances into the said Harbour, 
which was published in London last February. This 
plan I knew to be inaccurate in some particulars, 
and the chart may be so in others; but, by the 
best judgment I can make, upon comparing your 
facts with the chart, and considering the depths of 
water marked on this chart, I think it extremely 
probable, with you, that nothing but powder and 
cannon are wanting to effect the important pur 
poses you mention, that of making soldiers and 
sailors prisoners at discretion. 

"Dr. Franklin s row-galleys are in great forward 
ness; seven of them are completely manned, armed, 
&c. I went down the river the other day, with all 
of them. I have as much confidence in them as you 
have.* But the people here have made machines, to 
be sunk in the channel of Delaware River. Three 
rows of them are placed in the river, with large tim 
bers, barbed with iron. They are frames of timber, 
sunk with stone ; machines very proper for our chan 
nel in the Narrows." 



* " I had wrote largely to Mr. Adams upon the subject, but have not 
copied it, for fear of being tedious." 



76 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

Dr. Franklin says they may bo made in the form 
of a chevaux-de-frise, and used to great advantage. 

I have wrote to Mr. Adams for a model of the 
machines he mentions, with explicit directions how 
to sink and secure them from being weighed or de 
stroyed by the enemy s ships. For my own part, 
since I have read what my friend has wrote, I am 
more than ever convinced of the practicability of not- 
only securing the harbour, but relieving the town of 
Boston, by making the present possessors of it our 
prisoners, and that without shedding much more hu 
man blood, provided we can once possess and for 
tify Long Island. 

I doubt not your Excellency will readily agree with 
me, that these are become objects of much greater 
importance, since the destruction of Falmouth demon 
strates the malicious resolution of our barbarously 
civilized enemies, to destroy all the rest of our mari 
time towns, if they can. 

If your Excellency, should think the above senti 
ments worthy of your attention, and, for maturing 
your judgment, conclude it necessary to take an ocu 
lar view of the harbour and islands, please to accept 
of my cordial invitation to refresh or repose yourself 
at my house, where niy happiness will be in pro 
portion to the freedom with which you receive the 
friendly salutations of 

Your Excellency s most obedient humble servant, 

JOSIAH QuiNCY. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 77 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Ticonderoga, 6 November, 1775. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

Your Excellency s favor of the 26th ultimo I had 
the honor to receive on the 3d instant.* 

I have long since signified to Congress the neces 
sity of a delegation from them to this place ; and in 
their last to me, of the 12th ultimo, they (unfortu 
nately for me) say that it did not appear necessary 
then. I took the liberty to lament, that they were 
not in sentiment with me on the subject, and to add 
that I thought it absolutely necessary that one should 
be sent, so that I hope soon to see some of the gen 
tlemen here. A variety of regulations are necessary 
to be made in this quarter; a task to which I feel 
myself greatly inadequate, but which, if I had even 
judgment enough to arrange with propriety, the shat 
tered condition of my constitution is such, that mat 
ters so momentous as these should not be left to so 
precarious an event as that of my being able to sup 
port the fatigue ; for General Montgomery, though 
endowed with shining abilities, will have his time 
so totally engrossed with other matters, that he will 
not be able to attend to these. 

Should success crown our endeavours at St. John s, 
of which there seems to be little doubt, the entire 
reduction of Canada will, in all probability, be the 
consequence; an event which will open new scenes. 
An army to be formed and properly disposed of in 
that quarter - y provisions, ammunition, and every ne 
cessary to be procured for it; preparations to be

78 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

made for the next campaign; proper places to be 
determined on, and fortifications to be erected, to 
defend that Province against any attacks that may 
be made on it in the ensuing year ; small craft to 
be constructed here, that a reenforcement may be 
speedily sent into Canada, in case it should be 
found necessary to support what troops may be sta 
tioned there ; galleys, carrying heavy artillery, to 
prevent vessels of force from coming up the St. 
Lawrence ; a mode of government to be adopted in 
a country, where all will be anarchy and confusion 
without it; and probably a variety of other inter 
esting regulations to take place, that do not just 
now occur to me. 

Your Excellency will do me the justice to be 
lieve that I feel, in the most sensible manner, the 
favorable opinion you are pleased to entertain of 
me ; and I am confident General Montgomery will 
not be less affected on what you observe of him. 
I do myself the pleasure, this day, to write that 
gentleman, and shall convey to him your best wishes 
and respects. 

The vast benefit that would result from a suc 
cessful conclusion of the campaign in this quarter, 
has been so deeply impressed upon me, that I have 
often regretted that the operations were not com 
menced at an earlier period, and, when commenced, 
that so much tardiness prevailed in sending up the 
necessary stores and troops. That you, my dear 
General, should feel an anxiety to induce you to ask 
those questions, which you have done in so polite 
and friendly a manner, is what I can easily suppose. 

The difficulties, under which General Montgomery 
has labored, have been in the extreme, and which he 
most pathetically laments in a letter to me of the 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 79 

13th ultimo, an extract of which I do myself the 
honor to inclose your Excellency, together with the 
opinion of a Council of War held on that day, and 
which I forgot to transmit you in the hurry with 
which I sent off my last. And in his letter of the 
23d ultimo he says ; " Our reinforcements not yet 
arrived ; at this instant I have not in my camp 
above seven hundred and fifty men, and I wish much 
to send a strong detachment to the Island of Mon 
treal " ; a manoeuvre which would have taken place 
sooner, had it been in his power, or been prudent to 
have gone into ; neither of which I think it was, and 
shall beg leave to make the following observations in 
support of this opinion. 

At no period, until this, has it appeared to me 
that it would have been prudent to have passed St. 
John s, although a sufficient force could have been 
left for forming a blockade ; for [it would have been 
hazardous] previous to the reduction of Chamblee, and 
the success of our troops in repulsing the attack of 
Monsieur Regouville, who was sent from Montreal 
with two hundred and forty men, and expected to 
be joined by the inhabitants of three of the most 
populous parishes on the south side of the St. Law 
rence, in which he was disappointed to a man, and 
which has in some measure evinced the temper of the 
Canadians towards us, and given us better assurances 
than any we have had of their friendly disposition, 
for until then their real sentiments were problem 
atical ; and about this time, too, we sunk their best 
armed vessel, so that w r e can now spare more men for 
an attack upon Montreal, which, if not prevented by 
other obstacles, was General Montgomery s intention, 
as soon as the reenforcement above alluded to should 
arrive, which took place on the 26th or 27th, and 



80 LETTERS TO AY A SHIN GT ON. 

consisted of General Wooster s, of three hundred and 
thirty-five, and Major Tuthill, of Colonel Holmes s, 
with two hundred and twenty-five, officers of both 
included. In the numbers, however, he will be dis 
appointed, as General Wooster had returned four 
hundred and eighty-four effectives from Albany, but 
discharged ninety-nine between this and Albany, and 
left fifty-one sick here ; and the others, too, fell greatly 
short of what I expected 

If a blockade had been formed before the above- 
mentioned events took place, it must have been suffi 
ciently strong, not only to have guarded against the 
danger of a sortie, but to have prevented the ene 
my s armed vessels, which greatly surpassed ours in 
strength, from getting to the southward of us, and 
thereby effectually cutting off every possibility of re 
treat ; which, if they had been able to accomplish, 
the Canadians, I do firmly believe, would immediately 
have joined Mr. Carleton. But if a sufficient body 
had been left, that to -make the attempt on Montreal 
would have been too weak for such a service ; and 
if they had met with a repulse, the Canadians, in 
that case, would not have hesitated one moment to 
have acted against us, (as Colonel Allen, in his re 
port to me, observes,) and all our hopes in Canada 
would have been at an end. But another difficulty 
presented itself, and which I do not know how the 
detachment which General Montgomery proposed to 
send, or has sent, will even now surmount, the want 
of craft to convey a body of troops, sufficient to pro 
mise success, to the Island of Montreal, across the 
St. Lawrence, (which is deep, rapid, and wide,) as 
no craft can pass the fort at St. John s to go down 
the Sorel; which obstacles would be immediately re 
moved on the reduction of that fortress, which I hope 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 81 

has taken place by this time, and then I shall have 
the fullest confidence that our labors will be at an end 
in this quarter, except from what difficulties may arise 
from the intemperate desire our people have to return 
to their habitations; my fears on which account I 
have expressed to Congress. 

If we had passed it wholly, and could have got to 
and succeeded against Montreal, St. John s would un 
doubtedly have fallen. But what a vast risk ! No 
less than that of the loss of the whole Army, the com 
mand of Lake Champlain, Ticonderoga, and Crown 
Point ; for no retreat could possibly have taken place ; 
the dependence on the Canadians uncertain. And if 
they had found us incapable of passing to Montreal 
for want of boats, or of retreating on the same ac 
count, it is certain we should have found them op 
posed to us. 

In this view of things, I hope it will be thought 
that either attempt would have been injudicious. 

I do myself the honor to inclose you sundry ex 
tracts of my letters to Congress, with extracts of 
their answers, by which your Excellency will per 
ceive that I have hinted at several things, which I 
conceived claimed the attention of Congress. I in 
close you, also, a list of the officers made prisoners 
at St. John s. The return of the non-commissioned 
officers and privates is either mislaid or by mistake 
inclosed to Governor Trumbull. 

Be so good as to assure the gentlemen of your 
family that they have my best wishes. I have the 
honor to be your Excellency s 

Most obedient and very humble servant, 

PHILIP SCHUYLER. 



82 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM THOMAS LYNCH. 

Philadelphia, 13 November, 1775. 

MY DEAR SIR, 

In consequence of your favor by Colonel Reed, I ap 
plied to the Chief Justice, who tells me the Supreme 
Courts were lately held, and that it will be some time 
before their term will return ; that he knows of no 
capital suit now depending, and that it is very easy 
for Colonel Reed to manage matters so as not to let 
that prevent his return to you. I am sure Mr. Chew 
is so heartily disposed to oblige you, and to serve 
the cause, that nothing in his power shall be wanting. 

I fear, however, that you will be some time in want 
of your Secretary, as I did not find him in haste to 
return, when I mentioned to him what is just now 
related ; he, doubtless, has many private affairs to 
transact ; the loss must be greatly increased by Mi- 
Randolph s absence, who, I hear, came to town last 
night. 

I am happy to inform you, that Congress has 
agreed to every recommendation of the Commit tee, :;: 
and have gone beyond it, in allowing the additional 
pay to the officers. I rejoice at this, but can t think 
with patience, that the pitiful wretches, who stood 
cavilling with you, when entreated to serve the next 
campaign, should reap the benefit of this addition ; 
they will now be ready enough, but hope you will

be able to refuse them with the contempt they de 
serve, and find better in their room. Could not some

of the gentlemen at the camp enlist the New Eng 
land men, who have been persuaded to leave you? 
Frazier told me he could ; it would be a capital point 
to convince the world, that it is not necessary to have 
bad officers of that country in order to raise men 
there. I can scarce bear their tyranny. 

I have a letter, from undoubted authority, that 
assures me that the destruction of the Parliamental 
army in America will certainly produce peace ; and 
by another, that the seizing Quebec will produce the 
same effect. I have no doubt America stands now 
indebted to her General for the one, and will, before 
the return of spring, for the other. Mistake me not; 
I have not altered my mind one jot since I left you. 
I mean not to anticipate your determinations, but 
only to approve your design to hover like an eagle 
over your prey, always ready to pounce it, when the 
proper time comes. I have not forgot your propo 
sition relative to that city. I try to pave the way for 
it, and wait for the season as you do. 

No appearance of peace on the part of the enemy, 
unless produced by necessity ; every human feeling 
seems to have forsaken them ; fear and interest are 
only listened to. 

We hear seven tons of powder are arrived at Rhode 
Island, and as many at Portsmouth. I hope it is true, 
as it will possess us of advantageous grounds, and be 
gin the enemy s destruction. It is suspected, in Eng 
land, that Howe s army will give you the slip, and 
land at Long Island ; which God, in his infinite mercy, 
grant ! We wait with impatience to hear of the total 
reduction of Canada. 

Your Virginians, we hear, have drubbed Lord Dun- 
more, killed and took fifty men, and sunk one of his 
vessels ; may all such villains so perish ! 



84 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

A Mr. Richard Hare, brother to the porter brewer, 
sailed in the transport for Quebec. As you have or 
must take him, let me recommend him to your civil 
ities while with you, and to send him to his friends 
here. 

The articles of war have all the amendments we 
reported. You will enforce them ; you will not now 
suffer your officers to sweep the parade with the skirts 
of their coats, or the bottoms of their trowsers ; to 
cheat or to mess with their men ; to skulk in battle, 
or sneak in quarters ; in short, being now paid, they 
must do their duty, and look, as well as act, like gen 
tlemen. Do not bate them an ace, my dear General, 
but depend upon every support of your friends here. 
I have strove to keep two battalions now raising 
in the Jerseys, and one here, quite disengaged, that 
they may be ready on a call to join you, should those 
you have desert you. I have not been quite unsuc 
cessful. The winter is our own ; Boston will not, dur 
ing that season, be reenforced ; at least we have reason 
to think so. 

I want the return I desired from Gates exceed 
ingly. Compliments to him, Lee, Putnam, Mifnin, c. 

It is so dark I can t read this letter over, or I 
would save you the trouble of deciphering it. 
Dear Sir, your most obedient servant, 

THOMAS LYNCH. 

P. S. Ought not that spirit of independence, and 
separation from all other authority, w-liich appeared in 
the case of Captain Dyer, to be abolished ? Will it 
be right to keep your heroes for w T ood-cutters ? 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 85 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Ticondcroga, 28 November, 1775. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

The evening before General Montgomery landed on 
the Island of Montreal, Mr. Carleton embarked his 
garrison on board of some vessels and small craft, and 
made two attempts to pass our batteries, near the 
mouth of Sorel, but was drove back by Colonel Eas- 
ton, who has behaved with bravery and much alert 
ness. On the 19th, Mr. Carleton, disguised en Cana- 
dicn, and accompanied by six peasants, found means to 
make his escape. Brigadier-General Prescott surren 
dered next day by capitulation. What terms General 
Montgomery has given him, I do not know, as he 
was so hurried, in preparing to move immediately to 
Quebec, that he could not find time to send them. 
Prescott and the officers arrived here at four to-day. 
I have just received a return of the officers, men, 
vessels, and stores taken, which I do myself the honor 
to inclose. 

Your Excellency s favor, of the 16th of November, I 
received two days ago. I believe some cannon and 
mortars may be spared ; but none, except what I have 
sent across Lake George, can be got down until that 
or this lake freezes over. I have a very fine thir- 
teen-inch mortar here, and I will make a push to get 
her over the Lake. But where will you get shells ? 
We have none here. 

Mr. Livingston, Mr. Langdon, and Mr. Paine, arrived 
here at seven this evening. The season was so far 
advanced that I could not wait the orders of Con 
gress upon sundry matters, which appeared to me 
absolutely necessary to be carried into immediate ex- 
VOL. i. 8 



86 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

ecution. I am, however, happy to find, that every 
measure I have pursued corresponds with the in 
structions given to the Committee. 

I am informed that Prescott has used poor Walk 
er and Allen with a shameful brutality. Of this I 
shall acquaint Governor Trumbull, to whose Colony 
I shall send him. 

I believe our army in Canada consists of about one 
thousand and nine hundred men, including Colonel 
Arnold s corps. I have suggested to Congress, that 
I thought it necessary that they should be completed 
to three thousand, in the course of the winter, that 
they may be ready, early in the spring, to put Que 
bec (of which I make no doubt we shall possess our 
selves) into a proper state of defence, to prevent the 
enemy from regaining that important place. I have 
added, that I thought it necessary that preparation 
should be made here to throw in a reenforcement 
early in the spring, if they should be wanted. 

I expect to leave this in a few days for Albany. 
I am, Sir, your Excellency s 

Most obedient and very humble servant, 

PHILIP SCHUYLER.

reaching here before day, prevents my going over for 
an hour or two. He has given me a list of stores on 
the other side, from which I am enabled to send an 
inventory of those which I intend to forward to camp. 
The garrison at Ticonderoga is so weak, the convey 
ance from the fort to the landing is so difficult, the 
passage across the Lake so precarious, that I am 
afraid it will be ten days, at least, before I can get 
them on this side. When they are here, the convey 
ance from hence will depend entirely on the sledding ; 
if that is good, they shall immediately move forward; 
without sledding, the roads are so much gullied, that 
it will be impossible to move a step. 

General Schuyler will do every thing possible to 
forward this business. I have the honor to be, with 
the greatest respect, your Excellency s 

Most obedient humble servant, 

HENRY KNOX. 

P. S. General Schuyler assures me, that although 
the navigation through Lake George should be stop 
ped, yet, if there is any sledding, they shall move on 
another way. 



FROM COLONEL ARNOLD. 

Before Quebec, 5 December, 1775. 
MAY IT TLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 

My last, of the 20th ultimo, from Point-aux-Trem- 
blcs, advising of my retiring from before Quebec, I 
make no doubt your Excellency has received. I con 
tinued at Point-aux-Trembles until the 3d instant, 



88 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

when, to rny great joy, General Montgomery joined us, 
with artillery, and about three hundred men. Yester 
day we arrived here, and are making all possible pre 
paration to attack the city, which has a wretched 
motley garrison of disaffected seamen, marines, and 
inhabitants ; the walls in a ruinous situation, and can 
not hold out long. 

Inclosed is a return of my detachment, amounting 
to six hundred and seventy-five men, for whom I have 
received clothing of General Montgomery. I hope 
there will soon be provision made for paying the 
soldiers arrearages, as many of them have families 
who are in want. A continual hurry has prevented 
my sending a continuation of my journal. I am, with 
very great respect, your Excellency s 

Most obedient humble servant,

FROM RICHARD HENRY LEE. 

Philadelphia, 6 December, 1775. 

DEAR SIR, 

The inclosed letter, from Colonel Pendleton, came 
to hand two days ago, and, as it will save a good 
deal of unnecessary writing, I send it to yon. 

The proclamation, there alluded to, we have seen. 
It proclaims martial law through Virginia, and oilers 
freedom to all the slaves, calling their masters rebels, 
&c. It seems this unlucky triumph over Ilutchings, 
with his less than half-armed militia, so dispirited the 
miserable wretches in that neighbourhood, that many 
have taken an oath of Lord Dunmore s prescribing. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 89 

reprobating Congress, Committees, &c. Long before 
this, Colonel Woodford, with eight hundred good men, 
must be arrived in those parts ; and I make no doubt 
has forced his Lordship on board his ships again. 
All this would have been prevented, if our troops 
could have crossed James River, in proper time ; but 
they were obstructed, and forced to march high up, 
by the men-of-war; and indeed, such is the nature 
of our water-intersected country, that a small number 
of men, provided with naval force, can harass us ex 
tremely. 

I have good reason to hope, that in a few weeks 
the state of things in Virginia will be greatly altered 
for the better. I thank you for your list of armed 
vessels, but at present no use can be made of them. 
I hope some of them will be fortunate enough to 
meet with prizes eastward. 

I had not heard of your improvements on the 
Kanawha being destroyed, and unless Mr. Lund 
Washington has received very accurate information on 
this head, I am inclined to doubt it; because I see, 
in the treaty lately concluded with all the Ohio In 
dians, they first inform the Commissioners of the 
Kanawha fort being burnt by some of their rash 
young men ; but they promise to punish the offenders, 
and prevent repetition of the like offence. They are 
very precise in their information, and mention only 
the fort, as well as I remember. I hope, therefore, 
that your property may yet be safe. This treaty 
with the Indians is more likely to last, as Connolly, 
with his little corps of officers, is now in close custo 
dy in Maryland, having been arrested there, as they 
were stealing through the country to Pittsburg, from 
whence they were to proceed to Detroit, and with 
the troops in those western parts, Indians, &c. ? he was

to have done wonders. This wonderful man is now 
in close jail.* 

I congratulate you on the surrender of Montreal ; 
and from General Montgomery s letter, giving an ac 
count of that event, I think we have room to expect 
that Quebec is fallen before now. A Committee of 
Congress, some time since sent to Canada, have direc 
tion to raise a regiment in that country, to invite 
delegates to this Congress, and give the strongest 
assurances of protection to their civil and religions 
rights. I am glad to hear of your getting Cobble 
Hill, and I hope it will prove useful to you. We 
are told that your enemy s troops are very uneasy 
on Bunker s Hill. God grant that their uneasiness 
may increase to their ruin. No accounts yet from 
England, but ships are daily expected. I am, with 
much esteem, dear Sir, 

Your affectionate and obedient servant, 

RICHARD HENRY LEE. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 8 December, 1775. 

SIR, 

Your letter of the 28th of November, by Captain 
Blewer, being received, was immediately laid before 
Congress. 

By my letter of the 2d instant, which I hope you 
will in due time receive, you will perceive the Con 
gress have, in a great measure, prevented your wishes, 



* See the particulars of Connolly s case in Washington s Writings, Vol. 
III. p. 212.

having written to New York, and given orders tc 
General Schuyler to supply you with, and to forward, 
with all possible expedition, what cannon can be 
spared. They have also directed General Schuyler to 
make diligent search for lead ; and, retaining so much 
as may be wanted there, to send the remainder to 
your camp. However, it is hoped the gentlemen you 
have sent will expedite that business. 

By order of Congress, I forward a commission for 
Mr. Knox, who is appointed Colonel of the Regiment 
of Artillery. The Congress also have relieved your 
difficulties with respect to the two battalions of Ma 
rines, having ordered that the raising them out of 
the army be suspended. It is the desire of Congress 
that such a body of forces may be raised ; but their 
meaning is, that it be in addition to the army voted; 
and they expect you will think of proper persons to 
command that corps, and give orders for enlisting 
them wherever they may be found. 

The Congress are sensibly affected with your situ 
ation, and regret the backwardness of the troops to 
re enlist. In addition to what I had the honor of 
transmitting you the 2d instant, they have desired 
me to inclose you a copy of a resolution passed yes 
terday, and to write to the Council of Massachusetts 
Bay, the Convention of New Hampshire, and the 
Governors of Rhode Island and Connecticut, acquaint 
ing them with the present state of the army, and in 
closing copies of the resolutions of this Congress 
relative to your being empowered to call forth the 
militia of those Governments on any emergency, and 
requesting those Colonies to exert themselves in de 
fence of our common liberties, by affording you all 
the aid in their power, and to comply with your re 
quest for the assistance of the militia, whenever you 
may find it necessary to call for it. 



92 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

The gentlemen with the money set out to-day. I 
hope the arrival of this will relieve some of your 
difficulties; and that the payment of the arrears, and 
the month s advance, which you arc empowered to 
offer, will induce many to reenlist, who seem not to 
be actuated by nobler motives. 

By letters, received yesterday, we learn that Colo 
nel Arnold, after a fatiguing march, had reached Ca 
nada, where he was well received by the inhabitants 
that, on the 14th of November, he had reached Point 
Levi, and was preparing to pass the river that night; 
that, notwithstanding his being deserted by Colonel 
Enos, he had great hopes of gaining possession of 
Quebec, as both the English and Canadian inhabitants 
were well affected to our cause ; that Carleton, with 
the ships under his command, was stopped in his 
passage down the river by a fort in our possession, 
at the mouth of the Sorel, and some row-galleys ; and 
that General Montgomery was preparing to attack 
him from Montreal. But of these matters you will 
doubtless be more fully informed by an express, which 
we understand was despatched to you from Ticon- 
deroga. 

I have the honor to be, &c., 

JOHN HANCOCK, President. 



FROM MAJOR ROBERT ROGERS. 
Medford, (Porter s Tavern), 14 December, 1775. 

SIR, 

I sailed from Gravesend the 4th of June last, in 
a merchant ship, bound to Baltimore, in Maryland, 
which was, at the time I came away, the nighest 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 93 

passage I could get to Philadelphia, where I waited 
on the gentlemen that compose the Continental Con 
gress, in order to obtain their permit to settle my 
private affairs, being much encumbered with debts, 
chiefly contracted in the Province of New York; in 
which settlement my brother, Colonel James Rogers, 
who lives in the Province of New York, about twenty 
miles west of Connecticut River, was deeply concerned, 
being bound for me in several sums of money, which 
made it necessary for me to visit him in my way 
home; and for that purpose came by the way of 
New York and Albany to my brother s, and from 
thence to Portsmouth, to my wife and family (a 
pleasure long wished for), having been six years in 
Europe. 

I have taken the earliest opportunity that would 
permit to come to this town (where I arrived this 
morning), in order to lay before your Excellency the 
passport I received at Philadelphia, from the Com 
mittee of Safety there, a copy of which is transmitted 
at the bottom of this letter, together with the minutes 
made thereon by the Committees of Safety at New 
York and New Hampshire. I do sincerely entreat 
your Excellency for a continuance of that permission 
for me to go unmolested where my private business 
may call me, as it will take some months from this 
time to settle with all my creditors. 

I have leave to retire on my half-pay, and never 
expect to be called into the service again. I love 
North America ; it is my native country, and that of 
my family, and I intend to spend the evening of my 
days in it, 

I should be glad to pay you my respects person 
ally, but have thought it prudent to first write you 
this letter, and shall wait at this place for your Ex-

Most humble servant, 

EGBERT HOGERS. 



FROM COLONEL KNOX. 

Fort George, 17 December, 1775. 
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 

I returned from Ticonderoga to this place on the 
15th instant, and brought with me the cannon, &c.; it 
having taken nearly the time I conjectured it would 
to transport them here. It is not easy to conceive 
the difficulties we have had in getting them over the 
Lake, owing to the advanced season of the year, and 
contrary winds; three days ago it was very uncer 
tain whether we could have gotten them over until 
next spring ; but now/ please God, they shall go. I 
have made forty-two exceedingly strong sleds, and 
have provided eighty yoke of oxen, to drag them as 
far as Springfield, where I shall get fresh cattle to 
carry them to camp. 

The route will be from here to Kinderhook, from 
thence into Great Barrington, in Massachusetts Bay, 
and down to Springfield. There will scarcely be any 
possibility of conveying them hence to Albany or 
Kinderhook, but on sleds, the road being very much 
gullied. At present the sledding is tolerable to Sara 
toga, about twenty-six miles ; beyond that, there is 
none. I have sent for the sleds and teams to come 
up, and expect to begin to move them to Saratoga on 
Wednesday or Thursday next; trusting that between 
this and that period we shall have a fine fall of snow, 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 95 

which will enable us to proceed further and make 
the carriage easy. If that should be the case, I hope 
iri_^^teenjor t seventeen x days to be able to present to 
your Excellency a noble trarn~of artillery, the inven 
tory of which I have inclosed. T Kave been particu 
lar with respect to their dimensions, that no mistake 
may be made in making their carriages, as there are 
none here, or implements of any kind. I also send 
a list of those stores, which I desired Colonel McDou- 
gall to send from New York. I did not then know 
of any thirteen-inch mortars, which was the reason 
of my ordering but few shells of that size; but I 
now write to him for five hundred one-inch, two 
hundred five-and-seven-tenths inches, and four hun 
dred seven-and-one-half inches. If these sizes could 
be had there, as I believe they can, I should imagine 
it would save time and expense, rather than have 
them cast. If you should think otherwise, or have 
made provisions for them elsewhere, you will please 
to countermand this order. 

There is no other news here of Colonel Arnold, 
than that, from Colonel McLean s having burnt the 
houses round Quebec, Colonel Arnold was obliged to 
go to Point-aux-Trembles, about six miles from the 
city, and that General Montgomery had gone to join 
him with a considerable body of men, and a good 
train of artillery, mortars, &c. 

There are some timid, and some malevolent spirits, 
who make this matter much worse ; but from the dif 
ferent accounts which I have been able to collect, I 
have very little doubt that General Montgomery has 
Quebec now in his possession. I am, with the utmost 
respect, your Excellency s 

Most obedient, humble servant, 

HENRY KNOX. 



96 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL SULLIVAN. 

Camp on Winter Hill, 17 December. 1775. 
MUCH RESPECTED GENERAL, 

Agreeably to your order, have again waited on 
Major Rogers, and strictly examined him. Have 
seen his several permits, and think them genuine, 
and in every respect agreeable to the copy sent you. 
He says he left New York about the 10th of Octo 
ber, being ill with the fever-and-ague, was ten days 
in getting to Albany ; that there, and at the place 
called Stone Arabia, he tarried ten days more ; he 
then passed through Iloosick, Standford, Draper, and 
Hinsdale, in his way to his brother, who lives in 
Kent ; he was three days in performing this route, 
and tarried with his brother five or six days more ; 
he was then three days in going to Westminster, and 
in his way passed through by Dartmouth College, 
and saw Mr. Wheelock ; from thence he went to his 
farm, in Pennicook, where he tarried six or eight 
days ; from thence he went to Newbury, and from 
thence to Portsmouth, and, after tarrying there some 

/ O 

few days, laid his permit before the Committee of 
Safety. 

He owns every thing in Mr. Wheelock s letter ex 
cept that of his having been in Canada, which he 
warmly denies, and says lie can prove the route he 
took, and prove himself to have been in the several 
towns at or near the days he has mentioned. I 
asked him why he came to the camps, as he had 
no business with any particular persons, and had no 
inclination to offer his service in the American cause; 
to which he replied, that he had voluntarily waited 
upon the Committees of several Colonies, as he 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 97 

thought it a piece of respect due to them, and would 
probably prevent his being suspected and treated as 
a person unfriendly to us ; that he likewise thought 
it his duty to wait on your Excellency, and acquaint 
you with the situation of his affairs, and, if he could, 
to obtain your license to travel unmolested. 

These, Sir, are the facts as handed to me by him. 
What may be his secret designs I am unable to say, 
and what steps are most proper to be taken respect 
ing him, your Excellency can best judge. I am far 
from thinking that he has been in Canada ; but, as he 
was once Governor of Michilimackinac, it is possible 
he may have a commission to take that command, 
and stir up the Indians against us, and only waits 
for an opportunity to get there ; for which reason I 
would advise, lest some blame might be laid upon 
your Excellency in future, not to give him any other 
permit, but let him avail himself of those he has ; 
and, should he prove a traitor, let the blame centre 
upon those who enlarged him. I beg pardon for in 
truding my opinion; and subscribe myself 
Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

JOHN SULLIVAN.*

Providence, 19 December, 1775. 

SIR, 

I have your Excellency s letter of the 17th, which 
I have laid before the General Committee. Should

the force sailed from Boston be destined for Rhode 
Island, I tremble for the consequences, as the Colony, 
in its present exhausted state, cannot, without assist 
ance, defend the Island. At their unanimous request, 
I apply to your Excellency for a detachment from 
the Continental Army, of one regiment, to be stationed 
upon Rhode Island, and that you would please to 
appoint a general officer to take the command of the 
whole force there. They also desired me to inform 
you, that General Lee will be very acceptable to the 
Colony, and to request that the general officer w r ho 
may be appointed may set out immediately, to take 
the command of the troops upon the Island, and put 
it in the best posture of defence. 

We have, at head-quarters, about two hundred and 
fifty men, and shall immediately place on there about 
four hundred more, and hold as many more in readi 
ness as possible. I need not point out to you the 
importance of the Island, and the inability of the 
Colony. I am, in great haste, 

Your very humble servant, 

NICHOLAS Co ORE. 

P. S. Captain Wallace hath hinted, to some of his 
friends, that he expects a reenforcernent daily. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 22 December, 1775. 

SIR, 

Your letters of the 30th of November, and of the 
4th, 7th, and llth of December, being duly received, 
were laid before Congress. To prevent the ill conse- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 99 

quences that might ensue from the backwardness of 
the men, in the present service, to reenlist, the Con 
gress, as I informed you in my last, have written to 
the Governors of Connecticut and Rhode Island, the 
Council of Massachusetts Bay, and the President of 
the Convention of New Hampshire. In consequence 
of which letters, they have strong hopes and confi 
dence that measures will be taken to complete your 
army. As to the article of butter, the Congress, de 
sirous to obviate whatever may have a " tendency to 
give the soldiery room for complaint," have instructed 
me to inform you, that the same may be continued 
until further order. 

The Congress receive, with great satisfaction, your 
congratulations on the success of Captain Manly. By 
the inclosed resolves, you will perceive their deter 
mination on the captures already made, as well as 
those which may be made hereafter. It is expected 
the several Colonies will erect Courts of Admiralty, 
and that the Judges in those courts will regulate their 
decisions by the law of nations, except where it is 
relaxed by the inclosed resolutions. 

I am further directed to inform you, that the Con 
gress approve your taking such of the articles, found 
on board the Concord, as are necessary for the army. 
The necessity of the case will, they apprehend, jus 
tify the measure, even though the vessel upon trial 
should, contrary to their expectation, be acquitted. 

I am authorized to inform you, that it is the plea 
sure of Congress that Mr. Mifflin, the Quartermaster- 
General, hold the rank of Colonel in the Army of 
the United Colonies, and that you establish his rank 
accordingly. 

I must beg leave to refer you to the inclosed re 
solutions of Congress for your future proceedings, 



100 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

which I am directed to transmit to you. You will 
notice the last resolution relative to an attack upon 
Boston/ 1 This passed, after a most serious debate, in 
a Committee of the whole House, and the execution 
was referred to you ; and may God crown your at 
tempt with success. I most heartily wish it, though 
individually I may be the greatest sufferer. 

I have paid Mr. Fessenden, the express, in full for 
his three journeys as express to Philadelphia, deduct 
ing only sixty dollars, which he says you ordered 
him ; so that there will be no pay due to him for 
services performed heretofore, only for his expenses 
now from this place to you. If this adjustment be 
not right, please to inform me. 

I have the honor to be, with sincere sentiments of 
esteem, Sir, 

Your most obedient, humble servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK, President. 

P. S. Fessenden being indisposed, I have sent a 
special express, as Congress were anxious their resolves 
should reach you as quick as possible. 



FROM JAMES LYON. 

Macliias, 25 December, 1775. 



SIR, 

You doubtless remember to have seen an applica 
tion from the Committee of Safety in this place, for 



* In Congress, December 22d. "Resolved, That if General Washington 
and his Council of War should be of opinion, that a successful attack 
may be made on the troops in Boston, he do it in any manner he may 
think expedient, notwithstanding the town and property in it may 
thereby be destroyed." 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 101 

leave to go against Nova Scotia, which might pro 
bably have been taken then with very little difficulty. 
But we were informed that such an expedition could 
not be carried on, at that time, with proper secrecy, 
and that there was imminent danger from the King s 
ships. The same difficulties may possibly lie in the 
way now r , if any troops are collected, and sent from 
any part near the head-quarters. I apprehend that 
secrecy is as necessary now as ever it was, and if 
only one proper person, at a suitable place, be ordered 
to conduct the whole affair, it will probably succeed. 
There have been many applications, I dare say, 
from many persons and places ; but were I to point 
out a suitable place, I should mention this, as it is 
near to Nova Scotia. I should be more at a loss for a 
proper person to conduct the enterprise. I know of 
fitter persons than myself in many respects, but they 
are strangers to the province and people. But I 
have dwelt there for years, and have a personal ac 
quaintance with almost all the principal men, and know 
the country well. I should rejoice, therefore, in the 
appointment to this necessary business ; and if your 
Excellency, together with those only who must ne 
cessarily be acquainted with the appointment (for I 
choose none but they should know any thing of the 
matter), in your great wisdom, should see fit to 
appoint me, I will conduct the expedition with the 
utmost secrecy, and, Deo adjuvante, will add to the 
dominions of the Continental Congress another pro 
vince, before our enemies are able to defend it. All 
I require is sufficient authority to collect as many 
troops as I see fit, in this eastern country, not ex 
ceeding one thousand men, and vessels to convey 
them to the place of action, and blank commissions 
for the necessary officers of a thousand more, to be

102 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

filled up as I shall find expedient in Nova Scotia, 
where the men are to be raised, put into the Conti 
nental pay, and left there to defend the country, 
when taken ; and farther, that a sufficient quantity 
of provisions, ammunition, arms, &c., be sent here, 
about the middle of March. 

Your Excellency may inquire as much about me as 
you please, of Benjamin Foster, Esq., Captain Stephen 
Smith, Captain O Brien, and Mr. Shannon ; for these 
gentlemen I should choose to have as companions, 
but do not choose that they, or any other persons liv 
ing, should know any thing of the design, if this 
petition is granted, till it is time to embark, except 
those persons only who have authority to appoint. 
The above-mentioned gentlemen know nothing of this 
application. 

The reduction of Nova Scotia is a matter of great 
importance, and lies near my heart, on account of my 
many suffering friends in that province, and on ac 
count of the many advantages that would arise from 
it to this Colony, and to this place in particular. 
But should the Government appoint another person 
to conduct the expedition, I shall cordially acquiesce, 
and pray for his success, as I ever do, that God may 
smile on all the American arms, till all our enemies 
are subdued before us. 

Your Excellency will not take amiss what my zeal 
for the honor and safety of my country constrained 
me to write. I am, most respectfully, your Excel 
lency s 

Very humble and obedient servant, 

JAMES LYON.

FROM GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 

Lebanon, 1 January, 1776. 

SIR, 

I received, the 20th of last month, your Excel 
lency s favor of the 15th, inclosing a list of the offi 
cers and companies under the new arrangement, with 
the number of men enlisted ; and, at the same time, 
another of the 17th, with the information from seve 
ral persons who then had lately come out of Boston. 
I return my thanks for both. 

By accounts received from the various parts of the 
Colony, the recruiting officers, for the Continental 
service, have good success in enlisting men. 

The Assembly have granted Chaplains the same 
pay given last campaign, with the addition of forty 
shillings per month each, to enable them to supply 
their pulpits. 

Brigadier-General Prescott is not arrived. Shall give 
particular directions to prevent his escape, if he comes 
into this Colony. 

The 23d, yours of the 14th of December came to 
hand, per Messieurs Penet and De Pliarne. Every 
necessary assistance, for expediting their journey, 
was afforded without delay ; they set out the next 
morning. You shall be made acquainted with the ex 
pense incurred on their account, when the same is 
known. 

The 28th instant, at evening, our General Assembly 
adjourned. There is great unanimity in our common 
cause. Among others, they passed an act for raising 
and equipping one fourth part of the militia of this 
Colony, to be forthwith selected by voluntary enlist- 



104 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

ment, with as many other ablebodied, effective men, 
not included in any militia-roll, as are inclined to 
enlist, to stand in readiness as minute-men, for the 
defence of this and the rest of the United Colonies, 
with proper encouragement. Another act, for restrain 
ing and punishing persons who are inimical to the 
liberties of this and the rest of the United Colonies, 
and for directing proceedings therein. No person to 
supply the Ministerial army or navy ; to give intelli 
gence ; to enlist, or procure others to enlist in their 
service ; to undertake to pilot any of their vessels, or 
in any other ways to aid or assist them, on the pe 
nalty of forfeiting all his estate, and imprisonment in 
any of the jails in this Colony, not exceeding three 
years. No one to speak, write, &c., against the do 
ings of the Honorable General Congress, or acts of 
our Assembly, on the penalty of being disarmed, and 
rendered incapable to hold, or serve in any office, 
civil or military ; and be further punished, either by 
fine, imprisonment, disfranchisement, or to find surety 
of the peace and good behaviour. 

Any person or persons, who put, or shall continue 
to hold, or screen themselves under, the protection of 
the Ministerial army or navy, or aid or assist in car 
rying into execution the present Ministerial measures 
against America, their estates to be seized for the 
use of the Colony. 

A resolve to provide, so that we shall have two 
armed vessels, one of sixteen carriage-guns, the other 
fourteen ; with a schooner called the Spy, of four 
carriage-guns ; and four row-galleys. 

An act to exempt the polls of soldiers from taxes, 
for the last, and ensuing campaigns. Another act, 
for encouraging the manufactories of saltpetre and 
gunpowder. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 105 

Hope to collect saltpetre and manufacture a con 
siderable quantity of gunpowder early in the spring. 
The furnace, at Middletown, is smelting lead, and 
likely to turn out twenty or thirty tons. Ore is 
plenty. 

Please to favor me with an account of the quantity 
of lead received from Crown Point. From thence I 
received one hundred and eighty old gunbarrels, 
which are fitting up here, and will make one hundred 
and fifty stands of good arms. We are put to diffi 
culty for gunlocks. Hearing that those stands, taken 
in the ordnance store-ship, had each a spare lock, 
thought proper to mention to you, that, if it be so, 
whether it may not be well to furnish a number for 
the arms fitting here. 

On the 29th, at evening, I met, at Hartford, on 
my returning from the General Assembly, yours of 
the 23d December, and immediately sent to Captain 
Wads worth, a person employed by the Commissary- 
General, and much acquainted, to see if any blankets 
could be purchased, and found there are none. Many 
of our new-enlisted men, I am told, will bring blan 
kets with them, which they get from private families. 
Those lost at the Bunker Hill fight were furnished 
in that manner, and our minute-men will supply 
themselves in that way ; but I am very doubtful of 
success, if attempted. Lieutenant-Colonel Durkee this 
day mentioned to me your direction to him on this 
head. Shall lay the same before the Committee at 
our next meeting. 

Inclosed is a copy of an Act empowering the Com 
mander-in-chief, &c., to administer an oath. Also, 
Minutes of the ordnance taken from the Ministerial 
troops at the several northern posts, from the 1st of 
May to the 13th of November, 1775.

the proper salutations of this day, your Excellency s

Whcelock, at Dartmouth College. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL CHARLES LEE. 

January 5, 1776. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

The consequences of the enemy s possessing them 
selves of New York have appeared to me so terrible, 
that I have scarcely been able to sleep from appre 
hensions on the subject. These apprehensions daily 
increase. You have it in your power, at present, to 
prevent this dreadful event. If I do not mistake, the 
Congress have given you authority to take any step 
in that place, as well as here, which you shall think 
necessary for the public service ; but if they have not 
given you expressly and literally authority with re 
spect to the city of New York, I am confident that 
any measure you think right to plan and put in exe 
cution will be approved of. 

I have the greatest reason to believe, from the most 
authentic intelligence, that the best members of the 
Congress expect that you would take much upon your 
self; as referring every matter of importance to them 
is, in fact, defeating the project. We have an instance 
of this in the fate of the motion for seizing the per 
son of Mr. Tryon. To you they look up for decision 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 107 

"by your conduct they are to be inspired with deci 
sion. In fact, your situation is such that the salvation 
of the whole depends on your striking, at certain 
crises, vigorous strokes, without preidously communi 
cating your intention. On this principle I venture to 
propose the following scheme, and to offer myself for 
the execution. 

New York must be secured ; but it will never, I am 
afraid, be secured by direct order of the Congress, for 
obvious reasons. They find themselves awkwardly 
situated on this head ; you must step in to their relief. 
I am sensible that no men can be spared from the 
lines in our present circumstances; but I would pro 
pose that you should detach me into Connecticut, and 
lend your name for collecting a body of volunteers. 
I am assured that I shall find no difficulty in assem 
bling a sufficient number for the purposes wanted. 
This body, in conjunction (if there should appear oc 
casion to summon them) with the Jersey Regiment 
under the command of Lord Stirling, now at Eliza- 
bethtown, will effect the security of New York, and 
the expulsion or suppression of that dangerous ban 
ditti of Tories, who have appeared in Long Island, 
with the professed intention of acting against the 
authority of the Congress. Not to crush these ser 
pents, before their rattles are grown, would be ruin 
ous. 

I am assured, likewise, that the Connecticut volun 
teers, who will offer themselves for the service, will 
expect no pay, but, at most, the expenses of their 
provisions and perhaps of carriages for the conveyance 
of their baggage. When once we have secured the 
place with strict fortifications, and engaged the Friends 
of Liberty so far that they cannot recede, purged the 
City and Long Island of the leading Tories, the resi- 



108 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

dence of these Connecticut volunteers will be no lon 
ger necessary; for there is no reason to doubt that 
the Congress will detach troops from Pennsylvania to 
garrison the place, although, from reasons hinted at, 
they may not choose to commence the operation. This 
manoeuvre I not only think prudent and right, but 
absolutely necessary to our salvation ; and if it meets, 
as I ardently hope it will, with your approbation, 
the sooner it is entered upon the better. Indeed, 
the delay of a single day may be fatal. I am, dear 
General, 

Yours most respectfully, 

CHARLES LEE.* 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SCIIUYLER. 

Albany, 5 January, 17 70. 

I do not hesitate a moment to answer my dear 
General s question iii the affirmative, by declaring 
that now or never is the time for every virtuous 
American to exert himself in the cause of liberty 
and his country ; and that it is become a duty cheer 
fully to sacrifice the sweets of domestic felicity, to 
attain the honest, and glorious end America has in 
view; and I can, with a good conscience, declare, 
that I have devoted myself to the service of my 
country, in the firmest resolution to sink or swim 
with it, unanxious how I quit the stage of life, pro 
vided that I leave to my posterity the happy reflec 
tion that their ancestor was an honest American.

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 109 

Here, my dear Sir, you will ask, why then do you 
wish to retire from a public office ? Not because I 
am deterred by any difficulties I have experienced, 
or any that might hereafter present themselves ; for I 
have had repeated experience, in the course of life, 
that what the greater part of mankind deem impossi 
bilities exist only in idea, and are surmountable by 
a steady perseverance ; but, because I think I should 
prejudice my country by continuing any longer in 
this command. The favorable opinion that you are 
pleased to entertain of me, obliges me to an expla 
nation, which I shall give you in confidence. I have 
already informed you of the disagreeable situation I 
have been in during the campaign, but I would 
waive that, were it not that it has chiefly arisen 
from prejudice and jealousy; for I could point out 
particular persons of rank in the Army, who have 
frequently declared that the General commanding in 
this quarter ought to be of the Colony from whence 
the majority of the troops came. But it is not from 
opinions or principles of individuals that I have drawn 
the following conclusion, that troops from the Colony 
of Connecticut will not bear with a General from an 
other Colony. It is from the daily and common con 
versation of all ranks of people from that Colony, 
both in and out of the army; and I assure you, that 
I sincerely lament that a people of so much public 
virtue should be actuated by such an unbecoming 
jealousy, founded on such a narrow principle, a prin 
ciple extremely unfriendly to our righteous cause, as 
it tends to alienate the affections of numbers in this 
Colony, in spite of the most favorable constructions 
that prudent men, and real Americans amongst us, 
attempt to put upon it. And, although I frankly 
avow that I feel a resentment, yet I shall continue 
VOL. i. 10 



110 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

to sacrifice it to a nobler object, the weal of that 
country in which I have drawn the breath of life, 
resolved ever to seek, with unwearied assiduity, for 
opportunities to fulfil my duty to it. 

I shall to-morrow write to General Montgomery to 
collect the evidence in support of the charge against 
Prescott, and entreat him to be very particular. As 
the prisoners taken on board the vessels in the St. 
Lawrence are not yet passed, it is probable that I 
may, by their means, be able to furnish your Excel 
lency with some accounts of the usage Allen re 
ceived. 

Since the receipt of your Excellency s, of the 18th, 
Major Rogers is come to this town. I sent to him, 
and, amongst a variety of passes, he produced a late 
one from the Committee of New Hampshire, to pass 
unmolested to New York, for which place he sets out 
to-day. I believe there is no truth in the intelli 
gence sent by Mr. Wheelock ; for I find, upon inquiry, 
that Rogers arrived -at this place after St. John s 
was invested, and that he went from hence to New 
England. I shall, however, make further inquiries. I 
shall forward the account against Captain Morgan to 
Colonel Arnold by next post. 

You will perceive, by the inclosed, that the junc 
tion of General Montgomery and Colonel Arnold has 
taken place ; but their force is so small, and the 
weather has been so severe, that I fear they have not 
been able to possess themselves of Quebec. Should 
an attempt have been made to storm it, and have 
proved fruitless, and accidents have happened to Mont 
gomery and Arnold, I tremble lest Canada should be 
lost. If I could procure any men, I would send 
them to Canada immediately; but I know not where 
to get any. Even Ticonderoga and Fort George are

by this time, I fear, left to the care of the Commis 
sary of Provisions and Conductor of Artillery. The 
officers, to whom I had issued warrants to raise four 
companies, meet with no success. 

The first of the cannon arrived here on Wednes 
day, and the whole is on its way, but detained by 
the weakness of the ice in Hudson s River, occasioned 
by the uncommon mildness of the weather for several 
days past. One frosty night, if not deferred too 
long, will, however, put every thing in order, and I 
hope you will soon have the pleasure of seeing all at 
Cambridge. 

To-morrow thirteen of the Caghnawaga tribe, under 
the care of Major Wales, will set out for Cambridge 
on a visit. 

Your letter to General Howe gave me great plea 
sure, and his answer must convince mankind of your 
superiority.* His affectation is trifling, and unbecom 
ing a gentleman. His letter, I believe, will be evenk 
ually a censure on General Carleton. 

I shall immediately forward to your Excellency 
what clothing can be spared from here ; great part 
of it is not yet made up. 

Sunday, January 7/7?. Yesterday a frost came on, 
and this morning I had the satisfaction to see the 
first division of sleds, with cannon, cross the river. 
Should there be snow all the way to Cambridge, they 
will probably arrive there about this day week. 

A Mr. Gamble, who was made prisoner with Briga 
dier Prescott, and w r ho was a Deputy-Quartermaster- 
General in Canada, has entreated me to intercede 
with your Excellency to get him exchanged. He

urges that he must be ruined unless he can get back 
to Canada. Although I by no means wish to preju 
dice an individual, yet I do not think it prudent 
that he should go to Quebec, unless it is in our pos 
session. When that happens, I can see no inconve- 
niency in exchanging him, or permitting him to go, 
and shall esteem it as a favor if he can then procure 
your leave, and if you can get him exchanged, that 
he may riot lose his office. lie writes to General 
Lee on the subject. I have expressly informed him 
that I did not think he could be permitted to go to 
Quebec until after its reduction. 

Be pleased to accept the compliments of the sea 
son, and my best wishes. I have the honor to be, 
with unfeigned esteem, your Excellency s most obe 
dient, and

PHILIP SCHUYLER. 



FROM JOHN ADAMS. 

Watertown, 6 January, 1776. 

DEAR SIR, 

As your Excellency has asked my opinion of Gen 
eral Lee s plan, as explained in his letter of the 5th 
instant, I think it my duty to give it, although I am 
obliged to do it in more haste than I could wish. 

I suppose the only questions, which arise upon that 
letter, are, whether the plan is practicable ; whether it 
is expedient ; and whether it lies properly within your 
Excellency s authority, without further directions from 
Congress. 

Of the practicability of it, I am very ill qualified 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 113 

to judge ; but were I to hazard a conjecture, it would 
be that the enterprise would not be attended with 
much difficulty. The Connecticut people, who are 
very ready upon such occasions, in conjunction with 
the Friends of Liberty in New York, I should think, 
might easily accomplish the work. 

That it is expedient, and even necessary to be 
done, by some authority or other, I believe will not 
be doubted by any friend of the American cause, who 
considers the vast importance of that City, Province, 
and the North River, which is in it, in the progress 
of this war, as it is the nexus of the northern and 
southern Colonies, as a kind of key to the whole 
continent, as it is a passage to Canada, to the Great 
Lakes, and to all the Indian nations. No effort to se 
cure it ought to be omitted. 

That it is within the limits of your Excellency s 
command, is, in my mind, perfectly clear. Your com 
mission constitutes you commander of all the forces 
now raised, or to be raised, and of all others who 
shall voluntarily offer their service, and join the army 
for the defence of American liberty, and for repelling 
every hostile invasion thereof; and you are vested 
with full power and authority to act as you shall 
think for the good and welfare of the service. 

Now if upon Long Island there is a body of peo 
ple, who have arms in their hands, and are intrench 
ing themselves, professedly to oppose the American 
system of defence, who are supplying our enemies 
both of the army and navy, in Boston and elsewhere, 
as I suppose is undoubtedly the fact, no man can 
hesitate to say that this is an hostile invasion of 
American liberty, as much as that now made in Bos 
ton. Nay, those people are guilty of the very inva 
sion in Boston, as they are constantly aiding, abet- 
10* 



114 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

ting, comforting, and assisting the army there, and 
that in the most essential manner, by supplies of 
provisions. 

If in the city a body of tories are waiting only 
for a force to protect them, to declare themselves on 
the side of our enemies, it is high time that city was 
secured. The Jersey troops have already been ordered 
into that city by the Congress, and are there un 
doubtedly under your command, ready to assist in 
this service. That New York is within your com 
mand, as much as the Massachusetts, cannot bear a 
question. Your Excellency s superiority in the com 
mand over the Generals in the Northern Department, 
as it is called, has been always carefully preserved 
in Congress, although the necessity of despatch has 
sometimes induced them to send instructions directly 
to them, instead of first sending them to your Excel 
lency, which would have occasioned a circuit of many 
hundreds of miles, and have lost much time. 

Upon the whole, Sir, my opinion is, that General 
Lee s is a very useful proposal, and will answer many 
good ends. I am, with great respect, your Excel 
lency s 

Most obedient, humble servant, 

JOHN ADAMS. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Albanv, 13 January, 1776. 

I wish I had no occasion to send my dear General 
this melancholy account. My amiable friend, the gal 
lant Montgomery, is no more ; the brave Arnold is 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 115 

wounded; and we have met with a severe check in 
an unsuccessful attempt on Quebec. May Heaven be 
graciously pleased that the misfortune may terminate 
here ! I tremble for our people in Canada ; and no 
thing, my dear Sir, seems left to prevent the most 
fatal consequences, but an immediate reinforcement 
that is nowhere to be had but from you; and the 
only route, that which I have pointed out in my let 
ter to Congress, copy of which you have inclosed. 
Nor do I think that a less number than I have men 
tioned will suffice. Should your Excellency think 
proper to send the troops, you will please to let me 
know it by express, that I may send provisions to 
Onion River.* 

Congress has wrote to me on the subject of my 
request to retire. Our affairs are much worse than 
when I made the request. This is motive sufficient 
for me to continue to serve my country in any way 
I can be thought most serviceable; but my utmost 
can be but little, weak and indisposed as I am. The 
clothing is gone to Cambridge. 

I am your Excellency s most obedient and most 
humble servant, 

PHILIP SCHUYLER. 



* No troops could be spared from the main army for this service ; 
but a regiment from each of the Colonies of Massachusetts, New Hamp 
shire, and Connecticut, was raised and sent to Canada. See Washing 
ton s Writings, Vol. TIT, pp. 248, 253. 



116 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM COLONEL ARNOLD. 

Camp before Quebec, 14 January, 1776. 

DEAR SIR, 

I make no doubt you will soon hear of our mis 
fortune on the 31st ultimo, and be very anxious to 
know our present situation. Our loss and repulse 
struck an amazing panic into both officers and men, 
and, had the enemy improved their advantage, our 
affairs here must have been entirely ruined. It was 
not in my power to prevail on the officers to attempt 
saving our mortars, which had been placed in St. 
lioque s. Of course they fell into the hands of the 
enemy. Upwards of one hundred officers and soldiers 
instantly set off for Montreal, and it was with the 
greatest difficulty I could persuade the rest to make 
a stand. 

The panic soon subsided. I arranged the men in 
such order, as effectually to blockade the city, and 
enable them to assist each other if attacked. It was 
urged, by the officers, to move our ammunition and 
artillery stores, of which we had a large quantity ; 
and, though the risk was great, I could not approve 
the measure, as it w r ould undoubtedly have made un 
favorable impressions on the minds of the Canadians, 
and induced them to withdraw their assistance, which 
must have ended in our utter ruin. I therefore put 
the best face on matters, and betrayed no marks of 
fear. I have withdrawn the cannon from our battery, 
and placed them round the magazine. 

Our present force is only seven hundred. I am in 
daily expectation of a reenforcement from Montreal 
of two or three hundred men. I expected General 
Wooster, but find he cannot leave Montreal. Colonel 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 117 

Clinton is just arrived. I have put on foot the rais 
ing a regiment of two or three hundred Canadians, 
which I make no doubt of effecting. Our finances 
are very low. However, I hope we shall be able to 
rub along. Mr. Price is our only resource, and has 
exerted himself. I wait with great anxiety the arri 
val of a reenforcement from below. I have wrote the 
Honorable Congress my opinion, that five thousand 
men will be necessary to insure us Quebec, though 
it may possibly be reduced with a less number; it 
appears a blockade may answer the purpose. I think 
Quebec an object of too much consequence to trust it 
to the event. If reduced, five thousand men will be 
necessary for a garrison. 

Your favor of the 5th ultimo is just come to hand. 
It gives me a most sensible pleasure, to have your 
approbation of my conduct. I beg you would accept 
my thanks for the notice you have been pleased to 
take of me and my officers in your new establish 
ment. Most of them are provided for in an unex 
pected manner, not very pleasing to me. Inclosed is 
a list of the killed and wounded. Both officers and 
men behaved with the greatest intrepidity, and had 
not the General been basely deserted by his troops, 
we should doubtless have carried the town. My de 
tachment had carried the first battery. My being 
wounded, and the loss of their guides, retarded them 
much. After the death of the General, they sustained 
the force of the whole garrison for a considerable 
time, who fired from under cover, and had every 
advantage of situation. Their retreat was cut off by 
the enemy s gaining a narrow defile, through which 
they were obliged to pass. They were overpowered 
by numbers and obliged to resign, though deserving 
a better fate. Governor Carleton treats them with 



118 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

humanity, and has given leave fur their baggage to 
be sent in to them. 

I heartily congratulate you on the success of your 
privateers. I think the balance of the last year s 
account is still in our favor, though we have met a 
severe check here. I hope soon to have the pleasure 
of seeing General Lee, or some experienced officer, 
here. I heartily wish you the protection and blessing 
of the Almighty ; and am, with very great respect and 
esteem, dear Sir, 

Your obedient, humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



FROM GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 

Lebanon, 15 January, 1776. 

SIR, 

I have received your agreeable letter, of the 7th 
instant, per Captain Sears. The condition and cir 
cumstances of the Colony of New York give me pain, 
lest the friends to American liberty in that Colony 
should be too much neglected and become dishearten 
ed, and the inimical designs and mischievous opera 
tions of others succeed. I have received credible 
information that the Provincial Congress there had 
spent some time, just before they adjourned to the 
1st of February, in debating whether they should not 
address Mr. Tryon for the purpose of calling the Ge 
neral Assembly of that Colony, to revive the old 
scheme of adopting the Parliamentary insult of the 
20th of February last, which was rejected. Surely 
our friends want to be strengthened, and our ene 
mies to be checked. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 119 

The following is an extract from a letter from one 
of our friends to another, dated December 27th, 
1775. "Just after you left town, the Phoenix, a forty- 
gun ship, arrived and anchored just before Mr. Drake s, 
and in two or three days after, the Asia, in company 
of the Duchess of Gordon, came and anchored oppo 
site to Peck s slip, so that we are highly honored. 
General Dalrymple is on board the Phoenix, and it 
is rumored that they have two hundred troops con 
cealed on board, which has, for near a week past, 
kept us on pretty hard duty. The Colonel has slept 
in the barracks two or three nights. If they come 1 
hope to give a good account of them. We have 
some excellent field-pieces, and if they visit us the 
gates will be opened, and we will welcome them 
with a few 7 resolves of the Continental Congress, which 
is the name of one of the pieces." 

I wrote a letter to President Hancock, dated the 
6th of January, and another to one of our Delegates 
at Congress, requesting that more effectual measures 
may be taken for the security of New York, to pre 
vent our enemies from being supplied with provisions, 
furnished with intelligence, and from having an op 
portunity to use every artifice to insult and injure 
us from that quarter. It therefore gave me sensible 
pleasure to find, that you have adopted the measures 
mentioned in yours, and with great cheerfulness 
called my council, and, with their advice, appointed 
Colonel Waterbury, Lieutenant-Colonel Bradley, and 
Major Hobby, field-officers for one regiment ; Colonel 
Ward, Lieutenant-Colonel Lewis, and Major Douglas 
for another. Sent a proclamation to the two Colonels, 
and orders to them with the rest of the field-officers, 
by voluntary enlistment, to raise seven hundred and 
fifty men each, to join and assist Major-General Lee, 



120 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

with encouragement that they should be entitled to 
the same pay, wages, and billeting allowed the troops 
before Boston, during the time they served, and to be 
dismissed soon, when the service would conveniently 
admit. 

The field-officers of each regiment to select cap 
tains and subalterns from those in the standing mili 
tia ; if needful, to request the chief officer of the 
militia companies to call their companies together for 
the purpose of enlisting the men with expedition ; 
and, to prevent difficulty for want of ammunition, 
have ordered Captain Niles, Commander of our armed 
schooner, the Spy, to take on board half a ton of 
powder, and transport four hundred pounds to New 
Haven, two hundred pounds to Norwalk, and four 
hundred pounds to Stamford, with orders to him to 
follow such directions as Major-General Lee may give 
for the service he is employed in, and to execute 
the same, until dismissed by him, or further orders 
from me. Wished, but failed, to have the pleasure 
of a short interview with him. When my orders 
w T ere ready, very early on Saturday morning last, 
Captain Sears took them, and I apprehend he got to 
Hartford by noon. I wrote to Major-General Lee, in 
forming of what was done by me. I have no doubt 
but the men at the westward part of this Colony 
will readily and expedition sly engage in the service. 
May the Supreme Director of all events add His 
blessing on our endeavours to preserve, support, and 
maintain the constitutional liberties of these Colonies, 
which he hath made it our duty to do. 

Thirteen Indians, of the Caghnawaga tribe, came 
to visit me on the 13th, and seemed well pleased to 
have a conference on our affairs, and expressed their 
belief of my information, and that they were friends 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 121 

and brothers, and yesterday proceeded on their way 
to you. I ana, with great esteem and regard, your 
Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

JONATHAN TRUMBULL. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 16 January, 1776. 

Your letters of the 25th and 31st of December, 
and 4th of January, have been duly received, and 
laid before Congress. 

By the inclosed resolutions, you will perceive that 
the Congress, in providing for the defence of Canada, 
have directed that two battalions should be raised 
out of the troops now serving there. This they did 
in testimony of their approbation of the services of 
those brave men, apprehending, at the same time, 
that it would be both agreeable to the officers and 
men to have the honor of defending a country, which 
their valor had rescued from slavery. And the Con 
gress have a firm confidence, that General Montgo 
mery, who has a warm and just sense of their merit 
and services, will cheerfully embrace the present op 
portunity to continue and promote the officers of that 
corps, and, as far as in his power, to reward with 
office and command, in those battalions, such volun 
teers and others as have distinguished themselves. 

The Committee, to whom your letters were referred, 
this day brought in a partial report; on which the 
Congress came to certain resolutions, which you will 
see in the inclosed extracts. I am just to acquaint 
you, that it is expected, when the Paymaster draws 
any bills, he will observe to make them payable some 
few days after sight. The Committee have desired 
VOL. i. 11 



122 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

leave to sit again, which is granted. As soon as 
they have completed their report, and the Congress 
have come to a determination thereon, I shall do my 
self the pleasure of transmitting it to you. The 
money last voted, is now ready ; and the persons 
who have the charge of conveying it will, I expect, 
set out with it to-morrow. 

I .have the pleasure to inform you, that the Com 
mittee have purchased the saltpetre, and have agreed 
with the owners of mills to manufacture it into pow 
der. One of the mills, it is expected, will make 
near a ton a week, and another near half a ton. I 
hope you will soon receive the powder ordered to he 
purchased at New York. There were, as we are in 
formed, eight tons in the same vessel imported for 
that Colony. 

The public papers will inform you, that Lord Dun- 
more has endeavoured to exercise the same barbarity 
against the defenceless town of Norfolk, as was exer 
cised against Falinouth. By these repeated instances 
of inhumanity, so contrary to the rules of war, and so 
long exploded by all civilized nations, it would seem 
as if the rancorous Ministry, despairing of their mea 
sures to conquer and enslave, had determined to glut 
their revenge with destruction and devastation.* For 
my part, I shall not be surprised to hear, that in their 
frenzy of rage, and to effect their dark purposes, 
they have proceeded to murder, under forms of law, 
those prisoners whom the tools of their vengeance 
have chanced to take, and whom, with officious zeal, 
they have sent to England. 



*It has been ascertained that the British Ministry were in no degree 
responsible for the burning of Falmouth. It was the wanton act of a 
naval officer, unknown to the Ministry at the time, and disapproved by 
them afterwards. Washington s Writings, Vol. III. p. 520. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 123 

As it is now apparent that our enemies mean to 
exert their whole force against us next summer, the 
Congress are taking measures for putting the middle 
and southern Colonies in a posture of defence. We 
shall doubtless suffer much in this great struggle ; 
but I trust no losses or sufferings will induce us to 
desert the defence of our liberty; and that, cost what 
it may, we will persevere, with unremitting vigor, to 
maintain that inestimable jewel which we received 
from our ancestors, and transmit the same, with un 
sullied lustre, to our posterity. 

January 18^. The Committee, to whom your letter 
of the 31st of December was referred, desire to be 
informed whether the companies stationed at Chel 
sea and Maiden are regimented ; and whether, if 
those at Hingham, Weymouth, and Braintree, were 
withdrawn, it would be necessary to replace them 
out of the Continental Army. 

Since writing the above, we have received a letter 
from Messrs. Philip Livingston, Alsop, and Lewis, by 
which we find, to our mortification, that we were 
misinformed with regard to the large quantity of 
powder arrived at New York, and that there were 
only four hundred and sixty-two quarter casks, which 
were imported for the use of that Colony, and of 
which a great part is distributed among several 
Counties. 

Before this comes to hand, you will doubtless re 
ceive an account of the disagreeable news from Que 
bec, on which I sincerely condole with you. The 
express arrived here last evening. To-day I expect 
the Congress will take it into consideration. The 
result of their deliberations you will have in my 
next letter. I am, &c. 

JOHN HANCOCK, President. 



124 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LEE. 

New Haven, 16 January, 1776. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

We have been so baffled by the weather, that we 
only arrived here last night. I believe we shall find 
no difficulties in procuring a sufficient body of volun 
teers for the New York expedition. The unhappy 
accounts from Canada seem to animate these people, 
rather than depress. Indeed, we have new occasion 
for exertion and decision. I am apprehensive that 
the Congress must be inspired by you. They have 
just given a strong, and, I think, unfortunate instance 
of indecision. Colonel Waterbury had raised a regi 
ment. The regiment was equipped, and ready for em 
barkation. They were to have landed in Oyster Bay, 
to have attacked the Tories in Long Island. Lord 
Stirling was to have attacked them on the other side. 
All this by order of Congress; when suddenly Colo 
nel Waterbury received an order to disband his regi 
ment ; and the Tories are to remain unmolested till 
they are joined by the King s assassins. 

Governor Trumbull, like a man of sense and spirit, 
has ordered this regiment to be reassembled. I be 
lieve it will be ready on Sunday, the day on which 
I shall march from this town. I shall send imme 
diately an express to the Congress, informing them 
of my situation, and, at the same time, conjuring them 
not to suffer the accursed Provincial Congress of New 
York to defeat measures so absolutely necessary to 
salvation. 

The affairs of Canada will, I suppose, very soon, if 
not instantly, require a very considerable force from 
this Province. Neither will the circumstances of New 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 125 

York admit of its being too much stripped of men, 
for which reason I should think it advisable imme 
diately to raise some additional regiments in Massa 
chusetts Bay. Adieu, dear General. God prosper 
you and the arms of virtue ! 

Yours, most sincerely, 

CHARLES LEE. 



FROM THOMAS LYNCH. 

Philadelphia, 16 January, 1776. 

DEAR SIR, 

I am happy to be at last able to write you, that 
every thing you desired me to get done is accom 
plished, for the present. Our President assures me 
he has sent you the determination of Congress con 
cerning the trial of captures. Courts of Admiralty 
have been appointed in the Colony for that purpose. 
Colonel Frye has been appointed Brigadier in your 
army (Mr. Arnold precedes him in that of Quebec) ; 
and I inclose copies of the resolutions for the direc 
tion of the postmaster, relative to letters of officers 
and soldiers in our service. 

The delays in procuring the money have given me 
much concern, being sensible of the injury occasioned 
thereby to the service ; but the calls for money, from 
every quarter, so far outrun the diligence of the sign 
ers, that my reiterated solicitations could get the sum 
no sooner. 

We have resolved to raise, exclusive of your army, 
in New Hampshire one battalion, in Connecticut one, 
in New York one, in Jersey three, in Pennsylvania 
11* 



126 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

five, in the Lower Counties one, in Virginia six, in 
North Carolina three, and South Carolina three, in Geor 
gia one, and in Canada two, exclusive of Canadians. 
Besides these, I have no doubt New York will have 
four more, and Maryland two, which, with the regi 
ments of artillery, will be sixty-two or three bat 
talions, and the expense not less than ten millions of 
dollars. How quick a transfer of property, from the 
rich to the poor, such an expenditure must produce, 
you are well able to judge. The prospect is far from 
receiving light; when it is considered how each Colony 
lavishes aw r ay its private treasure at the same time, 
or when we view the amazing and unaccountable su- 
pineness of all our Governments. Not a single indi 
vidual, anywhere in a civil department, seems to con 
sider himself as interested in public matters, unless 
he can get money by them. The idea of all the 
paper being mortgages on their private estates is to 
tally lost and forgotten. 

In this state of things I have, besides niy depend 
ence on the continuance of the favor of Heaven, trust 
in two supports alone; the one, on your vigorous ex 
ertions ; the other, on the weakness of our enemies. 
Should they lose footing in America this winter, I 
should despise their thirty thousand Russians,* scat 
tered by storms, arriving, one transport after another, 
fatigued and debilitated by the fatal effects of a long 
voyage, without a spot to collect and recruit them 
selves for the field, and depending, for every neces 
sary, on supplies from a country three thousand miles 
distant. 



* It was reported, at this time, that the British Government had ob 
tained, or was about to obtain, military aid from Russia ; but the report 
was unfounded. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 127 

Do not the speeches of the King and his Minis 
ters hold very different language from those of the last 
year? America is no longer the abject, cowardly, 
and defenceless wretch she was then ; now his Lord 
ship, [who] would have despised [them], had they not 
bravely supported their rights, seems to approve their 
vigorous support of them, and offers the terms of 
1763. A gentleman, well known to Maryland, Lord 
Drummond, just from England, assures me he will 
give much more; he tells me that he has had many 
conversations with Ministry on this subject, and show 
ed me a paper, approved by each of them, and which 
he is sure will be supported in both Houses. The sub 
stance of it is, America to be declared free in point 
of taxation and internal police; Judges to be approv 
ed by the Judges of England, and commissioned dur 
ing good behaviour, upon stated and sufficient support 
being statedly assigned by the Colonies ; all charters 
to be held sacred ; that of Boston restored ; Britain to 
regulate trade sub modo ; all duties, laid for the pur 
pose of regulation, to be paid into the Colony Trea 
sury where they arise, applicable to its uses by its 
own Legislature; in lieu of which America shall, by 
duties on such articles as will probably keep pace 
in consumption with the rise or declension of the 
Colony, laid by each Legislature by permanent act 
of Assembly, grant towards the general support of 
the empire, annual sums in proportion to five thou 
sand pounds sterling for this Colony. As this sum 
is little more than half of what did arise by duties 
heretofore paid in this place, I doubted his informa 
tion; but was assured that Ministry wanted nothing 
but a show of revenue to hold up to Parliament, as 
they are afraid to propose reconciliation without sav-

His Lordship came hither through Halifax, Boston,

to hint, once or twice, at beginning with a suspension 
of arms, to which I turned a very deaf car, well 
knowing that the winter season is ours, and that 
much may be done by April next. I sincerely wish 
I had your sentiments on these heads. I shall pro 
pose them to the consideration of Congress, as soon 
as the most urgent affairs are over; I think they 
merit it. 

Congress has ordered you fifteen tons of gunpowder 
from New York, and we have saltpetre enough here 
to make eighty tons more, so that I hope we shall 
not soon want again ; larger quantities are every day 
expected. I beg you will make our compliments to 
your lady, and to the rest of your family, and all my 
friends.

P. S. We have just heard, from Charleston, that 
they have mounted on the batteries there above one 
hundred and sixty cannon, from twelve to forty-two 
pounders, and seventy more in different parts of the

gang are totally suppressed. He is come, but I have 
not yet seen him.

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 129 

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 20 January, 1776. 

SIR, 

In rny former letter, I mentioned the disagreeable 
news received from Canada. The Congress have taken 
that matter into consideration; and, having examined 
Mr. Antill, and duly deliberated on the situation of 
our affairs in that quarter, they have come to sundry 
resolutions, which I have the honor to inclose. 

I w r ould just observe, that, by Mr. Antill s exami 
nation, it appears our loss is greater than wiiat is set 
forth in the despatches he brought, a copy of which 
was transmitted to you. Almost the whole of Gene 
ral Arnold s gallant detachment are taken prisoners, 
having, after four hours resistance, been obliged to 
surrender at discretion. However, we have the satis 
faction to hear the prisoners are treated with hu 
manity. 

The Congress are anxious, as Avell from motives of 
policy as of justice and humanity, to repair our 
losses in that quarter, and, if possible, to gain posses 
sion of Quebec, and drive our enemies out of that 
country before they can be reinforced in the spring. 
An active, able General is wanted to take the com 
mand there, arid if such an one can be spared from 
the service at Cambridge, it is their desire you should 
send him. 

The battalion from Pennsylvania, and that from 
New Jersey, will set forward the beginning of next 
week. 

As it is of great importance, as well for the secu 
rity and relief of our friends as for confirming the 
wavering, that speedy succours should arrive, I am 



130 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

directed to request you to detach, from the camp at 
Cambridge, one battalion, if the service there will 
permit you to spare one, with orders to march, with 
the greatest expedition possible, to Canada. If this 
cannot be complied with, you will use your utmost 
endeavours in stimulating the Governor of Connecti 
cut and the Convention of New Hampshire, to whom 
I write by this opportunity, to forward, with the ut 
most despatch, the very first companies that can be 
raised in those Colonies. You can easily conceive 
what efiect the arrival of even one company will 
have on the minds of our friends, especially when 
they shall be satisfied it will soon be followed by 
more. 

The Colony of South Carolina has been so fortu 
nate as to oblige Lord William Campbell, with the 
vessels of war, to quit their harbour. Being earnestly 
desirous of providing for their defence, they have re 
solved to fit out some armed vessels, but not having 
seamen among themselves, they have despatched Cap 
tain Cochran to the northward, to enlist a number of 
seamen for the service of that Colony. Lest the 
offers he was empowered to make might prejudice 
the service, the Congress have chalked out a plan 
for him to go by, as you will see in the inclosed 
extracts, and I am directed to desire you will please 
to forward this service. 

Yesterday Dr. J. Smith, who made his escape from 
Frederick, was brought to this town. He was taken 
at the Little Meadows, on his way to Detroit, and 
had with him letters from Connolly to the command 
ing officer there. 

I hinted to you, in my former letter, that the Con 
gress were taking measures for the defence of the 
Middle and Southern Colonies. For this purpose. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 131 

over and above those destined for Canada, they have 
ordered four battalions to be raised in the Colony of 
New York, two in New Jersey, four in Pennsylvania, 
one in the Counties on Delaware, six in Virginia, 
three in North Carolina, three in South Carolina, and 
one in Georgia, each to consist of seven hundred and 
twenty-eight men, including officers, making in the 
whole, with those for Canada, thirty-four battalions. 
I have the honor to be, &c. 

JOHN HANCOCK, President. 



FROM GOVERNOR COOKE. 

Providence, 21 January, 1776. 

SIR, 

Your favor of the 6th instant I received, and laid 
before the General Assembly. It had great weight; 
and I believe that no supplies to the enemy s ships 
would have been permitted, had it not appeared to 
us that the members of the Continental Congress 
were of opinion that they should be continued. The 
following is an extract from our Delegates on that 
subject. "A Memorial from the Town of Newport, 
forwarded to us by express, having been referred to 
the General Assembly, we now inclose that, with the 
papers pertinent thereto. We should not do jus 
tice to the benevolence of Congress, or to the dis 
tressed situation of the town, if we did not acquaint 
you that all the gentlemen, who spoke in this debate, 
expressed the most tender regard for the distressed 
people, and gave it as their opinion that, as long as 
the ships of war now in the harbour could be sup 
plied with fresh provisions, beer, and such like neces- 



132 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

saries for their own immediate support, consistently with 
the great principles of the general good and safety 
of America, the town ought to he permitted to fur 
nish them; the greatest care being taken by govern 
ment that no more than the barely necessary supplies 
be furnished from time to time, lest the common enemy 
in other parts of the Continent should, through them, 
obtain provisions." In consequence of which the 
General Assembly have ordered that Captain Wallace 
should be supplied, as you will see by the inclosed 
vote. But, as he may cannonade, and even burn the 
town, a discretionary power, by a private vote, which 
it is designed should be kept a profound secret, is 
given to the commander of the forces on Rhode 
Island to permit supplies in cases of imminent dan 
ger, until the next session, to be holden on the last 
Monday in next month. 

Similar measures to those taken by Connecticut, 
as mentioned in your letter, have been adopted by 
this Colony. Besides- which, the commanding officer 
of any body of Continental troops is empowered to 
impress carriages, &c. 

The General Assembly ordered an Address to the 
Congress, a copy of which I do myself the honor 
to inclose you. We are not without hopes that the 
Congress will take the whole brigade into their ser 
vice, especially as the necessity, arising from so pow 
erful an invasion, of establishing the whole force we 
have ordered, is clear and manifest. From the nature 
of the Avar, and the circumstances of the Colonies, I 
think every idea of partial and Colonial defence 
ought to be given up. There must be a supreme, 
superintending power, to exert and direct the force 
of the wliole, for the defence and safety of all ; other 
wise the exertions and burdens will not only be 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 133 

very unequal, to the greatly endangering the union, 
upon which the welfare of America depends, but 
Colony after Colony may be subdued without the 
chance of making resistances. I shall only add, on 
this head, that unless the Continent enter upon the 
defence of the Colony, it must be abandoned, to the 
great detriment of the common cause. I beg the 
favor of your Excellency seriously to consider this 
matter, and to give us your assistance with the mem 
bers of the Congress for procuring such a body of 
forces as the interest of this and the United Colonies 
in general shall require. 

We had procured upwards of an hundred blankets, 
which were designed for the army under your im 
mediate command; but the descent upon Prudence 
obliged us to send forty of them to our troops upon 
that Island; and to supply the additional forces, or 
dered to be raised, will demand every blanket that 
can be spared in the Colony. I am, with great re 
spect and esteem, Sir, your Excellency s 

Most obedient and most humble servant, 

NICHOLAS COOKE. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL WOOSTER. 

Montreal, 21 January, 177G. 

SIR, 

I herewith inclose a letter just received from Colo 
nel Arnold, and take this opportunity most heartily 
to condole with you for the loss of the brave and 
most amiable General Montgomery, and the other 

VOL. i. 12 



134 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

brave officers and soldiers who fell with him, and for 
the failure of success in the unfortunate attack upon 
Quebec, the particulars of which you will doubtless 
have received before this reaches you. 

I should have gone down, immediately upon hear 
ing of the defeat, to the camp before Quebec, but 
the necessity of securing this place and the country 
round in our interest, induced all the officers, and our 
friends here, to request me not to leave this place 
till we should have a rcenforcement from the Colo 
nies. When they arrive, I expect to proceed on 
with them. We have many enemies in this Pro 
vince, particularly among the clergy, who are using 
every artifice to excite the Canadians to take up 
arms against us ; but I hope to be able to prevent 
any thing of the kind. I have called in many of 
the commissions given by Governor Carleton, and 
have given out new ones under the Congress, and 
expect soon to have them spread through the coun 
try, which I expect, .and indeed I perceive already, 
that it answers very salutary purposes. After re 
ceiving new commissions, they look upon themselves 
as bound, and, unless we succeed, they will all be 
treated as traitors. I allow each parish to choose 
their own captains, a circumstance which pleases 
them much, and there have been but few instances 
that they have not chosen a zealous friend to our 
cause. The taking of Quebec must be a matter of 
the greatest consequence to the Colonies, but at 
present we are very ill provided for it. The place 
is strong. I believe they are determined to defend 
it to the last extremity. We have but about four 
tons of powder in the Province. We have, I believe, 
a sufficiency of small cannon, none larger than 
twelve-pounders, except two brass twenty-fours, which 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 135 

are at St. John s. We have expectations of having 
shot and shells cast at Three Rivers. 

In my opinion it will not only be necessary to 
forward men and powder from the Colonies, but 
also a number of heavy cannon, such as thirty-two 
pounders and one thirteen-inch mortar, if no more, 
and some small ones, if to be had. I understand 
that the large mortar from Ticonderoga, with a num 
ber of pieces of cannon, are gone to your camp. It 
is of the greatest importance that whatever is sent 
from the Colonies should be here by the middle of 
March at furthest, for, after that time, the gentle 
men here inform me, it will be impossible to trans 
port any thing from this place to Quebec, on ac 
count of the river being filled with ice, and the 
water, of consequence, overflows the flat country. 
Therefore, if any of our wants can be supplied from 
your camp, I could wish that whatever is sent may 
be forwarded as expeditiously as possible. I am, Sir, 
with the greatest esteem and respect, 

Your most obedient servant, 

DAVID WOOSTER. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LEE. 

Stamford, 24 January, 1776. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

It was unnecessary sooner to trouble you with my 
scrawl, as I could give you no information the least 
interesting. I find the people through this Province 
more alive and zealous than my most sanguine expect 
ation. I believe I might have collected ten thousand 
volunteers. I take only four companies with me, and 



136 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

Waterbury s regiment, which is so happily situated on 
the frontier. Ward s regiment I have ordered to re 
main at their respective homes, until they hear fur 
ther. These Connecticutians arc, if possible, more 
eager to go out of their country, than they are to 
return home, when they have been out for any con 
siderable time. 

Inclosed I send yon my letter to the General Con 
gress. That of the Provincial Congress of New York 
to me, with my answer, I hope will have your appro 
bation. 

The Whigs, I mean the stout ones, are, it is said, 
very desirous that a body of troops should march and 
be stationed in their city. The timid ones are averse, 
merely from the spirit of procrastination, which is the 
characteristic of timidity. The letter of the Provincial 
Congress, you will observe, breathes the very essence 
of this spirit. It is wofully hysterical. I conclude I 
shall receive the orders of the General Congress be 
fore, or immediately on,, my arrival; otherwise I should 
not venture to march into the Province, as, by their 
late resolve, every detachment of the Continental 
troops is to be under the direction of the Provincial 
Congress in which they are ; a resolve, I must say 
with submission to their wisdom, fraught with diffi 
culties and evils. It is impossible, having two sove 
reigns, that any business should be carried on. 

Have you seen the pamphlet, Common Sense? I 
never saw such a masterly, irresistible performance. 
It will, if I mistake not, in concurrence with the 
transcendent folly and wickedness of the ministry, 
give the coup-dc-yrace to Great Britain. In short, I 
own myself convinced by the arguments, of the neces 
sity of separation. Poor brave Montgomery ! But it 
it is not a time to cry, but to revenge. God bless 



THE AMERICAN. REVOLUTION. 137 

you, my dear General, and crown us with the success 
I am sure we merit, from the goodness of our cause. 
My love to the ladies. I shall write a long letter to 
Gates, when I have time and materials. Adieu. 
Yours, most affectionately, 

CHARLES LEE. 



FROM GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 

Lebanon, 24 January, 1776. 

SIR, 

Your letters, of the 20th and 21st instant, are 
received. I thought fit this morning to acquaint 
Colonel Burrell, appointed to command the regiment 
destined to Canada from hence, that a month s pay 
will be advanced to officers and men by you. This 
additional encouragement will enliven them to the 
service. Also to inform, that I understood the route 
of the Massachusetts and New Hampshire regiments 
would probably be by Number Four* to Onion River, 
with a Commissary to attend such as went that way. 
A month s pay was promised the men by my procla 
mation, and, on being acquainted with the readiness 
of the men, one of the Committee of the Pay-Table 
should attend for the payment thereof at Litchfield, 
to prevent delay. I am unable to inform how and 
when the money from you may be received. 

The men in that quarter are well spirited and 
zealous, but have yet received no intelligence of the 
progress made in the business. Shall give you every 
necessary intelligence as it comes to my knowledge. 



* Charlestown, in New Hampshire. 



138 LETTERS TO .WASHINGTON.

esteem and regard, your Excellency s 

Most obedient and humble servant, 

JONATHAN TRUMBULL. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 29 January, 1776. 

SIR, 

The Congress have received your letter of the 19th 
instant, and highly commend your prudence and zeal 
in applying to the Governments of New Hampshire, 
Massachusetts Bay, and Connecticut, to raise forces 
for the service of Canada at this exigency. They 
have fond hopes, by the zeal and alacrity of those 
Colonies, troops will be forwarded with such expedi 
tion as will not only succour our friends, but in some 
measure retrieve our loss, and put us in possession 
of Quebec, before our enemies can receive reinforce 
ments. 

The Congress have agreed to add the Massachusetts 

cD o 

regiment to the forces they at first destined for Ca 
nada. This is the more necessary, as it is now uncer 
tain whether two battalions, as was expected, can be 
raised out of the troops in that country. But they 
do not, by this, mean to weaken your army. They 
have, therefore, ordered that the three regiments you 
applied for from Massachusetts Bay, New Hampshire, 
and Connecticut, shall be exclusive of the thirteen 
wanted for the army at Cambridge. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 139 

By the latest advices from England, it appears that 
Administration are determined to exert themselves, and 
to send a considerable force against us next spring, 
though at the same time they pretend to say, that 
they will offer terms of accommodation, and mean 
only by their armament to enforce their terms. 

It behooves us, therefore, to be ready to receive 
them; for, should an accommodation take place, the 
terms will be severe or favorable in proportion to 
our ability to resist, 

The Congress highly approve your sending Gene 
ral Lee to the assistance of New York, as a measure 
judicious and necessary, and have also appointed 
three of their body to repair to New York and con 
fer with General Lee and the Committee of Safety 
of New York, on the subject of putting that Colony 
in a posture of defence. 

General Prescott arrived here last Thursday, and is 
this day ordered into close confinement in the jail 
of this city. 

I must beg leave to refer you to the inclosed reso 
lutions. I send, by this express, commissions for the 
Massachusetts battalion, and the money ordered to 
the Assembly. I have the honor to be, with the 
greatest esteem, Sir, 

Your most obedient, humble servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK, President. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LEE. 

New York, 5 February, 1776. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 
I arrived here yesterday, but not without some diffi- 



140 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

culty. My disorder increased rather than diminish 
ed, so that I was under the necessity of being car 
ried in a litter a considerable part of the way. I 
consider it as a piece of the greatest good fortune 
that the Congress have detached a Committee to this 
place, otherwise I should have made a most ridicu 
lous figure, besides bringing upon myself the enmity 
of the whole Province. My hands were effectually 
tied up from taking any step necessary for the pub 
lic service by the late resolve of the Congress, put 
ting every detachment of the Continental forces un 
der the command of the Provincial Congress w r here 
such detachment is. 

I should apprise you that General Clinton arrived 
almost at the same instant with myself. lie has 
brought no troops with him, and pledges his honor 
that none are coming. lie says it is merely a visit 
to his friend Tryon, If it is really so, it is the most 
whimsical piece of civility I ever heard of. He in 
forms us that his intention is for North Carolina, 
where he expects five regiments from England ; that 
he only brought tAVO companies of light infantry from 
Boston. This is certainly a droll way of proceeding. 
To communicate his full plan to the enemy is too 
novel to be credited. 

The Congress Committees, a certain number of the 
Committee of Safety, and your humble servant, have 
had two conferences. The result of these conferences 
is such as will agreeably surprise you. It is, in the 
first place, agreed, and justly, that to fortify the town 
against shipping, is impracticable ; but w T e are to for 
tify lodgments in some commanding part of the city 
for tw r o thousand men. We are to erect inclosed bat 
teries on both sides the water near Hell Gate, which 
will answer the double purpose of securing the town

against piracies through the Sound, and secure our 
communication with Long Island, now become a more 
capital point than ever, as it is determined to form 
a strong fortified camp of three thousand men on the 
Island, immediately opposite to New York. The pass 
in the Highlands is to be made as respectable as pos 
sible, and guarded by a battalion. In short, I think 
the plan judicious and complete. The two brass 
pieces and other articles will be sent down as you 
request. You have heard of the fate of the cannon 
near King s Bridge. As I write with pain, you will 
excuse my abrupt conclusion. 

Yours, dear General, 

CHARLES LEE.

FROM GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 

Lebanon, 5 February, 1776. 

SIR, 

Inclosed is account of the charges and expenses 
incurred by providing for Messrs. Penet and De Pli- 
arne, in their journey to Philadelphia, by your Excel 
lency s direction. I have sent forward to you the bills, 
showing how the account arose. Please to order pay 
ment to be made, and sent to me by the post who 
brings this. 

The battalion raising in this Colony, to march to

142 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

the assistance of our friends at Canada, are enlisted 
to serve until the 1st of February next, with bounty, 
pay, wages, and allowances, agreeable to resolve of 
Congress, sent me by the express who last came to 
you this way. 

Our Treasury was exhausted, and knew not how 
to set the troops forward, until Saturday. Intelli 
gence came to me that twelve thousand iivo huudred 
dollars were received from the Honorable Congress 
for that purpose. My proclamation was out some 
time before, and I hear that men enlist freely, and 
hope they will be on their march soon; have ordered 
them to go off by divisions, and hope nothing will 
retard them. 

Through fear of delay, I wrote, last week, to you 
on the head of our payment of the troops that 
served under you last season ; the pay-rolls are to 
meet your approbation and order for payment ; and 
although provision is received for those going to Ca 
nada, yet there remain innumerable calls we are 
unable to answer without further supplies, and appre 
hend payment is to be made by you on those rolls. 

Three battalions, raised and marching to your camp. 
will come on soon ; three dollars a man was paid, in 
part of wages, to enable them to make necessary 
provisions. I hear that two or three companies are 
gone forward, and the rest going this week. 

I received a letter from Major-General Lee, dated 
at Stamford, January 31st, wherein he writes; U A 
most unexpected and severe attack of the rheumatism 
or gout has seized me here, and prevented me per 
sonally proceeding. I have sent Colonel Waterbury 
on, as he is sufficiently strong in numbers betwixt 
his own regiment and the volunteers. I thought 
it prudent to order back Ward s regiment, till they 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 143 

received your Honor s further orders." In another 
scrip, he says ; " There is a late resolve of the Con 
tinental Congress, which, had I seen before, would 
have stopped me. It is, that every detachment of 
the army is to act under the direction of the Pro 
vincial Congress where it is. What then will be the 
use of a detachment at New York ? I answer by 
asking, is New York to be left to be more inimical 
to us than even the Province of Quebec? The policy 
of many there is strained to the utmost against our 
rights. However, I hope better things of their Con 
gress, if not perverted by artful threats and craft." 

Since writing thus far, I am. informed that Gene 
ral Lee was carried into New York in a litter, and 
three members of the Continental Congress are to 
meet him there, to settle measures of conduct. 

I am, with great truth and regard, Sir, your obe

JONATHAN TRUMBULL. 



FROM GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 

Lebanon, 12 February, 1776. 

SIR, 

I received your two favors of the 8th instant ; 
have also received, per Bacon, the remittance for the 
expenses of the French gentlemen to Philadelphia. 
I had no design to have ever called on you for the 
money paid our troops under your immediate com 
mand, but to have accounted with the Congress, had 
we not been unexpectedly drained of cash, and had 
pressing calls upon us two or three ways at once. 
That to the northward could not possibly have been 



144 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

answered, but for the seasonable arrival of the Con 
tinental supply, just sufficient for that purpose. Our 
other demands for the common service are many. 
The men, for the short service with you, could not 
have inarched without some money, which they have, 
I trust, wholly expended for necessary clothing, &c. 
I therefore could have wished it had been in your 
power to have remitted the sum advanced by our 
Pay-Table, but shall do every thing in my power, that 
the common interest do not suffer. 

I am greatly concerned for the scarcity of powder 
and arms. We have not half a sufficiency for our 
selves, as the circumstances may be ; yet, anxious to 
furnish you, for the common good, with every supply 
in our power, have ordered a quantity of gunpowder 
lately arrived at Bedford, in Dartmouth, carted to and 
now lying at Providence, on account of this Colony, 
to be sent you, with all possible expedition. Three 
thousand weight of this we conclude to order to Ma 
jor Thompson, Agent .for the Massachusetts Colony, 
on account of money he supplied to Mr. Shaw, the 
importer, for that end, and you will consult him or 
them concerning the use of it. I suppose the whole 
to be upwards of six thousand weight ; the residue, 
on account of this Colony, for which shall expect 
payment, or to be replaced, as shall be hereafter 
chosen by us. I shall send you this week twenty or 
thirty stands of good arms. I have not certain ad 
vice from every quarter, but I believe our three 
regiments are all on the march to your camp, except 
those already arrived there. 

I have much more agreeable intelligence from Ge 
neral Lee, and the New York Congress, than I ex 
pected. I cannot but hope propitious Heaven will 
smile success on that most timely and judicious ex-

ertion of your Excellency, to prevent our enemies 
possessing themselves of that important station. I 
have the pleasure to inclose you a copy of General 
Lee s letter. In compliance with his request, we have 
already sent orders to Colonel Ward to repair again 
forthwith to New York. 

I am, Sir, with the greatest esteem and regard, 
your most obedient, humble servant,

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LEE. 

New York, 14 February, 1776. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I should have written to you more constantly, but 
really had no means of conveying my letter. A Mr. 
Buchanan and Tolby, bound for head-quarters, will 
deliver you this. You will excuse the conciseness, 
as my time is short. The Governor and Captain of 
man-of-war had threatened perdition to the town if 
the cannon were removed from the batteries and 
wharves; but I ever considered their threats as a bru- 
tum fulmen, and even persuaded the town to be of 
the same way of thinking. We accordingly conveyed 
them to a place of safety in the middle of the day, 
and no cannonade ensued. Captain Parker publishes 
a pleasant reason for his passive conduct. He says 
it was manifestly my intention, and that of the New 
England men under my command, to bring down de 
struction on this town, so hated for their loyal prin 
ciples ; but that he was determined not to indulge 
us, so remained quiet out of spite. The people here 
laugh at his nonsense, and begin to despise the

146 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

menaces which formerly used to throw them into 
convulsions. To do them justice, the whole show a 
wonderful alacrity; and in removing the cannon, men 
and boys, of all ages, worked with the greatest zeal 
and pleasure. I really believe that the generality are 
as well affected as any on the Continent, 

-The Provincial Congress have ordered on fifteen 
hundred minute-men. A number equal to two battal 
ions are coming from Pennsylvania and the Jerseys. 
Lord Stirling s regiment is already here, but not 
complete. When the major part, or a sufficient num 
ber, arrive, we shall begin our works. My intention 
is to pull down that part of the fort on the town 
side, to prevent its being converted into a citadel for 
the enemy, and to erect a battery on a traverse in 
the street, to prevent their making a lodgment in it. 
A redoubt and battery at the pass of Hell Gate will 
prevent their ships and tenders passing and repassing 
to and from the Sound. 

We have fixed on a -spot in Long Island for a re 
trenched camp, which I hope will render it impossi 
ble for them to get footing on that important Island. 
As this camp can always be reenforced, it is our in 
tention to make it so capacious as to contain four 
thousand men. The batteries on the pass of Hud 
son s River will be secured as soon as possible. Some 
of the heavy cannon from hence must be sent up for 
the purpose. It is really a fine train we are in pos 
session of. You shall have a return of the guns as 
well as stores by the post. 

Captain Smyth is an excellent, intelligent, active 
officer, and I take the liberty of commending him to 
your protection. Captain Badlam, of the artillery, is 
likewise a man of great merit in his way. You 
must pardon me, dear General, for a liberty I have 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 147 

taken. You know that Sears was to collect our vo 
lunteers in Connecticut, but he thought he could not 
succeed unless he had some nominal office and rank. 
I accordingly, most impudently, by the virtue of the 
power deputed by you to me (which power you never 
deputed), appointed him assistant Adjutant-General, 
with rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, for the expedition. 
It can have no bad consequences. The man was 
much tickled, and it added spurs to his heat.* He 
is a creature of much spirit and public virtue, and 
ought to have his back clapped. 

With respect to the Canada expedition, which you 
indirectly propose to me, I have only one answer to 
make. Wherever I can be of most service, there I 
should choose to be. I have, indeed, just at this in 
stant, one objection, which is, I am not without ap 
prehensions that facing the cold may throw me into 
a relapse, so as not only to render me unfit for ser 
vice there, but everywhere else. I am, indeed, much 
better, but extremely tender. I begin to walk it 
has been a d d attack; a constant violent fever 
attending it. I neither ate nor slept for eight days; 
but my fever is passed, and I begin to eat; a week 
I hope will set me up. 

Several members of Congress have indicated a de 
sire I should go to Canada. I have explained to 
them my apprehensions, but assured them most hon 
estly of my willingness ; but, in fact, unless they ex 
pedite an army, and some heavy artillery, it will 
be in vain to trouble their heads about a General. 
Colonel Richmore, who lately left Montreal, tells us 
that what few troops are HOAV there will infallibly

ble) the necessary lights 5 but whatever steps they 
take, ])e assured, dear General, that I am, with the 
greatest readiness, prepared to receive and execute 
your and their commands. Canada is, I confess, if 
I am only to be ably accoutred, a glorious field, which

Savannah, 16 February, 1776. 

SIR, 

My country having honored me with the command 
of the Continental battalion, ordered to be raised by 
the General Congress for the protection and defence 
of this Colony (though I fear too partial to my 
poor abilities), it becomes my duty to inform your 
Excellency of the state of our Province, as far as 
it concerns the service, as well as of the troops to 
be immediately under my command. 



* Lachlan Mclntosli was a native of Scotland, and, in 1736, when he 
was nine years old, he came to Georgia with his father, who accom 
panied General Oglethorpe. Early in 1776, the Assembly of Georgia 
passed a resolution to raise a battalion of Continental troops, and, on 
the 4th of February, Lachlan Mclntosh was appointed to the com 
mand, with the rank of Colonel. (Me Call s History of Georgia. Vol. II. 
p. Go.) On the 16th of September, of the same year, he was appointed 
by Congress a Brigadier-General in the Continental Army. lie served 
in the Western Department for some time, having his head-quarters at 
Pittsburg, and was afterwards at the siege of Savannah, lie retired 
from the service before the close of the war. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 149 

Our Province has a front along the sea-coast of 
above one hundred miles, covered by a range of 
islands divided from each other by eight rivers from 
the main land, which makes as many good inlets 
and harbours, most of them capable of receiving any 
frigate, and, as some say, much larger ships. Our 
settlements extend back to the north-west above two 
hundred miles; in other parts, to the southward, not 
above ten, and very thinly inhabited. Indeed, this 
large space of land altogether has not more than 
three thousand men, chiefly in the back country, and 
many disaffected and doubtful in our cause, espe 
cially the men of the greatest property among us. 
Our slaves will be above fifteen thousand souls, 
mostly within twenty miles of the sea-coast, and 
make above thirty-five thousand tierces of rice annu 
ally, besides many other articles of provision, which, 
with our fine harbours, makes the security of this 
Colony, though weak in itself, of the utmost conse 
quence to the whole Continent of America. And we 
have every reason to think our enemies intend to 
make it a place of general rendezvous and supplies. 

We are bounded south by the garrisoned Province 
of East Florida, who have now, as I am well in 
formed, five hundred regulars in St. Augustine, and 
one thousand more expected there daily from Eu 
rope. On the west of us is the Province of West 
Florida, the numerous nations of the Creek, Choc- 
taw, and Cherokee Indians, besides lesser tribes, sup 
posed to have at least ten thousand gun-men, brave, 
intrepid, and eager for war, whom we shall have the 
utmost difficulty to keep at peace, as we want every 
article of their usual supply, and now furnished them 
in great plenty from the two Floridas. 

Our metropolis is situated in the north corner of 
13 * 



150 LETTEKS TO WASHINGTON. 

the Province, upon a bluff or sand-hill thirty feet 
high or more above the water, and fifteen miles 
up the river Savannah from the inlet of Tybee, 
where five ships of war, the Syren, the Scarborough, 
the Raven, the Tamar, and Cherokee, besides tenders, 
are now lying, and two large transports, having, it 
is said, above three hundred men on board, and ex 
pecting more daily; with what design, whether for 
this Colony only, or Carolina, or both together, we 
are not yet informed. Our Province has declared 
itself in a state of alarm, and resolved not to supply 
the men-of-war with provision, and ordered a draft 
of half the militia to the town of Savannah, to op 
pose the landing of any troops. 

Our Provincial Congress, having accepted the bat 
talion ordered for their protection and defence, chose 
the officers the 29th and 30th ultimo (a return of 
whom shall accompany this), and made them sign 
the inclosed test before their commissions were deliv 
ered ; and I have this day issued general orders for 
recruiting, which has been hitherto prevented by 
many obstacles in providing money for that and 
other necessary services, and I fear will yet be at 
tended with some difficulty. We expect very few in 
our own Province. That of South Carolina is said to 
be already drained of such people as will enlist by 
their Provincial regiments; besides, their bounty, sub 
sistence, &c., is so much better than ours. Therefore, 
I expect we must have recourse, distant as it is, to 
North Carolina, with this additional disadvantage, that 
our currency passes in no other Colony but our own, 
and we have received very little Continental money 
yet. 

I have received no kind of orders or instructions 
from the General Congress, or your Excellency ; nor 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 151 

have I yet been able to obtain even a copy of the 
American Articles of War, which makes me at a loss 
how to act in many cases. Therefore I shall wish any 
orders or directions your Excellency will please to 
send me, to be as full and frequent as possible ; also 
to be informed how far we are under the control 
of the Provincial Congress, &c., of this or any other 
Province, when we are upon duty, and what rank we 
hold when acting with militia or Provincial troops. 

I shall take the liberty of appointing surgeons to 
the battalion, which are so indispensably necessary 
that I suppose the neglect of not naming any must 
be owing to our Delegates ; and also make Captain 
Colson s a rifle company, when raised, which I think 
will be useful, and hope will meet with your Ex 
cellency s approbation, and I doubt we shall be oblig 
ed to arm more with such guns, for want of others, 
which are very scarce. 

I have the honor to be your Excellency s 
Most obedient 

And most humble servant, 

LACIILAN MC!NTOSH. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LEE. 

New York, 19 February, 1776. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I am extremely happy that there is any opening 
for a more comfortable establishment for poor Palfrey 
than his present. He is a valuable and capable 
man, and the pittance of a simple Aid-de-Camp-ship 
is wretched for a man, who has a family to support. 



152 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

On this principle, and in obedience to your com 
mands, I shall send him to head-quarters without 
delay. I must, at the same time, confess that the 
loss will be irreparable to me, particularly if I am 
detached to Canada, of which there is the greatest 
probability, as I have received letters from divers 
members of the Congress, expressing their wishes 
that I should be employed in that department. 
Messrs. Griffin and Byrd are very good young men, 
but pretty much in the predicament of your Baylor. 
They can ride, understand, and deliver verbal orders, 
but you might as well set them the task of trans 
lating an Arabic or Irish manuscript as expect that 
they should, in half a day, copy a half sheet of or 
ders. However, I must bustle through the difficul 
ties, and not keep Palfrey out of the channel of a 
better provision. If I go to Canada, I suppose I 
shall be allowed secretaries, one French and one 
English. I do not see now it is possible to manage 
matters with less. Apropos., my dear General, if this 
is to be my province, shall you take it ill if I apply 
for one of my two Brigadiers, either Greene or Sulli 
van? It is a pleasure to have some officer about us 
in whom we can place confidence. 

The ships of war, which were here, have been fright 
ened away. The Asia lies betwixt Nutten s and Bed- 
loe s Islands; the Duchess of Gordon, with his Excel 
lency Governor Tryon, is under her stern ; the Phoenix 
is stationed a league below the Narrows. The Mer 
cury and General Clinton must inevitably fall into 
the hands of our fleet, unless they are fast asleep. 
We have taken strong hold of Hell Gate, so that the 
passage betwixt Long Island and the continent is 
absolutely blocked up to the enemy. I wait for 
some more force to prepare a post, or retrenched en- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 153 

campment, on Long Island, opposite to the city, for 
three thousand men. This is, I think, a capital ob 
ject; for, should the enemy take possession of New 
York, when Long Island is in our hands, they will 
find it almost impossible to subsist. The Jerseys are 
two well manned, and Connecticut, you know, will 
not furnish them, with any thing. 

What to do with the City, I own, puzzles me. It 
is so encircled with deep, navigable water, that who 
ever commands the sea must command the town. 
To-morrow I shall begin to dismantle that part of 
the fort next to the town, to prevent its being con 
verted into a citadel. I shall barrier the principal 
streets, and, at least, if I cannot make it a Conti 
nental garrison, it shall be a disputable field of battle. 

Inclosed I send you a return of the good and in 
different pieces of cannon. The number of the bad, 
those, I mean, totally unfit for service, is, I believe, 
about sixty. As no Commissary of Stores has been 
appointed until this instant, it is impossible to give 
you a return of the other stores by this post, but 
you shall have it by the next. Lord Stirling is a 
great acquisition. He is a most zealous, active, and 
accurate officer. 

A captain of a ship from Cadiz, who is a very in 
telligent person, tells us that Lord Howe and Captain 
Barrington, or Admiral Barrington, are appointed Com 
missioners to propose terms to the Congress. This 
he had from the Consul Hardy. What d d fools 
the Ministry are ! How does your recruiting go on 
for the standing army ? Be so good as to tell Gates, 
to whom I shall write by the next post, that Mr. 
Nourse inclosed no letters for him. If little Eustace 
is not provided for in your army, and I should go 
to Canada, I think he had better be sent to me, and 



154 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

I will consign him to his uncle. I am got quit of my 
gout and fever, but remain extremely weak and ten 
der. God preserve you, my dear General, from all 
disorders, at least until w r e have trampled Satan un 
der our feet, 

My love to Mrs. Washington and all the ladies. 
Adieu. Yours, most faithfully, 

CHARLES LEE. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL ARNOLD. 

Camp before Quebec, 27 February, 177G. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I wrote you the 14th ultimo, of our situation and 
prospects, since which nothing of consequence has oc 
curred here. The enemy, to the number of about 
five hundred, have twice sallied out at Palace Gate, 
with design of seizing our field-pieces (near the 
Nunnery) ; but, on our troops advancing to attack 
them, they made a precipitate retreat under cover of 
their guns. Desertions from the garrison are fre 
quent, by which we learn they are much distressed 
for fuel, and must soon burn their houses and ships. 
Two officers, taken at St. John s, were lately sent 
with a flag to the walls, with a view of getting their 
families at liberty, but were refused admittance, 
which, I am told by several deserters, incensed the 
inhabitants very much, and caused a great uneasiness 
in the garrison, who, I believe begin to grow heartily 
tired of salt provisions and confinement. We have 
received a reinforcement of four hundred men; many 
are daily coming in. I hope, in the course of this 
month, we shall have four or five thousand men. I 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 155 

am fearful we shall not be supplied with shot, shells, 
mortars, &c. I am therefore preparing ladders for an 
assault, if necessary. The extensiveness of the works 
I think will render their defence impracticahle. 

I have this minute the pleasure of your favor of 
the 27th ultimo. I am greatly obliged to you for 
your good wishes, and the concern you express for 
me. Sensible of the vast importance of this country, 
you may be assured my utmost exertions will not be 
wanting to effect your wishes in adding it to the 
United Colonies. I am fully of your opinion, that 
the balance will turn in whose favor it belongs. The 
repeated successes of our raw, undisciplined troops 
over the flower of the British army, the many unex 
pected and remarkable occurrences in our favor, are 
plain proofs of the overruling hand of Providence, 
and justly demand our warmest gratitude to Heaven, 
which I make no doubt will crown our virtuous 
efforts with success. No doubt Administration will 
exert themselves in sending a large force this way 
in the spring ; but if we are fortunate enough to 
reduce the city before they arrive, I make no doubt 
of keeping it, as we shall have the interest of the 
country in general, to which the raising two regi 
ments of Canadians (which Congress have ordered) 
will not a little conduce. 

I am sorry to inform you, notwithstanding every 
precaution that could be used, the smallpox has 
crept in among the troops. We have near one hun 
dred men in the hospital. In general it is favorable; 
very few have died. I have moved the inhabitants 
of the vicinity of Quebec into the country, and hope 
to prevent its spreading any further. 

The severity of the climate, the troops very illy 
clad, and worse paid, the trouble of reconciling mat- 



156 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

tors among the inhabitants, and lately an uneasiness 
amonc; the New York and some other officers, who 

O * 

think themselves neglected in the new arrangement, 
while those who deserted the cause and went home 
last fall have been promoted ; in short, the choice of 
difficulties I have had to encounter, has rendered it 
so very perplexing, that I have often been at a loss 
how to conduct matters. 

As General Schuyler s ill state of health will not 
permit his coming this way, I was in hopes General 
Lee, or some experienced officer, would have been 
sent to take the command here. The service requires 
a person of greater abilities and experience than I 
can pretend to. General Wooster writes me his in 
tention of coming down here. I am afraid he will 
not be able to leave Montreal. 

I have the pleasure to inform you my wound is 
entirely healed, and I am able to hobble about my 
room. Though my leg is a little contracted and weak, 
I hope soon to be fit for action. We are waiting 
impatiently, expecting to hear of some capital blow 
being struck with you. I beg my compliments to 
the gentlemen of your family; and am, with great 
respect and esteem, dear General, 

Your obedient and very humble servant, 

BENEDICT AENOLD. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LEE 

New York, 29 February, 1776. 



DEAR GENERAL, 

I am now so far recovered, though far from well, 
that I shall set out in two days. The stripping 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 157 

Ticonderoga so entirely of its heavy cannon, is a 
most unfortunate circumstance, as the transportation 
of them from this place is a business of monstrous 
difficulties, expense, and labor. 

The Congress have, as yet, not taken the least step 
for the security of this place. The instant I leave it, 
I conclude the Provincial Congress and inhabitants in 
general will relapse into their former hysterics; the 
men-of-war and Mr. Tryon will return to their old 
station at the wharves; and the first regiments, who 
arrive from England, will take quiet possession of 
the town and Long Island. I have written letters 
till I am tired, on the subject, to the Congress, but 
have received no answer. The Committee of three, 
who were here to confer with me, agreed it was 
necessary that five thousand men should be in the 
place. They left us, and no notice has been taken 
of the affair since. Great and extensive works were 
resolved upon ; and we have scarcely sufficient num 
bers to mark out the ground, much less to throw 
up the works. In short, I know not what to make 
of this apathy on so important a subject. 

Messrs. Price, Walker, and, since them, the volun 
teer Melchior, are arrived from Canada. It is very 
lucky, for they can communicate all the necessary 
lights to the Congress with respect to the measures 
Avhich must be taken in that country. By their ac 
counts, nothing is so much wanted as artillerymen. 
Captain Lamb s company were all taken prisoners. I 
wish, indeed it is necessary, you should spare us a 
company from Boston. We cannot possibly do with 
out them. We have none here. I entreat, dear Gen 
eral, you w T ould detach Captain Badlam s company. 
The Captain and I are now well acquainted, and agree 
wonderfully. The Pennsylvania and Jersey troops 
VOL. i. 14 



158 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

march for Canada; are good and strong in numbers. 
The spirit of enlisting prevails through the whole 
country. I am told, but cannot believe it, that the 
New England Delegates oppose the enlisting for a 
year. They say, by means of a shorter engagement 
the whole country would be soldiers. A curious whim 
this. Who the d 1 can fill their heads with such 
nonsense ? 1 should think a letter from you on the 
subject, to either of the Adamses, would have a good 
effect, 

I have this moment received yours of the 22d. It 
is a sort of reprimand for not having more exactly 
informed you of the occurrences here. I do assure 
you, General, that I have wrote fully and frequently. 
It is true, I believe, two posts have carried no letters 
from me, but I would not trouble you when I had 
nothing material to communicate. I shall not in 
trench myself behind the parade of great business, 
for my first business is to be attentive to my Gene 
ral. Nor shall I make a plea of the loss of Palfrey, 
since whose departure I have been obliged to write 
with my own hand every the most trifling note. But, 
in fact, though I confess I am naturally remiss, I 
have not neglected my duty in this point. I have 
suffered no safe opportunity to escape me. But 
enough of this. 

I shall now give you a detail of what we have 
been doing, and in what circumstances we arc. Our 
force, including the minute-men, amounts to about 
seventeen hundred men. Ward s regiment, which is 

O f 

the strongest, I have stationed on Long Island. They 
are employed in making fascines, and preparing other 
materials for constructing three redoubts, one of which 
will, in great measure, (in correspondence with a bat 
tery which I have sunk opposite to it in the city), 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 159 

secure the entrance of the East River. Waterbury s 
and Stirling s regiments are quartered in the city; 
the former in the upper barracks, the latter in the 
lower. Two hundred minute-men are likewise lodged 
in the town. Drake s regiment of minute-men, and 
one more company (in all about two hundred), are 
stationed at Horen s Hook, which commands the pass 
of Hell Gate. They are employed in throwing up a 
redoubt to contain three hundred men. 

As to the town, having few hands, and the neces 
sary duty being hard, I have been able to effect little. 
I have indeed thrown down the side of the fort next 
the town, to prevent its being converted into a cita 
del for the use of the enemy. It was absolutely 
impossible to be moulded into any thing which could 
annoy their ships. I have likewise thrown a traverse, 
or barrier, across the Broadway, two hundred yards 
in the rear of the fort, with four pieces of cannon, to 
prevent the enemy lodging themselves in the remains 
of the fort, and repairing it. It is likewise my inten 
tion to barricade all the streets leading into the 
Broadway, both on the right and left, to secure us 
against being taken in reverse. Batteries are to be 
erected on the eminence behind Trinity Church, to 
keep their ships at so great a distance as not to 
injure the town. As we are surrounded by navigable 
waters, I consider inclosed w r orks as rather danger 
ous. It was, therefore, my intention to throw up a 
great number of large fleches or redans at certain dis 
tances, one behind another, so as to render it a dis 
putable field of battle against any force. King s 
Bridge, being a most important pass, without the 
command of which we could have no communication 
with Connecticut, I had resolved to make as strong 
as possible. 



160 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

Such were my schemes ; but as the Congress have 
not furnished the force which I was taught to expect 
from Philadelphia, w r e have not had it in our power 
to effect more than I have related. Governor Tryou 
and the Asia still continue betwixt Nutten s and Bed- 
loe s Islands. It has pleased his Excellency, in vio 
lation of the compact he had made, to seize several 
vessels from Jersey, laden with flour. It has, in 
return, pleased my Excellency to stop all provision 
from the city, and cut off all intercourse with him, a 
measure which has thrown the Mayor, Council, and 
Tories into agonies. The propensity, or rather rage, 
for paying court to this great man, is inconceivable. 
They cannot be weaned from him. We must put 
wormwood on his paps, or they will cry to suck, as 
they are in their second childhood. 

Captain Smith is just returned from Fort Consti 
tution. He gives me a most terrible account of it. 
The expense of its construction has been enormous. 
Its defects, both in point of situation, laying out, 
finishing, &c., are numerous. He has made the plan 
of another, which will command, as far as I can judge 
from it on paper, the river effectually. 

I have now related, as minutely as necessary, our 
situation. As I shall set out very soon, it will pro 
bably be my last from this place. I must entreat, 
once more, dear General, that you will spare us a 
company of artillery. Badlam seems rather averse, 
on proposing it. 

Adieu, dear Sir. Yours, with the greatest respect 
and affection, 

CHARLES LEE. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 161 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LEE. 

New York, 3 March, 1776. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

My destination is altered. Instead of going to 
Canada, I am appointed to command at the south 
ward. There has been a great promotion of Briga 
dier-Generals ; Armstrong, Thompson, Lewis, Moore, 
Stirling, and Howe, are the six. Four are to serve 
under my orders, namely, Armstrong, Lewis, Moore, 
and Howe. As I am the only general officer on the 
Continent, who can speak and think in French, I con 
fess I think it would have been more prudent to have 
sent me to Canada; but I shall obey with alacrity, 
and hope with success. Griffin has resigned, as he 
flatters himself he can do better in the commercial 
line. I have, in his room, appointed one of the sons 
of Lewis Morris, to whom I was under a sort of en 
gagement. Lord Stirling will take the command until 
the arrival of Schuyler. His Lordship is active and 
distinct. 

In my last I gave you my plan of defence for this 
city and environs; but, from want of men, I shall be 
obliged to leave it in a poor condition. A regiment 
of Associators are, I am told, ordered from Philadel 
phia. I have likewise sent for a battalion from the 
Jerseys ; but, on the other hand, Ward s and Water- 
bury s regiments will, I suppose, according to their 
laudable custom, leave the place the moment their 
time is expired, which is the 12th of this month. I 
heartily pray that you may give Mr. Howe a hand 
some salute on his leaving Boston. I am not yet 
informed who is to take the command in Canada. No 
time, I am sure, is to be lost. As I am ordered away 
14* 



162 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

immediately, I must consign the affairs of New York 
to Lord Stirling. He will acquit himself well. I 
have nothing material to trouble you with at present, 
further than to assure you that I am, and ever shall 
be, dear General, 

Yours, most sincerely, 

CIIAKLES LEE. 



FROM JOSEPH REED. 

Philadelphia, 3 March, 1776. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

I have not been favored with any thing from you 
since my two last; but that never makes any differ 
ence in my writing, as your claims of friendship and 
gratitude upon me are superior to all others. The 
Congress have made an appointment of Generals, as 
by the inclosed paper. Armstrong is ordered to South 
Carolina, Thompson to New York. The others keep 
their present situations. General Lee s destination is 
changed to Virginia, from undoubted authority that 
it will be a principal scene of action. The Congress 
have acceded to the proposition respecting myself; so 
that unless some new event, unforeseen and very im 
portant, should happen, I shall be with you this sum 
mer. I must beg your indulgence till I can get 
my family into some convenient situation, and settle 
my affairs. In the mean time, I am forwarding your 
camp equipage, which I have extended, in many small 
particulars, beyond your order. 

Arnold is to be intrusted with the affairs of Ca 
nada, Wooster having either resigned, or been super 
seded, I know not which. Melchior is come from 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 163 

Quebec in twelve days, where he left our little army 
strengthened to fifteen hundred men, in good spirits, 
and still pleasing themselves with the hope of being 
masters of the town. I have not yet seen him, so 
that I can give you no further particulars; but I 
understand they are like to want battering cannon 
and mortars. No arrivals of powder or arms since 
my last, or any account of our fleet, though, from 
their present cruising ground, we hope they will fall 
in with Lord Cornwallis and the transports. 

Notwithstanding the act of Parliament for seizing 
our property, and a thousand other proofs of a bitter 
and irreconcilable spirit, there is a strange reluctance, 
in the minds of many, to cut the knot which ties us 
to Great Britain, particularly in this Colony and to the 
southward. Though no man of understanding expects 
any good from the Commissioners, yet they are for 
waiting to hear their proposals before they declare 
off. However, yesterday I was informed letters had 
been sent to France to know what encouragement 
we might expect from that quarter. Our coast is 
yet clear; it is a golden opportunity to make provi 
sion for the war, which, I hope, will not be lost. If 
the other Provinces had done any thing like this in 
the making of arms, this winter we should have been 
tolerably provided. We shall, by the 1st April, have 
made four thousand stands since last October, every 
part done here. We are casting cannon, and there 
is more saltpetre made than in all the Provinces put 
together. Six powder-mills are erecting in different 
parts. The two near this city deliver twenty-five hun 
dred pounds per week, and are now in very good 
order. Many attempts have been made to get a 
bounty for the New England troops, but without 
effect. The Congress are resolved that you shall aban- 



164 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

don the lines, and give up their country to be ra 
vaged, if they will not defend it upon the same terms 
as those enlisted here (such as marched to Canada 
only excepted). 

The Assembly have it under consideration to raise 
two thousand men for the defence of this Province ; 
but I doubt its taking. Perhaps there may be half 
the number. I am told we can easily raise two or 
three more battalions, if we had arms, &c., for them. 

I do not think I shall bring any person with me 
when I come. Mr. Webb has long had an inclination 
to be in your family. If the post should be agree 
able to him, and he is agreeable to you, I believe I 
should prefer him to any other. The post is just 
going ; so that I have only time to add, that I am, 
my dear Sir, 

Yours, most affectionately, 

JOSEPH PtEED. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, G March, 177G. 

SIR, 

Since my last, I have had the honor of receiving 
your letters of the 24th and 30th of January, 9th, 
14th, 18th, 21st, and 26th of February, which were 
communicated to Congress. On the settlements and 
adjustments of accounts, the Congress have not yet 
come to any determination ; nor have they yet had 
time to contrive expedients for remedying the incon 
veniences mentioned in that of the 9th, which is re 
ferred to, and will be taken up, in a Committee of 
the Whole. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 165 

The Congress highly approve your care and atten 
tion in stopping Lord Drummond s letter, and en 
tirely concur with you in sentiment with regard to 
his Lordship s officious and unwarrantable zeal. 

The situation of the Middle and Southern Colonies 
hath engaged the attention of Congress. These are 
divided into two departments ; the Middle, compre 
hending New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Dela 
ware, and Maryland, under the command of a Major- 
General and two Brigadier-Generals; the Southern, 
comprehending Virginia, North and South Carolina, 
and Georgia, under the command of a Major-General 
and four Brigadier-Generals. As there is reason to 
think that the force of our enemies will be directed 
against the Colonies in the Southern Department, 
Major-General Lee is appointed to that command. 
The Brigadier-Generals are, John Armstrong, William 
Thompson, Andrew Lewis, James Moore, Esq., Lord 
Stirling, and Robert Howe, Esq. 

Of these gentlemen, General Armstrong is directed 
to repair to South Carolina; General Lewis and Gen 
eral Howe to Virginia ; General Moore to North Caro 
lina; and General Thompson and Lord Stirling to 
New York. And, that our affairs in Canada may be 
under the direction of an able officer, and General 
Schuyler s health not permitting him to go thither, 
or, if he could, as his presence is so necessary in 
New York, the Congress have promoted Brigadier- 
General Thomas to the rank of a Major-General, and 
directed him to repair to Canada, and take the com 
mand of the Continental forces in that quarter. I 
have accordingly inclosed him his commission, and 
am to desire you will give him orders to repair, with 
all expedition, to his post. To enable him to exe 
cute the purposes Congress have in view in Canada, 



1G6 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

they have ordered twelve battering cannon to be sent 
from New York, and have forwarded ten tons of 
powder. 

Of this article, we have lately received several sup 
plies, and have, some time ago, ordered five tons and 
a half to be sent to you; which, if you have not 
already received, will, I hope, soon reach you. The 
Congress have also ordered ten tons more of powder 
to be sent to you, which will set out to-morrow or 
next day. Besides this, in the beginning of last 
month they ordered ten tons of saltpetre to be sent 
to Mr. Wisncr s powder-mill, in the Colony of New 
York; and, on the 12th of the same month, ten tons 
to Mr. Livingston s mill, in the same Colony; and 
ten tons to the Council of Massachusetts, with a de 
sire to have it manufactured into gunpowder with all 
possible expedition, and sent to you for the use of 
the army under your command. Besides this, I have 
the pleasure to inform you, that the powder-mills in 
this Colony are employed, and more mills are build 
ing, which will be employed ; so that I have strong 
hopes we shall soon have a plentiful supply of that 
necessary article. 

With regard to arms, I am afraid W T C shall, for a 
time, be under some difficulty. The importation is 
now more precarious and dangerous. To remedy this, 
a Committee is appointed to contract for the making 
arms ; and, as there is a great number of gunsmiths 
in this and the neighbouring Colonies, I flatter my 
self w r e shall soon be able to provide ourselves without 
risk or danger. But W T C must, like other States en- 

o 

gaged in the like glorious struggle, contend with 
difficulties. By perseverance, and the blessing of 
God, I trust, if we continue to deserve freedom, we 
shall be enabled to overcome them. To that Being, 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 167 

in whose hands is the fate of nations, I recommend 
you and the army under your command. 

I have the honor to be, with every sentiment of 
esteem, 

Sir, your most obedient, humble servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK, President. 

P. S. The inclosed letter I request the favor you 
will please order to be delivered to Mr. Gushing. 



FROM COLONEL M C INTOSH. 

Savannah, Georgia, 8 March, 1776. 

SIR, 

I did myself the honor to write to your Excellency 
the 16th ultimo, which, for want of conveyance, lies 
here still, as our Continental post is not well regu 
lated, this length, yet. It is hardly worth troubling 
you with any report of our battalion, as I have heard 
from very few of our recruiting officers, and we have 
only between twenty and thirty men of them in 
town ; but the transactions here, since that time, 
may deserve some notice. The men-of-war at Tybee, 
though still giving out they had no hostile intentions 
against this Colony, were encouraging our slaves to 
desert to them, pilfering our sea islands for provi 
sions ; and our Governor broke his parol of honor, 
and went privately, in the night, with his family, 
aboard the Scarborough, Captain Barclay, which gave 
us every reason to expect they meant to land at or 
near the town, destroy it, and carry off about twenty 
sail of shipping lying in the river, having, among 



168 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

other articles, near three thousand tierces of rice on 
board. 

Between three and fonr hundred of our own mili 
tia, and one hundred from South Carolina, were all 
that could be got to defend an open, straggling, de 
fenceless, and deserted town, with numberless avenues 
leading to it, and those men under no control or 
command whatsoever ; and, to add to the anarchy 
and confusion w r e were in, our Council of Safety had 
not met for some time, having differed about the 
meaning of a resolve of the Continental Congress 
respecting the ships sailing the 1st of March. 

In this desperate state of affairs, 1 ventured to take 
the command of the militia, lest the Colony should 
be tamely given up, though, I must acknowledge, 
with some reluctance ; and, after examining very par 
ticularly, as I was unacquainted, around the town, I 
placed guards everywhere the enemy could land, and 
ambushes in the different roads leading to it, which 
made the duty very severe, and reduced our number 
in town greatly. In the mean time, the Cherokee, 
the two transports, the armed vessels and boats, came 
up the river within two and a half miles of town, 
near where we sunk a hulk in the channel of the 
river, and opposite to Brewton s plantation, where I 
placed a detachment of one hundred and fifty men, 
under command of Colonel Bullock, expecting they 
would attempt to land there. The enemy were 
parading with their boats for several days within 
gunshot of our sentinels, who, though they were 
ordered not to fire unless they were fired upon first, 
or they attempted to land, gave them several shot, 
but were not returned. 

Our Council of Safety w r ere got together, and re 
solved the shipping should not sail, and ordered they 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 169 

should be unrigged. The evening of the 2d of March 
one of the transport ships (the schooner Hinchin- 
brook), and sloop St. John, of eight or ten guns 
each, with some boats, sailed in our sight up the 
North River, back of Hutchinson s Island, lying op 
posite to the town of Savannah, but so far off that a 
little battery we had below the town, which played 
upon them, could do no damage to them. Expecting 
the enemy intended coming round Hutchinson s Island, 
and down the south side of it, to make their landing 
good at Yamacraw (a village three or four hundred 
yards above the town), I had three four-pounders 
carried there, a little battery erected in haste, and 
threw up intrenchnients, and withdrew part of the 
guard at Brewton s, without weakening too much, or 
withdrawing any of our ambushes on that side, lest 
it might be a feint to deceive us. 

About the middle of the same night, as we were 
afterwards informed, the Commodore, Barclay, and 
Majors Grant and Maitland, with about three hun 
dred men, as it was said, landed on the back of 
Hutchinson s Island, with some howitzers and field- 
pieces, and, with the assistance and contrivance of all 
our own seafaring people, and many from the town, 
crossed the Island and hid themselves aboard of our 
merchant ships, which were previously hauled close 
to the Island, a little above our battery at Yama 
craw, for that purpose. Early on Sunday, the 3d, 
the two armed vessels, intending to cover the ene 
my s landing, had come round the Island, and, coming 
down on the south side, were attacked by parties of 
riflers ordered for that purpose, and kept smartly en 
gaged on both sides most of the day, until they lost 
the tide and got aground ; while two sailors (Ame 
ricans), at the risk of their lives, stole ashore and 
VOL. i. 15 



170 LETTEllS TO WASHINGTON. 

informed me the enemy were hid on board our mer 
chant-men, and had taken Joseph Rice prisoner, who 
was employed to unrig them that morning. 

To confirm this intelligence, Messrs. Demere and 
Roberts were ordered to go only alongside the ves 
sels, and, without arms, to demand our felloAV-citizen, 
Mr. Rice ; but, to our astonishment, they were also 
forced on board and kept, which convinced us our 
information was true ; and immediately our little bat 
tery of three guns began to play upon them, which 
they returned ; and was continued very smartly with 
ball, langrage, and small arms, from both sides for 
several hours. Our men were inflamed, particularly 
at our own people, who had treacherously joined the 
enemy against us, and were eager to board them ; 
but we had neither boats, sailors, or arms, proper for 
the attempt^ and the oars of the few boats we had 
were previously stolen away. The general cry then 
was, to set all the shipping on fire ; in attempting 
of which, many of our people showed great resolution 
and bravery ; but, unfortunately, the first ship set 
fire to (valued at twenty thousand pounds sterling), 
was so large that she grounded before she got up to 
the others. Afterwards a sloop w r as fired, which 
burned two others, while the rest were cutting away, 
amidst the shot of our rifles and langrage, and 
slipping higher up the river, out of our reach, with 
the last of the flood. In the mean time, many of 
the soldiers hastily landed on the Island, in great 
confusion, running in the marsh in a laughable man 
ner, for fear of our rifles, though far past their reach, 
until they got aboard a tier of ships higher up the 
river, and out of the reach of our guns, near the 
armed vessels. In this manner ten sail of our vessels 
went along with the enemy round the upper end of 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 171 

the Island (a channel never known before), with six 
teen hundred barrels of rice, with the utmost anxiety 
and fear. 

After being foiled in their scheme upon the town, 
the Commodore and Majors eagerly and repeatedly 
solicited a cessation of hostilities, for which they 
promised immediately to repair to Tybee, and not 
molest us again ; which was at length granted them, 
with seeming difficulty, though the truth was, we 
had no means of annoying them by water. The rest 
of the shipping we hauled close to the wharves, con 
fined some of their Captains, for acting against us, 
with our Chief Justice and some Councillors, until 
they released our fellow-citizens, Demere, Roberts, 
and Rice, and sent them up from Tybee, where our 
enemies are all now gone. 

Whether they intend to try us again or not, I am 
not able to inform your Excellency. In this, I think, 
they rather lost than gained any reputation, and 
have done us great honor, by being the second Pro 
vince on the continent which they attacked, and 
were shamefully foiled. We had, in all our different 
engagements, but two white men and one Indian 
wounded slightly. They must have many both kill 
ed and wounded, though they acknowledge but six. 
Several were seen to fall. 

I have the honor to be, your Excellency s most 
obedient and most humble servant, 

LACHLAN MC!NTOSH. 

P. S. The ships of war have taken all the rice 
(sixteen hundred barrels) out of the merchant-men, 
that so treacherously went down with them, and put 
it aboard their two transport ships, without paying a 
farthing for it. They claim one eighth for "wresting 



172 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

them out of the hands of the rebels/ as the Commo 
dore s certificate expresses it ; but I doubt they will 
keep the other seven eighths also. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL LORD STIRLING 

New York, 11 March, 1776. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

General Lee left this place on Thursday even 
ing last for Philadelphia, on his way for Virginia, 
where he is to command. This has thrown a heavy 
load on my shoulders, and very unexpectedly ; but I 
am likely soon to be relieved from it, as I hear 
Brigadier-General Thompson is to be here in a day 
or two. 

The sudden departure of the post prevents my say 
ing any thing at present relative to the situation of 
this place ; and will only inform you that last 
night three gentlemen landed here from on board a 
packet, nine weeks out from Falmouth. They say 
that seven regiments of foot, amounting to about four 
thousand men, were embarked and ready to sail from 
Cork, about the 6th of January, bound to the south 
ern Colonies ; that Great Britain had engaged four 
thousand Hanoverians and six thousand Hessians, for 
the American service, and were in treaty for ten 
thousand Russians ; that the French Ambassador at 
London had declared to the English Ministry, that 
his master did not mean to meddle with the quarrel 
between Great Britain and her Colonies, while it was 
carried on with its own force ; but that he could not 
be an idle spectator, if any foreign aid was made use 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 173 

of (it was not then known, in London, that the 
French had any troops in the West India Islands) ; 
that it was not likely any more British troops would 
be sent out, for they had them not to spare. 

If these things should be true, I am in hopes we 
shall have an easy summer s work to secure the 
whole Continent. The Commissioners, whose number 
is reduced to twenty, were to embark about the mid 
dle of January. It was said that they were to en 
deavour to treat with the Assemblies of Colonies 
separately, if possible ; and even to retail out cor 
ruption to single toAvns or families ; but if this could 
not succeed, they were to swallow the bitter pill, and 
treat with Congress. 

Adieu, my dear General ; the post waits. But yet, 
present my best regards to Mrs. Washington, Mr. 
and Mrs. Custis, Palfrey, &c. ; and I am, with the 
highest esteem and regard, 

Your most humble servant, 

STIRLING. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL LORD STIRLING. 

New York, 20 March, 1776. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

I received your letter, by express, of the 14th, 
and your letter of the same date to General Lee, 
which I opened and forwarded, agreeably to the di 
rections he left me. I am happy to find that the 
aid I called in from New Jersey and Connecticut ex 
actly concords with your sentiments. 

The two regiments of Connecticut now here, con 
sisting of about five hundred rank and file each, are 



174 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

impatient to go home, as many of them are farmers, 
who want to mark out their summer s work. The 
time of their engagement with General Lee ends 
next Monday. I have used my best endeavours to 
prevail on them to stay till their places are supplied 
from that quarter- but it is still doubtful whether 
they will consent to it. Of this I have apprised Go 
vernor Trumbull, and have requested him to supply 
their places, and to make the whole two thousand 
from that Colony. From New Jersey I have re 
quested one thousand men; about two hundred of 
them are come in. About one thousand are ordered 
from the northern counties of this Province ; none of 
them are yet arrived. We have now in this place 
and in Long Island about twenty-five hundred men, 
including the above two Connecticut regiments. 
The militia in town amount to about as many more. 
Near one half of the whole are on fatigue every 
day, carrying into execution the plan of defence 
formed by General Lee. They go on with great 
spirit and industry. 

The Congress have ordered eight thousand men for 
the defence of this City and Province. The corps to 
make up this number are four regiments from Penn 
sylvania, one from New Jersey, and four of this Pro 
vince, none of which are yet arrived, and most of 
them are incomplete and unfit to march, especially the 
latter, of which not above two hundred are yet in 
town, and some of them I find are to be employed 
on Hudson s River, and the northern parts of this 
Province. From this state of the matter, you will see 
that, if the Ministerial troops leave Boston and move 
this w r ay, how necessary it will be to detach a large 
part of your army to this place, which, undoubtedly, 
is the most important object in North America. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 175 

On receiving your last letter, I had determined to 
detain at this place the eleven tons of powder de 
signed for your camp ; but, lest the manoeuvres at 
Boston should prove a feint, I have ordered five tons 
of it to proceed to-morrow morning. The rest will 
follow according to the intelligence we receive. 

Ten o clock, P. M. Brigadier-General Thompson is 
arrived here this day, and of course takes the com 
mand. My utmost industry will be exerted to assist 
him in it. My most sincere and best wishes attend 
you. I have the honor to be, my dear General, 
Your most obedient, humble servant, 

STIRLING. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 25 March, 1776. 

SIR, 

I had the honor of receiving, yesterday, yours of 
the 19th, containing the agreeable information of the 
Ministerial troops having abandoned Boston. The 
partial victory we have obtained over them, in that 
quarter, I hope will turn out a happy presage of a 
more general one. Whatever place may be the ob 
ject of their destination, it must certainly give a sin 
cere pleasure to every friend of this country, to see 
the most diligent preparations everywhere making to 
receive them. What may be their views, it is in 
deed impossible to tell with any degree of exactness. 
We have all the reason, however, from the rage of 
disappointment and revenge, to expect the worst. 
Nor have I any doubt that, as far as their power 
extends, they will inflict every species of calamity 



176 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

upon us. The same Providence that has baffled their 
attempt against the Province of Massachusetts Bay 
will, I trust, defeat the deep-laid scheme they are 
now meditating against some other part of our coun 
try. 

The intelligence that our army had got possession 
of Boston, you will readily suppose gave me heart 
felt pleasure. I beg/ Sir, you will he pleased to ac 
cept my warmest thanks for the attention you have 
showed to my property in that town. I have only 
to request that Captain Cazneau will continue to 
look after it, and take care that it be no ways de 
stroyed or damaged. 

This success of our arms naturally calls on me to 
congratulate you, Sir, to whose wisdom and conduct 
it has been owing. Permit me to add, that, if a 
constant discharge of the most important duties, and 
the fame attending thereon, can afford genuine satis 
faction, the pleasure you feel must be the most ra 
tional and exalted. 

I have it in charge from Congress to direct, that 
you send an account of the troops in your camp, 
who are deficient in arms, to the several Assemblies 
or Conventions of the Colonies to which those men 
belong, and request them to send a sufficient num 
ber of arms for the men coining from the respective 
Colonies ; and that, if arms cannot be procured, such 
as have not arms be dismissed the service. 

The Congress being of opinion, that the reduction 
of Quebec and the general security of the Province 
of Canada, are objects of great concern, I am com 
manded to direct that you detach four battalions 
into Canada from the army under your command, as 
soon as you shall be of opinion, that the safety of 
New York and the Eastern service will permit. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 177 

Your several letters are at this time under the 
consideration of a Committee. As soon as any de 
termination is made thereon, I will immediately for 
ward it to you. I have the honor to be, with the 
greatest esteem, Sir, your most obedient and very 
humble servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK, President. 



FROM JOHN ADAMS. 

Philadelphia, 1 April, 1776. 

DEAR SIR, 

The bearer of this letter (Francis Dana, Esq., of 
Cambridge) is a gentleman of family, fortune, and 
education, returned in the last packet from London, 
where he has been about a year. He has ever main 
tained an excellent character in his country, and a 
warm friendship for the American cause. He returns 
to share with his friends in their dangers and their 
triumphs. I have done myself the honor to give 
him this letter for the sake of introducing him to 
your acquaintance, as he has frequently expressed to 
me a desire to embrace the first opportunity of pay 
ing his respects to a character so highly esteemed 
and so justly admired throughout all Europe as well 
as America. Mr. Dana Avill satisfy you that we 
have no reason to expect peace from Britain. 

I congratulate you, Sir, as well as all the friends 
of mankind, on the reduction of Boston; an event, 
which appeared to me of so great and decisive im 
portance, that the next morning after the arrival of 
the news, I did myself the honor to move for the 
thanks of Congress to your Excellency, and that a 



178 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

medal of gold should be struck in commemoration of 
it. Congress have been pleased to appoint me, with 
two other gentlemen, to prepare a device. I should 
be very happy to have your Excellency s sentiments 
concerning a proper one. 

I have the honor to, bo, with very great respect, 
Sir, your most obedient and affectionate servant, 

JOHN ADAMS. 



FROM GEORGE MASON. 

Gunston Hall, Virginia, 2 April, 1776. 

DEAR SIR, 

We have just received the welcome news of your 
having, with so much address and success, dislodged 
the Ministerial troops, and taken possession of the 
town of Boston. I congratulate you most heartily 
upon this glorious and important event; an event 
which will render General Washington s name immor 
tal in the annals of America, endear his memory to 
the latest posterity, and entitle him to those thanks, 
which Heaven appointed as the reward of public vir 
tue. 

It is the common opinion here, that we shall have 
a visit from General Howe in some of the Middle or 
Southern Colonies ; but it does not seem well found 
ed. I am very unable to judge of military affairs ; 
but it appears to me that if General Howe acts the 
part of a wise man, and an experienced officer, 
he will not venture a sickly, worn-out, disgusted, 
and disgraced army, in a country where he must 
meet immediate opposition, and where any misfortune 
might produce a mutiny or general desertion. I 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 179 

think it much more probable that he will retire to 
Halifax, give his troops a little time, by ease and 
refreshment, to recover their spirits, and be in readi 
ness, as soon as the season permits, to relieve Que 
bec; keeping some ships of war cruising off Boston 
harbour, to protect and direct the transports which 
may arrive. New York, or any of the Northern 
United Provinces, are too near Cambridge ; for, if he 
could not maintain the advantageous and strongly- 
fortified post of Boston, what reasonable hope has he 
of gaining and maintaining a new one in the face 
of a superior army ? 

You will perhaps smile at these speculative and 
idle suggestions upon a subject which will probably 
be reduced to a certainty, one way or another, long 
before this reaches your hands ; but, when I am con 
versing with you, the many agreeable hours we have 
spent together recur upon my mind. I fancy my 
self under your hospitable roof at Mount Vernon, 
and lay aside reserve. May God grant us a return 
of those halcyon days, when every man may sit 
down at his ease, under the shade of his own- vine 
and his own fig-tree, and enjoy the sweets of domes 
tic life ! Or, if this is too much, may he be pleased 
to inspire us with spirit and resolution to bear our 
present and future sufferings becoming men deter 
mined to transmit to our posterity, unimpaired, the 
blessings we have received from our ancestors. 

Colonel Caswell s victory in North Carolina, and 
the military spirit which it has raised, will be an 
obstacle to any attempts in that quarter. Maryland 
and Virginia are at present rather unprepared, but 
their strength is daily increasing. The late levies 
here have been made with surprising rapidity, and 
the seven new regiments are already in a manner 



180 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

complete, except as to arms, in which they are very 
deficient; but arms are coming in, in small quanti 
ties, from different parts of the country, and a very 
considerable manufactory is established at Fredericks- 
burg. Large ventures have been lately made for 
military stores ; for which purpose we are now load 
ing a ship for Europe, with tobacco, at Alexandria. 
Her cargo is all on float, and I hope to have her 
under sailing in a few days. Notwithstanding the 
natural plenty of provisions in this Colony, I am 
very apprehensive of a great scarcity of beef and 
pork among our troops this summer, occasioned by 
the people s not expecting a market until the slaugh 
ter season was past. I find it extremely difficult to 
lay in a stock for about three hundred men, in the 
marine department of this river. 

Ill health, and a certain listlessness inseparable 
from it, have prevented my writing to you so often 
as I would otherwise have done but I trust to your 
friendship to excuse it. The same cause disabled me 
from attending the Committee of Safety this winter,, 
and induced me to entreat the Convention to leave 
me out of it. I continue to correspond constantly 
with that Board, and I hope am no less usefully em 
ployed, thinking it, in such times as these are, every 
man s duty to contribute his mite to the public ser 
vice. 

I have, in conjunction with Mr. Dalton, the charge 
of providing and equipping armed vessels for the 
protection of this river. The thing is new to me, 
but I must endeavour to improve by experience. I 
am much obliged to the Board for joining Mr. Dal 
ton with me. lie is a steady, diligent man, and 
without such assistance I could not have undertaken 
it. We are building two row-galleys, which are in 



TH E AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 181 

considerable forwardness ; and have purchased three 
sloops for cruisers. Two of them, being only from 
forty to fifty tons burden, are to mount eight car 
riage-guns each, three and four-pounders ; they are 
not yet fitted up. and w r e are exceedingly puzzled to 
get cannon for them. 

The other, the American Congress, is a fine stout 
vessel, of about one hundred and ten tons burden, 
and has such an easy draft of water as will enable 
her to run into most of the creeks, or small har 
bours, if she meets with a vessel of superior force. 
She mounts fourteen carriage-guns, six and four- 
pounders, though we have thoughts of mounting two 
nine-pounders upon her main beam, if we find her 
able, as we think she is, to bear them. Her guns 
are mounted, and to be tried to-morrow. We have 
twenty barrels of powder, and about a ton of shot 
ready ; more is making ; swivels we have not yet 
been able to procure, but she may make a tolerable 
shift without, until they can be furnished. We have 
got some small arms, and are taking every method 
to increase them, and hope to be fully supplied in 
about a week more. Her company of marines is 
raised, and have been for some time exercised to the 
use of the great guns. Her complement of marines 
and seamen is to be ninety-six men. We are exert 
ing ourselves to the utmost, and hope to have her 
on her station in less than a fortnight, and that the 
other vessels will quickly follow her, and be able to 
protect the inhabitants of this river from the pirati 
cal attempts of all the enemy s cutters, tenders, and 
small craft. 

Immediately upon receipt of your former letters, I 
applied to some of the Maryland Committees, as well 
as those on this side ; in consequence of which, the 

VOL. i. 16

several most convenient places on this river were 
sounded, and thoroughly examined ; but effectual bat 
teries were found, in our present circumstances, im 
practicable. Mr. Lund Washington tells me he sent 
you the draughts and soundings taken upon this occa 
sion. A regiment, commanded by Colonel Mercer, 
of Frcdericksburg, is stationed on this part of the 
river, and I hope we shall be tolerably safe, unless 
a push is made here with a large body of men. I 
think we have some reason to hope the Ministry will 
bungle away another summer, relying partly upon 
force, and partly upon fraud and negotiation. 

The family here join with me in presenting their 
best compliments to yourself and lady, as well as to 
Mr. Custis and his. If, in any of your affairs here, I 
can render you any acceptable service, I beg you 
will use that freedom with which I wish you to com 
mand, dear Sir, 

Your affectionate and obedient servant, 

GEORGE MASON. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LEE. 

Williamsburg, 5 April, 177G. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

I most sincerely congratulate you, I congratulate 
the public, on the great and glorious event, your 
possession of Boston. It will be a most bright page 
in the annals of America, and a most abominable 
black one in those of the beldam Britain. Go on, 
my dear General ; crown yourself with glory, and 
establish the liberties and lustre of your country on 
a foundation more permanent than the Capitol Bock. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 183 

My situation is just as I expected. I am afraid 
that I shall make a shabby figure, without any real 
demerits of my own. I am like a dog in a dancing- 
school. I know not where to turn myself, where to 
fix myself. The circumstances of the country, inter 
sected by navigable rivers, the uncertainty of the 
enemy s designs and motions, who can fly in an in 
stant to any spot with their canvas wings, throw 
me, or would throw Julius Caesar, into this inevitable 
dilemma. I may possibly be in the North, when, as 
Richard says, I should serve my sovereign in the 
West. I can only act from surmise, and have a very 
good chance of surmising wrong. 

I am sorry to grate your ears with a truth ; but 
must at all events assure you that the Provincial 
Congress of New York are angels of decision, when 
compared with your countrymen, the Committee of 
Safety assembled at Williamsburg. Page, Lee, Mer 
cer, and Payne are indeed exceptions; but from Pen- 
dleton, Bland, the Treasurer, and Company, libem 
nosy Domine! 

I shall not trouble you with a detail of the army, 
ordnance, stores; but compendiously say, that the 
regiments in general are very complete in numbers, 
the men (those that I have seen) fine, but a most 
horrid deficiency of arms, no intrenching tools, no 
guns (although the Province is pretty well stocked) 
for service. Had I only eight eighte en-pounders, I 
would immediately, at all events, take post on Cra- 
ney Island, by which measure I should drive out the 
enemy, and exclude them from the finest and most 
advantageous port in America. I have ordered, with 
this view, the artificers to work night and day. If 
I succeed, I shall come in for a sprig of laurels. 

This essential measure might have been effected 



184 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

long ago, but the same apathy and oblique squinting 
towards what the milk-and-water people call reconcili 
ation,, the prodigious flattering prospect opened by 
the appointment of Commissioners, were strong argu 
ments against the expense of gun-carriages and in 
trenching tools. 

But this is not all. They have distributed their 
troops in so ingenious a manner as to render every 
active offensive operation impossible. An equal num 
ber of their battalions are stationed on the different 
necks. They say, very acutely, that, as the expense 
is equal, the security ought to be equal. I cannot 
help persuading myself, that their object will be to 
take possession of Williamsburg, not only from its 
tempting advantageous situation, commanding, in great 
measure, two fine rivers, and a country abundant in 
all the necessaries for an army; but the possession 
of the Capital would give an air of dignity and de 
cided superiority to their arms, which, in this slave 
country, w r here dominion is founded on opinion, is a 
circumstance of the utmost importance. Perhaps I 
may be mistaken, but, as the surmise is not irration 
al, I have called three regiments down the country. 

You will excuse, my dear General, the blots and 
scratches of this letter, for the post is just going out. 
By the next, I will inform you of the steps we have 
taken for the security of this place. I have been 
desired to recommend Colonel Grayson as a man of 
extraordinary merit. He sets out soon to make ap 
plication to the Congress for an establishment. If 
we have, as we must, a Continental Hospital in the 
Southern Department, Dr. McClary, I suppose, will 
be the man to direct it. I need not mention his 
qualifications, they are so w r ell known. I beg you 
will make somebody w r rite to me from time to time. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 185 

Indeed, I think I may modestly insist on Mr. Pal 
frey s pen being employed often in this service. 
Adieu, dear General. 

Yours, most respectfully and sincerely, 

CHARLES LEE. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL THOMAS. 

Albany, 7 April, 1776. 

SIR, 

I arrived at Albany in five days after I left the 
camp at Roxbury, at which place I have been de 
tained to this time by reason of the Lakes being 
impassable. The troops here and at Lake George 
are about eleven hundred, and I hear some few are 
at Ticonderoga and Crown Point, prevented going 
forward, as the Lakes are partly blocked up. What 
number are in Canada, I cannot ascertain; but am 
sensible, from the best intelligence, will be much short 
of the number required, as I find the regiments 
are very incomplete. General Schuyler thinks they 
will be much short of five thousand; and should the 
Ministerial troops there be reenforced, and Quebec 
remain in their hands, so small a number must be 
thought to be inadequate for the defence of that 
quarter. Your Excellency will judge whether a re- 
enforcement will not be necessary. 

The last from Canada was about the 25th of 
March, at which time things there remained in statu 
quo. Dr. Franklin and others, of the Committee of 
Congress, arrived here this morning. As the weather 
this day or two is moderate, I am in hopes the Lake 
may be passed in a few days. I determine to set 
16* 



186 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

off for the Lake tomorrow. I am, Sir, with the greatr 
est respect, your Excellency s most obedient and 
Most humble servant, 

JOHN THOMAS. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Fort George, 12 April, 177G. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

Yesterday I had the honor to receive your favor 
of the 3d instant, by Bennet, who overtook me on 
my way to this place. All is in readiness to move, 
as soon as the Lakes open, which, I hope, will be in 
a day or two. General Thomas is here, six com 
panies of Burrell s regiment from Connecticut, two 
companies of the First Pennsylvania Battalion, and 
three of the New Jersey. The remainder of these 
corps arc gone on, whereof two companies are about 
forty-five miles below Crown Point; the rest have 
reached Canada, We have also here two companies 
of Van Schaick s, of this Colony; and five companies 
of the Second Pennsylvania Battalion are at Fort 
Edward, waiting for the Lake to open, as I have no 
quarters for them at this place. The remainder of 
Van Schaick s are not yet raised; and two companies 
of the First Pennsylvania Battalion are on their way 
from New York. 

I should be extremely happy, my dear General, to 
pay my devoirs to you at New York; but I do not 
see a possibility of quitting this quarter, without risk 
ing all in Canada. Unless some other general officer 
should relieve me, I shall, therefore, presume to re 
main, unless I receive your further orders. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 187 

Four o clock, P. M. This moment the post from 
Canada is arrived. I inclose you copies of all the 
papers I received. The intelligence they afford is so 
alarming., that I beg leave to repeat my wish that a 
considerable body of troops should be immediately 
sent up. 

I have stopped the courier at this place, and he 
goes back immediately to advise our friends in Ca 
nada, that the troops now here will soon be in 
Canada; and I have presumed to add, that they will 
be followed by three or four thousand more. This 
intelligence will keep up their spirits, and intimidate 
our enemies. 

I have, heretofore, observed to your Excellency, 
that I had never received a return of the army in 
Canada. I am, on that account, still incapable of let 
ting you know the strength of our army there. I am 
equally in the dark with respect to the arrangement 
made in officering the two regiments that were to 
be raised out of the troops that wintered there. 

The provisions at these posts are very trifling. 
None of what General Lee has contracted for is 
come to Albany; and, unless a speedy supply is sent 
up, our troops in Canada must suffer. I have written 
on this subject to General Thompson before I left 
Albany; and although I make not the least doubt 
but that he will forward it, if he can, yet I beg 
leave to mention it, lest he should forget to mention 
it on the arrival of his superior officer at New York. 

I am seized with a copious scorbutic eruption, 
which I have frequently experienced, and imagined 
it threw off some other more disagreeable disorder. 
I believe it will not confine me, or prevent me from 
doing my duty. I am, dear General, most sincerely, 
Your obedient, humble servant, 

PHILIP SCHUYLEE. 



188 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

PROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 23 April, 1776. 

SIR 

I am to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of 
the 19th of April, inclosing several papers; all which 
were immediately laid before Congress. 

The important intelligence they contain makes it 
necessary that the most vigorous measures should 
be adopted, as well to defend our troops against the 
Canadians themselves, as to insure success to the ex 
pedition. The Congress being determined on the re 
duction of Quebec, and the security of that country, 
for reasons too obvious to be mentioned, have left 
nothing undone which can any ways contribute to 
that end. Whatever may be the causes of the late 
insurrection, good policy requires, that while w r e endea 
vour to prevent every thing of the kind for the fu 
ture, we should also make provision in case it should 
happen. Accordingly Congress have come into sundry 
resolutions calculated to quiet the minds of the Cana 
dians, and to remove the sources of their uneasiness 
and discontent. They have likewise ordered six more 
battalions to be sent into Canada from the army at 
New York, as you will see by the inclosed resolve. 
Whether any further additional forces will be wanted 
there, is a matter of some uncertainty with Congress. 
Should you, from your knowledge of facts, the state 
of Canada, the possibility that General Howe will 
attempt to relieve General Carleton, and, comparing 
all circumstances together, be of opinion that an addi 
tional force is still necessary, you will please to sig 
nify it to Congress, and at the same time inform 
them whether, in that case, such additional force can 
be spared from the army now at New York. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 189 

I transmit, herewith, sundry resolves of Congress 
for your direction; and have the honor to be, Sir, 
your 

Most obedient and very humble servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK, President. 

P. S. The inclosed letter for Commodore Hopkins, 
I leave unsealed for your perusal only ; after which I 
beg of you the favor to seal and forward it by Fes- 
senden, or a fresh express. I have paid Mr. Fessen- 
den twelve dollars, which you will please to note on 
settlement with him. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL THOMAS. 

Montreal, 27 April, 1776. 

SIR, 

I have been so unfortunate, by reason of the Lake 
being blocked up with ice, as not to be able to reach 
this city until last evening; and the troops which 
were at Albany and Fort George, waiting for the 
opening of the Lakes, have not yet arrived on this 
side; but as they are on their way, I hope to see 
them in a few days. 

I have endeavoured to inform myself from General 
Arnold, and other gentlemen in this city, of the state 
of our army before Quebec, and in other parts of the 
Province of Canada. I find that the troops, who 
engaged only to the 15th of April, are mostly on 
their return home, and cannot be prevailed on to 
continue longer in the country; and, by the informa 
tion given me, have no reason to expect, that when 
those who are on their way here shall arrive, the 



190 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

whole will much exceed four thousand, exclusive of 
a small number of Canadians., who have and are 
likely to engage in the Continental service. The 
artillery, powder, c., are not yet arrived, and little 
or no preparation made, as I expected there would 
have been, for the defence of the country ; not an 
artificer, as I can find, for building boats or floating 
batteries, which are, in my opinion, very necessary 
to defend the river; nor a person who understands 
the use of artillery, except those who are confined in 
Quebec. 

The provisions are not more than sufficient to vict 
ual the troops to the 10th of May, and the Conti 
nental currency has but little credit, which makes it 
extremely difficult to discharge the debts contracted 
among the inhabitants, whose dispositions are not so 
friendly as heretofore, owing partly to their not being 
paid so punctually for their services as they were 
promised, and partly to their disappointment in not 
seeing the number of troops coming into the country, 
which they have been taught to expect. When 1 
mention the quantity of provisions, I mean the provi 
sions already here, exclusive of three hundred barrels 
of pork, which General Sclmyler is sending forward. 

The Committee of Congress have not yet arrived; 
and unless, on their arrival, they can give credit to 
the Continental currency, we shall be subjected to 
many inconveniences. I am not at present able to 
make out a perfect return of the troops here, but 
shall as soon as in my power. 

From this situation of things, your Excellency will 
judge, whether double the number of troops, men 
tioned above, will be more than sufficient for the 
defence of this Province, should there be a reenforce- 
ment of the Ministerial troops ; as there is the utmost 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 191 

reason to suppose there will be, as soon as the navi 
gation of the river will permit, especially considering 
the little dependence that is to be made on the Ca 
nadians. 

I should have been happy, could I, consistently 
with truth, have given a more pleasing account of 
the state of our affairs in Canada; but it is niy duty 
to represent facts as they are. I am, Sir, with the 
greatest respect, 

Your most obedient, humble servant, 

JOHN THOMAS. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL WARD. 

Boston, 4 May, 1776. 

SIR, 

Your letter of the 29th of April is just come to 
hand. Agreeably to your desire, I shall give an 
account of what has been done towards fortifying the 
harbour. The forts on Fort Hill in Boston, Charles- 
town Point, and Castle Point, are almost completed, 
with a number of heavy cannon mounted in each. 
A work is in good forwardness on Noddle s Island, 
and a detachment of the army is at work at Castle 
Island, repairing the batteries there. A number of 
hulks are preparing to sink in the channel. I have 
employed the troops here to the greatest advantage 
in my power; have ordered all the men, not on actual 
duty, to turn out upon fatigue every day, not allow 
ing any superfluous cooks nor waiters; and, upon 
receiving intelligence of the British fleet being on its 
passage this way, I directed all the officers to turn 
out with their men upon the works, which they cheer- 



192 LETTERS TO TV A SHIN GT ON. 

fully complied with, and are instantly upon fatigue 
with their men. I have set every wheel in motion, 
which I could move to advantage, and shall neglect 
nothing in my power in order to give the enemy a 
proper reception, if they should pay us a visit. 

I have inclosed a return of this division of the 
army. 

I am to inform your Excellency, that I have just 
received a letter from the President of the Congress, 
by which I am informed the Congress has accepted 
my resignation. The sooner I am relieved, the more 
agreeable it will be to me, as my health has declined 
much this spring. I am 

Your Excellency s obedient, humble servant, 

ARTEMAS WARD. 



FROM GOVERNOR CO ORE. 

Providence, 6 May, 177G. 

SIR, 

Your Excellency s favor, in which you assure me 
you will recommend this unhappy Colony to the Con 
tinental Congress, hath been laid before the General 
Assembly, to whom it gave great satisfaction. 

I inclose you a copy of Colonel Babcock s dismis 
sion. The office of Brigadier-General is still kept 
vacant, in hopes that the brigade will be put upon 
the Continental establishment, and that a Command 
er-in-chief will be appointed by Congress. 

I also inclose a copy of an act, discharging the 
inhabitants of this Colony from allegiance to the 
King of Great Britain, which was carried in the House 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 193 

of Deputies, after a debate, with but six dissentient 
voices, there being upwards of sixty members present. 
I may also inform your Excellency, that the Delegates 
from this Colony are instructed and authorized to 
join with the major part of the Delegates in enter 
ing into a treaty with any Prince, State, or Poten 
tate for the security of the Colonies, and to adopt 
any other measures that may be thought prudent and 
effectual. This instruction passed ncm. con. 

The Lower House afterwards passed a vote for 
taking the sense of the inhabitants at large, upon 
the question of Independence ; but the Upper House 
having represented to them, that it would probably 
be discussed in Congress before the sense of the 
inhabitants could be taken, and transmitted to the 
Delegates, in which case the Colony would lose their 
voice, as the Delegates would be laid under the ne 
cessity of waiting for instructions from their con 
stituents, and further observed that the Delegates, 
when they should receive a copy of the vote, renounc 
ing allegiance to the British King, and their instruc 
tions, could not possibly be at a loss to know the 
sentiments of the General Assembly, upon this the 
matter was dropped. 

I have also the satisfaction to inform your Excel 
lency that, at a very full town-meeting of the inha 
bitants of Newport, held last Monday, it w r as unani 
mously voted to enter into the defence of the town; 
and last Thursday a considerable body of them began 
to work upon the fort to be erected upon Brenton s 
Point. This happy event, I have great hopes, will 
make us an united people, and root up every seed 
of disaffection in the Colony. 

I take the liberty, once more, to press your Excel 
lency in behalf of the Colony, the defence of which

must be abandoned unless we receive assistance from 
the Congress. I am, with great respect, Sir, your 
Most obedient and most humble servant, 

NICHOLAS COOKE. 

P. S. By this day s post I have forwarded to Mr. 
Hopkins an instruction from the General Assembly, 
directing him to make immediate application to Con 
gress to put our troops upon the Continental esta 
blishment. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL ARNOLD. 

Montreal, 8 May, 177G. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

Your favor of the 3d of April I received a few 
days since, and I should have answered by the last 
post, but was obliged to go to Chamblee to give 
directions about some gondolas building there. I 
heartily congratulate you on the success of your arms 
against Boston, and am sorry it is not in my power 
to give you a more pleasing account of our affairs in 
this country, which wear no very favorable aspect at 
present. General Thomas arrived here about ten 
days since, and has joined the army before Quebec. 
General Wooster is disgusted, and expected here 
daily. Our army consists of few more than two 
thousand effective men, and twelve hundred sick and 
unfit for duty, chiefly with smallpox, which is uni 
versal in the country. We have very little provisions, 
no cash, and less credit; and, until the arrival of the 
heavy cannon and two mortars from Cambridge, our 
artillery has been trifling. The mortars I expect will 
reach the camp to-morrow, and shells can be supplied 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 195 

from Three Rivers. I hope they will have the de 
sired effect ; the want of cash has greatly retarded 
our operations in this country. We are fortifying 
two very important posts, which command the river 
at Richelieu, fifteen leagues above, and at Jacques 
Cartier, which commands a pass between two moun 
tains, eleven leagues above Quebec. If succours 
should arrive before we can possess ourselves of Que 
bec, I hope we shall be able to maintain these two 
posts until a reenforcement arrives to our assistance, 
which we are told are on their way here. These are 
the only posts that secure the river, until you ap 
proach near Montreal ; and of so much consequence, 
that nothing but superior numbers will oblige us to 
abandon them. 

I have mounted three twenty-four-pounders on a 
gondola, and armed several bateaux, which go down 
the river to-morrow ; these, with a schooner mounting 
ten guns, and a gondola mounting one twelve-pound 
er, are all the force we have in the river. Four 
other gondolas are building at Chamblee, calculated 
to mount three heavy pieces of cannon, but will not 
be completed these two weeks. To-morrow I set off 
to the army with no very agreeable prospect before 
me. Should the enemy receive any considerable re- 
enforcement soon, I make no doubt we shall have 
our hands full. At any rate, we will do all that can 
be expected from raw troops, badly clothed and fed, 
and worse paid, and without discipline. I trust the 
event to Providence. 

We have received advice that the eighth regiment, 
of about four hundred men, with a number of sa 
vages, are coming down from the upper countries. I 
have posted five hundred men at the Cedars, a nar 
row pass fifteen leagues above this place. They have 



196 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

two pieces of cannon, and well intrenched, by which 
they must pass. 

I have only time to beg you will accept my best 
wishes and respectful compliments, and make the 
same to the gentlemen of your family. I am, most 
respectfully, dear General, 

Your obedient and very humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL THOMAS. 

Head- Quarters, Point Dechambeau, 8 May, 1776. 

SIR, 

Immediately on my arrival at the camp before 
Quebec, which was on the 1st instant, I examined 
into the state of the army, and found, by the returns, 
there were nineteen hundred men. Of this number 
only one thousand were fit for duty, officers included; 
the remainder were invalids, chiefly confined with the 
smallpox. Three hundred of the effective were sol 
diers whose enlistments expired on the 15th ultimo, 
many of whom peremptorily refused duty, and all 
were very importunate to return home ; and two hun 
dred others, engaged for the year, had received the 
infection of the smallpox by inoculation, and would, 
in a short time, be in the hospitals. Several posts 
were necessary to be supported by the small number 
able to do duty, at such distances from each other, 
that by means of rivers and other obstructions, not 
more than three hundred men could be rallied to the 
support of any one post, should it be attacked by 
the whole force of the enemy. In all our magazines 
there were but one hundred and fifty pounds of pow- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 197 

der, nor more than six days provision ; the French 
inhabitants (as I hinted in my last) much disaffect 
ed, so that supplies of any kind were obtained with 
great difficulty from them. 

Considering these and many other disagreeable cir 
cumstances, I thought it expedient to call a Council 
of War; and the Council, consisting of Brigadier-Gene 
ral Wooster, and all the field-officers in camp, after 
mature deliberation, were unanimously of the opinion 
that, as, upon the first arrival of any reenforcement 
to the enemy, all communication by the river would 
inevitably be cut off by their armed vessels, it was 
absolutely necessary, for the safety of the invalids, 
immediately to remove them to Three Rivers, and to 
collect the artillery and other stores, in order to 
move them and the army further up the river, as 
soon as it could conveniently be done, to secure some 
posts where there would be a prospect of resisting 
with success. This was on the 5th instant, and, in 
the evening of the same day, I received certain in 
telligence of fifteen ships being forty leagues below 
Quebec. Early next morning, five of them, appeared 
in sight, and the wind and tide being favorable, they 
soon arrived before the city. We were at this time 
employed in carrying the sick on board the bateaux, 
removing the artillery, &c. ; the enemy, in landing 
their troops, and, as the event shows, in preparing to 
make a sally. Our movements were retarded by the 
change the arrival of these vessels produced in the 
inhabitants ; for they would neither furnish us with 
teams, nor afford us the least assistance, but kept 
themselves concealed. 

About one o clock, a considerable body of the ene 
my attacked our sentries and main guard, in conse 
quence of which I instantly ordered the troops under 
17* 



198 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

arms, and detached a party to support the main 
guard, which was now coming off in good order. 
By the best judgment I could make, the enemy were 
a thousand strong, formed into two divisions, in 
columns six deep. 

The most that we could collect at this time, on 
the Plains, did not exceed a quarter of that number, 
with one field-piece, whereas the enemy were sup 
ported with a train of six pieces of cannon. 

No intrenchments had been thrown up, nor any 
lines formed, which would serve for a cover. We 
had no place of retreat, if we had been overpowered 
with numbers ; a defeat would have been decisive 
against the whole army in this encampment, and vic 
tory would have given us no considerable advantages, 
as the enemy might securely have retreated to their 
garrison, and their shipping entirely commanded the 
river. 

This being our situation, rather than contend on 
so unequal ground, with so little probability of reap 
ing emolument by the contest, by advice of the field- 
officers present, I gave orders for the army to march 
up the river, as far as this place, where the greater 
part came up yesterday. On my arrival, I without 
delay called a Council of War, a copy of the determi 
nations of which I have inclosed, as I have of that 
held in the camp before Quebec. The result of the 
council was, as your Excellency will see, to advance 
still further up the river, and was founded on several 
reasons, some of which I will suggest. The ships of 
war were hastening forward with all possible despatch, 
and had already got up to Jacques Cartier, between 
two and three leagues distant from hence ; we had 
no cannon to prevent their passing the falls of Ri 
chelieu (the only advantageous post to fortify for 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 199 

this purpose) ; our provision would not more than 
subsist the army for two or three days. We should, 
therefore, labor under the same disadvantages at De- 
chambeau as before Quebec ; the men-of-war would 
run up the river, intercept all our resources, and soon 
oblige us to decamp. 

I shall, however, send the invalids forward, and re 
main here myself, with about five hundred men, until 
I receive advices from Montreal, whether such sup 
plies can be despatched immediately, as will enable 
me to defend this post. 

The cannon in the bateaux w r ere taken ; and near 
two tons of powder, which General Schuyler had for 
warded by Lieutenant-Colonel Allen, were unfortu 
nately intercepted by a frigate, before it reached the 
camp. 

I hope my conduct, in tnese transactions, will meet 
with jour Excellency s approbation. I have kept the 
importance of the cause in view, and acted according 
to the best of my understanding. I do not mean to 
reflect on any gentleman, w r ho has had the command 
in this department; but, in my ideas of war, as there 
was nothing which promised success in the issue, it- 
would have been highly proper to have made this 
movement some weeks past, I am, with great re 
spect, your Excellency s 

Most obedient, humble servant, 

JOHN THOMAS. 



200 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL WARD. 

Boston, 9 May, 1776. 

SIR, 

By Mr. Harrison s letter, of the 2d instant, I am 
acquainted that yon have been informed "the regi 
ments stationed on Dorchester Heights and Bunker s 
Hill have not been employed in carrying on the 
works for the defence of Boston," which represent 
ation is an injurious falsehood; and I beg to be in 
formed who made it. I have paid the strictest atten 
tion to your instructions, and constantly employed the 
men, to the greatest advantage, in forwarding the 
works for the defence of the town and harbour of 
Boston, that I could. Six companies of Colonel Sar 
gent s regiment have been employed in demolishing 
the enemy s works on Bunker s Hill, and building the 
fort on Charlestown Point, until these were nearly 
completed. Since, the greatest part of them have 
been at work on Noddle s Island. Colonel Ilutchin- 
son s regiment has been employed in the works on 
Dorchester Point, next to Castle Island, until that 
fort was nearly finished, and then I ordered part of 
the regiment to work on Castle Island in repairing 
the batteries there. I believe I can truly affirm that 
more work has never been done in the American ar 
my by an equal number of troops, than lias been 
performed by the troops which are stationed here, in 
the same space of time ; but, because fifteen hundred 
men could not throw up works as fast as six or 
seven thousand had done in time past, there appeared 
to some people an unaccountable delay. 

I have the pleasure to inform your Excellency 
that, on the 7th instant, Captain Tucker, commander 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 201 

of the armed schooner Hancock, took two brigs in 
the Bay (within sight of the men-of-war), and carried 
them into Lynn. One of them was from Cork, nine 
ty tons burden, laden with beef, pork, butter, and 
coal; the other w r as from the Western Islands, laden 
with wine and fruit, about one hundred tons burden. 
Neither of them gave any important intelligence ; 
they brought no papers nor letters that had any re 
lation to public affairs. The master of the Irish ves 
sel says he sailed from Cork the 1st of April ; that 
five regiments lay there ready to embark for Ame 
rica; that he heard that Hessians and Hanoverians 
were coming to America; but had not heard of any 
troops having sailed from Great Britain or Ireland 
for America this spring. I am 

Your Excellency s obedient, humble servant, 

AKTEMAS WARD. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LEE. 

Williamsburg, 10 May, 1776. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

The most compendious method to give you an idea 
of the state of your Province, is to inclose to you 
the result of a Council of Officers, every article of 
which is approved by your Convention. We have 
just received an express from North Carolina, inform 
ing us of the arrival of eight large transports in 
Cape Fear River, in the whole containing, as it is 
supposed, about two thousand men. I had before, on 
a suspicion of their arrival, detached a battalion of 
riflemen, and shall set out myself the day after to 
morrow. 



202 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

The Convention lias ordered twelve hundred militia 
or minute-men to that Province. My command, as 
you may easily conceive, is extremely perplexing 
from the consideration of the vast extent of the 
valuable parts of this country, intersected by such a 
variety of navigable waters, and the expedition with 
which the enemy, furnished with canvas wings, can 
fly from one spot to another. Had we arms for the 
minute-men, and half a dozen good field engineers, we 
might laugh at their efforts; but in this article (like 
the rest of the Continent) we are miserably deficient. 
Engineers we have but two ; and they threaten to 
resign, as it is impossible that they should subsist 
on a more wretched pittance than common carpenters 
or bricklayers can earn. I have written to the Con 
gress, entreating them to augment the pay. A word 
from you would, I make no doubt, effect it. 

I wish, my dear General, you would send me Cap 
tain Smith, on condition Congress make it worth his 
while ; otherwise, I have not the conscience to pro 
pose it. I am well pleased with your officers in 
general, and the men are good, some Irish rascals 
excepied. I have formed two companies of grena 
diers to each regiment, and with spears of thirteen 
feet long. Their rifles (for they are all riflemen) 
sling over their shoulders ; their appearance is formi 
dable, and the men are conciliated to the weapon. I 
am likewise furnishing myself with four-ounced rifle- 
amusettes, which will carry an infernal distance ; the 
two-ounced hit a half sheet of paper five hundred 
yards distant. So much for military. 

A noble spirit possesses the Convention. They are 
almost unanimous for independence, but differ in their 
sentiments about the mode ; two days will decide it. 
I have the pleasure to inform you that I am ex- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 203 

tremely well in the opinion of the senatorial part, as 
well as of the people at large. God send me grace 
to preserve it ! But their neighbours of Maryland (I 
mean their Council of Safety) make a most damnable 
clamor (as I am informed) on the subject of a letter 
I wrote to the Chairman of the Committee of Balti 
more, to seize the person and papers of Mr. Eden, 
upon the discovery which was communicated to me 
of his treacherous correspondence with the Secretary 
of State. It was a measure not only justifiable in 
the eyes of God and men, but absolutely necessary. 
The Committee of Safety here are indeed as deep in 
the scrape as myself. The Congress must, and will, 
I dare say, support and vindicate the measure. 

Captain Green and his party are upon their march, 
as you ordered. I was a d d blockhead for bring 
ing them so far, as their accounts will be intricate ; 
but I hope not so intricate as not to be unriddled. 
I send you an account of the money I advanced to 
the different officers, to Captains Smith, Lunt, and 
Green. I have taken the liberty to appoint a Ser 
geant Denmark, of the Rifle battalion, to do duty as 
Ensign. lie is a man of worth, and I beg you 
will confirm his commission. Another Sergeant, of 
the same battalion, I have promoted to the rank of 
second Lieutenant in the Artillery of this Province. 
He is a German, his name Holmer, and very deserv 
ing. If little Eustace cannot be provided for with 
you, I could wish, if there is a cheap method of do 
ing it, you would send him to me, as I have it in 
my power to please him, and quite doat upon him. 

My love to Mrs. Washington, Gates, and her bad 
half, to Moylan; but Palfrey is a scoundrel for not 
writing. Adieu, my dear General. 

Yours, most entirely, 

CHARLES LEE. 



204 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL WARD. 

Boston, 20 May, 1776. 

SIR, 

I am to inform your Excellency that yesterday af 
ternoon, Captain Mugford, in the armed schooner 
Franklin, fell down in order to go out on a cruise, 
but ffot aground near Point Shhiev in the evening. 

o O / ~ 

Major Frazer s little armed schooner went down at 
the same time with the Franklin, and anchored not 
far from her. About midnight, a number of sail and 
other boats from the men-of-war attacked the two 
armed schooners. The people on board Major Frazer s 
cut their cable and came up. Captain Mugford was 
very fiercely attacked by twelve or thirteen boats, 
full of men ; but he and his men exerted themselves 
with remarkable bravery, beat off the enemy, sunk 
several of their boats, and killed a number of their 
men; it is supposed they lost sixty or seventy. The 
intrepid Captain Mugford fell a little before the ene 
my left his schooner; he was run through with a 
lance, while he was cutting off the hands of the pirates 
as they were attempting to board him ; and it is said 
that with his own hand he cut off five pairs of theirs. 
No other man was either killed or wounded on board 
the Franklin. 

These are all the particulars I have been able to 
collect, as but one man has yet come up from the 
schooner this morning. 

I am your Excellency s obedient, humble servant, 

ARTEMAS WARD. 

P. S. Mr. Mugford was not commissioned Captain 
of the Franklin, but master ; and, as the other officers 
had left the schooner, he took the command.

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 21 May, 1776. 

SIR, 

As I imagine this will meet you on the road to 
this place, I waive making any mention of public 
matters, except that it is the wish of Congress you 
would, if consistent with the good of the service, 
order one battalion from. New York to be posted at 
Aniboy, in the Jerseys, agreeably to the inclosed re 
solve. 

General Gates arrived this morning; soon after 
which I was honored with your favor by post, w r hich 
I laid before Congress; and, as they expect you so 
soon here, I imagine they will defer consulting Gen 
eral Gates, and wait your arrival. 

Your favor of the 20th instant I received this 
morning, and cannot help expressing the very great 
pleasure it would afford both Mrs. Hancock and my 
self to have the happiness of accommodating you 
during your stay in this city. As the house I live 
in is large and roomy, it will be entirely in your 
power to live in that manner you should wish. 
Mrs. Washington may be as retired as she pleases 
while under inoculation, and Mrs. Hancock will es 
teem it an honor to have Mrs. Washington inocu 
lated in her house ; and, as I am informed Mr. Ran 
dolph has not any lady about his house to take the 
necessary care of Mrs. Washington, I flatter myself 
she will be as well attended in my family. In 
short, Sir, I must take the freedom to repeat my 
wish, that you would be pleased to condescend to 
dwell under my roof. I assure you, Sir, I will do 
all in my power to render your stay agreeable, and 
VOL. i. 18 



206 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

my house shall be entirely at your disposal. I must, 
however, submit this to your determination, and only 
add that you will peculiarly gratify Mrs. Hancock and 
myself in affording me an opportunity of convincing 
you of this truth, that I am, with every sentiment 
of regard for you and your connections, and with 
much esteem, dear Sir, your faithful and most obe 
dient and humble servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK. 

P. S. Fessenden is complaining for the want of 
money; I have advanced him sixteen dollars, which 
you will please to order him to account for. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL GREENE. 

Long Island, 21 May, 1776. 

DEAR SIR, 

From the last accounts from Great Britain, it ap 
pears absolutely necessary that there should be an 
augmentation of the American forces, in consequence 
of which I suppose there will be several promotions. 
As I have no desire of quitting the service, I hope 
the Congress will take no measure that will lay me 
under the disagreeable necessity of doing it. I have 
ever found myself exceeding happy under your Ex 
cellency s command. I wish my ability to deserve 
was equal to my inclination to merit. How far I 
have succeeded in my endeavours, I submit to your 
Excellency s better judgment. I hope I shall never 
be more fond of promotion than studious to merit it. 
Modesty will ever forbid me to apply to that House 
for any favors. I consider myself immediately under 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 207 

your Excellency s protection, and look up to you for 
justice. Every man feels himself wounded, where he 
finds himself neglected, and that in proportion as he 
is conscious of endeavouring to merit attention. I 
shall be satisfied with any measure that the Congress 
shall take, that has not a direct tendency to degrade 
me in the public estimation. A measure of that 
sort would sink me in my own esteem, and render 
me spiritless and uneasy in my situation, and conse 
quently unfit for the service. 

I wish for nothing more than justice, either upon 
principle of merit or rank, and will at all times rest 
satisfied when your Excellency tells me I ought to 
be. I feel myself strongly attached to the cause, to 
the Continental Congress, and to your Excellency s 
person and I should consider it a great misfortune 
to be deprived of an opportunity of taking an active 
part in the support of the one, and the promotion of 
the other. 

But should any thing take place contrary to my 
wishes, which might furnish me with sufficient reason 
of quitting the service, yet I will not do it, until the 
danger and difficulties appear less than at present. 
Believe me to be, with the highest respect, your Ex 
cellency s 

Most obedient and humble servant, 

NATHANAEL GREENE. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL THOMPSON. 

Camp at Sorcl, 2 June, 1776. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

The news of this country you will hear from the 
Honorable Commissioners of Congress. The prospect 



208 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

is rather unfavorable on our side at present, but I 
hope will clear up. 

On the night of the 31st ultimo, I received an ac 
count of General Carleton s having passed the Rapids 
of Richelieu, whilst I was at Chaniblee, attending a 
Council of War. I made no delay in setting out for 
this place, and arrived in time to prevent any bad 
consequences following the intelligence here. 

Having received information, that Colonel McLean, 
with about eight hundred regulars and Canadians, had 
advanced as for up as the Three Rivers, I have sent 
off Colonel St. Clair, with between six and seven 
hundred men, to attack his camp, if it can be done 
with the least probability of success. This may be 
a means to prevent the Canadians and savages from 
taking up arms against us, which they begin already 
to do, and might otherwise, in a little time, increase 
the number of the enemy to a very formidable force. 
Colonel St. Clair is an officer of great experience, 
and I make no doubt he will acquit himself well of 
his command. 

I have wrote to General Arnold, at Montreal, to 
send the Pennsylvania troops, in number about three 
hundred, from thence to join me here ; and likewise 
to the Baron,* to send from St. John s the first regi 
ment that arrives there. With those troops I may 
be able to make the most advantage of Colonel St. 
Clair s success, if he should prove fortunate, or sup 
port a retreat, if driven to that necessity. 

Had I arrived in this country two weeks sooner, 
with my reenforcement, I think we could have pre 
vented General Carleton s passing Dechambeau this 



* Baron de Woedtke, a Brigadier-General in the American service. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 209 

summer. Three thousand men could have defended 
Canada at that place, better than ten thousand can 
now we are out of possession of it. I now begin to 
entertain doubt of our ability to keep the Province. 
Our artillery is lost; and the New England troops 
are so much infected with, or afraid of, the small 
pox, as to almost prevent their doing duty. Could I 
have the command of the Jersey and Pennsylvania 
regiments, I still believe, if I could not keep the 
country, it would require at least five thousand men 
to oblige me to evacuate it, and that we could be 
easing the southern Colonies of so many enemies 
during the course of the campaign, and perhaps re 
cover a little of the honor we have lately so lavishly 
thrown away. 

Mr. Chase is of opinion we may with safety break 
the capitulation made with General Arnold. T is 
extremely hard to give up all the fruits of the last 
year s campaign in Canada, which cost so much, and, 
what was still a greater loss to us, the life of Gene 
ral Montgomery, without even releasing our distressed 
friends in Quebec. But, if engagements of this deli 
cate nature are broken, without the fullest testimony 
to support us, we shall be forever undone. 

I have sent off the sick and heavy baggage from 
hence, that, if I am reduced to the necessity of re 
treating, I can do it with little loss. 

Including the men that went with Colonel St. 
Clair, those employed in rowing his boats and gone 
to remove the sick, with fifty stationed on the oppo 
site side of the St. Lawrence, the number of troops 
here is reduced to about two hundred. In a few 
days I shall be joined by Colonel Dehaas with his 
detachment. 

My greatest distress, at present, is on account of 
IS* 



210 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON, 

the unhappy situation of the Canadians, who have 
taken an active part with us, as I know not whether 
I shall long have it in my power to protect them 
from the vengeance of General Carleton, with which 
they are threatened. They apprehend the worst, and 
are truly objects of compassion. I am, my dear 
General, 

Your affectionate, humble servant, 

WILLIAM THOMPSON. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL SULLIVAN/ 1 " 

Cbamblcc, 3 June, 1776. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

I had wrote a letter to Congress, and expected to 
have the honor of writing one to you before the 
Commissioners departed ; but, as I found them going 
off before I could possibly finish one to you, I 
sealed that, and begged Mr. Chase to desire your 
Excellency to open and read it, which contained the 
purport of what I intended to write your Excellency. 
I have, since that, been to Montreal, and find almost 
every person agreed to depart, without even seeing 
the enemy. 

General Thompson writes, that about eight hundred 
of the enemy had arrived at Three Rivers, forty-five 
miles below Sorel, where he is. This he has by re 
port only. I find that all the heavy baggage is sent

away, with the intrenching tools, &c. On that ac 
count I have ordered them back, and am this mo 
ment embarking for Sorel, where I hope to arrive 
by daybreak, and meet them with all the force I 
can make. I am far from fearing eight hundred men 
against such a force as I can muster. I have de 
sired all the general officers to be with me there, 
who seem well satisfied to go on. Want of time 
prevents my writing more fully on the state of 
affairs here at present, which I shall not forget to do 
as soon as possible. In the interim, I am, dear Ge 
neral, with great respect, 

Your most obedient servant, 

JOHN SULLIVAN. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL SULLIVAN. 

Sorel, 5 June, 1776. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I have the pleasure to inform you, that I arrived 
here at a very critical moment with my brigade. 
General Thompson was left but with very few men 
to defend this important post, the troops being scat 
tered about in a most shocking manner. I had is 
sued orders for all the well men to follow me, as, 
upon departure of General Wooster and the death of 
General Thomas, the command devolved upon me. 

Having given these orders, I proceeded, with the 
troops I brought with me, to join General Thompson, 
who was in the greatest distress. As General Carle- 
ton s fleet had passed the Sorel, and was coming up 
the river with a fair wind (as was reported in all 
quarters), a retreat seemed in all parts to be agreed 



212 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

upon; and the heavy baggage and most of the artil 
lery were removed to St. John s and Chamblee. This 
caused the Frenchmen to curse our cowardice, and 
lament their folly in favoring a cause which we had 
so poorly defended ; but, upon my coming with a 
large force, ordering all the troops to follow, and the 
cannon to be returned, I found joy in every counte 
nance, except some very few Tories. It really was 
affecting to see the banks of the Sorcl lined with 
men, women, and children, leaping and clapping their 
hands for joy to see me arrive ; it gave no less joy 
to General Thompson, who seemed to be wholly for 
saken, and left to fight against an unequal force, or 
retreat before them. 

Upon my arrival I was surprised to hear that, 
notwithstanding all we have read about the Sorel, 
our people had not thrown up as much work as I 
could do with a hundred men in two days, and that 
extremely ill done. There were three cannon, and 
three only, mounted in all the w r orks. I set all the 
men at work, and have this day almost inclosed the 
encampment, and completed a battery on the north 
side of the river, with three cannon. General Thomp 
son says, and I believe with great truth, that more 
work was done here this day than has been done in 
Canada since the surrender of St. John s. 

June Qt/i, This morning two expresses arrived from 
Three Rivers, which were sent to observe the motions 
of the enemy ; one of them was a friendly Canadian, 
who lived at Three Rivers, and passed among the 
fleet, the other one of our officers. They agree that 
the number of vessels are as follows, namely, one ship, 
one brig, and eight sloops and schooners. They both 
say that the troops there amount to no more than 
three hundred, who are intrenching themselves at the 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 213 

Three Rivers. I have detached General Thompson, 
with about two thousand of your best troops, to at 
tack them. A copy of his orders is inclosed, which 
I hope will be approved by your Excellency. 

Our affairs here have taken a strange turn since 
our arrival. The Canadians are flocking by hundreds 
to take a part with us. I am giving them commis 
sions, agreeable to the inclosed form, which I hope 
will not be thought an unnecessary assumption of 
power. I really find most of them exceedingly friend 
ly. I have sent out for carts and teams, &c. They 
have come in with the greatest cheerfulness ; and, 
what gives still greater evidence of their friendship 
is, that they have voluntarily offered to supply us 
with what wheat, flour, &c., we want, and ask nothing 
in return but certificates. -They begin to complain 
against their priests, and wish them to be secured ; 
I shall, however, touch this string with great tender 
ness at present, as I know their sacerdotal influence. 

I really find, by the present behaviour of the Ca 
nadians, that the only reason of their disaffection was 
because our exertions were so feeble that they doubt 
ed much of our success, and even of our ability to 
protect them; but the face of our affairs seems to be 
changed; and, in the midst of our pleasing prospects, 
an express arrives from General Schuyler, with six 
teen hundred and sixty-two pounds one shilling and 
three pence, Pennsylvania currency, in specie, with the 
spirited resolves of Congress. This gives new life to 
our Canadian friends, and added spirit to our troops. 

I was extremely happy to find, that I had antici 
pated the wishes of Congress, and had, through every 
embarrassment, pressed downward toward the import 
ant posts they wished; for it was my fixed determi 
nation to gain post at Dechambeau, which I mean 



214 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

to fortify so as to make it inaccessible. This com 
mands the channel, secures the country, destroys the 
communication, and affords a safe retreat, if we are 
obliged to make one. General Thompson was em 
barking for that purpose, when the resolves arrived. 
The ships are now above that place ; but if General 
Thompson succeeds at Three Rivers, I will soon re 
move the ships below Richelieu Falls, and after that 
approach towards Quebec as fast as possible ; and, ac 
cording to the present appearance of affairs, may ex 
ceed in number the Hanoverians, &c., which we are 
threatened with. I have no doubt of the general at 
tachment of the Canadians, though I suppose some 
unprincipled wretches among them will always ap 
pear against us; but a vast majority will be for us, 
and perhaps as many, according to their numbers, 
are really in our favor as in some other Colonies 
upon the Continent. Many of them are with General 
Thompson in this expedition, and great numbers are 
here, ready equipped, waiting my orders. 

I may venture to assure you and the Congress 
that I can, in a few days, reduce the army to order 
and, with the assistance of a kind Providence, put a 
new face to our affairs here, which a few days since 
seemed almost impossible. General Thompson and 
the Baron de Woedtke have done every thing in 
their power to assist me. General Arnold has not 
joined me, being, as you may see by his letter, 
which I inclose to you, much engaged at Montreal, 
upon affairs of importance. The post at La Chine, 
which he mentions, I can by no means consent to 
afford such a large body of men to defend against a 
petty number of savages, little else than a mob. I 
have, therefore, ordered a small fortification to be 
thrown up by Colonel Dehaas s party, consisting of 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 215 

about nine hundred men ? and made inaccessible, at 
least to savages, and garrisoned it with two hundred 
men ; the rest to return to me, as all our operations 
ought to be down the river, where, if we are suc 
cessful, the insurrection there will die, of course. I 
have ordered a month s provision to be lodged there, 
lest an excuse of surrendering, for want of provision, 
before we can relieve it, should take place, as at the 
Cedars. I do not think it a post of great import 
ance, or, indeed, any in our rear, except St. John s 
and Chamblee, which will ever secure a retreat, and 
to these I will pay particular attention. 

I hope, dear General, to give you, in a few days, 
some agreeable intelligence ; while I remain, with the 
most profound respect, 

Your Excellency s obedient servant, 

JOHN SULLIVAN. 

P. S. I shall soon obtain proper returns of our 
scattered army, and will forward them, with return 
of stores, &c. ; after which you may expect them 
weekly. I have, for your diversion, inclosed to you 
one which is similar to what the other Colonels must 
make, if called upon. I inclose to your Excellency a 
letter from Colonel Duggan. I have appointed a 
Court of Inquiry into the accusation against him. I 
am informed, by General Thompson, Mr. Bromfield, 
and others, that the accusation is false, and that he 
is a very useful man. He has, at my request, since 
he wrote the above letter, raised and armed upwards 
of two hundred men for us. 

I have the honor to be your Excellency s most 
obedient servant, JOHN SULLIVAN. 

As I have not time to write the Congress, I beg 
your Excellency to forward to them a copy of this. 



216 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL SULLIVAN. 

Sorcl, 8 June, 177G. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

At three quarters after eleven o clock this fore 
noon, I received a letter from General Thompson, of 
which the inclosed is a copy. I find that he has 
proceeded in the manner proposed, and made his at 
tack on the troops at Three Rivers, at daylight ; for 
at that time a very heavy cannonading began, which 
lasted, with some intervals, to twelve o clock. It is 
now near one, P. M. ; the firing has ceased, except 
some irregular firing with cannon, at a considerable 
distance of time one from the other. At eight o clock, 
a very heavy firing of sinallarms was heard, even 
here, at the distance of forty-five miles. The distance 
might have rendered it doubtful, had not the boats 
down the bay, which have since arrived, confirmed it, 
and declared that they distinctly heard the smallarms 
for a long time. I am almost certain that victory 
has declared in our favor, as the irregular firing of 
the cannon for such a length of time after the small- 
arms ceased, shows that our men are in possession of 
the ground. 

I should immediately set off to join General 
Thompson, with Colonel Dehaas s detachment; but 
by some strange kind of conduct in General Arnold, 
directly contrary to repeated orders, lie lias kept that 
detachment dancing between this and Montreal ever 
since my arrival. Some of the officers, this moment 
arrived, inform me that he let them come within 
eighteen miles of this place, and ordered them back 
again. He has now permitted them to pass to Cham- 
blee, and I expect them here this evening, when I 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 217 

shall immediately set off with them to join General 
Thompson. I am now informed, by Mr. McCarty, that 
General Arnold has abandoned Montreal, and gone to 
Chamblee, with all the troops. I hope this report is 
not just, as the step must, in every light, be impru 
dent and injudicious ; it leaves that quarter entirely 
without a check, and gives our enemies liberty to 
assemble and form any mischievous designs they 
please, without interruption. 

I hear that the report at Montreal, yesterday, was, 
that the enemy had passed us at Sorel, and were 
passing up the river. This gave them the alarm, 
and caused them to abandon the city. I wish it 
may not prove true ; but, as it is so much of a piece 
with former conduct, I cannot help giving it some de 
gree of credit. Notwithstanding the weakness of this 
post, occasioned by the strange delay of Colonel De- 
haas, I have sent Colonel Winds, with his regiment, 
to reenforce General Thompson. This I did this 
morning, at eight o clock. They have joined him be 
fore now, I trust. I hope soon to follow, with more 
force, to maintain the ground which, I dare say, our 
troops have won. We hear no firing now, except a 
few cannon at a great distance of time between, 
sometimes half an hour s space at least. This, with 
many other circumstances, induces me to believe our 
troops are victorious. I am anxious to know the 
event, which God grant may be fortunate. However, 
if our party have been, or should be, defeated, I am 
determined not to leave Canada, but to make vigi 
lance and industry supply the want of numbers. I 
am determined to fortify and secure the most im 
portant posts, and hold them as long as one stone is 
left upon another. 

It is a serious truth that our army is extremely

weak. Colonel Greaton is with me, without a single 
man, all under inoculation- Colonel Bond, with all 
his regiment ; in the same situation ; Colonel Patter 
son has six only; Colonel Stark, about forty; Colonel 
Reed s and Colonel Poor s nearly in the same situa 
tion. Poor is at St. John s ; Reed at Chaniblee. Colo 
nel Burrell s return I sent in my last, and the other 
regiments are most of them in the same situation; 
for this Colony, it seems, has of late been considered 
the general hospital of America. The party with 
General Thompson, and that with Colonel Dehaas, 
contain the flower of our army at present. Some 
regiments are nearly out of the smallpox, and will 
be fit for duty in a few days. Our numbers will be 
daily increasing. I should rejoice, however, to see 
General Greene here, with his brigade, if he can be 
spared from JS T ew York. 

June 12, 1776. I could not close the foregoing 
letter, till I could get some certain intelligence of 
General Thompson and his party, most of which, 
after being unfortunately repulsed, are now returned ; 
but the General himself, with Colonel Irvine, Dr. 
McKenzie, Mr. Currie, Mr. Bird, Mr. Edy, and Parson 
Colley, are unluckily fallen into the hands of our 
enemies. A flag has arrived this night for their bag 
gage, by which he writes that he and the other gen 
tlemen are treated with the greatest politeness by 
General Burgoyne, who commands at Three Rivers. 
The officers suppose they had about twenty-five kill 
ed, and we find missing in the whole about a hun 
dred and fifty, some of which we expect in yet, as 
some have arrived this evening, and say more will 
be in. The General was taken, after the retreat, by 
some Canadian militia, summoned in by Caiieton. I 
have also a number, which I have summoned in to 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 219 

take part with us, under the Baron de Woedtke. 
Our people say that the Canadians were, in general, 
very kind to them, upon their retreat, and gave them 
every assistance in their power. 

The unfortunate defeat of General Thompson and 
his detachment happened in this manner; namely, 
the repeated accounts from Three Rivers of the small- 
ness of their numbers induced General Thompson to 
detach Colonel St. Clair to attack them with seven 
hundred men, "before my arrival. This not being put 
in execution, and St. Clair remaining at Nicolet, and 
the account of their weakness being confirmed, the 
General solicited the liberty of attacking them, which 
I granted, giving the orders which I inclosed in my 
last. He crossed from Nicolet to Three Rivers in 
the night, but being led into a morass by his guides, 
was obliged to return back near two miles; in which 
time the day broke, he was discovered, the ships be 
gan to cannonade, and continued while he marched 
through a swamp, which took near an hour and a 
half. The people came up to the attack, but, un 
luckily for them, twenty-five vessels had arrived that 
evening with troops, which they landed, while he 
marched on, and, being well prepared, gave them so 
warm a reception that the troops soon broke and 
quitted the ground. The cannonading and all the 
firing after that was a mere random firing, which an 
swered very little purpose. When they found our 
troops began to give way, they detached a party of 
six hundred by the side of the river, to attack them 
in flank, and secure our bateaux. The bateaux were 
preserved by Major Woods, who brought them off. 
One bateau only was taken, with four barrels of pow 
der, and nothing else on board; the men escaped. 

This, dear General, is a state of this unfortunate 



220 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

enterprise. What you will hear next, I cannot say. 
I am every moment informed of the vast number of 
the enemy which have arrived. Some, indeed, say 
that great numbers have arrived from England, and 
all the troops from Halifax. This I do not believe ; 
but I apprehend their numbers now are very great. 
I have here only two thousand five hundred and thir 
ty-three, rank and file. Most of the officers seem 
discouraged, and, of course, their men. I am employ 
ed, day and night, in fortifying and securing niy camp, 
and am. determined to hold it as long as a person 
will stick by me. I have heard nothing of Colonel 
Dayton s, or the residue of Colonel Wayne s regiment, 
or of the others ordered here. Sure I am that they 
are much wanted. There are some regiments all down 
with the smallpox; not a single man fit for duty. 
This will be remedied in time, unless the enemy make 
a sudden push, which, indeed, we expect every hour. 
If so, we must, with the numbers we have, sustain 
their efforts, and I hope repulse them. 

Dear General, I am, with much regard, your most 
devoted, humble servant, 

JOHN SULLIVAN. 

P. S. Our old friend Colonel Louis, of the Cagh- 
nawagas, has this moment arrived express from that 
tribe. He says all the Indians have made peace, 
even the Canasadagas, and those tribes which joined 
Captain Forster at the Cedars, except the Roundorks. 
These have refused in council, and say they will take 
arms for the King, and have sent to General Carle- 
ton to let him know it. This tribe consists of fifty 
warriors only. The Caghnawagas and other tribes de 
sire we should send up some other tribes, which they 
will join with, to extirpate them. This they would 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 221 

do themselves, but are apprehensive that some few 
French, through the influence of their priests, will 
join them. Indeed I can but illy spare the force; 
but it is a matter of too much importance to be neg 
lected. I must, therefore, send some force under the 
command of an experienced officer. 

I have the honor to be, your Excellency s most 
obedient servant, 

JOHN SULLIVAN. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 11 June, 1776. 

SIR, 

I am honored with your letters of the 7th, 8th, 
and 9th instant. The two first I have read in Con 
gress. We have been two days in a Committee of 
the Whole, deliberating on three capital matters, the 
most important in their nature of any that have yet 
been before us, and have sat till seven o clock in the 
evening, each day. That not being finished, I judge 
best to return the express. I shall press Congress as 
soon as possible to determine upon the several mat 
ters you wish to be ascertained, and immediately 
transmit you the result. 

The Congress have agreed to settle the mode of 
paying the troops in the Eastern Department this 
morning, and to proceed to the appointment of a 
Deputy Paymaster-General. 

The particular mode of establishing expresses is 
now under the consideration of a Committee, and as 
soon as agreed, you shall know the issue. 

Although Congress have not acted upon your que- 
19* 



222 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

ries respecting the Indians, yet I will venture to 
give my opinion that Congress intended the resolu 
tion of May 25th should be general, and extend to 
the several departments ; and that the resolution of 
the 3d of June goes only to the number which the 
General shall be empowered to employ in Canada. 
But I hope soon to give you a full answer to all 
your queries ; and in future I will exert myself in 
Congress, that your applications may be considered 
as soon as received, and keep you punctually and 
regularly informed of the result. 

Inclosed you have a resolve, whereby you will see 
that all the troops in the Middle Department are put 
upon the same pay, six and two thirds dollars, as the 
troops in the Eastern Department. 

I have sent you four bundles of commissions, and 
will forward you more by next opportunity. 

The inclosed, from Mrs. Washington, I wish safe 
to hand. I have the pleasure to acquaint you she is 
in fine spirits, and proposes paying you a visit next 
week. I sent her your letter by the express; and 
when you write, if you will please to put the letter 
under my cover, I will immediately deliver it. I 
have the honor to be, with every sentiment that re 
spect and esteem inspire, 

Sir, your very humble servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK, President. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 223 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Albany, 12 June, 1776; 4 o clock, P. $1. 

DEAR SIR, 

The letter, which I had the honor to write you 
y ester day, I delivered to General Wooster, who sailed 
this day. 

I have, within this half hour, received a letter from 
General Arnold, of which the inclosed is a copy. I 
fear the next will announce the evacuation of Ca 
nada by our troops, probably with loss, as I fear that 
not a sufficient attention has been paid to a recom 
mendation of mine, to bring all the bateaux, that 
could possibly be spared from Sorel, to St. John s. I 
shall immediately despatch an express to Fort George 
to send bateaux to St. John s ; but, after all, the 
number will be very small, for want of men to navi 
gate them. I suppose one hundred and twenty, at 
least, are at Lake George. 

I am not under the least apprehension that the 
enemy will be able to cross Lake Champlain, provid 
ed that our army is able to retreat into that Lake, 
that ammunition is speedily sent up, and a further 
supply of pork forwarded, without delay, to this 
place. 

Your Excellency will perceive that General Arnold 
informs me, that the enemy have the frames, &c., for 
gondolas on board. We should therefore build a 
number of these vessels, with all possible despatch; 
one is now on the stocks, but we want people that 
understand the construction of them. I have some 
time ago begged Congress to send one, express; let 
me entreat that some more capable persons may be 
sent up, and twenty shipwrights with them. 



224 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

As I fear the saw-mills will not be able to saw a 
sufficient number of plank, I wish to have a dozen 
of whipsaws and files sent up with all possible des 
patch. 

I shall order all the bateaux that do not go to 
St. John s out of Lake George, to Ticonderoga, that 
they may be ready, at that place, to be sent to 
Skenesborough, to convey the militia,, should they be 
sent up. I am, with every respectful sentiment, your 
Excellency s 

Most obedient, humble servant, 

PHILIP SCIIUYLER. 



FROM RICHARD HENRY LEE. 

Philadelphia, 13 June, 1776. 

DEAR SIR, 

I am informed that a certain Mr. Eustace, now in 
New York, but some time ago with Lord Dunmore, 
is acquainted with a practice that prevailed, of taking 
letters out of the post-office in Virginia, and carrying 
them to Dunmore for his perusal, and then returning 
them to the office again. As it is of the greatest 
consequence that this nefarious practice be stopped 
immediately, I shall be exceedingly obliged to you, 
Sir, for getting Mr. Eustace to give, in writing, all 
that he knows about this business, and inclose the 
same to me at Williamsburg. I wish to know, par 
ticularly, what post-offices the letters were taken 
from, by whom, and who carried them to Lord Dun- 
more. 

This day I set off for Virginia, where, if I can be 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 225 

of any service to yon, it will oblige to command me. 
It is more than probable that Congress will order our 
friend Gates to Canada. His great abilities and vir 
tue will be absolutely necessary to restore things 
there, and his recommendations will always be readily 
complied with. You will find that great powers are 
given to the commander in that distant department. 
The system for Canada, adopted since the arrival of 
the Commissioners here, will, I hope, be of essential 
service to our affairs. 

All good men pray most heartily for your health, 
happiness, and success, and none more than, dear Sir, 

Your affectionate friend and obedient servant, 

RICHARD HENRY LEE. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 18 June, 1776. 

SIR, 

You will see, from the inclosed resolves, which I do 
myself the pleasure of forwarding, in obedience to 
the commands of Congress, that they have bent their 
whole attention to our affairs in Canada, and have 
adopted such measures, as, in their opinion, are cal 
culated to place them on a better and more repu 
table footing for the future. 

The most unfortunate death of General Thomas 
having made a vacancy in that department, and the 
service requiring an officer of experience and distinc 
tion, the Congress have thought proper to appoint 
General Gates to succeed him. And I am to request 
you will send him into that Province, to take the 
command of the forces there, as soon as possible; and 



226 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

that you direct him to view Point-au-Fer, and to 
order a fortress to be erected there, if he shall think 
proper. 

My opinion on the resolve of the 25th May was 
well founded ; Congress having since determined, as 
you will find by a resolve herewith transmitted, that 
you are to employ the Indians wherever you think 
their services will contribute most to the public good. 

I shall write to the Colonies of New York, New 
Jersey, and Connecticut, to request them to author 
ize you to call on their militia, if necessary. My 
time will not permit me to do it now, as the post 
will set out directly, and the inclosed resolves were 
not passed till late yesterday evening. 

I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient 
and very humble servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK, President. 

P, S. A Mustermaster-General, in the room of Mr. 
Moylan, will be appointed this day or to-morrow, and 
a Deputy will afterwards be sent into Canada. 

I beg you will think of the Eastern Department, 
with respect to General Officers, when your very im 
portant concerns will admit. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL WARD. 

Boston, 20 June, 177G. 



SIR, 

I have to inform you that the Continental priva 
teers brought into this port, the 18th instant, another 
Scotch transport, with a Highland company of grena- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 227 

diers on board, consisting of upwards of an hundred, 
with their officers, with a few arms more than what 
belonged to the company. Each transport brings a 
considerable quantity of provisions for the troops. 
The prisoners are going into the country towns, 
agreeably to the order of Congress. 

The Colonel, mentioned in my last, is Lieutenant- 
Colonel Campbell, commander of one of General Fra- 
zer s battalions of Highlanders. He is a member of 
Parliament, and a gentleman of fortune. 

I must repeat my earnest request to be relieved 
immediately, as I have been so very ill for some time 
past as to be confined to my chamber, and have no 
prospect of recovering my health until I have a re 
laxation from business. I am, 

Your Excellency s obedient, humble servant, 

ARTEMAS WARD. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 21 June, 177G. 

SIR, 

The Congress, having the greatest reason to be 
lieve there has been very gross misconduct in the 
management of our affairs in Canada, have come to 
a resolution to have a general inquiry made into the 
behaviour of the officers employed on that expedition. 
The honor of the United Colonies, and a regard for 
the public good, call loudly for such an inquiry to 
be set on foot. I am, therefore, directed to request, 
after having made the inquiry agreeably to the in- 



228 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

closed resolve, you will transmit the result, together 
with the proofs, to Congress/ 1 

The opinion that an officer cannot be tried by a 
court-martial after his resignation, for offences while 
he held a commission, so dangerous to the service, 
and particularly destructive in our army, where the 
short enlistment of the troops might furnish tempta 
tion to crimes from the prospect of impunity, has 
been this day reprobated by Congress. 

I have written to the Convention of New York on 
the subject of the inclosed resolve respecting another 
regiment to be raised in that Colony. The terms on 
which the commissions are to be granted are ex 
tremely well calculated to excite the officers to exert 
themselves to fill up their companies. 

I have likewise written to the respective Colonies, 
and have sent copies of the inclosed resolve recom 
mending to them to provide clothes for the troops of 
their Colonies. These, or such articles of them as 
you shall want, the Congress have empowered you 
to draw for on the Assemblies and Conventions, from 
time to time, as you shall judge necessary. I have 



* In Congress, June 2lst. " Resolved, That General "Washington be 
directed to order an inquiry to be made into the conduct of the officers 
heretofore employed in the Canada Department; that the said inquiry 
be made at such times and places as, in his judgment, shall be most 
likely to do justice, as well to the public as to the individuals ; and that 
the result of the said inquiry, together with the testimonies upon the 
subject, be transmitted to Congress; that, moreover, all officers accused 
of cowardice, plundering, embezzlement of public moneys, and other 
misdemeanours, be immediately brought to trial. And whereas Congress 
is informed that an opinion has prevailed that officers resigning their 
commissions arc not subject to trial by court-martial for oii ences com 
mitted previous to such resignation, whereby some have evaded the 
punishments to which they were liable, it is hereby declared that such 
opinion is not just." 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 229 

represented to them that it is totally impossible that 
the American army should ever be on a respectable 
footing, or that they should render such essential ser 
vices to their country as we expect and desire, un 
less the United Colonies will, on their part, take care 
that they are well appointed and equipped with every 
thing necessary for an army. 

General "VVooster, it is the order of Congress, should 
be permitted to return to his family. 

I have delivered Mr. Visscher his commission as 
Lieutenant-Colonel in the regiment commanded by 
Colonel Nicholson, and directed him to wait on you, 
upon his arrival at New York. 

Apprehending that such of the resolves of Congress 
as respect the conduct of the army, are executed in 
consequence of orders issued by you, I have omitted 
sending to General Schuyler such as respect him,, 
concluding that the directions would go from you ; 
but if it will be any way a relief to you, I will con 
tinue to forward them. I have the honor to be, with 
much esteem, Sir, 

Your most obedient, humble servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK, President. 

22d. Your letter of the 20th this moment came to 
hand, and shall be laid before Congress on Monday. 



FROM JOSEPH HAWLEY. 

Watertown, 21 June, 1776. 

GENERAL WASHINGTON, 

The most important matters are soon to be decided 
by arms. Unhappy it is, for the Massachusetts, and 
VOL. i. 20 



230 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

I fear for the whole Continent, that, at this season, 
we have a large and numerous Assembly. More than 
one half of the House are new members. Their deci 
sions are most afflictingly slow, when every thing calls 
for the utmost ardor and despatch. The Lord have 
mercy on us ! This Colony, I imagine, will raise the 
men required by Congress before snow falls, but in 
no season for the relief of either New York or Ca 
nada. 

Pray, Sir, consider what there is to be done. It 
is my clear opinion that there will not be a single 
company move in this Colony, for either of those 
places, these three weeks. I know, Sir, it will vex 
you; but your Excellency will not be alone in the 
vexation. My soul, at times, is ready to die within 
me at the delays; at others, my blood to press out 
at the pores of my body. But what shall be the 
expedients ? I never was good at them, but will 
venture to propose again the same I mentioned in 
my last; namely, that some, or all, of the five Conti 
nental regiments here be ordered to march, without 
one moment s delay, to Canada or New York, as the 
exigencies require. In such case they must be paid 
up their arrears, or nearly. In that way you will, in 
effect, get succours for New York or Canada, or both, 
from this Colony. Our people are so jealous for their 
own safety (though you know, Sir, that I judge them 
at present in very little danger), that they will raise 
the militia for their own defence. 

I beg your Excellency to advert to the proposal a 
moment. Our own militia are as good, for all the 
intents answered, or to be answered here, by those 
regiments, as they are. They are much better for 
Canada or New York than the militia. They are 
officered and organized, and well armed; the militia 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 231 

to be officered, armed and equipped. The differences 
are too many to be enumerated. If I may say it, I 
am astonished at the policy of Congress in ordering 
more regiments here, instead of ordering those which 
are here to parts where they are infinitely more 
needed. But my opinion is of little worth ; but, such 
as it is, I have given it. It may serve as a sugges 
tion. 

I am, may it please your Excellency, most sin 
cerely yours, 

JOSEPH HAWLEY. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL SULLIVAN. 

Isle-aux-Noix, 24 June, 1776. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

It is with the greatest pain I inform you, that, 
after our retreat from Canada to this place, of which 
I have given your Excellency an account through 
General Schuyler, and after I had determined to 
make a stand here till I received your Excellency s 
order, I find myself under an absolute necessity of 
quitting this Island for a place more healthy- other 
wise the army will never be able to return, as one 
fortnight longer in this place will not leave us well 
men enough to carry off the sick, exclusive of the 
public stores, which I have preserved thus far. The 
raging of the smallpox deprives us of whole regi 
ments in the course of a few days, by their being 
taken down with that cruel disorder. But this is not 
all. The camp disorder rages to such a degree that, 
of the regiments remaining, from twenty to sixty in 
each are taken down in a day, and we have nothing 



LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

to give them, but salt pork., flour, and the poisonous 
waters of this Lake. I have, therefore, determined, 
with the unanimous voice of the officers, to remove 
to Isle-la-Motte, a place much more healthy than 
this, where I have some hope we shall preserve the 
health of the few men we have, till some order is 
taken respecting our future movements. 

I think it would be by far the best to remove to 
Crown Point, fortify that, build row-galleys to com 
mand the Lake, and by scouting parties to defend 
our frontiers, as the savages have already begun upon 
us. They have made two attacks upon our men, 
killed and taken near twenty, among whom are some 
officers. These officers went on shore unarmed, when 
I was gone to reconnoitre Point-au-Fer. The other 
party went on shore at river Lecot to buy milk. 
They were in boats loaded with flour, which they 
brought off, but had some men killed. The whole of 
our loss, in killed and taken, amounts to about twen 
ty. This happened in both cases for want of that 
care which should ever be taken in an enemy s coun 
try. I hope it will be a warning to our people in 
future. 

I hear, from all quarters, that the enemy arc very 
numerous in Canada. Their shipping is also nume 
rous, and it cannot be doubted that all the Canadians 
and all the Indians in this quarter will be compelled 
to bear arms against us. This I know they would 
gladly have aA r oided ; but, finding that we are not 
able to afford them that protection we promised, they 
are obliged to make their peace, in the best manner 
they can. I think it is now past a doubt, that the 
neglect and inattention to this department has not 
only lost us Canada, but involved us in a war with 
all the blacks and whites in this quarter; and to 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 233 

check their progress I know of no better method 
than to secure the important posts of Ticonderoga 
and Crown Point, and, by building a number of 
armed vessels, command the Lakes ; otherwise the 
forces now in Canada will be brought down upon us 
as quick as possible, having nothing now to oppose 
them in that Colony. 

They have a number of bateaux framed, which 
they brought from Three Rivers. They will doubt 
less construct some armed vessels, and then endeavour 
to penetrate the country toward New York. This, I 
am persuaded, they will attempt, but am sure they 
can never effect, unless we neglect to secure the im 
portant posts now in our power. I have written to 
General Schuyler, and wait with impatience for his an 
swer, as I know that no time ought to be lost in 
fortifying this place or Crown Point. If I attempt 
to fortify here, and afterwards am ordered to leave 
it, I shall strengthen the enemy, by preparing a 
work for them, which I would not willingly do. If 
I am to tarry and fortify here, I should be glad to 
know it as soon as possible, that I may put the or 
der in execution ; but I must say that, unless our 
men grow much more healthy, our army here will be 
no kind of check upon the enemy after remaining in 
this low marsh for a few weeks longer. 

I inclose your Excellency a general return, drawn 
from the returns made the day before yesterday; 
since which I suppose a quarter part have been taken 
down with the camp disorder. This, however incredi 
ble it may seem, is a real fact. For instance, Colo 
nel Wayne has sixty, out of one hundred and thirty- 
eight, taken down since. Colonel Dehaas and all 
his field-officers, with a number of his men, are since 
taken clown. This seems to run through the whole, 
20* 



234 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

no corps being exempt from it. I am shocked to re 
late, but much more to see, this dreadful havoc 
among the troops. 

I inclose your Excellency a return of the ordnance 
and stores at St. John s on the 12th instant. The 
whole could not, in our confused state, be procured. 
As to the provisions, some are on board the armed 
vessels, some at this place, and some at Isle-la-Motte, 
which were never brought further down. I can make 
no accurate return at present. I will have one made 
as soon as possible and forward it, and send regular 
returns in future. I do not despair of getting this 
army yet into some kind of order and regulation ; but 
T must confess that it is a work of time and trou 
ble, as order and regularity seem to have been 
strangers in this northern army. 

I received your Excellency s favor of the 13th in 
stant. I am extremely sorry it was not in my power 
to fulfil your Excellency s wishes, by leading on our 
troops to victory. The reasons for my not being able 
have doubtless long since reached you in my letters 
giving an account of the strength of the enemy, the 
weakness of our army, and the unhappy defeat of 
General Thompson at Three Rivers, as also the re 
sult of our Council of War in Canada, I think we 
shall secure all the public stores and baggage of the 
army, and secure our retreat, with very little loss. 
Whether we shall have W 7 ell men enough to carry 
them on, I much doubt, if we don t remove quickly, 
unless Heaven is pleased to restore health to this 
wretched army, now, perhaps, the most pitiful one 
that ever was formed. 

There is no return of Colonel Patterson s regiment, 
as he has but five men here fit for duty, whom I 
this day ordered to Crown Point to join the rest of

the regiment, who are all sick there. You may as 
sure yourself, niy dear General, that nothing shall be 
wanting, on my part, to restore order among the 
troops here and to recover their health, as also to 
throw every stumblingblock in the way of the ene 
my, that lies in the power of your Excellency s 
Most affectionate, humble servant, 

JOHN SULLIVAN. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 25 June, 1776. 

SIR, 

Your letter of the 21st instant, by Mr. Bennett, 
with the inclosure, was duly received and laid before 
Congress, as you will perceive by the inclosed re 
solves, to which I beg leave to request your atten 
tion. 

Although the Commissioners have undoubtedly mis 
taken the intention of Congress, yet the terms in 
which the resolve is conceived, namely, " That the 
General be empowered to employ in Canada a num 
ber of Indians, not exceeding two thousand," may, at 
first view, seem to confine their employment to the 
limits of that Province, and to give a latitude of con 
struction as to the place in which they are to be 
raised; and in this sense they must have been under 
stood by General Schuyler and the other Commis 
sioners. I am, how r ever, to request you will give 
orders to have a stop put to raising the Mohegan 
and Stockbridge Indians, as soon as possible. I shall 
write Governor Trumbull to the same purpose. 



236 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

The conduct of the Quartermaster-General, in de 
taining the tents sent from this place to Massachu 
setts Bay, is a stretch of office which, though it may 
he well meant, is certainly a very extraordinary one. 
You will, therefore, be pleased to order them to he 
delivered up, and forwarded to the Massachusetts Bay 
as soon as possible. 

The other resolves, herewith transmitted, calculated 
to suppress insurrections and to promote good order 
and obedience to laws in the United Colonies, are so 
full and explicit that I need not enlarge. It is suffi 
cient to observe, that internal convulsions do always 
extremely weaken the force and springs of Govern 
ment, and must necessarily render its operations 
against foreign enemies less vigorous and decisive.* 

o O 

Application having been made to Congress with re 
gard to victualling the Flying Camp, I am directed 
to request you will inform them what is the cost of 
a ration, as furnished by the Commissary-General. 

The several matters in your letters are before a

FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL ARNOLD. 

Albany, 25 June, 1776. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

By this express you will receive advice from Gen 
eral Schuyler of our evacuating Canada, an event 
which I make no doubt (from our distressed situa 
tion) you have some time expected. The particu 
lars of General Thompson s repulse and captivity, as 
nearly as could be ascertained, have been transmitted 
you. On advice of which, [with] very direct intelli 
gence that the enemy were greatly superior to us in 
numbers, I advised General Sullivan to secure his 
retreat by retiring to St. John s. He was determined 
to keep his post at Sorel, if possible, and did not 
retire until the 14th instant, at which time the enemy 
were as high up with their ships as the Sorel. 

On the 15th, at night, when the enemy w r ere at 
twelve miles distance from me, I quitted Montreal 
with my little garrison of three hundred men. The 
whole army, with their baggage and cannon (except 
three heavy pieces left at Chamblce), arrived at St. 
John s the 17th, and at the Isle-aux-Noix the 18th; 
previous to which it was determined, by a Council of 
War at St. John s, that in our distressed situation, 



238 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

(one half of the army sick, and almost the whole des 
titute of clothing and every necessary of life, except 
salt pork and flour), it was not only imprudent, but 
impracticable, to keep possession of St. John s. 

Crown Point was judged the only place of health 
and safety, to which the army could retire and op 
pose the enemy. It was found necessary to remain 
at the Isle-aux-Noix for some few days, until the sick, 
heavy cannon, &c., could be removed. General Sulli 
van did not choose to leave the Isle-aux-Noix until he 
received positive orders for that purpose, and thought 
it necessary for me to repair to this place, and wait 
on General Schuyler. I arrived here last night, and 
am happy to find him of our sentiments in quitting 
the Isle-aux-Noix, which, from its low situation, is ren 
dered very unhealthy, and from the narrow channel 
leading to it from the north part of Lake Champlain, 
of six miles in length and from three to eight hun 
dred yards in breadth, is rendered very insecure, as 
the enemy, by light pieces of cannon and smallarms, 
might render all access to it dangerous, if not im 
practicable. 

It now appears to me of the utmost importance, 
that the Lakes be immediately secured by a large 
number of (at least twenty or thirty) gondolas, row- 
galleys, and floating batteries. The enemy, from un 
doubted intelligence, have brought over a large num 
ber (it is said one hundred) frames for flat-bottomed 
boats, designed to be made use of on Lake Cham- 
plain ; and, from their industry and strength, will 
doubtless become masters of the Lake, unless every 
nerve on our part is strained to exceed them in a 
naval armament. I think it absolutely necessary, that 
at least three hundred carpenters be immediately 
employed. Fifty sent from Philadelphia, who are ac- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 239 

quainted with building that kind of craft, would 
greatly facilitate the matter. 

A particular return of the army could not be ob 
tained, in our hurry and confusion. It will be trans 
mitted to you in a few days. I believe the whole 
about seven thousand, and at least one half of them 
sick and unfit for duty, but daily recovering. Up 
wards of one thousand more are yet to have the 
smallpox. The enemy, from the best intelligence that 
can be obtained, are near ten thousand, exclusive of 
Canadians and savages. Few of the latter have joined 
them as yet. 

I make no doubt it will be thought necessary to 
repair Crown Point, or build a new fort near that 
place. The former, from the advantage of its situa 
tion, and the fine barracks nearly completed, will, I 
believe, be thought most proper. I make no doubt 
but General Gates, who I am happy to hear is on 
his way here, will pay immediate attention to it. 

I flatter myself our arms, under your immediate 
direction, will meet with more success than they have 
done in this quarter. I make not the least doubt 
our struggles will be crowned with success. I am, 
with every friendly wish, most respectfully, dear Gen 
eral, your affectionate and 

Obedient, humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Albany, 25 June, 1776; 1 o clock, A. M. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

About an hour ago General Arnold, who is arrived 
here from Canada, sent me a letter from General 



240 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

Sullivan, inclosing one from General Arnold to him, 
another from Colonel Ilazen, and a third from Lieu 
tenant-Colonel Antill, copies of all which I do myself 
the honor to inclose. The grief I feel on the evacu 
ation of Canada by our troops, is greatly alleviated 
hy the little loss sustained in the retreat, and the 
hope I have, that we shall maintain a superiority on 
the Lakes. 

Your Excellency will observe that General Sullivan 
intimates that further than the Isle-aux-Noix he could 
not retreat, without your Excellency s or my orders, 
previous to which he observes, that the Council of 
War were unanimous for coming to Crown Point. I 
do not hesitate to say, that I wish he had retreated. 
at least as far south as Point-au-Fer, or Isle-la- 
Motte, as I am afraid that the enemy will throw 
themselves between him and the broad part of Lake 
Champlain, and render it extremely difficult, if not 
impossible, to send on a supply of provisions, as 
they can with light cannon and even wall-pieces com 
mand the waters from shore to shore in most places, 
for six miles south of Isle-aux-Noix, and in many even 
with musketry. 

Did not the danger of remaining there, especially 
with an army broken and spiritless, and who wish so 
much to come further south, that the officers, as Ge 
neral Arnold informs me, have already, in a body, 
entreated him to come away, appear to me too great 
to admit of the delay of waiting your Excellency s 
orders, I should not send mine for a further retreat, 
until your pleasure could be known ; but I trust I 
shall be justified in doing it, and yet I believe the 
order will meet the army on this side of Islc-aux-Noix. 

Be pleased to order up six anchors and cables for 
the gondolas that are constructing, of the size of 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 241 

what is called the small anchor and cable of an Al 
bany sloop. 

I shall immediately write to Governor Trunibull to 
provide fifty ship-carpenters, if he can, and send for 
a like number to the Massachusetts Bay. 

If any Dutch mill-saws can be procured at New 
York, be pleased to order up four dozen, with six 
dozen of files for them. 

Having learned that General Gates is upon his way 
up, I have ordered a boat down to meet him. I am, 
dear General, with every sentiment of esteem and 
respect, your Excellency s 

Most obedient, humble servant, 

PHILIP SCHUYLER. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL SULLIVAN. 

25 June, 1776. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

This morning at daybreak, I received your Excel 
lency s favor of the 16th instant; am extremely mor 
tified to find that every thing here has turned out 
contrary to my expectations, and your Excellency s 
wishes. This was not owing to my being deceived 
with respect to the enemy on the ground at the 
time I wrote, but to the sudden arrival of such a 
number under General Burgoyne, the night before 
the battle of Three Rivers, of which I have given 
a full and perfect account in former letters. I 
am conscious of having done every thing in my 
power to gain the ground our troops had lost, and 
to secure the retreat of the army, when I found our 
VOL. i. 21 



242 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

point could not be . carried. I imagine that General 
Schuyler forgot to inclose the return, as I think -it 
went from me at the time; "but I am not clear whe 
ther it did not go in a separate letter. I dare say 
it has reached you before this. I now inclose an 
other which I wish safe to hand, and hope to have 
a more complete and , perfect one in a few days, 
which I shall forward to your. Excellency. 

I am well convinced of the necessity of a good 
understanding being kept up among the officers of 
the army. This has been remarkably the case since 
my arrival. I have not seen an instance to the con 
trary, except some few reflections . which seemed to 
take place between the northern and southern troops, 
which I hope I have sufficiently cured by calling 
upon the officers of every corps, and requesting them 
to suppress a thing, which, if continued, must weaken, 
if not destroy, the army. They all agreed to join 
heartily in putting an end to this dangerous beha 
viour among the troops, which I am convinced they 
did, as I have heard nothing of it since, and find 
that harmony takes place among the troops in a sur 
prising manner. In all our difficulties there seemed 
a unanimity of sentiment among all the officers. 
Indeed, I have not known the least dispute among 
them. The unfortunate General Thompson, the Baron 
de Woedtke, and myself were at Sorel. Never did 
greater harmony and friendship exist. General Ar 
nold was at Montreal, and kept up the most friendly 
intercourse and correspondence with us, and we with 
him. It is true, I thought the keeping Colonel De- 
haas from Sorel was wrong, but only supposed it an 
error in judgment, as I did that of his keeping the 
forces in too great numbers at the posts up the coun 
try. This I communicated to him in the most 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 243 

friendly manner, which he accounted for in a way 
that convinced- me that he acted not without some 
foundation ; though I think it would have been better 
had it not been done. Assure yourself, my dear 
General, that I will exert myself in cultivating har 
mony and friendship among both officers and soldiers 
in the army, and that I am, with the most profound 
respect, your Excellency s 

Most devoted, humble servant, 

JOHN SULLIVAN. 

P. S. The Brigade-Major and Adjutant of the day 
have this moment informed me, that, while they 
were parading the main guard, four men dropped 
down under arms, and appear like dead men. I arn 
almost distracted with the thought of losing so many 
men as daily go off by sickness. I shall, to-day, re 
move from this infectious place to Isle-la-Motte, 
which I should have done before now, had not too 
many of our bateaux gone forward with the sick to 
Crown Point. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LEE. 

Charleston, 1 July, 1776. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

I have the happiness to congratulate you on a 
very signal success (if I may not call it a victory), 
which we have gained over the mercenary instru 
ments of the British tyrant. I shall not trouble you 
with a detail of their manoeuvres or delays, but de 
fer it to another time, when I have more leisure to 
write, and you to attend. Let it suffice, that having 



244 LETTERS TO WASHINGTQN. 

lost an opportunity (such as I hope will never again 
present itself) of taking the town, which, on my ar 
rival, was utterly defenceless, the Commodore thought 
proper, on Friday last, with, his whole squadron, con 
sisting of two fifties, six frigates, and a bomb (the 
rates of which you will see in the inclosed list), to 
attack our fort on Sullivan s Island. 

They dropped their anchors about eleven in the 
forenoon, at the distance of three or four yards be 
fore the front battery. I was myself, at this time, 
in a boat, endeavouring to make the Island; but the 
wind and tide being violently against us, drove us 
on the main. They immediately commenced the most 
furious fire I ever heard or saw. I confess I was in 
pain, from the little confidence I reposed in our 
troops ; the officers being all boys, and the men raw 
recruits. What augmented my anxiety was, that we 
had no bridge finished for retreat, or communication ; 
and the creek, or cove, which separates it from the 
continent, is near a mile wide. I had received, like 
wise, intelligence that their land troops intended at 
the same time to land and assault, I never in my 
life felt myself so uneasy; and what added to my 
uneasiness was, that I knew our stock of ammunition 
was miserably low. I had once thoughts of ordering 
the commanding officer to spike his guns, and, when 
his ammunition was spent, to retreat with as little loss 
as possible. However, I thought proper previously to 
send to town for a fresh supply, if it could possibly 
})e procured, and ordered my Aid-de-camp, Mr. Byrd, 
(who is a lad of magnanimous courage) to pass over 
in a small canoe, and report the state of the spirit 
of the garrison. If it had been low, I should have 
abandoned all thoughts of defence. His report was 
flattering. I then determined to maintain the post 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 245 

at all risks, and passed the creek or cove, in a small 
boat, in order to animate the garrison in proprid per 
sona ; but I found they had no occasion for such en 
couragement. 

They were pleased with my visit, and assured me 
they never would abandon the post but with their 
lives. The cool courage they displayed astonished 
and enraptured me, for I do assure you, my dear 
General, I never experienced a hotter fire. Twelve 
full hours it was continued without intermission. The 
noble fellows, who were mortally wounded, conjured 
their brethren never to abandon the standard of li 
berty. Those who lost their limbs deserted not their 
posts. Upon the whole, they acted like Romans in 
the third century. However, our works were so 
good and solid, that we lost but few; only ten killed 
on the spot, and twenty-two wounded, seven of whom 
lost their legs or arms. The loss of the enemy, as 
you will perceive by the inclosed list, was very 
great. As I send a detail to the Congress, I shall 
not trouble you with a duplicate ; but, before I fin 
ish, you must suffer me to recommend to your es 
teem, friendship, and patronage my (though young) 
Aids-de-camp, Byrd and Morris, whose good sense, 
integrity, activity, and valor, promise to their country 
a most fruitful crop of essential services. Mr. Jenifer, 
of Maryland, a gentleman of fortune, and not of the 
age when the blood of men flows heroically, has 
shown not less spirit than these youngsters. I may 
venture to recommend in these high terms, because 
the trial was severe. 

Colonel Moultrie, who commanded the garrison, de 
serves the highest honors. The manifest intention 
of the enemy was to land, at the same time the 
ships began to fire, their whole regulars on the east 

21* 



246 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

end of the Island. Twice they attempted it, and twice 
were repulsed by a Colonel Thompson, of the South 
Carolina Rangers, in conjunction with a body of 
North Carolina regulars. Upon the whole, the South 
and North Carolina troops and Virginia Rifle batta 
lion we have here, are admirable soldiers. The enemy 
is now returned to their old station on this side the 
bar. What their intention is, I cannot divine. One 
of the five deserters, who came over to us this day, 
is the most intelligent fellow I ever met with. The 
accounts of their particular loss and situation are his, 
and I think they may be depended upon. 

For God s sake, my dear General, urge the Con 
gress to furnish me with a thousand cavalry. With 
a thousand cavalry I could insure the safety of these 
Southern Provinces ; and without cavalry, I can an 
swer for nothing. I proposed a scheme in Virginia 
for raising a body almost without any expense. The 
scheme was relished by the gentlemen of Virginia, but 
I am told the project was censured by some members 
of the Congress, on the principle that a military ser 
vant should not take the liberty to propose any 
thing. This opinion I sincerely subscribe to, when 
our distance from the sovereign is so small, and the 
danger so remote, as to admit of proposing, deliberat 
ing, resolving, and approving ; but when a General is 
at a vast distance, and the enemy close to him, I 
humbly conceive that it is his duty to propose and 
adopt any thing, without other authority than the 
public safety. From want of this species of troops, 
we had infallibly lost this Capital, but the dilatori- 
ness and stupidity of the enemy saved us. 

I this instant learn that the Commodore is fixing 
buoys on the bar, which indicates an intention of 
quitting the place. It is probable that they will bend 
their course to Hampton, or Chesapeake Bay. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 247 

I am extremely happy, dear General, that you are 
at Philadelphia, for their counsels sometimes lack a 
little military electricity. 

I have ordered the Adjutant-General to send you 
a return; I mean only a return of the strength of 
this place. I suppose it will be imperfect, for it is 
an Herculean labor, to a South Carolina officer, to 
make any detail. God bless you, my dear General, 
and crown you with success, as I am, 

Most entirely and affectionately, yours, 

CHARLES LEE. 

P. S. I am made quite happy by the resolution 
of Congress to keep Canada. Had it been relin 
quished, all would have been lost. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Albany, 1 July, 1776. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

On Friday evening I received a line from General 
Sullivan, a copy whereof I have the honor to inclose. 
By the contents your Excellency will perceive, that 
we have reasons to believe his next will announce 
his arrival at Crow r n Point. 

Yesterday morning General Gates introduced a Mr. 
Avery to me, who applied to me for money to carry 
on the Commissary-General s department here. I ask 
ed if Mr. Livingston was superseded, and begged to 
see how he (Avery) was authorized to act here. He 
showed me a commission from Mr. Trumbull, the 
Commissary-General, with instructions annexed, ap 
pointing him Deputy-Commissary in Canada, and the 



248 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

instructions were correspondent to such appointment. 
I told him his commission did not, by any means, 
supersede Mr. Livingston s, and until that was done, 
I must consider Mr. Livingston as the Deputy-Com 
missary-General here, and that all warrants for mo 
ney to carry on that department here must he drawn 
in his favor, unless Mr. Trumhull himself was pre 
sent. 

He assured me that it was Mr. Trumbull s inten 
tion that he (Avery) should have the sole manage 
ment, and that Mr. Livingston was only to be con 
sidered as a contractor. I sent for Mr. Livingston, 
who produced a letter of the 25th instant from Mr. 
Trumbull, directly contradictory to what Mr. Avery 
had asserted ; upon which he declared that Mr. Trum 
bull had informed him, that Congress had given him full 
power to make any arrangement he thought proper, 
and displace whom he pleased, and that it was his 
intention, by giving him (Avery) that commission, to 
supersede Mr. Livingston. To which Mr. Livingston 
answered, that, although Mr. Trumbull had 110 power 
to remove him unless authorized so to do by Con 
gress, as he held his commission immediately from 
that body, yet, if Mr. Trumbull had expressed any 
such intention, he would immediately resign, and he 
would put the question to Mr. Trumbull. I observed 
to Mr. Avery that nothing in his commission, or the 
instructions annexed, authorized him to say what 
he did; that Mr. Trumbull s letter to Mr. Livingston 
flatly contradicted it; that if he remained with the 
army, provided it was not in Canada, he must be 
subordinate to Mr. Livingston, and obey his orders, 
which he chose not to do, and is now going down. 

I advised him to remain until the affair was deter 
mined, and candidly told him that I should try to 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 249 

keep Mr. Livingston in the employment if he chose 
it, because, admitting that their abilities and integrity 
were perfectly equal, Mr . Livingston s conduct had 
met my approbation, and that his great family con 
nections in this county had enabled him to carry on 
the service, when others could not have done it, of 
which I gave instances. General Gates was present, 
and acquiesced in the propriety of what I observed. 
I was, therefore, greatly surprised to be informed, 
that he should tell Mr. Avery that he had nothing 
to say here, but that as soon as he came to the ar 
my he would employ him. I say I was greatly sur 
prised, because General Gates knew that the army 
was no longer in Canada, and because I did not 
know that he then claimed a right to control my 
orders with respect to the army, even if it should be 
at Crown Point ; nor could I imagine he thought so, 
as your Excellency s instructions to him gave, as I 
conceive, not the least color for it. Your last letter 
to me holds up a contrary idea, and so does every 
resolution of Congress hitherto transmitted to me ; 
but that General Gates conceived, and still does, that 
the army is immediately under his command, I had, 
a very few hours after, the most convincing proof of, 
as your Excellency will observe from the inclosed 
paper, which I hastily drew up immediately after the 
discourse, and which I desired General Gates to read, 
that no misunderstanding might arise for want of re 
collecting what had been said, and which he acknow 
ledges contains the substance of what passed be 
tween us. 

By your Excellency s instructions to General Gates, 
he is empowered to appoint a Quartermaster-General 
in Canada. I observed, this morning, that I believed 
it was founded on a supposition that Colonel Camp- 



250 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

bell was then about quitting Canada, for that I could 
not imagine that an officer being "ordered to Con 
gress to settle his accounts" deprived him of his em 
ployments ; that Colonel Campbell was originally ap 
pointed to this department/ and that Canada now 
being made a separate one, and the command of it 
given to General Gates, he could., under the powers 
he had, appoint whom he pleased to act there; but 
that, . unfortunately for us, the evacuation of that 
country by our troops had taken place, and that I 
must and should consider Colonel Campbell as the 
Deputy Quartermaster-General on this side of Ca 
nada. 

If Congress intended that General Gates should 
command the Northern army, wherever it may be, 
as he assures me they did, it ought to have been 
signified to me, and I should then have immediately 
resigned the command to him ; but until such inten 
tion is properly conveyed to me, I never can. I 
must, therefore, entreat your Excellency to lay this 
letter before Congress, that they may clearly and ex 
plicitly signify their intentions, to avert the dangers 
and evils that may arise from a disputed command; 
for, after what General Gates has said, the line must 
be clearly drawn, as I shall, until then, stand upon 
punctilios with General Gates, that I would otherwise 
with pleasure waive ; but that the service may not 
be retarded, nor suffer the least from a difference of 
opinion between General Gates and me, I have deter 
mined to remain here, although I had, before this 
affair came to light, mentioned to him my intentions 
of going up with him. 

As both General Gates and myself mean to be 
candid, and wish to have the matter settled without 
any of that chicane which would disgrace us as offi- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 251 

ccrs and men, we have agreed to speak plain, and 
to show each other what we have written to you 
upon the occasion ; and he has accordingly read the 
whole of what I have above said. . 

Since writing the above, General Gates has shown 
me the resolutions of Congress of the 17th ultimo, 
which confirm me in the opinion I have entertained, 
that he was only to command the army in Canada, 
and that I had no control upon him when there.* 

Your Excellency may be assured of my best exer 
tions to prevent the enemy from penetrating into 
these Colonies. General Gates is in sentiment with 
me on the mode ; that of increasing our naval 
strength, and fortifying some advantageous spot on 
the east side of Lake Champlain, either opposite to 
Ticonderoga, or between that and Crown Point. 

Part of the militia from this Colony is marched 
up ; none of the others are yet moved. Their tardi 
ness will greatly distress us, as we have much, very 
much, to do, and few men to do it with. 

The cannon sent by Colonel Knox arrived yester 
day; and, although the Indians have deferred the 
treaty to the middle of this month, yet I have 



* In Congress, June lltli. "Resolved, That an experienced General

for their approbation ; and he also have power to suspend any oilicer

252 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

thought it advisable to take post at Fort Stanwix ; 
and all the stores are moving from here to-day, and 
will, I hope, leave Schenectady on Wednesday morn 
ing. The Commissioners of Indian Affairs have pre 
pared a message to the Six Nations, giving the rea 
sons why we take post at Fort Stanwix. This will, 
however, not be sent until every thing is so far ad 
vanced that there may be no danger in coimnimbat- 
ing to them my intentions. 

Should the enemy advance, and we bo under the 
necessity of calling forth the militia nearest to us, 
we shall be at a loss for ball and buckshot. I wish, 
therefore, to have twenty-five rounds a-piece for ten 
thousand men sent up the soonest possible, if it can 
anywhere be procured, with a proportionate quantity 
of cartridge-paper, and two tons of oakum. 

If any cutlasses, stinkpots, and handgrenades can 
be got, I beg they may also be sent for the use of 
our armed vessels. 

One hundred thousand of the dollars brought up 
by General Gates are ordered to the army; better 
than half of the other are already expended, nor 
will any be left in two or three days. 

Mr. Duane informed me, and gave me leave to 
make use of his name, that the five hundred thou 
sand voted by Congress the 22d of May for this de 
partment, were actually charged, and he fears that 
they may have met with some accident on the way up. 

I have ordered the silver to be kept in chests, ex 
cept about three thousand pounds, which we borrowed 
here, and must now be repaid. 

Four o clock, P. M. I am this moment favored 
with your Excellency s letter of the 27th ultimo, in 
closing a copy of a resolution of Congress of the 
24th. I have immediately an opportunity of forward- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 253 

ing copies thereof to Governor Trumbull and Mr. Ed 
wards. The latter has already received one month s 
advance wages for the Stockbridge company, which, 
I suppose, is by this time paid to them, as he in 
formed me that they were to be here on Wednesday 
or Thursday next. I am afraid it will give great 
umbrage, if they are immediately discharged; but, as 
the order is positive, I dare not presume to defer 
complying with it. I shall, however, request Mr. Ed 
wards to do it in a manner that will give the least 
offence. 

I wish Colonel Francis and Colonel Wolcott were 
immediately ordered up to attend the conference at 
the German Flats on the 15th instant, as I propose 
going to Crown Point to-morrow, having, upon further 
consultation with General Gates and General Arnold 
since writing the foregoing, determined upon it; and 
this journey may detain me so long as to prevent 
my attendance, in which case there will be only two 
Commissioners present. 

I am, dear General, most respectfully, your obe 
dient, humble servant, 

PHILIP SCHUYLER.* 



FROM GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 

Lebanon, 4 July, 1776. 



SIR, 

The retreat of the Northern army, and its present 
situation, have spread a general alarm. By intelli-

254 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

gence from Major-General Schuyler, received last- 
evening, I have reason to conclude that they are 
now at Crown Point and Ticonderoga, in a weak 
state, and under the necessity of an immediate re- 
enforcement, to enable them to make a stand, and 
prevent the enemy from passing the Lake and pene 
trating into the country. The prevalence of the 
smallpox among them is every way unhappy. Our 
people, in general, have not had that distemper. Fear 
of the infection operates strongly to prevent soldiers 
from engaging in the service, and the battalions or 
dered to be raised in this Colony fill up slowly; and 
though no measures be taken to remove the impedi 
ment, may not the army be soon freed from that in 
fection ? Can the reinforcements be kept separate 
from the infected ? Or may not a detachment be 
made from the troops under your command and the 
militia raising in the several Colonies and ordered to 
New York, of such men as have had the smallpox, 
to be replaced by the troops raising for the Northern 
Department? Could any expedient be fallen upon, 
that would afford probable hopes that this infection 
may be avoided, I believe our battalions would soon 
join the Northern army. I shall omit nothing in my 
power to expedite them. 

The retreat of the army from Canada exposes the 
Northern frontiers of New York and New Hampshire 
to the ravages of the Indians, who will doubtless be 
spirited up to fall upon them. Some of the settle 
ments on Onion River, I am informed, are breaking 
up and removing, and the whole filled with the 
most disquieting apprehensions. Some powder and 
lead, upon application, have been supplied them from 
this Colony ; but the settlers there, from their infant 
state, and consequent poverty, are unable to devote 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 255 

themselves to the defence of the frontiers, unless 
they should be enabled to hire laborers to carry on 
the business of their farms in their absence. I 
could therefore wish, that your Excellency might 
think proper to recommend it to the Continental 
Congress, to order a battalion to be raised and sta 
tioned there, for the defence of those settlements. It 
would, I trust, be immediately filled up with a hardy 
race of men in that quarter, well adapted to repel 
the attacks of the savages, and ready to join and 
support the Northern army, upon occasion, and at 
all times may scour the woods, and furnish intelli 
gence of the enemy s motions. 

If those settlers are driven back, besides the loss 
of their property, a much heavier expense will fall 
upon some of the Colonies for the support of their 
families, than the charges arising from the raising 
and maintaining a battalion of Continental troops ; and 
we shall still have a frontier to defend. 

The anxiety of the friends and relations of many, 
if not most, of those settlers who emigrated from this 
Colony, and the importance of the matter, will, I 
trust, be my sufficient apology for wishing to engage 
your influence with Congress, to support the motion 
I judge advisable and shall make, to have a battalion 
raised out of, and stationed on, those frontiers. 

By a letter from General Schuyler, of the 1st in 
stant, received last evening, I am advised that Gene 
rals Schuyler, Gates, and Arnold, were to set out on 
Tuesday morning. I trust they are by this time at 
the end of their journey, and hope their presence 
may have a happy effect towards retrieving affairs in 
that quarter. I am, with great truth and regard, Sir, 
Your most obedient, humble servant, 

JONATHAN TRUMBULL. 



256 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 6 July, 177G. 



The Congress, for some time past, have had their 
attention occupied by one of the most interesting and 
important subjects, that could possibly come before 
them or any other assembly of men. 

Although it is not possible to foresee the conse 
quences of human actions, yet it is, nevertheless, a 
duty we owe ourselves and posterity, in all our pub 
lic councils, to decide in the best manner w r e are 
able, and to leave the event to that Being who con 
trols both causes and events, to bring about his own 
determinations. 

Impressed with this sentiment, and at the same time 
fully convinced that our affairs may take a more fa 
vorable turn, the Congress have judged it necessary 
to dissolve the connection between Great Britain and 
the American Colonies, and to declare them free and 
independent States, as you will perceive by the in 
closed DECLARATION, which I am directed by Congress 
to transmit to you, and to request you will have it 
proclaimed at the head of the army in the way you 
shall think most proper.* 

Agreeably to the request of Congress, the Commit 
tee of Safety of this Colony have forwarded to you 
ten thousand flints, and the Hints at Khode Island 
are ordered to be sent to you immediately. 



* In Congress, July 4th. " Resolved, That copies of the Declaration be 
sent to the several Assemblies, Conventions, and Committees or Councils 
of Safety, and to the several commanding officers of the Continental 
troops, that it be proclaimed in each of the United States, and at the 
head of the armv." 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 257 

It is with great pleasure I inform you, that the 
militia of this Colony, of Delaware Government, and 
Maryland, are, and will be every day in motion, to 
form the Flying Camp, and that all the militia of 
this Colony will soon be in the Jerseys, ready to re 
ceive such orders as you shall please to give them. 

I have written to Governor Cooke, to engage im 
mediately, and send forward as fast as possible, fifty 
ship-carpenters to General Schuyler, for the purpose 
of building vessels on the Lakes. Fifty have already 
gone from hence on that business. 

The Congress having directed the arms, taken on 
board the Scotch transports, to be sent to you. I have 
written to the agents in Rhode Island and Massachu 
setts Bay, to forward them immediately. 

The inclosed copy of a letter from Mr. Green, I 
am directed to forward, by Congress, with a request 
that you will order such parts of the stores, therein 
mentioned, to New York, as you shall judge proper. 

I have the honor to be, Sir, with perfect esteem, 
your most obedient and very humble servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK, President 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 13 July, 1776. 

SIR, 

I am to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of 
the 10th instant, and to acquaint you that it is now 
under the consideration of Congress. 

The inclosed resolves I do myself the honor to 
transmit, as necessary for your information. I have 
22* 



258 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

written to General Schuyler, and the Commissioners 
for Indian Affairs, respecting the same. 

In obedience to the commands of Congress, I have 
inclosed von two copies of sundry resolves they have 
passed relative to the treatment of our prisoners by 
Captain Forster, in Canada. I am to request you 
will take the proper steps to send one of them to 
General Howe, and the other to General Burgoyne. 
I transmit, also, a third copy for your own use.* 

Should the United States of America give their 
sanction to the Jesuitical and villanous distinction 



* A Committee had reported the facts relating to the transactions at 
the Cedars, in Canada, and, after taking the report into consideration, 
the Congress adopted the following resolutions ; 

"Resolved, That all acts contrary to good faith, the laws of nature, 
or the customs of civilized nations, done by the ofliccrs or soldiers of 
his Britannic Majesty, or by foreigners or savages taken into his service, 
are to be considered as done by his orders, unless indemnification be 
made, in cases which admit indemnification, and in all other cases, un 
less immediate and effective measures be taken by him, or by his officers, 
for bringing to condign punishment the authors, abettors, and perpetra 
tors of the act ; 

"That the plundering the baggage of the garrison at the Cedars, 
stripping them of their clothes, and delivering them into the hands of 
the savages, was a breach of the capitulation on the part of the enemy, 
for which indemnification ought to be demanded ; 

" That the murder of the prisoners of war, was a gross and inhuman 
violation of the laws of nature and nations ; that condign punishment 
should be inflicted on the authors, abettors, and perpetrators of the 
same ; and that, for this purpose, it be required that they be delivered 
into our hands; 

" That the agreement entered into by General Arnold, was a mere 
sponsion on his part, he not being invested with powers for the disposal 
of prisoners not in his possession, nor under his direction ; and that, 
therefore, it is subject to be ratified or annulled at the discretion of this 
House ; 

"That the shameful surrender of the post at the Cedars, is charge 
able on the commanding officer ; that such other of the prisoners as 
were taken there, showed a willingness and desire to fight the enemy ; 
and that Major Sherburne, and the prisoners taken with him, though 
their disparity of numbers was great, fought the enemy bravely for a 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 259 

which Captain Forster adopts to justify his conduct, 
there would be no end to butchering our prisoners. 
They have, therefore, very properly reprobated it ; 
and, in the genuine spirit of freedom, resolved, that 
such cruelty as shall be inflicted on prisoners in their 
possession, by savages or foreigners taken into pay 
by the King of Great Britain, shall be considered as 
done by his orders, and recourse be immediately had 
to retaliation. It is to be hoped their determination 
will have the desired effect, and that for the future, 
such barbarous scenes will never be acted under the 
eye and approbation of a British officer ; for there is 
the greatest reason to believe, that Captain Forster 
engaged the Indians to join him, on the express con 
dition of giving up to them all such prisoners as 
might fall into his hands. His subsequent conduct, 
indeed, renders this conjecture more than probable. 



considerable time, and surrendered at last, but on absolute necessity ; on 
which consideration, and on which alone, it is resolved, that the said 
sponsion be ratified ; and that an equal number of captives from the 
enemy, of the same rank and condition, be restored to them, as stipula 
ted by the said sponsion ; 

" That, previous to the delivery of the prisoners to be returned on our 
part, the British commander in Canada be required to deliver into our 
hands the authors, abettors, and perpetrators of the horrid murder com 
mitted on the prisoners, to suffer such punishment as their crime de 
serves ; and also, to make indemnification for the plunder at the Cedars, 
taken contrary to the faith of the capitulation ; and that, until such de 
livery and indemnification be made, the said prisoners be not delivered ; 

That if the enemy shall commit any further violences, by putting to 
death, torturing, or otherwise ill treating the prisoners retained by them, 
or any of the hostages put into their hands, recourse be had to retali 
ation, as the sole means of stopping the progress of human butchery ; 
and that, for that purpose, punishments of the same kind and degree 
be inflicted on an equal number of the captives from them in our pos 
session, till they shall be taught to respect the violated rights of nations ; 

" That a copy of the above report and resolutions be transmitted to 
the Commander-in-chief of the Continental forces, to be by him sent 
to Generals Howe and Burgoyne." Journals of Congress, July 10th.

your most obedient and very humble servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK, President. 

One o clock, P. M. This moment your favor, per 
post of the llth instant, came to hand. I shall lay 
it before Congress on Monday evening. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL GEORGE CLINTON.* 

Fort Montgomery, 15 July, 1776. 

SIR, 

I received your favor of the 12th instant yesterday, 
at this place ; previous to which, about nine o clock 
Saturday morning, the signal at Fort Constitution be 
ing given, and the masters of two sloops, which about 
the same time came to, opposite my house, having 
informed me that the enemy had attacked New York 
the evening before, and that they judged, by the re 
port of the cannon, that their shipping had passed by, 
and were up the river as far as King s Bridge, I 
thought it my duty to put the neighbouring militia 



* At tills time commanding the New York militia. On the 5th of 
August he was appointed, by the Convention of the State of New York, 
to take command of the levies recently raised for immediate service. 
Nathaniel Woodhull, the President of the Convention, wrote to him as 
follows ; 

" The accounts received from General Washington are of a very 
alarming nature. You are therefore to send expresses to Dutchess, 
Ulster, Orange, and Westchestcr counties, and order the new levies to 
march with the utmost expedition to the post erected on the north 
side of King s Bridge, since it is of the utmost importance to prevent 
the enemy s occupying that post, and cutting off the communication be 
tween the army in town and the country." August 5th. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 261 

in motion and accordingly issued orders to three regi 
ments, one immediately to march into these works, 
another into Fort Constitution, and the third to ren 
dezvous at Newburg, on the bank of the river, about 
nine miles above Fort Constitution, with orders to 
march and reenforce that garrison, upon the next sig 
nal given. 

At the same time I issued orders to all the regi 
ments in my brigade, to stand ready to march on a 
moment s warning, and despatched expresses to all 
owners of sloops and boats twenty miles up the west 
side of the river, to haul them off so as to prevent 
their grounding ; that as many of them as were ne 
cessary might be ready to carry down the militia to 
the forts. The residue I ordered down to Fort Con 
stitution, as I believe by drawing a chain of them 
across the narrowest part of the river, and fixing 
them properly to be set on fire, should the enemy s 
shipping attempt passing by, they would answer a 
most valuable purpose. Early in the afternoon of 
that day, I marched into Fort Constitution with about 
forty of my neighbours, and in the evening came to 
this fort, being nearer the enemy and better situated 
to discover their motions. Yesterday evening I was 
joined by Colonel Woodhull, with between two and 
three hundred of his regiment; this morning early, 
by Lieutenant-Colonel McClaghry, with upwards of 
five hundred of his ; and I hourly expect parts of 
two other regiments. When these join me, I will 
draft, out of the four, six hundred men, and employ 
them as your Excellency has directed. I have ordered 
the Colonels I have called in, to leave the frontier 
companies at home to protect the country against 
the Indians, should they be troublesome, and as many 
men out of each company as will be sufficient to 



262 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

guard against any attempts that might be made by 
internal enemies. 

The men turn out of their harvest fields, to defend 
their country, with surprising alacrity. The absence 
of so many of them, however, at this time, when their 
harvests are perishing for want of the sickle, will 
greatly distress the country. I could wish, therefore, 
a less number might answer the purpose. I would 
fain hope the enemy mean, by their shipping in our 
bays, at present only to cut off the communication 
between the country and city, and prevent our ob 
structing the channel. Many of the militia may be 
called in in eight hours ; some in a much less time, 
should there be occasion for them. 

Since writing the above, I received a letter from 
Colonel Hay, of Haverstraw, a copy of which is in 
closed. I will send a small party down there this 
evening, or in the morning, but don t believe I shall 
be able to continue them long, as the militia here 
will think hard to be carried there. The bearer, Mr. 
Boyd, who is well acquainted with this country, the 
fortifications here, and may be confided in, will be 
able to give your Excellency any further information. 
I am, with great esteem, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

GEORGE CLINTON. 

P. S. I should be glad to know whether it is 
best to keep the sloops, &c., ordered down to Fort 
Constitution, there, as it may be attended with con 
siderable expense, which, however, if they can be 
made to answer a good purpose, ought not, in my 
opinion, to be regarded. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 263 

FROM BENJAMIN FRANKLIN. 

Philadelphia, 22 July, 1776. 

SIR, 

The bearer, Mr. Joseph Belton, some time since 
petitioned the Congress for encouragement to destroy 
the enemy s ships of war by some contrivances of his 
invention. They came to no resolution on his peti 
tion; and, as they appear to have no great opinion 
of such proposals, it is not easy, in the multiplicity 
of business before them, to get them to bestow any 
part of their attention on his request. He is now 
desirous of trying his hand on the ships that are 
gone up the North River; and, as he proposes to 
work entirely at his own expense, and only desires 
your countenance and permission, I could not refuse 
his desire of a line of introduction to you, the trou 
ble of which I beg you to excuse. As he appears 
to be a very ingenious man, I hope his project may 
be attended with success. 

With sincerest esteem and respect, I have the 
honor to be, &c. 

BENJAMIN FRANKLIN. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL GREENE. 

amp on Long Island, 25 July, 1776. 

SIR, 

I have just completed a brigade return for the 
vacancies in the different regiments. My brigade is 
so dispersed that it is difficult getting returns sea 
sonably. I should have made this return yesterday, 
but could not get Colonel Hand s until last evening. 



264 LETTERS T.O WASHING-TON. 

The outguards report nothing worthy your Excel 
lency s notice this morning. 

I am so confined, writing passes, &c., that it is 
impossible for me to attend to the duties of the day, 
which, in many instances, prejudices the service. Such 
a confined situation leaves one no opportunity of 
viewing things for themselves. It is recommended, 

O O 

by one of the greatest Generals of the age, not only 
to issue orders, but to see to the execution ; for the 
army being composed of men of indolence, if the com 
mander is not attentive to every individual in the 
different departments, the machine becomes dislocated, 
and the progress of business retarded. 

The science or art of war requires a freedom of 
thought, and leisure to reflect upon the various inci 
dents that daily occur, which cannot be had where 
the whole of one s time is engrossed in clerical em 
ployments. The time devoted to this employment is 
not the only injury I feel ; but it confines my thoughts 
as well as engrosses my time. It is like a merchan 
dise of small wares. 

I must beg leave to recommend to your Excellen 
cy s consideration the appointing an officer to write 
and sign the necessary passes. The person I should 
wish to be appointed is Lieutenant Bio d get. If it 
was put in general orders, that passes signed by him 
should be deemed authentic, as if signed by me, it 
would leave me at liberty to pursue the more im 
portant employments of my station. 

I hope your Excellency will not think this appli 
cation results from a lazy habit, or a desire to free 
myself from business. Far from it. I am never more 
happy than when I am honorably or usefully em 
ployed. If your Excellency thinks I can promote the 
service as much in this employment as in any other, 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 265 

I shall cheerfully execute the business, without the 
least murmur. 

I am, with all due respect, your Excellency s most 
obedient, humble servant, 

NATHANAEL GREENE. 



FROM MAJOR MEIGS.* 

Middletown, 25 July, 1776. 

SIR, 

I arrived here the 22d instant, after a tedious pas 
sage of sixty-six days from Quebec, on my parole of 
honor, to return when called for, a copy of which, 
together with my pass from General Carleton, is in 
closed. The original is in the hands of General Howe. 
I am to represent to your Excellency the situation 
of the unfortunate detachment that were made prison 
ers on the 31st December last. 

The number now in Quebec is about three hundred, 
including officers. The officers were confined in the 
Seminary, the soldiers in the Jesuits College, and 
were served with the same rations that were served 
to the garrison after the siege was raised. The offi 
cers had liberty to walk in a large garden that is 
adjoining the Seminary. The officers and privates are 
in great want of money, as they cannot procure cloth 
ing without it, of which they are in great want. The 
officers are now considerably in debt for necessaries, 
exclusive of the garrison allowance. Generals Carle-

derness to Quebec, and was made prisoner in the assault upon that 
city by General Montgomery.

266 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

ton and Howe have given their word for the protec 
tion of any private gentleman that may be sent with 
money, but will not admit that an officer of the army 
be sent. 

The prisoners bear their confinement with becoming 
fortitude, but are anxious for an exchange of prison 
ers, if it can be obtained consistent with the interest 
of their country. I am informed that Lieutenant- 
Colonel Campbell, of the Highlanders, has applied to 
General Howe for a cartel, and that Major French 
and others are anxious for an exchange. In February 
last, the officers, prisoners at Quebec, petitioned Ge 
neral Carleton for an exchange of prisoners, provided 
our country should approve it. The General received 
the petition, read it, and told the officer that pre 
sented it, that he would consider of it, but returned 
no other answer. 

I intended to have waited on your Excellency my 
self, but was advised, by the gentlemen in Hartford 
and this town, not to do it without your Excellen 
cy s advice, as it would be undoubtedly known to 
General Howe, and perhaps even represented that I 
had joined the army, or was giving intelligence, for 
which he might immediately demand me. When I 
gave my parole to General Carleton, he told me Ma 
jor Skene, son to Governor Skene, had arrived at 
Quebec two days before, and that he should not em 
ploy him till he had the advice of the King of Eng 
land. 

I have sent by the bearer a number of unsealed 
letters, which I brought from the prisoners at Que 
bec. I have the honor to be, with the greatest re 
spect, your Excellency s 

Most obedient and most humble servant,

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 267 

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 2 August, 1776. 

SIR, 

I am. particularly instructed, by Congress, to an 
swer that part of your letter of 29th ultimo, directed 
to the Board of War, which relates to the filling up 
vacancies in the army. The Congress are concerned 
to find, that an opinion is entertained that greater 
confidence has been placed in, and larger powers 
given to other commanders in that respect, than to 
yourself. 

They have, in no instance, except in the late ap 
pointment of General Gates to the command in Ca 
nada, parted with the power of filling up vacancies. 
The great confusion and many disorders prevalent 
in that army, and its distance, induced Congress to 
lodge such a power in that General, for the limited 
space of three months, and only during his continu 
ance in Canada. Should Congress ever empower its 
Generals to fill up the vacancies in the army, they 
know of no one in whom they would so soon repose 
a trust of such importance as in yourself; but future 
Generals may make a bad use of it. The danger 
of the precedent, not any suspicion of their present 
Commander-in-chief, prompts them to retain a power 
that, by you, Sir, might be exercised with the great 
est public advantage. 

I do myself the honor to inclose sundry resolves, 
and to request your attention to them. They relate 
principally, as you will perceive, to some new regu 
lations with regard to Paymasters, Commissaries, and 
Quartermasters in the American army, and are in- 






268 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

tended to prevent confusion and disorder in those 
several departments. 

The Congress approve of your employing, in the 
service of the States, the Stockbridge Indians, if you 
think proper. 

The inclosed resolve, for taking into the pay of 
the States such of the seamen as may fall into our 
hands on board of prizes, will, I trust, be attended 
with the good effects Congress had in view when 
they passed it. 

I have the honor to be, with perfect respect and 
esteem, Sir, your most obedient and very humble 
servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK, President. 

N. B. Your favor of 5th instant, just come to 
hand, will be replied to by to-morrow s post. 



FROM GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 

Lebanon, 5 August, 1776. 

SIR, 

I have received your two favors of the 24th and 
25th of July last. I have put Colonel Ward s regi 
ment under marching orders, to proceed without loss 
of time, whatever way Congress shall direct. The 
troops from this State, destined to the northward, 
are marched to Bennington, and from thence to 
Skenesborough. At the request of General Schuyler 
for one thousand felling axes, I have sent eight hun 
dred, ground and with helves, to go the same route. 
They went from hence the 29th last. The residue 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 269 

will go with clothing, preparing for that army, next 
Monday. I thought it not best to wait for orders, 
as we were very well assured of their necessity. 

Notwithstanding our enemies are so numerous and 
powerful, and have hired mercenaries into their ser 
vice, yet, knowing our cause righteous, and trusting 
Heaven will support and defend us, I do not greatly 
dread what they can do against us. Our internal 
malignants may be permitted to do many injurious 
and insidious things. They are, therefore, to be 
watched with care and diligence, to prevent such 
hypocritical and designing men carrying on and per 
petrating their wicked purposes. No doubt there are 
many such, the persons and characters unknown to 
me ; and not convenient to mention in a letter the 
notices given me of any. 

Last week I sent circular letters addressed to the 
civil authority, Selectmen, Committees of Inspection, 
and Military Officers, in all the towns in this State, 
to promote and facilitate the filling the several bat 
talions ordered to be raised here, and to send them 
forward to the places of their destination. Recruit 
ing officers for the companies not filled are neces 
sary, and I conclude are left for the purpose. The 
people have, in some measure, got through the hurry 
of harvest, &c. Hope that they will now cheerfully 
enlist and go on. 

Colonel Dyer and Richard Law, Esq., are directed 
to repair to New York to confer with your Excel 
lency on every subject needful for our direction, and 
for your information. You know our readiness to 
afford every assistance for our common defence. I 
am, with great esteem and regard, Sir, 

Your most obedient, humble servant, 

JONATHAN TRUMBULL.

270 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

P. S. Qthy 8 o clock, A. M. Just received your 
two favors of the 1st instant. Orders are gone to 
Colonel Elmore, and express to carry those to Colo 
nel Ward expected in soon. The orders are ready. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL MIFFLIN. 

Mount. Washington, 6 August, 1776. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

Agreeably to your order, by Colonel Reed s letter, 
I have directed Colonel Holden to march with his 
three companies this evening to King s Bridge. 

I shall, in consequence of that order, be under the 
necessity of totally neglecting the Point Battery, un 
til men are sent up to work on it; our two batta 
lions being employed in raising part of our parapet, 
covering the large magazine, cutting and forming the 
abatis, digging wells, &c. That magazine will be pre 
pared to receive the powder this evening. The maga 
zine within the fort will be completed in two days. 

We have so many sick and on guard, that I have 
been obliged to give up the outworks for the pre 
sent. 

As I had no orders respecting the chevaux-de-frise, 
and as the artists appeared willing to take their own 
way, I did not presume to interfere. 

In future I will watch and direct their movements. 
But, as Colonel Putnam is absent with the soundings, 
and as the vessels are sent up without persons who 
are acquainted with the depth of water for which 
they were calculated, I shall be at a loss to sink 
them. The sloops which came up this morning, 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 271 

being small, must, in my opinion, be sunk to the west 
ward of the brigs. If Colonel Putnam had another 
destination for them, I beg to be favored with direc 
tions where to place them. 

In future it will be best to send up single vessels, 
it being the most abstruse problem in hydraulics to 
determine of what size the several ports, or holes, 
would be, in vessels of different tonnage and con 
struction, in order to their sinking at the same time. 
If one sinks before the other, we risk, as yesterday. 

I believe that vessels above ninety tons, without 
iron work, will answer very well. No ship will at 
tempt to pass over them, even if they were eighteen 
feet below the surface. If five or six vessels, of one 
hundred tons each, could be sent up, I shall appre 
hend no danger of ships of war passing them. It 
will be the most expeditious and the most frugal 
scheme. The Colossus is now at anchor, a little to 
the westward of her post. The buoy, fixed by Colo 
nel Putnam, appears to be too distant from the shore. 
Possibly it may have been carried there by the wind 
and current. It shall be removed this night, if pos 
sible ; the brigs, this afternoon. 

The enemy may possibly attempt to weigh some 
of the vessels. It will, therefore, be necessary to fix 
some guns at the battery. If I can obtain no heavy 
guns, I will send down our four twelve-pounders and 
the howitzer, and fight them. I am, with zeal and 
attachment, 

Your Excellency s, &c. 

THOMAS MIFFLIN. 



272 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 



Haerlem, 9 August, 1776. 

SIR, 

It is with peculiar pleasure that I acknowledge 
the receipt of your Excellency s favor of yesterday, 
since I cannot but consider it as an additional mark 
of that confidence with which your Excellency has 
hitherto honored me. I have made the proper use 
of it, and imparted it, in confidence, to the members 
of the Convention, on whose secrecy I thought I 
could most safely rely, and from whose influence I 
hoped to draw the most effectual assistance. 

I early foresaw what has since happened, and 
therefore made it my endeavour to enforce the draw 
ing out as much of the strength of this State as 
could possibly be collected. I cannot but hope that 
the good effect of this measure will very shortly ap 
pear. A considerable body of troops will, as we 
suppose, begin their march for King s Bridge to-mor 
row, and I flatter myself that in five or six days 
their number will be increased to sixteen or eighteen 
hundred men. Such is my idea of the importance 
of this post, that I could wish your Excellency to 
count as little as possible upon the raw troops we 
send there, but to send thither all you originally de 
signed for that station. Your Excellency is best able 
to judge whether it can be rendered tenable without 
some cannon, gunners, and matrosses ; and how far it 



* A member of the Continental Congress, now attending the New 
York Convention, and acting as one of a Secret Committee for facili 
tating the military operations on Hudson s River. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 273 

is prudent to supply that want under which it now 
labors, by sending them from some other place. 

Since I am upon this subject, I will take the 
liberty to hint what may possibly have escaped your 
Excellency s attention, in the multiplicity of business 
in which you are involved; I mean the possibility 
of the enemy s destroying the bridge (if their fleet 
should get above the town) by means of a body of 
troops sent up the creek in boats, before any assist 
ance could come in, unless some small work was 
thrown up there for its defence, which the situation 
renders very practicable. 

The troops raised on Long Island, and which we 
have subjected to your Excellency s command, and 
ordered to join General Greene s brigade, may amount 
to about eight hundred men; but as part of them 
are very remote, they may possibly not all arrive at 
their stations in less than eight days. 

We shall, this morning, endeavour to raise some 
more of our militia, to occupy the passes in the 
Highlands, and that of the northern counties, which 
we have hitherto reserved in case of any misfortunes 
happening to the army at Ticonderoga. I fear they 
will not come in time to assist your Excellency at 
New York, if the enemy should be speedy in their 
attack, as they are very remote and ill armed. Per 
haps we may be able to send some of the neighbour 
ing militia to General Greene, to be dismissed when 
the Long Island levies are all come in. 

Your Excellency may be assured that the little 
influence I have shall be exerted to forward any 
operations which your Excellency may form, since I 
am fully satisfied that they will always be directed 
by that spirit of patriotism which has so deservedly 
secured to you the esteem of this Continent; and 



274 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

shall therefore think it a happiness to be honored 
with your commands. I have the honor to be, with 
the greatest esteem and respect, your Excellency s 
Most obedient, humble servant, 

ROBERT R LIVINGSTON. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL LIVINGSTON.* 

Elizabcthtown, 12 August, 177G. 
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 

Your letter of the 8th instant, I received on a 
journey to Brunswick, on Friday last, where I had 
an opportunity of conferring with our Convention, 
and urging your Excellency s requisition relating to 
the militia, the propriety of which is so obvious. I 
returned on Saturday evening, and delayed answering 
your favor, in hopes of receiving the resolution of the 
Convention thereon. I have just been favored with a 
rough draught of their ordinance, which I shall send 
you as soon as I get a correct copy. 

The outlines are, that the one half of the whole 
militia, without exception, be immediately called out, 
and join the Flying Camp ; that every person refus 
ing his attendance be fined three pounds ; that they 
be formed into thirteen battalions, and to remain on 
service one month, and then to be relieved by the 
other half. 



"* William Livingston had been a member of the Continental Congress, 
and was now in command of the New Jersey militia, acting in concert 
with the Continental Army. He was soon afterwards chosen Governor 
of that State, which office he held during the war. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 275 

There being no mention made of any number to 
be forwarded to New York, I take it for granted the 
whole are to be under your Excellency s direction as 
to their station, &c. 

The two thousand men for the Flying Camp, under 
General Dickinson, are in great fonvardness, and (al 
though very little acquainted with their duty) might 
answer a valuable purpose in New York, on the pre 
sent emergency, especially as their places will be so 
soon filled by the half of the militia now to be 
raised. A considerable body of the militia must be 
kept here to supply the place of the Pennsylvania 
Associators, who are deserting their post in consider 
able numbers, notwithstanding the most spirited exer 
tions of their officers, and particularly their Colonel, 
whose behaviour does honor to his Province in par 
ticular, and America in general. 

We have taken such measures as I hope will put 
a stop to any further behaviour of this kind. This 
corps, since our militia were dismissed, have not car 
ried on any of the works at the Point, which, as 
soon as they are relieved by any men under my 
command, I shall order to be prosecuted with all 
possible vigor ; as, it is more than probable, the ene 
my will attempt an incursion into this Province, 
to which its present defenceless state, in this part, 
seems strongly to invite them. I am, with much 
truth and regard, your Excellency s 

Most obedient and humble servant, 

WILLIAM LIVINGSTON. 



276 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HEATH. 

King s Bridge, 17 August, 1776. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

The kst night the fire-ships and row-galleys made 
an attempt upon the enemy s ships, which lay at an 
chor up the river. The fire-ships were well conduct 
ed ; the armed schooner was grappled and burnt ; 
the Phoenix was grappled for about ten minutes, but 
got herself clear. The Lady Washington galley and 
Independence, were conducted with great judgment 
and bravery. I wish I could say that the other gal 
leys did any thing at all. The Phoenix either slipt 
or cut her cable ; the Rose was left alone, and it is 
thought might have been taken. I was an eye-wit 
ness to the whole; and, from the confusion which was 
apparent, I am confident that if an attempt should 
be made on the fleet below, and but one or two 
ships set on fire, their confusion would be beyond 
description.* 

I have the pleasure to acquaint your Excellency, 
that General Mifrlin has about five hundred men at 
a moment s notice, to aid you in case of need. They 
were the last evening drawn out, when I reviewed 
them. They are of Colonels Slice s and Magaw s re 
giments, and the best disciplined of any troops that 
I have yet seen in the army. I shall, this evening, 
or to-morrow, send a return of the troops at this 
post. We are pushing our works with all diligence. 
I have the honor to be, with great respect, 
Your Excellency s humble servant, 

WILLIAM HEATH.

mo ms, p. 53. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 277 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HEATH. 

King s Bridge, 18 August, 1776. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

Early this morning, the Phoenix man-of-war, Rose 
frigate, and the two tenders, came to sail, and stood 
down the river, keeping close under the east shore, 
in order to avoid the fire of our cannon. But, not 
withstanding this precaution, the Phoenix was thrice 
hulled, by our shot from Mount Washington, -and one 
of the tenders once. The Rose was hulled once by 
a shot from Burdett s Ferry. They kept their men 
close, otherwise some of them would have been 
picked down by a party of riflemen, who were posted 
on the bank. They fired grape-shot as they passed, 
but did no damage save to one tent. We hope to 
hear that your batteries have done the work for 
some of them. 

We shall recover some swivel-guns, gun-barrels, 
shot, &c., out of the wreck of the tender, which was 
burnt the other night, the particulars of which shall 
be transmitted to your Excellency as soon as I can 
obtain them. General Clinton has about fourteen 
hundred men already come in, but their quarters are 
so scattered, that it will be almost impossible to col 
lect them suddenly, if occasion should require it. If 
there are any spare tents, I earnestly beg for them, 
if it were but for one regiment. General Clinton 
has orders from the Convention of the State of New 
York to purchase ten thousand feet of boards, for 
erecting sheds, &c., but it is uncertain when we shall 
have them. I shall, to-morrow, send for six or seven 
hundred of tools, being able to employ that number 
VOL. i. 24 



278 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

more than we have at present. The more I view 
this post, the more I am convinced of its importance. 

The ships have now tried the practicability of pass 
ing our works. They have explored every part of 
the shore, as far as they have gone up the river, 
and sounded the river in almost every place. Should 
the ships rejoin the fleet without receiving much da 
mage, I think Howe will be emboldened to attempt 
an attack somewhere above this place, thinking 
that there may be a greater probability of succeed 
ing here, than in the face of so many and strong 
works as have been erected in and around the city. 
However, should his inclination lead him this way, 
nature has done much for us, and we shall, as fast 
as possible, add the strength of art. Our men are in 
good health and spirits, and I dare say will give 
them a warm reception. 

I should be glad to have the carriages for the 
four-pounders sent forward the moment they are 
done, as we have not as yet a single cannon mount 
ed beyond Mount Washington. I have just now re 
ceived your Excellency s commands to inquire into 
the cause of the inactivity of some of the row-gal 
leys, in the late attack on the enemy s ships ; but 
as the galleys have all left this post, and fallen down 
to the city, I must beg your Excellency to excuse 
me from that service. I have the honor to be, with 
the greatest respect, 

Your Excellency s most humble servant, 

WILLIAM HEATH. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 279 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GATES. 

Ticonderoga, 28 August, 1776. 

SIR, 

Yesterday I had the honor to receive your Excel 
lency s letter of the 14th instant, which is all I have 
been favored with since that of the 19th July. I 
have at length the satisfaction to send a pretty cor 
rect general return of the army in this part of the 
northern district of America. A copy of my last 
letter to General Schuyler, which is in the packet, 
will explain the return to your Excellency. I also 
inclose my orders and instructions to Lieutenant 
Whitcomb, who went from hence the 20th instant upon 
a scout towards St. John s, Chamblee, &c. The re 
port of his last scout, which General Sullivan sent 
him upon, has already been sent to General Schuy- 
ler, who has doubtless transmitted it to your Excel 
lency. 

As the smallpox is now perfectly removed from 
the army, I shall, in consequence of the intelligence 
received of the motions of the enemy, immediately 
assemble my principal strength to maintain this im 
portant pass ; and hope General Waterbury, in a 
week, at farthest, will be able to come with the 
three row-galleys to Ticonderoga, and proceed, the in 
stant they arrive and are fitted, to join General Ar 
nold upon the Lake. In the mean time, we are ex 
erting our utmost industry to fortify this post, a 
plan of which is inclosed. The weather of late has 
been so uncommonly wet and stormy for the season, 
that we are much retarded in our works. As the 
enemy feel alike the inclemency of the season, I 
hope we shall be prepared for them when they come. 



280 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

My orders to Brigadier-General Arnold your Excel 
lency will find in the packet. lie read and entirely 
approved them before he left Ticonderoga. I hope 
they are the sentiments of your Excellency, and the 
most Honorable the Congress, upon that momentous 
command. 

As the New Hampshire and Connecticut militia 
have come without tents, much time is lost, by those 
regiments, in covering themselves. It happens, very 
fortunately, that Mount Independence affords an am 
ple supply of huts ; otherwise those corps must soon 
have felt great distress. The Massachusetts militia 
are arrived, well supplied with excellent tents, and a 
sufficiency of good camp utensils. This, in our pre 
sent circumstances, is a great help to us, and does 
that Province much honor. 

Governor Trumbull acquaints me he has forwarded 
one thousand felling-axes and two loads of clothing. 
His Excellency has, from the beginning of the misfor 
tunes of this army, done every thing in his power to 
establish it in health and power. Too much cannot 
be said in his praise. Your Excellency must, long 
ere this, have received from General Schuyler the re 
port of Major Bigelow, who returned with the flag of 
truce from Isle-aux-Noix. As I constantly report 
every extraordinary occurrence to General Schuyler, 
I take it for granted there is no delay with him in 
forwarding them to your Excellency and the Con 
gress. I have ordered Commissary A very to forward 
to Colonel Trumbull the returns and reports that are 
proper to be made in his department, and Dr. Mor 
gan has, before this, shown your Excellency my let 
ter to him of the 22d instant. 

I am pleased . at the account General Schuyler 
gives me, of five hundred and thirteen thousand dol- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 281 

lars being arrived at Albany from Philadelphia. It 
is much wanted both there and here, as the militia 
were promised their mileage and billeting-money at 
Number Four; but no money was sent there to pay 
them. This neglect caused much murmuring amongst 
them, and was very near stopping their march from 
thence. I wish good care was taken not to make 
any promises to troops but such as are punctually 
performed. I apprehend this promise was made by 
the Legislature at Watertown. I have the honor to 
be, your Excellency s 

Most obedient, humble servant, 

HORATIO GATES. 



FROM GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 

Lebanon, 31 August, 1776. 

SIR, 

Adjutant-General Reed s letter, of the 24th instant, 
came to hand Tuesday morning, the 27th; yours, of 
the same date, yesterday. 

On receiving the former, I advised with my Coun 
cil. We concluded to send Benjamin Huntington, Esq., 
one of my Council, with direction to take with him 
Major Ely, at New London, an officer there well ac 
quainted with the people on Long Island, to proceed 
there and consult and agree with some of the sure 
friends of our cause, with secrecy, as far as the cir 
cumstances would admit, for a number of their men, 
assured friends, and well acquainted on the Island, to 
join with a body from this State, if possible to ac 
complish your wishes, to cause a diversion to the ene 
my, to harass them on their rear, and to prevent 
24* 



282 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

their excursions in pursuit of the provisions the 
Island affords. I hear they sailed for the Island 
yesterday. His return is expected the beginning of 
next week. 

If he succeeds according to our hopes, no exer 
tions of this State, I trust, will be wanting, at this 
critical conjuncture, to harass and keep the enemy 
at bay, to gain time and every advantage the case 
may admit. I shall give the earliest intelligence of 
our proceedings, that you may cooperate with our 
designs. The race is not to the swift, nor the bat 
tle to the strong. It is nothing with God to help, 
whether many, or with those that have no power. 
He hath so ordered things, in the administration of 
the affairs of the world, as to encourage the use of 
means ; and yet, so as to keep men in continual de 
pendence upon him for the efficacy and success of 
them ; to make kings and all men to know the reins 
of the world are not in their hands, but that there 
is One above who sways and governs all things here 
below. 

I am closing. A post comes in, and brings the 
letters, copies of which are inclosed. I now expect 
Mr. Huntington s speedy return. Have sent for my 
Council. My own thoughts, and such as come to 
me, are to send forward four or five of the compa 
nies now stationed at New London, with four field- 
pieces, I hope six pieces, to join those men which 
may be ready for the service on Long Island ; four 
or five companies to follow from New London as 
soon as they can be marched down; and also to or 
der on other companies to take the places of such 
as are removed from thence. 

I am inclined to think we shall fall upon some 
measure similar to what is mentioned. No delay 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 283 

can be admitted at this critical moment. Please to 
give me the earliest intelligence how we may best 
serve agreeably to your desires. 

Shall send in the morning this intelligence to Go 
vernor Cooke, of Providence, and ask his assistance 
in the best way he shall think the circumstances 
of that State will admit. 

September \st. Inclosed is a copy of another let 
ter, dated yesterday, from Southold, that you may 
observe the contents. I hope to pursue our mea 
sures so as to stop the enemy getting into Suffolk 
county. I am, with esteem and regard, your Excel 
lency s 

Most obedient, humble servant, 

JONATHAN TRUMBULL. 



FROM GOVERNOR COOKE. 

Providence, 6 September, 1776. 

SIR, 

The necessity, which caused the unexpected evacua 
tion of Long Island, hath alarmed the General As 
sembly of this State, as it seems that communications 
cannot be kept open with an island where the ene 
my s ships can approach. This hath filled us with 
apprehensions for the town of Newport and the Island 
of Rhode Island, which are of so great importance to 
this and the other United States. Upon which the 
Assembly have thought proper to appoint John Col 
lins, Joshua Babcock, and Joseph Stanton, Esqs., a 
Committee to wait upon your Excellency, to acquaint 
you with the state of this Government, and to confer 
with you upon the best measures to be taken for its 



284 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

defence, and with respect to the Island of Rhode Is 
land. I beg the favor of your Excellency to treat 
them with the most entire confidence ; and have no 
doubt but that the same disposition which hath al 
ways induced you to manifest your regard to this 
State, will induce you to give us your best advice 
and assistance. 

Upon receiving information of the landing of the 
enemy upon Long Island, and a letter from Governor 
Trumbull, acquainting us with your request that a 
body of men might be thrown upon the east end of 
that Island, this State ordered the whole brigade, with 
the two galleys, and a sufficient quantity of provisions 
and ammunition, to proceed to that Island, and order 
ed them to be replaced by the militia of the State. 
We exerted ourselves to get them in readiness; and 
some of them w r ere under orders to proceed, when 
we received the most uncertain and aggravated ac 
counts of the evacuation of Long Island, which occa 
sioned us to stop the men until we could receive 
intelligence to be depended upon ; which we did not 
gain until the last evening. I beg leave to observe 
to your Excellency the advantages that may accrue 
to the common cause from the several States having 
early and authentic intelligence of all matters of im 
portance that shall happen, and to request your Ex 
cellency to favor us with accounts of every thing 
material. I have the honor to be, with every senti 
ment of esteem and respect, Sir, your Excellency s 
Most obedient, humble servant, 

NICHOLAS Co ORE. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 285 

FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL MERCER. 

Amboy, 8 o clock, A. M., 7 September, 1776. 

SIR, 

I have been confined two days by a fever, which 
has not yet left me ; it is a great mortification that I 
have it not in my power to attend at head-quar 
ters. It would, however, have been impossible for 
any officers from this place to be in time at New 
York. By some neglect of the messenger, your letter 
was not delivered till seven this morning. General 
Roberdeau waits on your Excellency to know the 
result of your determinations, and to inform you of 
the state of the troops in New Jersey. 

My ideas of the operations for this campaign are 
to prevent the enemy from executing their plan of a 
junction between the armies of Howe and Burgoyne, 
on which the expectations of the King and Ministry 
are fixed. We should keep New York, if possible, 
as the acquiring of that will give eclat to the arms 
of Britain, afford the soldiers good quarters, and fur 
nish a safe harbour for the fleet. If it even could 
be retained a month or two, keeping the field so 
long in this climate may be supposed to affect the 
health of European troops very much. On the other 
hand, a free and safe communication with the coun 
tries, from whence supplies of men and provisions 
can come to your army, is a consideration of superior 
moment to any other. 

How far both those objects may be within the 
compass of your Excellency s force, I cannot pretend 
to judge, having a very inadequate knowledge of the 
particulars necessary to found an opinion upon. I 
have not seen Colonel Clark, but gave general orders 



286 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

at all the posts along the Jersey shore, that the 
troops from Maryland should proceed immediately to 
New York. I hope to be able, very soon, to effect 
some enterprise on Staten Island, when we have a 
sufficient number of men for the Flying Camp to 
dispose along the different posts ; but the militia are 
not the men for such a purpose. Four Colonels were 
with me some nights ago, to inform that their men 
would fight the enemy on this side, but would not 
go over to Staten Island. I have the honor to be, 
Sir, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

HUGH MERCER. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Albany, 9 September, 177G. 

DEAR SIR, 

At half after ten, this morning, I received a letter 
from General Gates, copy whereof I inclose your Ex 
cellency. 

As it is most probable the enemy are attempting 
to cross the Lake, I have therefore thought it neces 
sary to apply to the neighbouring counties of the New 
England States, and those of Ulster and Duchess in 
this, to order their militia to march up. As soon 
as they arrive, I shall either move with what part 
may go to the northward, or with those to the west 
ward, as may be most necessary. This can, however, 
only be determined by farther intelligence from Ge 
neral Gates and Colonel Dayton, which I momently 
expect to receive. 

The cartridge-paper arrived here on the 2d instant, 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 287 

was sent forward on the 3d, and arrived at Fort 
George on the 5th, at night, and was probably for 
warded from thence on the 6th. 

I am informed that the army is in the greatest 
distress for medicines. As every misfortune and want 
they labor under is imputed to me, so is this. I am 
heartily tired of abuse, and was in hopes that Con 
gress would have ordered an inquiry into my con 
duct. I requested it, most earnestly, on the 16th of 
last month, but have not yet been honored with an 
answer. I will no longer suffer the public odium, 
since I have it most amply in my power to justify 
myself, and shall therefore resign my commission as 
soon as I return from Ticonderoga, or Try on county. 
Of this I shall advise Congress, that orders may be 
given for a General Officer to reside in this place, 
without which the service will suffer. But, in doing 
this, I shall never forget the duty I owe to my coun 
try ; and if I can, by advice or any other means, pro 
mote the w r eal of it, none will do it with more ala 
crity. I am, dear Sir, with every sentiment of esteem 
and respect, your Excellency s 

Most obedient, humble servant, 

PHILIP SCHUYLER. 



FROM EDWARD RUTLEDGE.* 

Brunswick, AVednesday Evening 10 o clock, 
11 September, 177G. 

MY DEAR SIR, 

Your favor of this morning is just put into my 
hands. In answer I must beg leave to inform you, 

* Lord Howe and General Howe had been appointed Commissioners 
by the King, in conformity with an Act of Parliament, to endeavour to 



288 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

that our conference with Lord Howe has been air 
tended which no immediate advantages. He declared 
that he had no powers to consider us as independent 
States ; and we easily discovered that, were we still 
dependent, we should have nothing to expect from 
those with which he is vested. He talked altogether 
in generals; that he came out here to consult, advise, 
and confer with gentlemen of the greatest influence 
in the Colonies, about their complaints; that the King 
would revise the Act of Parliament, and royal in 
structions, upon such reports as should be made ; 
and appeared to fix our redress upon his Majesty s 
good will and pleasure. This kind of conversation 
lasted for several hours, and, as I have already said, 
without any effect. 

Our reliance continues, therefore, to be, under God, 
on your wisdom and fortitude, and that of your 
forces ; that you may be as successful as I know 
you are worthy, is my most sincere wish. 

I saw Mrs. Washington the evening before I left 
Philadelphia. She was well. I gave Mr. Griffin a 
letter from her for you. The gentlemen beg their 
respects. God bless you, my dear Sir.

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 289 

FROM SIR WILLIAM HOWE. 

Head-Quarters, York Island, 21 September, 1776. 

SIR, 

I have the favor of your letters of the 6th and 
19th current. In consequence of the latter, direc 
tions are given for Major-General Sullivan being con 
veyed to Elizabethtown on the earliest day, and I 
conclude Major-General Prescott will return in the 
same boat. 

The exchange you propose, of Brigadier-General 
Alexander, commonly called Lord Stirling, for Mr. 
McDonald, cannot take place, as he has only the 
rank of Major by my commission ; but I shall readily 
send any Major in the inclosed lists of prisoners, that 
you will be pleased to name, in exchange for him ; 
and, that Lord Stirling may not be detained, I would 
propose to exchange him for Governor Montfort 
Brown, although the latter is no longer in the mili 
tary line.* 

Inclosed you have a list of the officers belonging 
to the army under my command, who are your pri 
soners. It is not so correct as I could wish, having 
received no regular return of the officers of the forty- 
second and seventy-first regiments, taken this year ; 
but beg leave to refer you to Lieutenant-Colonel 
Campbell, of the seventy-first, to rectify any omissions 
that may be; and I am to desire you will put, oppo 
site to their names, such of your officers, of equal 
rank, as you would have in exchange for them. The

had been captured by Commodore Hopkins. See Washington s Writ 
ings, Vol. III. p. 352. 

VOL. I. 25 



290 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

names of the non-commissioned officers and privates, 
prisoners with you, are not sent, being unnecessary ; 
but the return, herewith inclosed, specifies the num 
ber, and I shall redeem them by a like number of 
those in my possession ; for which purpose I shall 
send Mr. Joshua Loring, my Commissary, to Eliza- 
bethtown, as a proper place for the exchange of pri 
soners, on any day you may appoint, wishing it to 
be an early one, wherein I presume you will concur, 
as it is proposed for the more speedy relief of the 
distressed. 

As it may be some time before Mr. Lovell arrives 
here from Halifax, though I took the first opportunity 
of sending for him after your agreement to exchange 
him for Governor Skene, I am willing to believe, 
upon my assurances of Mr. Lovell s being sent to 
you immediately on his arrival, that you will not 
have any objections to granting the Governor his 
liberty, without delay; and am induced to make the 
proposal for your compliance, neither of the persons 
being connected with military service. 

General Carleton has sent from Canada a number 
of officers and privates, as per return inclosed, to 
whom he has given liberty upon their paroles ; and 
in pursuance of his desire and their engagements to 
him, I shall send them to Elizabethtown on the 
earliest day. It is, nevertheless, the General s expect 
ation, that the exchange of prisoners, as settled by 
Captain Forster, in Canada, will be duly complied 
with; and I presume you are sufficiently sensible of 
the sacred regard that is ever paid to engagements 
of this kind, [not] to suffer any infringement upon 
the plighted faith of Colonel Arnold. 

It is with much concern, that I cannot close this 
letter without representing the ill treatment which, I 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 291 

am too well informed, the King s officers now suffer 
in common jails, throughout the Province of New 
England. I apply to your feelings alone for redress, 
having no idea of committing myself by an act of 
retaliation upon those in my power. 

My Aid-de-camp, charged with the delivery of this 
letter, will present you with a ball cut and fixed to 
the end of a nail, taken from a number of the same 
kind found in the encampments quitted by your troops 
on the 15th instant. I do not make any comment 
upon such unwarrantable and malicious practices, be 
ing w r ell assured the contrivance has not come to your 
knowledge. I am, with due regard, Sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

WILLIAM HOWE.* 



FROM GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 

New Haven, 11 October, 1776. 

SIR, 

In consequence of your favor, proposing a descent 
on Long Island, although I was so unhappy as not to 
be able to meet Generals Clinton and Lincoln at this 
place, as requested, I applied to the State of Rhode 
Island, and obtained their consent and orders, that 
Colonel Richmond, and such part of his battalion as 
shall not enlist on board the Continental vessels, 
should assist in the enterprise. Colonel Richmond 
will accordingly begin his march this day for New 



* See the answer to this letter, in Washington s Writings, Vol. IV. 
p. 105. 



292 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

London, and bring with him the whaleboats collected 
in Massachusetts Bay and Rhode Island, to the num 
ber of between eighty and ninety, which, it is appre 
hended, will be of great use to the troops ordered on 
this service, especially to secure and assist their re 
treat, should it be attempted to be cut off. When 
Colonel Richmond arrives at New London, he has 
orders to put himself under the command of such 
General Officer as your Excellency shall appoint, 

I have this day conferred with Colonels Mclntosh 
and Livingston on the subject. They inform me they 
are supplied with provisions and ammunition for their 
purpose, and only want such a number of water-craft, 
as, with the whaleboats divided into three parts, in 
the whole may be sufficient to transport twelve hun 
dred men ; as he means each division to be so placed 
at the inlets to the Island, as, if cut off from one, 
he may resort to the other to make his retreat sure, 
if necessary. These I have ordered for him, and they 
will be provided and ready without delay. 

The number of men he proposes to set out with 
will doubtless be sufficient for his first attempts. But 
what reinforcements will be necessary soon to follow, 
to answer every purpose, your Excellency will judge. 
They may be thrown over from Stamford or Nor walk 
very soon, if placed there. I am apprehensive lest 
some difficulties may arise with regard to the com 
mand of this detachment. Colonel Mclntosh is a 
superior officer to Lieutenant-Colonel Livingston ; and 
Richmond is superior in rank to both. Colonel Liv 
ingston appears to be a young gentleman of real 
spirit and abilities, and has every advantage in his 
knowledge of the Island, and the people there. The 
other gentlemen have also their merit. May not a 
difficulty arise as to the command? I hope there 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 293 

will not. As the gentlemen are all well disposed, I 
hope they will cooperate to the best advantage in 
the whole. What is further necessary to render their, 
operations effectual, you will please to consider and 
direct. 

Our naval expedition against the ships of the ene 
my in the Sound is still in contemplation, and pre 
parations are making for the same as fast as we can. 
Commodore Hopkins writes me, the 5th instant, that 
the Alfred and Hampden are ready, and that the two 
new frigates there would be ready in about a week, 
if they can be manned, neither of them having more 
than half their complement at that time. Our ship 
and brig will, we trust, be ready to join them, and 
when they are equipped it is proposed that they first 
attack the two frigates that infest the coast and 
Sound, if they, or either of them, shall appear in 
their way; otherwise they will proceed directly up 
the Sound, and give the best account they can of 
the ships this side Hell Gate, which is the principal 
object. I am now informed that the two frigates and 
the Alfred are manned from Colonel Richmond s regi 
ment, which I hope will prove true ; but, if not, am 
in hopes they may be completed by volunteers from 
Rhode Island and New London; but if they should 
still fall short of their full complement, I beg leave 
to suggest to your Excellency whether they could 
not, without inconveniency, be filled up from some 
parts of your army, unless the row-galley men, by 
the enemy s ships passing up the North River, are 
rendered useless, in which case they may be ordered 
to some proper place along the Sound, for Commo 
dore Hopkins to take them in. 

I have given Commodore Hopkins the utmost as 
surance to give him all possible intelligence, from 



294 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

time to time, of the enemy s ships of force this side 
Hell Gate, that he may be apprised what he has to 
encounter. To that purpose I beg leave to suggest 
to your Excellency to give orders to such command 
ers of the guards, or posts, in sight of the enemy s 
ships, to give me intelligence of their force, situation, 
and motions, or whether and when joined by any 
other of the enemy s ships through Hell Gate. 

I have heard that one twenty-four gunship of the 
enemy has already passed through to them. Since 
my last from Commodore Hopkins, am informed thai 
the Columbus, Captain Whipple, has arrived in port 
at Rhode Island. I have wrote to him to take her 
with him, which will make considerable addition to 
his force. Please to afford me your advice and fullest 
information. I cannot but flatter myself with strong 
hopes of advantages to be derived from this adven 
ture of our ships, as well as the expedition to Long- 
island. Secrecy in both is of utmost importance. I 
am, with great esteem and regard, Sir, 

Your most obedient, humble servant, 

JONATHAN TRUMBULL. 



FROM ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

Fishkill, 12 October, 1776. 

DEAR SIR, 

I should do great injustice to the polite attention 
with which your Excellency has listened to the un 
digested opinions which I have sometimes offered, if 
I did not, without any apology, give my sentiments 
freely on the present alarming condition of this Colo 
ny, and submit to your Excellency s better judgment 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 295 

such measures as will, in my idea, be most likely 
to insure success. 

Since, upon experiment (contrary to the general 
sentiment), it appears that the passage of the river 
is not effectually obstructed, the present situation of 
the army, though not exactly similar, bears some 
resemblance to that in which it was at New York. 
The enemy may land above and reduce your Excel 
lency to the necessity of attacking them at their 
landing, or of suffering them to seize upon passes 
from which it will be impossible to dislodge them; 
nor (such is the peculiar situation of the country and 
the vicinity of the Sound) will it be very difficult 
so to station themselves as to render every supply 
going to our camp extremely precarious. This, too, 
may be done with a part of their forces, while the 
remainder, having their retreat secured, may, at their 
leisure, ravage the open country beyond the High 
lands, encourage the disaffected, and, by their assist 
ance, carry their arms to Albany, which would, while 
it distressed the troops in your Excellency s camp, 
inevitably destroy the Northern army. 

To stay at Ticonderoga, without daily supplies, 
would be impossible ; a march to Albany would be 
equally so, without carriages or horses to carry their 
provisions or stores, or a sufficient number of boats 
to transport them in time across Lake George. No 
other means would be left them but to retreat into 
New England, without stores, artillery, or provisions, 
in which case their strength would soon be dissipated 
by desertions, or the whole body separated through 
want of necessaries. 

These fears may appear ideal to those who do not 
reflect, that the distance from the Highlands to Al 
bany is but one hundred miles; that the road from 



296 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

Ticonderoga to Albany is equally distant, through a 
broken and almost uninhabited country; that most of 
the militia of this State that can be armed, or de 
pended on, are in your Excellency s camp ; and that 
all the men which we have at present ventured to 
call upon, in addition to those in service, do not ex 
ceed three hundred, and even these w r e have little 
reason to expect that we shall obtain. Add to this, 
that bodies of men are already enlisted throughout 
this State, and, we have reason to fear, are already 
collecting under the direction of disguised officers in 
the Highlands. 

Those evils might, in my humble opinion, be fully 
guarded against by sending a single regiment with 
a good engineer, to take possession of the passes in 
the Highlands, and by forming two camps, the one 
to secure the passes into Connecticut (which might 
be done by the militia of the New England States), 
the other at or near the place where the ships now 
lie in the North River, which would reduce the ene 
my to the necessity of attacking the lines in front, 
or expose them, if they landed above, to the danger 
of being surrounded. The very reputation of such 
camp being formed, will prevent their making any 
such attempts, and, in case of any misfortune at New 
York, will afford a secure retreat, and effectually pre 
vent the enemy from pushing their advantage, more 
especially if all stores, which are not absolutely ne 
cessary for the army, are removed to this place. 

Your Excellency has, I dare say, seen the neces 
sity of laying up magazines of provisions, and col 
lecting materials for barracks, at or near this place, 
that the want of them should not, in case of a de 
feat, oblige the army to separate. Were not the 
treasury of this State exhausted by the uncommon 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 297 

expense to which we have been put by the disaffec 
tion of our own people, the debt due from the Con 
tinent, and the disappointment we have met with in 
striking money, the Convention of this State would 
have done something therein at their own risk. Mr. 
Hubbard promised to give your Excellency some in 
formation relative to the forts in the Highlands, and 
the General that commands. The subject is too deli 
cate for a letter. 

Your Excellency sees the opinion I have of your 
patience and good nature, by my venturing to ob 
trude upon them these crude and hasty remarks, 
which I have not even leisure to copy. Perhaps I 
might find some excuse for them in my anxiety for 
the great cause your Excellency supports, and my 
knowledge of a country which you have had no op 
portunity to explore. I have the honor to be, with 
the greatest respect, your Excellency s 

Most obedient, humble servant, 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Fort Lcc, 24 October, 1776. 

DEAR SIR, 

Inclosed you have a copy of the letter, in answer 
to mine to Congress, relative to cartridges. As soon 
as the cartridges come up, they shall be forwarded. 
Colonel Biddle has wrote to Amboy for ninety thou 
sand that are at that post. 

We have collected all the wagons in our power, 
and sent over. Our people have had extreme hard 
duty ; the common guards, common fatigue, and the 



298 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

extraordinary guards and extraordinary fatigue, for 
the removal of the stores, and forwarding the provi 
sions, have kept every man on duty. 

General Putnam requested a party of men to re- 
enforce them at Mount Washington. I sent between 
two and three hundred of Colonel Durkee s regiment. 
Please to inform me whether your Excellency ap 
proves thereof. 

We shall get a sufficient quantity of provisions 
over to-day for the garrison at Fort Washington. 
General Mifflin thinks it not advisable to pull the 
barracks doAvn yet. lie has hopes of our army re 
turning to that ground for winter-quarters. I think 
this would be running too great a risk to leave them 
standing in expectation of such an event. There be 
ing several strong fortifications in and about King s 
Bridge, if the enemy should throw in a thousand or 
fifteen hundred men,, they could cut off our commu 
nication effectually; and, as the state of the barracks 
is, they w y ould find exceeding good cover for the 
men. But if we were to take the barracks down, if 
the boards were not removed, it would, in a great 
measure, deprive them of that advantage. However, 
I have not had it in my power to do cither as yet. 

I have directed all the wagons that are on the 
other side to be employed in picking up the scat 
tered boards about the encampments. I believe, from 
what I saw yesterday in riding over the grounds, 
they will amount to several thousands. As soon as 
we have got these together, I purpose to begin upon 
the barracks. In the mean time, I should be glad 
to know if your Excellency has any other orders to 
give respecting the business. 

I have directed the Commissary and Quartermaster- 
General of this department to lay in provisions and 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 299 

provender, upon the back road to Philadelphia, for 
twenty thousand men for three months. The princi 
pal magazine will be at Aquackanock. I shall fortify 
it as soon as possible, and secure that post and the 
pass at the bridge, which is now repaired and fit for 
an army to pass over, with the baggage and artillery. 
I rejoice to hear of the defeat of that vile traitor, 
Major Rogers, and his party of Tories, though I am 
exceeding sorry to hear it cost us so brave an officer 
as Major Greene. I am, with great respect, 

Your Excellency s obedient servant, 

NATHANAEL GREENE. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Fort Lee, 31 October, 1776. 

DEAR SIR, 

The enemy have possession of Fort Independence, 
on the heights above King s Bridge. They made their 
appearance the night before last. We had got every 
thing of value away. The bridges are cut down, and 
I gave Colonel Magaw orders to stop the road be 
tween the mountains. 

I should be glad to know your Excellency s mind 
about holding all the ground from King s Bridge to 
the lower lines. If we attempt to hold the ground, 
the garrison must still be reenforced; but if the gar 
rison is to draw into Mount Washington, and only 
keep that, the number of troops on the Island is too 
large. 

We are not able to determine, with any certainty, 
whether those troops, that have taken post above 
King s Bridge, are the same troops or not that were 
in or about Ilaerlem. Several days past they clisap- 



300 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

peared from below, all at once, and some little time 
after about fifty boats, full of men, were seen going 
up towards Hunt s Point, and that evening the enemy 
were discovered at Fort Independence. We suspect 
them to be the same troops that were engaged in 
the Sunday skirmish. 

Six officers, belonging to privateers that were taken 
by the enemy, made their escape last night. They 
inform me they were taken by the last fleet that 
came in. They had about six thousand foreign troops 
on board, one quarter of which had the black scurvy, 
and died very fast. 

Seventy sail of transports and ships fell down to 
Red Hook. They were bound for Rhode Island, and 
had on board about three thousand troops. They also 
inform, that after the Sunday action an officer of dis 
tinction was brought into the city, badly wounded. 

The ships have come up the river to their station 
again, a little below their lines. Several deserters 
from Paulus Hook have come over. They all report 
that General Howe is wounded, as did those from 
the fleet. It appears to be a prevailing opinion in 
the land and sea service. 

I forwarded your Excellency a return of troops at 
this post, and a copy of a plan for establishing maga 
zines. I could wish to know your pleasure as to the 
magazines, as soon as possible. 

I shall reenforce Colonel Magaw with Colonel Raw- 
lings s regiment, until I hear from your Excellency 
respecting the matter. 

The motions of the Grand Army will best deter 
mine the propriety of endeavouring to hold all the 
ground from King s Bridge to the lower lines. I shall 
be as much on the Island of York as possible, so as 
not to neglect the duties of my own department. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 301 

I can learn no satisfactory account of the action 
the other day. I am, with great respect, 

Your Excellency s obedient servant, 

NATIIANAEL GREENE. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Fort Lee, 7 November, 1776. 

DEAR SIR, 

By an express from Major Clark, stationed at 
Dobbs s Ferry, I find the enemy are encamped right 
opposite, to the number of between three and four 
thousand ; and the Major adds, from their disposition 
and search after boats, they design to cross the river. 
A frigate and two transports or provision-ships pass 
ed the chevaux-de-frise night before last. They were 
prodigiously shattered, from the fire of our cannon. 
The same evening, Colonel Tupper attempted pass 
ing the ships with the petiaugres, loaded with flour. 
The enemy manned several barges, two tenders, and 
a row-galley, and attacked them. Our people ran 
the petiaugres ashore, and landed and defended them. 
The enemy attempted to land several times, but 
were repulsed. The fire lasted about an hour and a 
half, and the enemy moved off. Colonel Tupper still 
thinks he can transport the provision in flat-bottomed 
boats. A second attempt shall be speedily made. 
We lost one man, mortally wounded. 

General Mercer writes me the Virginia troops are 

coming on. They are now at Trenton. He proposes 

an attack on Staten Island; but the motions of the 

enemy are such I think it necessary for them to 

VOL. i. 26 



302 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

come forward as fast as possible. On York Island, 
the enemy have taken possession of the hill, next 
to Spiten Devil. I think they will not be able to 
penetrate any farther. There appears to be about 
fifteen hundred of them. From the enemy s motions, 
I should be apt to suspect they were retreating from 
your army, or at least altering their operations. Mr. 
Lovell, who is at last enlarged from his confinement, 
reports that Colonel Allen, his fellow prisoner, was 
informed that transports were getting in readiness 
to sail, at a moment s warning, sufficient to trans 
port fifteen thousand men. 

The officers of Colonel Hand s regiment are here, 
with enlisting orders. The officers of the Pennsyl 
vania regiments think it a grievance (such of them 
as are commissioned for the new establishment), that 
officers of other regiments should have the privilege 
of enlisting their men before they get orders. I 
have stopped it until I learn your Excellency s plea 
sure. Governor Ewing is very much opposed to it. 
You will please to favor me with a line on the sub 
ject, I am, with the greatest respect, 

Your Excellency s obedient servant, 

NATHANAEL GREENE. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Fort Leo, 9 November, 1776. 

DEAR SIR, 

Your Excellency s letter of the 8th, this moment 
came to hand. I shall forward the letter to General 
Stevens by express. The stores at Dobbs s Ferry I 
had just given orders to the Quartermaster to pre- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 303 

pare wagons to remove. I think the enemy will 
meet with some difficulty in crossing the river at 
Dobbs s Ferry. However, it is not best to trust too 
much to the expected difficulties they may meet 
there. 

By the letter that will accompany this, and was to 
have gone last night by Major Mifrlin, your Excellen 
cy will see what measures I took before your favor 
came to hand. The passing of the ships up the river 
is, to be sure, a full proof of the insufficiency of the 
obstructions in the river to stop the ships from go 
ing up ; but that garrison employs double the num 
ber of men to invest it that we have to occupy it. 
They must keep troops at King s Bridge, to prevent 
a communication with the country; and they dare 
not leave a very small number, for fear our people 
should attack them. 

Upon the whole, I cannot help thinking the garri 
son is of advantage; and I cannot conceive the gar 
rison to be in any great danger. The men can be 
brought off at any time, but the stores may not be 
so easily removed; yet I think they can be got off, 
in spite of them, if matters grow desperate. This 
post is of no importance only in conjunction with 
Mount Washington. I was over there last evening. 
The enemy seem to be disposing matters to besiege 
the place ; but Colonel Morgan thinks it will take 
them till December expires before they can carry it. 
If the enemy do not find it an object of importance, 
they will not trouble themselves about it; if they 
do, it is open proof they feel an injury from our 
possessing it. Our giving it up will open a free 
communication with the country, by the way of 
King s Bridge, that must be a great advantage to 
them and injury to us. 



304 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

If the enemy cross the river, I shall follow your 
Excellency s advice respecting the cattle and -forage. 
Those measures, however cruel in appearance, were 
ever my maxims of war, in the defence of a coun 
try ; in attacking, they would be very improper. 

By this express, several packets from Congress are 
forwarded to you. 

I shall collect our whole strength, and watch the 
motions of the enemy; and pursue such measures, 
for the future, as circumstances render necessary. 

As I have your Excellency s permission, I shall 
order General Stephen on as far as Aquackanock, at 
least. That is an important pass. I am fortifying it 
as fast as possible. 

I am, dear Sir, your most obedient, 

And very humble servant, 

NATIIANAEL GREENE. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LEE.* 

Camp at Philipsburg, 12 November, 177G ; 
9 o clock, P. M. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

This instant came express, from Colonel Tupper, 
(stationed opposite to Dobbs s Ferry), one David 
Keech. The substance of his intelligence is as fol 
lows. That the enemy began their march at nine 
this morning, down the river, with their baggage, ar 
tillery, &c. ; that the man-of-war and two store-ships 
had just set sail, and were making down (I mean 
those which came up last); that three ships still lie 



* General Lee returned from the Southern Department and joined 
the army under Washington on the 14th of October. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 305 

off Tarry town and Sing Sing, two at the former, and 
one at the latter. Keech says the whole army have 
quitted Dobbs s Ferry, and imagines the rear have 
by this time reached King s Bridge. 

I am far from being satisfied with the conduct of 
our scouts. I do not think they venture far enough, 
for they generally bring back very lame, imperfect 
accounts. But I have projected a plan for breaking 
in, at least, upon Rogers s party, and believe I shall 
succeed. The sentence on Austin is, that he should 
be reprimanded; but I have ordered a new court- 
martial, with a charge of wanton, barbarous conduct, 
unbecoming, not only an officer, but a human crea 
ture. 

General Lincoln and the Massachusetts Committee 
are using their efforts to detain the militia; whether 
they will succeed, heaven only knows. Hitchcock 
and Yarnum do not recollect the recommendation of 
General Greene, but I have ordered them to give me 
a list of those who they think ought to be recom 
mended ; for it is now too late to refer to Greene, 
as the Commissioners are expected every hour. I 
wish to God you were here, as I am in a manner a 
stranger to their respective merits. When the list is 
made out, I shall inform myself, as well as I can, if 
their recommendation is impartial, and proceed ac 
cordingly. I am, dear General, 

Yours, most sincerely, 

CHARLES LEE.

306 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LEE. 

Camp, 19 November, 1776. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

The recommendation of General Greene, which you 
transmitted to me ; threw the officers to whom. I com 
municated it into so great a flame of discontent, that 
I ventured, notwithstanding your orders, to hesitate. 
They accused him of partiality to his connections and 
townsmen, to the prejudice of men of manifestly su 
perior merit. Indeed, it appears, from the concurrent 
testimony of unbiased persons, that some of the sub 
jects he recommended were wretched. In short, I 
was so stunned with their clamor, that I delayed till 
the arrival of the Committee, for which I ought to 
ask your pardon. But, at the same time, I think the 
delay has been salutary. 

My objections to moving from our present post 
are, as I observed before, that it would give us the 
air of being frightened; it would expose a fine fertile 
country to their ravages ; and I must add, that we 
are as secure as we could be in any position what 
ever. We are pretty well disencumbered of our im 
pediments, which I propose depositing in or about 
Crompond, which (though I confess I have not recon 
noitred the place), from its situation, must be full as 
safe, and is much more centrical than Peekskill. If, 
on further examination, it has any material disadvan 
tages, we can easily move from thence. 

As to ourselves, light as we are, several retreats 
present themselves. In short, if we keep a good 
look out, we are in no danger; but I must entreat 
your Excellency to enjoin the officers posted at Fort 
Lee to give us the quickest intelligence, if they ob-

serve any embarkations of troops in the North River. 
Our scouts are of late grown more vigilant, and make 
prisoners. The militia, according to their laudable 
custom, would not stay a moment beyond their usual 
time. Oh, General, why would you be overpersuaded 
by men of inferior judgment to your own? It was 
a cursed affair. 

Yours, most affectionately, 

CHARLES LEE. 

P. S. The returns of the soldiers of the different 
regiments now in the hands of the enemy, according 
to the mode you require, are not yet made out, but 
will soon, and shall be sent. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LEE. 

Camp, Philipsburg, 26 November, 1776. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

It never was my idea to leave the Highlands un 
guarded, but only for expedition s sake that Heath 
should detach two thousand of his corps immediately 
over the river, and to replace these two thousand by 
the same number, the most lightly accoutred, from 
this body here, till the main body, with their bag 
gage, cannon, &c., could move. I conceived this move 
ment could be attended with no risk, as he has now 
nothing to guard but the western passages; for there 
is no possibility of their approaching by the eastern, 
having, as I can learn, no vessels on the eastern 
river to transport their cannon, and the road from 
King s Bridge by land is now almost impracticable.* 

* General Heath was stationed at Peeksklll for the defence of the 
country in the neighbourhood of the Highlands. A full account of the 



308 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

The want of carriages, and this disappointment with 
respect to Heath, but above all, the alarms w r e have 
been thrown into by the activity of the Tories, and 
the important consideration of leaving this country in 
a tolerable state of security on my departure, have 
still detained me here. The enemy kept a very con 
siderable part of their force on this side of King s 
Bridge till yesterday, so considerable, indeed, that 
from what we saw we conceived the numbers trans 
ported to the Jerseys not near so great as you were 
taught to think. This, and the apprehension of their 
gleaning all the forage of this district, contributed to 
the other considerations I have mentioned, have de 
tained me so much longer than I could have wished. 

Yesterday they drew T themselves in, and we made 
a sweep of the country from Phillips s house. Part of 
the army have moved on. I set out to-morrow. JNo 
militia are come in to cover the country. I have 
wrote most pressing letters on this subject to Trum- 
bull, and hope they will have effect. I have been 
equally urgent with Mr. Bowdoin for blankets, shoes, 
&c. Indeed, our soldiers are not in a moving condi 
tion, but seem well disposed, and engage themselves 
beyond expectation. But we are in great want of 
money for bounty. I have been under the necessity, 
without authority, to draw for this purpose. Several 
deserters, come out to-day, inform us that a consider 
able embarkation is made for Amboy. 

I shall take care to obey your Excellency s order, 
in regard to my march, as exactly as possible; and am, 
Dear General, yours, 

CHARLES LEE.

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 309 

FROM GENERAL CADWALADER.* 

Bristol, 26 December, 1776. 

SIR, 

The river was so full of ice that it was impossible 
to pass above Bristol, where I intended, and there 
fore concluded to make an attempt at Dunks s Ferry. 
As soon as it was dark, I sent down all the boats I 
could muster, and marched down about eight o clock. 
I embarked a few men to line the river, and pre 
vent any person escaping to give intelligence to the 
enemy ; and these were followed by a part of the 
first battalion of militia, then two field-pieces, with 
which I went over to see if it was practicable to 
land them, and, upon examination, found it was im 
possible, the ice being very thick. Upon reporting 
this to the field-officers, they were all of opinion 
that it would not be proper to proceed without can 
non. During this time the third battalion was land 
ed. We concluded to withdraw the troops that had 
passed, but could not effect it till near four o clock 
this morning. The whole then were ordered to march 
for Bristol. 

I imagine the badness of the night must have pre 
vented you from passing, as you intended.! Our 
men turned out cheerfully. We had about eighteen 
hundred rank and file, including artillery. It will be 
impossible for the enemy to pass the river till the 
ice will bear. Would it not be proper to attempt to

cross below, and join General Putnam, who was to 
go over from Philadelphia to-day, with five hundred 
men, which number, added to the four hundred Jer 
sey militia which Colonel Griffin left there, would 
make a formidable body. This would cause a diver 
sion, that would favor any attempt you may design in 
future, and would expose their baggage and stores, 
if they attempt to cross. It is impossible, in our 
present situation, to cooperate with General Putnam. 
The militia will be easier kept together by being in 
motion. We shall have some service from Colonel 
Hitchcock s brigade, whose time of enlistment will be 
up in a few days. We have procured a considerable 
number of shoes, stockings, and breeches for them. 
They are in good spirits, and enlist very fast, I am, 
Sir, with great respect, 

Your most obedient, humble servant, 

JOHN CADWALADER. 



FROM ROBERT MORRIS. 

Philadelphia, 26 December, 1776. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have just received yours of yesterday, and will 
duly attend to those things you recommend to my 
consideration. At present I have to inclose you a 
letter from Congress, which I suppose contains their 
resolves of the 20th instant; but as the President 
does not say, in his letter to me, that they are in 
closed to you, and as it is necessary you should 
have them, I take the liberty to send herewith a 
copy of them.* 



* On the 20th of December, Congress " Ecsolvcd, That the President

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 311 

I am well pleased to see the attention they pay 
General Lee ; and I shall make it a point to collect 
and send your Excellency, soon as possible, the 
one hundred half Johannes they order.* You will 
observe Mr. Clymer, Mr. Walton, and myself are ap 
pointed a Committee to transact the Continental busi 
ness here, that may be necessary and proper ; and I 
apprehend that it will frequently be necessary that 
we should know the substance of your correspond 
ence with Congress.! Your letters to the President, 
if sent open under our cover, shall always meet des 
patch, and their contents kept secret; and when you 
think it improper we should see them before the 
Congress, seal them, and they shall go forward un 
touched ; and, if you do not approve of submitting 
them to our inspection at all, write us freely, and 
your wishes in that respect shall be complied with. 

We have just heard of your success at Trenton. 
The account is but imperfect ; but we learn you are 
master of that place, and all the baggage and stores 
our enemy had there, and of three hundred prison 
ers^ and that your troops were still in pursuit of the 



Howe, and inquire in what manner General Lee, who has been taken 
prisoner, is treated ; and, if he finds that he is not treated agreeably to 
his rank and character, to send a remonstrance to General Howe on 
the subject; and further to inquire of General Howe, whether he will 
grant permission to send General Lee such supplies of money as may 
be necessary to support him, during his confinement, in a manner suit 
able to his rank in the service of the United States."

the 13th of December, and was taken to New York. See Sparks s

flying enemy. I have just wrote to Congress, and 
told them thus much, as the substance of an account 
just come down; and I told them further, I had been 
informed that you had executed in this matter your 
part of a well-concerted plan; that General Heath,- at 
llackensack, had orders from you, and that General 
Ewing and Colonel Cadwalader, also, had orders to 
cross the Delaware at the same time you did, but 
had been prevented by driving ice. 

Good news sets all the animal spirits to work. 
The imagination is heated, and I could not help add 
ing, that I expected General Heath was to continue 
his march towards Brunswick, which would draw the 
attention of any troops posted there and at Prince 
ton, while you would pursue the flying heroes to 
Bordentown and Burlington, where Ewing and Cad 
walader would stop them, and cut off their com 
munication with the two thousand Hessians and 
Highlanders, that came after Griffin ; nay, I almost 
promised them that you should, by following up this 
first blow, finish the campaign of 1776 with that 
eclat that your numerous friends and admirers have 
long wished for. I congratulate you most heartily on 
what is done ; and am, with perfect esteem, dear Sir, 
Your Excellency s most obedient servant,

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 313 

FROM GENERAL CADWALADER. 

Burlington, 10 o clock, 27 December, 1776. 

SIR, 

As I did not hear from you this morning, and be 
ing prepared to embark, I concluded you were still 
on this side, and therefore embarked, and landed 
about fifteen hundred men about two miles above 
Bristol. After a considerable number were landed, 
I had information from the Paymaster of Colonel 
Hitchcock s brigade, that you had crossed over from 
Trenton. This defeated the scheme of joining your 
army. We were much embarrassed which way to 
proceed. I thought it most prudent to retreat; but 
Colonel Reed was of opinion that we might safely 
proceed to Burlington, and recommended it warmly, 
lest it should have a bad effect on the militia, who 
were twice disappointed. The landing in open day 
light must have alarmed the enemy, and we might 
have been cut off by all their force collected to this 
place. We had intelligence, immediately afterward, 
that the enemy had left the Black Horse and Mount 
Hollcy. Upon this we determined to proceed to Bur 
lington. 

Colonel Reed and two other officers went on, from 
one point to another, till they came to Bordentown, 
where they found the coast clear. Colonel Reed and 
Colonel Coxe are now there, and we shall march, at 
four to-morrow morning, for that place. This inform 
ation has induced me to proceed, though not quite 
conformable to your orders, which I received on the 
march this afternoon. If you should think proper to 
cross over, it may be easily effected at the place 
where we passed. A pursuit would keep up the 
panic.

They went off with great precipitation, and pressed 
all the wagons in their reach. I am told many of 
them are gone to South Amboy. If we can drive 
them from West Jersey, the success will raise an 
army by next spring, and establish the credit of the 
Continental money to support it. I shall write to- 
morroAv, I hope, from Trenton. I am, Sir, 

Your most obedient, very humble servant, 

JOHN CADWALADER. 

P. S. I have two six-pounders, brass, and two 
three-pounders, iron. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL MIFFLIN* 

Bristol, Saturday evening, 8 o clock, 
28 December, 1776. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

The inclosed I have this minute received from an 
express sent by my order to General Cadwalader. 
The General, not knowing that I was here, did not 
write to me, and as I supposed the contents of im 
portance in my movements, I took the liberty to 
open the letter, for which I must plead only the 
occasion in excuse. 

I came here at four o clock this afternoon. Five 
hundred men, sent from Philadelphia yesterday, crossed 
to Burlington this morning. This evening I sent 
over near three hundred more. To-morrow seven or 
eight hundred shall follow. I will cross in the morn 
ing, and endeavour to form them into regiments, and 
a brigade. They consist of many different corps, and 
want much regulation. 

If your Excellency has any orders for me, other 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 315 

than to join General Cadwalader as soon as possible, 
please to favor me with such as are necessary, and I 
will punctually obey them. Pennsylvania is at length 
roused, and coming in great numbers to your Excel 
lency s aid. Mr. Hall will return with your orders. 
I am informed that we cannot cross at Bordentown, 
nor at any place between that place and this. I 
have no doubt of effecting it here, having sent from 
Philadelphia in the morning several fine boats, which 
are now here. 

I most heartily congratulate your Excellency on 
your late capital stroke, and wish most ardently a 
repetition. I am, with great affection and attachment, 
Your Excellency s obedient servant, 

THOMAS MIFFLIN. 



FROM ROBERT MORRIS. 

Philadelphia, 30 December, 1776. 

SIR, 

I have just received your favor of this day, and 
sent to General Putnam to detain the express until 
I collect the hard money you want, which you may 
depend shall be sent, in one specie or other, with this 
letter, and a list thereof shall be inclosed herein. 

I had long since parted with very considerable 
sums of hard money to Congress; therefore must col 
lect from others, and, as matters now stand, it is no 
easy matter. I mean to borrow silver, and promise 
payment in gold, and will then collect the gold in 
the best manner I can. Whilst on this subject, let 
me inform you that there are upwards of twenty 
thousand dollars in silver at Ticonderoga. They have 



316 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

no particular use for it, and I think you might as 
well send a party to bring it away, and lodge it in 
a safe place convenient for any purposes for which 
it may hereafter be wanted. 

I gave Mr. Commissary Wharton an order for forty 
thousand dollars this morning, and pressed him to at 
tend most diligently to your supplies. I will send 
for him again, know what is done, and add springs 
to his movements, if I can. I wish he was more 
silent, prudent, &c. : but I fancy he is active. What 
ever I can do shall be done for the good of the ser 
vice. I ever am, dear Sir, 

Your Excellency s obedient, humble servant, 

ROBERT MORRIS. 

P. S. Hearing that you are in want of a quarter 
cask of wine, I have procured a good one, which Mr. 
Commissary Wharton will send up. 



FROM ROBERT MORRIS. 

Philadelphia, 1 January, 1777. 

SIR, 

I was honored with your favor of yesterday by 
Mr. Ho well, late last night, and, ever solicitous to 
comply with your requisitions, I am up very early 
this morning to despatch a supply of fifty thousand 
dollars to your Excellency. You will receive that 
sum with this letter; but it will not be got away so 
early as I could wish, for none concerned in this 
movement, except myself, are up. I shall rouse them 
immediately. It gives me great pleasure that you 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 317 

have engaged the troops to continue, and if further 
occasional supplies of money are necessary, you may 
depend on my exertions either in a public or private 
capacity. 

The year 1776 is over. I am heartily glad of it, 
and hope you nor America will ever be plagued with 
such another. Let us accept the success at Trenton 
as a presage of future fortunate events; and under 
that impression, I do most sincerely wish you a suc 
cessful campaign in 1777, to crown you with immor 
tal honors, in reward of the dangers and fatigues of 
war; and that you may, for many, many years after, 
enjoy the sweets of peace and domestic happiness, in 
reward of your social virtues. With sincere esteem 
and regard, I ever am, Sir, 

Your obedient servant, 

ROBERT MORRIS. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Baltimore, 1 January, 1777. 

SIR, 

I am to acknowledge the receipt of your several 
favors, to the 27th ultimo. Your letter of that date, 
containing the very agreeable intelligence of the suc 
cess of the Continental arms under your command, 
was last night delivered to me by your Aid-de-camp, 
Colonel Baylor, together with the Hessian standard. 
I entertain the most pleasing expectation that our 
affairs will henceforth assume a better complexion. 
Your account of the behaviour and spirit of the 
troops, gave the highest satisfaction to Congress; and 
27* 



318 LETTEKS TO WASHINGTON. 

manifests a disposition which may prove the fore 
runner of future success. 

Considering the unfavorable temper of the men, 
broken by fatigue and ill fortune, the happy event 
of the expedition appears the more extraordinary. 
But troops properly inspired, and animated by a just 
confidence in their leader, will often exceed expecta 
tion, or the limits of probability. As it is entirely 
to your wisdom and conduct the United States are 
indebted for the late success of their arms, the plea 
sure you must naturally feel on the occasion will be 
pure and unmixed. May you still proceed in the 
same manner to acquire that glory, which, by your 
disinterested and magnanimous behaviour, you so 
highly merit. 

I inclose to you a copy of resolves transmitted to 
General Schuyler, relative to the Northern Depart 
ment, and also sundry other resolves relative to your 
own immediate department, which are all the Con 
gress have come into since I wrote you last. I have 
fonvarded to all the States copies of the resolves, 
vesting you with the powers which I had the pleasure 
of transmitting in my last, accompanied with letters 
explaining the reasons on which Congress acted in 
that particular.* 

From the inclosed resolve, you will perceive Con 
gress have determined, that a horse, properly capari 
soned, be presented to your Aid-de-camp, Colonel 
Baylor, and to recommend it to you to promote him 
to be a Colonel of a regiment of Light Horse. As 
the Congress have been pleased to intrust me with 



* See the letter and resolves, here alluded to, in Washington s Writ 
ings, Vol. IV. p. 550. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 319 

the execution of this resolve, I must beg you will 
do me the favor to give directions to the Quarter 
master, or other proper person, to purchase as hand 
some a horse, for this purpose, as can be found. The 
reason of my making this application, is an informa 
tion I had received, that some Light Horse were 
taken at Trenton, and are to be publicly sold for 
the benefit of the soldiery. Should this be the case, 
I must further ask the favor of you to give direc 
tions at the same time to purchase one or two for 
my own use. The money shall be immediately re 
mitted, whatever it may be. I should be glad to 
know what kind of horse furniture you think the 
most proper, as I would, by all means, wish to pro 
cure the best; but, without your advice and assist 
ance, I am apprehensive I shall not succeed. If the 
horses are to be had, be pleased to order them to 
be sent to me, and every expense shall be paid 
arising thereon. 

This recommendation of Colonel Baylor, I doubt 
not, will meet with your approbation, and that, on 
his return from Virginia, you will give him a com 
mission, with such pay as you shall think suitable 
and adequate. 

Wishing you, very sincerely, the compliments of 
the season, I have the honor to be, with every sen 
timent of esteem and regard, Sir, 

Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
JOHN HANCOCK, President. 

P. S. I shall send you the letter-books by the 
first safe hand. By this opportunity, I send you four 
bundles, containing two hundred commissions ; the rest 
shall immediately follow. 



320 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN.* 

Peekskill, 4 January, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I have just arrived here; find only part of two 
regiments of the militia, from the Massachusetts. The 
badness of the roads hath much retarded the troops. 
I have left some of our best officers at different posts 
to forward them, and provide every necessary to faci 
litate their march. I flatter myself, from the provi 
sion that hath been made and is now making, that 
the time will not be long, nor the period distant, 
when they shall rendezvous at your Excellency s 
head-quarters, wherever they may be, or such other 
place to which they may be ordered. Nothing shall 
be neglected, in my power, speedily to effect this. 

Soon after advice was forwarded to your Excel 
lency by Mr. Bowdoin, that the State of Massachu 
setts Bay had ordered out about six thousand of 
their militia, to reenforce the Continental army, the 
General Court were informed, by General Schuyler, 
that the time for which the men, doing duty at Ti- 
conderoga, engaged to serve, was near expiring; and 
that the forts there would, in all probability, be left 
in a short time too defenceless, unless they could be 
reenforced by the militia; the consequence of which 
might be extremely injurious to the cause of America. 
He therefore urged the Massachusetts to send him 
at Albany some of their militia, in the most pressing 
and energetic terms, in order that he might succour 



* General Lincoln, at this time, had command of the Massachusetts 
militia. lie was appointed a Major-General in the Continental army 
on the 19th of February following. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 321 

those forts, if he should find it necessary. The Court 
thereon ordered two of their most western regiments 
to march directly for Albany. 

In consequence of an application from the Commis 
sioners assembled at Providence from the New Eng 
land States, appointed, among other things, to adopt 
measures for the immediate defence of the State of 
Rhode Island, and the neighbouring States, the Court 
of Massachusetts Bay have halted in that State the 
men raised to reenforce the Continental army in the 
counties of Plymouth, Barnstable, and Bristol, which 
will amount to ten or eleven hundred. The remain 
der, from the best returns I can obtain, will a little 
exceed four thousand, officers included. 

I left Providence last Monday, in the forenoon. 
There were no late accounts from the Island of Rhode 
Island. A few days before, some ships, to the num 
ber of ten or twelve, had left it and gone up the 
Sound. Whether they had troops on board, or not, 
we could not learn. The accounts, with regard to the 
number of troops on the Island, are so various that 
no good judgment can be formed. Some positively 
affirm that there are not more than three thousand 
five hundred, others, with as much assurance, declare 
that there are nine thousand. From the best inform 
ation I could obtain at Bristol and Rowland s Ferry, 
their numbers do not much exceed, if any, five thou 
sand men. Indeed, I have sometimes doubted, from 
their manoeuvres, whether they amount to that number. 
I am, with the most perfect regard and esteem, Sir, 
Your most obedient, humble servant, 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 



322 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Baltimore, 6 January, 1777. 

SIR, 

The inclosed resolves, which I have the honor of 
transmitting, call for your immediate attention ; and I 
am to request you will take measures in pursuance 
thereof, as soon as possible. General Lee s situation 
seems to be extremely dangerous and critical, and 
from General Howe s behaviour to him, it is highly 
probable he will be brought to a trial for desertion. 
General Lee, it is said by Mr. Eustace, his Aid-de 
camp, having addressed tAvo letters to General Howe, 
received them both back again, unopened, and inclos 
ed under a cover directed to Lieutenant- Colonel Lee. 
I hope the flag, which Congress ordered to be sent 
to make inquiry into the manner in which he was 
treated, has been despatched, and a remonstrance, in 
consequence of it, should the information you have 
received of his treatment have rendered that step 
necessary. 

You will please to propose an exchange of the six 
Hessian field-officers for him; and at the same time 
make inquiry whether the report which Congress have 
heard of Mrs. Stockton s being confined in a common 
jail by the enemy, has any truth in it or not. 

By a letter, which Congress yesterday received from 
Mr. Morris, we are informed that General Cadwalader, 
with the troops under him, had joined your army; 
that the enemy were at Trenton; that the two armies 
were divided only by a creek; and that a general 
engagement was hourly expected. In the mean time 
Congress are infinitely anxious to hear the event, 
and humbly hope that victory has declared in favor 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 323 

of those whose sacred cause should inspire them with 
ardor, on every solemn appeal to that Being who 
hateth all injustice, tyranny, and oppression. I have 
the honor to be, with every sentiment of respect, Sir, 
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK, President. 

P. S. If the desire of Congress to procure General 
Lee s exchange cannot be effected, and the enemy, 
preferring the gratification of revenge to the civility 
they owe their Hessian auxiliaries, determine to keep 
or to abuse him, it will be very agreeable to Congress 
that their determination, with the inclosed resolve, be 
made known to the Hessians as fully as possible. 
To secure General Lee as effectually as may be from 
personal insult and injury, Congress have come to the 
present resolution; which you, Sir, are desired to con 
vey to General Howe, with all convenient despatch. 
It will be very agreeable to Congress, that the Hes 
sian field-officer intended to be exchanged for Colonel 
Ethan Allen, be sent to notify it to General Howe, 
taking his parole to return in a fixed time, if Colonel 
Allen is not returned in his place. It will fall with 
in the wish of Congress, if Colonel Rahl, or one of 
the Hessian officers, should be also sent with the flag 
proposing the exchange of General Lee ; but the pro 
priety of it is submitted to you. 

We have had an imperfect account of the engage 
ment at Trenton, and anxiously wait for further par 
ticulars. It was in hopes of receiving them that I 
detained the express till this morning. 



124 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 



FROM ROBERT MORRIS, GEORGE CLYMER, AND GEORGE 
WALTON.* 

Philadelphia, 7 January, 1777. 

SIR, 

We were this day honored with your favor of the 
5th instant, which arrived in time to forward the in- 
closures by post. We waited, with impatience, to 
learn the consequence of your late movements, and 
have been highly gratified; at the same time, we see 
plainly some important event is still to happen. The 
enemy must mean to evacuate the Jerseys, or give 
you battle. The latter may be ruinous in its conse 
quences to either party, and therefore it is probable 
will only be sought for by those that have the supe 
riority. This, we fondly hope, will fall to your lot, if 
joined by General Heath and General McDougall, 
and the Jersey militia, as we are taught to expect 
will be the case. Should they lo&o a battle, or evacu 
ate Jersey, surely they cannot afterwards make out 
a decent paragraph for Gaines s infamous paper, after 
being outgeneralled and obliged to abandon the coun 
try they thought themselves securely possessed of. 

Your Excellency will find inclosed a paper herein, 
drawn up by a Captain Gamble, lately a prisoner on 
board the fleet in New York. He declares that the 
treatment of both sea and land prisoners, in that 



* Congress adjourned from Philadelphia to Baltimore on the 12th of 
December, and assembled in the latter city on the 20th. The following 
resolution was passed on the 21st: "That Robert Morris, George Cly- 
mcr, and George Walton, Esquires, be a Committee of Congress, with 
powers to execute such Continental business as may be proper and 
necessary to be done at Philadelphia." 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 325 

place, is shocking to humanity. This man deserves 
credit, and his account of their ill usage is confirmed 
by all the prisoners that come from thence. As to 
the information that he gives at the bottom of his 
paper, he says he will forfeit his life if every tittle 
of it is not as near to the truth as possible for an 
inquisitive man, in his situation, to come at. We 
think this would be a good time to remonstrate to 
General Howe and Lord Howe against the base usage 
our people meet with, and to threaten immediate re 
taliation on the British prisoners in our possession, if 
they do not alter their conduct. 

It is probable General Howe may say it is con 
trary to orders, and not with his knowledge, if our 
people suffer; but this is not sufficient. Our poor 
soldiers and sailors are perishing for want of food, 
fresh air, and cleanliness, whilst those of theirs, in 
our possession, are feasting on the fat of this land. 
They have said we treat them well through fear. It 
is time to convince them we are not afraid, although 
we are actuated by principles of humanity. But those 
principles HOAV dictate the necessity of severe usage 
to British officers in particular, that they may here 
after make it a point, for their own sakes, to see 
proper care taken of those that fall within their 
power. 

Depend on it, good Sir, we do not write in this 
style to gratify any feelings of our own. They are 
all repugnant to what we propose. Lieutenant Josiah 
has just called on us, and confirms the account of ill 
usage, &c. He says he was exchanged for Lieutenant 
Ball, and that no person has been given up for Lieu 
tenant Boger, now in New York. There is a Captain 
Burke, that was formerly Captain Manly s Lieutenant 
in his successful cruise. Burke succeeded to the com-

mand of Manly s vessel; was taken by the Liverpool 
frigate, to which Mr. Boger belongs; and Captain 
Bellen sent Burke to New York for the express pur 
pose of having him exchanged for Boger; and, as he 
is said to be a very good officer, has been ill used, 
and suffered a good deal, we dare say your Excel 
lency will demand his release by the first flag. We 
have the honor to be, Sir, 

Your Excellency s obedient servants,

FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL ARNOLD. 

Providence, 13 January, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

Yesterday I arrived here, having previously done 
all in my power to forward on the militia from the 
Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut, upwards of six 
thousand of which I hope are in the Jerseys before 
this time. 

There are, at this place and in the vicinity, about two 
thousand men, part of six thousand ordered from the 
New England States. The others are on their march, 
and expected in, in a few days. The enemy s force on 
Rhode Island, by the best intelligence, is five or six 
thousand; one half foreigners, and some few invalids. 
We are informed, by several persons who left New 
port within a few days, that General Clinton is going 
home in the Asia, and has sent his baggage on board, 
and that the troops have orders to hold themselves 
in readiness to embark at a minute s notice, perhaps 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 327 

for New York. I believe they have no intention of 
penetrating the country at present. I beg leave, 
though late, to congratulate your Excellency on 
your success at Trenton. It was a most happy 
stroke, and has greatly raised the sinking spirits of 
the country. 

We this minute have advice, by a letter from Go 
vernor Trurnbull, of your further success near Prince 
ton; and report says, Generals Putnam and Miffliri 
have killed and taken two regiments near Bristol. 
We believe this true, as the intelligence comes from 
Newport.* People in general are in high spirits. 
This seems a most favorable crisis to dislodge the 
enemy from the country. Heaven grant your Excel 
lency may be able to effect it, and may peace and 
laurels crown your successes ! 

About twelve or fifteen hundred of the enemy are 
dispersed in all the farm-houses on Rhode Island. As 
soon as the militia arrives, I hope we shall be able 
to give a good account of some of them. 

I beg leave to recommend to your Excellency, Cap 
tain Samuel Mansfield, to command a company of 
artillery. He was a Lieutenant of artillery last sum 
mer in the Northern Department, and afterwards Cap 
tain of a galley in two actions, and behaved with 
great prudence and bravery. Being anxious to con 
tinue in the service, and much wanted here, I have 
desired him to engage a number of men. If your 
Excellency should think proper to appoint him, his 
company will be soon filled up, and I dare be respon 
sible for his conduct. 

A Quartermaster is much wanted here. One is ap-

pointed by the State for their own troops, but they 
are not able to furnish him with cash. I am, clear 
General, 

Your most obedient, humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HEATH. 

Williams s Tavern, 19 January, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I have just received the honor of yours of the 
14th and 17th instant. 

Yesterday morning, about sunrise, our troops, in 
three divisions, arrived in the neighbourhood of Fort 
Independence ; the right division by the Albany 
Road, the centre by Stephen Ward s, and the left 
by East Chester. Upon our approach, the enemy 
fled to Fort Independence, leaving fifteen muskets at 
one place, and ten at another, besides blankets, &c. 

I summoned the fort to surrender. I have taken 
the liberty to inclose a copy. The answer to the 
summons was verbal, and in substance, that, as the 
Americans were excepted, they, although Britons, had 
no answer to return. They afterwards fired a num 
ber of cannon at us from the fort, which we re 
turned. We are just informed, by two deserters from 
the fort, that the garrison consists of about three 
hundred and fifty men ; that the last night they had 
.a twelve-pounder sent to the fort, and that General 
Agnew moved up yesterday with his brigade^ and 
took post at the northernmost woody hill, between 
Fort Washington and King s Bridge, and about twelve 
hundred Hessians near the fort. Between two and 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 329 

three hundred Hessians are in the houses just over 
the bridge. 

We took one light-horseman, with horse complete, 
and one soldier, and have had one man killed by a 
cannon ball this day. To-morrow we intend to make 
an attack upon the Hessians at the bridge, if they 
should not be reenforced. They have two pieces of 
cannon well posted. Our troops are all militia, and, 
although perhaps as good as any militia, yet they 
are not disciplined. Our numbers are about three 
thousand, but they begin to go home already. The 
want of covering, the weather cold, &c., causes many 
complaints. Much will depend on the success of our 
attack to-morrow. 

I have approved of the sentence of the court-mar 
tial on Strang, and have ordered him to be executed 
on Wednesday next at eleven o clock before noon. 

A Hessian Major, son of one of their Generals, 
commands Fort Independence. I have the honor to 
be, very respectfully, 

Your Excellency s most humble servant, 

WILLIAM HEATH. 



FROM WILLIAM DUER. 
Camp in Westehester Comity, 28 January, 1777. 

I beg leave to introduce to your Excellency s ac 
quaintance Mr. Sacket, a member of the Convention 
of the State, a man of honor, and of firm attachment 
to the American cause. 

He will communicate to your Excellency some 
measures taken by him and myself, which, if pro 
perly prosecuted, may be of infinite utility to the pre 
sent military operations. I have, therefore, recom- 
28* 



330 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

mended it to him to wait on you in person, in hopes 
that some systematical plan may be adopted and pro 
secuted for facilitating your manoeuvres against the 
British army. 

To say more in a letter, might be imprudent, I 
shall, therefore, content myself with observing, that 
Mr. Sacket is, as I know by experience, a person 
of intrigue and secrecy, well calculated to prosecute 
such measures as you shall think conducive to give 
success to your generous exertions in the cause of 
America. 

Your Excellency Avill likewise receive from Mr. 
Sacket a confidential account of our operations in 
this quarter. I wish I could say they had been con 
ducted in such a manner as to create, either a diver 
sion in favor of the army in Jersey, or, at least, to 
drive the enemy from this county. On the contrary, 
it is obvious to every discerning person, that we 
have been insulted by a handful of traitorous ban 
ditti, and that we run a risk of either being routed or 
cut off by a night surprise, or of abandoning this 
part of the country with disgrace. 

As I have been appointed, by the Convention of 
the State of New York, a member of a Committee 
for cooperating in the design formed by your Excel 
lency for driving the enemy from this quarter, I 
esteem it my duty to inform you, that I have no 
manner of doubt but it has been in our power to 
cut off the communication of Fort Independence with 
York Island, and to make ourselves masters of the 
garrison, with a loss noways proportionable to the 
benefits which would inevitably result from such a 
measure. This is still in our power; but how long 
it will continue so, I will not pretend to determine. 
Certain I am, that, unless a decisive and systematic 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 331 

plan is devised and prosecuted in a very short time, 
your success will be counterbalanced by our disgrace ; 
that many good officers and men, who have come 
down as volunteers, will return home; that the mili 
tia, should any come in, will grow languid ; that our 
enemies will triumph ; and that the timid Whigs, who 
have been roused from their late lethargy or despair, 
from your Excellency s successful efforts, will either 
relapse into the same supineness, or take an active 
part with our enemies. 

It would be needless and impertinent in me to 
point out to your Excellency the very great advan 
tages, which would result from our making ourselves 
masters of this county. I shall only content myself 
with observing that, if no other purposes were to be 
answered by this expedition but those of laying up 
magazines of forage for the next campaign, the rais 
ing of recruits for the Continental army, and prevent 
ing the disaffected from taking part with the enemy, 
it is an object worthy our greatest exertions. 

Brigadier-General Parsons, who came down with us 
from Peekskill, is gone to Connecticut, not choosing, 
as I conceive, to run the risk of his reputation by 
a longer stay here. Colonel Dubois, who has come 
down with the York militia as a volunteer, and who 
has repeatedly offered his service to destroy King s 
Bridge, will, I fear, return to-morrow, despairing to 
see any thing effectual done. 

Should your Excellency wish to know to what our 
want of success is to be attributed, I must beg leave 
to refer to your own judgment of the character of 
men; observing only that it is my private opinion 
that, if measures could be devised, without injuring 
the public service, that either General Mifflin, General 
Parsons, or General Clinton, could direct our opera- 



332 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

tions in this part of the county of Westchester, that 
the enemy would not only be driven from this coun 
ty, but other measures might probably be devised for 
pushing our success and harassing the enemy. At 
the request of General Heath, I devised means of 
his obtaining the best intelligence of the enemy s 
strength and disposition. Would to heaven we had 
profited by it! I write with an aching heart, and in 
a great hurry, so that your Excellency will excuse 
both my freedom and inaccuracy. I have long in 
tended to return; but shall wait the return of Mr. 
Sacket, in hopes that some more regular counsels 
may be formed, and more vigorous measures prose 
cuted, in this quarter. 

As I am informed that your Excellency is raising 
several new battalions, the officers of which are to be 
of your appointment, I beg leave to inform you that 
Mr. John Livingston, a son of Mr. Robert Livingston, 
lord of the manor of that name, is anxious to enter 
the service in a regiment to be commanded by gen 
tlemen. He is a young gentleman of a high spirit, 
of honor, and undoubted bravery. I have, therefore, 
no doubt but he will raise his own reputation, and 
do justice to your appointment, if you should think 
proper to give him the offer of a Lieutenant-Colonel s 
commission. I beg to know from your Excellency 
whether my application can be complied with. It is 
with great reluctance I ever venture to recommend; 
but I know this young gentleman so well, that I 
will risk my reputation upon his behaving himself 
with distinguished resolution, should he have an op 
portunity of embracing the military profession. I am, 
with great respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

WILLIAM DUER. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 333 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HEATH. 

Burling s, near Ward s, 30 January, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I have just received the honor of yours of the 
27th instant. The last evening we moved back from 
the neighbourhood of King s Bridge ; General Lin 
coln s troops to Dobbs s Ferry and Tarrytown ; the 
Connecticut militia, to New Rochelle; and the York 
militia, towards White Plains. This remove was for 
the following reasons. 

We could not reduce the fort by cannonade, being 
destitute of proper artillery. As to taking of it by 
storm, it is surrounded by chevaux-de-frise, hooked to 
gether; yet I think it might have been taken, if we 
had been so happy as to have had a few Continental 
troops. But our army is all militia, and your Excel 
lency well knows that they are by no means ade 
quate to such an enterprise. The houses in the vi 
cinity are so scattered, that the troops were every 
hour exposed to surprise, if the enemy should make 
a sudden sally, or continually harassed by keeping 
out large guards exposed, in the open air, to the in 
clemency of the season ; and, as there remained little 
or no probability of success, either against the fort 
or island, and the principal object now being to col 
lect the forage, protect the well-disposed, and curb 
the disaffected, the Generals who were present in 
council, namely, Lincoln, Wooster, Ten Broeck, and 
Scott, were unanimously of opinion that, as the be 
fore-mentioned purposes could be as well answered 
by the troops falling back, as remaining so near the 
fort, and many inconveniences avoided, the manoeuvre 
was advisable; and it was accordingly made. 



334 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

We have collected considerable quantities of forage. 
At present, it is stored at Kingstreet and Wright s 
Mills. Large quantities are still uncollected. 

The person who lately brought me intelligence from 
the city has,, since I wrote your Excellency, men 
tioned one piece which, if true (and he thinks it is), 
is very extraordinary, namely, that General Carletons 
army formed a junction with Howe s before the army 
went into the Jerseys ; and that a small garrison 
only is left at Quebec. It is reported here, and 
gains credit, that the enemy have burnt Newport and 
left Rhode Island.* 

Daniel Strang was executed at Peekskill, on Mon 
day last, agreeably to his sentence. The Tories gave 
out that we dare not hang him. I have the honor 
to be 

Your Excellency s most humble servant, 

W. HEATH. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL ARNOLD. 

Providence, 31 January, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

By the best intelligence we have been able to pro 
cure of the enemy s force on Rhode Island, it con 
sisted of about six thousand men; eleven regiments 
of British, and four of Hessians. Two thousand em 
barked the 21st instant, in twenty-four transports, and 
sailed from Newport three days since, supposed for 
New York, as they were seen off New London, Part 



* All these reports were unfounded, except that a part of the enemy 
had sailed from Newport. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 335 

of the remainder, believed about fifteen hundred, are 
disposed over the Island in seeming great security. 
They have a small fort opposite Bristol Ferry, and 
are raising a work opposite Fogland Ferry. One of 
their frigates was lately drove from thence, and was 
yesterday replaced by a fifty-gun ship and two tend 
ers, which we are preparing to attack, by guns on 
shore, and our galleys, which are ordered down. 

At a Council of General Officers, held a few days 
since, it was advised to land a body of eight thou 
sand men (if they can be procured) on Rhode Island, 
and attack the enemy in the following manner, name 
ly; Five thousand men, with proper artillery, to em 
bark at Rowland s Ferry and land nearly opposite 
Fogland Ferry, and to take post on a high ground, 
under cover of a thick wood, on the middle of the 
Island, six miles this side of Newport. Three thou 
sand men to embark at Bristol and Rowland s Ferry, 
and attack the enemy in the different posts, a diver 
sion to be made by a party from Seconnet, who are 
to land three miles from Newport. At the same 
time, two fire-ships are to be sent into Newport 
among the transports; two frigates and two galleys 
are to be placed between Bristol and Rowland s Fer 
ry, which, with the batteries, will effectually secure 
our retreat. We are making every necessary prepa 
ration of boats, artillery, &c., which will be complete 
in two or three weeks. Nothing will be wanting but 
men. We have, at present, only four thousand. Not 
more than one thousand more (of the six ordered) 
can be expected. With this number, as they are 
chiefly raw militia, I believe your Excellency will not 
think it prudent for us to make a general attack. 
The deficiency I know of no way of making up but 
by calling in four or five Continental regiments from 



336 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

the States of Massachusetts Bay and New Hampshire. 
If this number can be procured, we have a good pros 
pect of dislodging the enemy from Newport; if not, 
we must be content to harass them with small par 
ties. I suppose Major-General Spencer has wrote 
your Excellency very particularly on the subject, and 
will wait for your directions in the matter. 

This will be delivered to your Excellency by Cap 
tain Mansfield, whom, I recommended, in my last as 
a proper person to command a company of artillery. 
If your Excellency should think proper to appoint 
him, I beg the favor that he may be allowed to re 
turn here immediately. I am, with sentiments of 
great respect and esteem, Dear General, 

Your affectionate and most obedient, 
Humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 

P. S. I have inclosed a plan of Rhode Island and 
the adjacent country, by which you will observe the 
great difficulty of coining at the enemy, and the ne 
cessity of having a superior force, if we land on the 
Island. B. A. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HEATIi. 

Westchester, 6 February, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

The last evening I received the honor of yours of 
the 3d and 4th instant, which has given me great 
pain. Perhaps I may venture to say, that no officer 
is more attentive to orders or more anxious to carry 
them into execution, than I am. When I received 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 337 

your Excellency s orders to march towards King s 
Bridge, nothing could be more agreeable than the 
manoeuvre ; but I cannot say the taking the com 
mand of a body of troops, entirely militia, was so. 
It w r as indeed far otherwise. Before I received your 
Excellency s orders to move myself towards King s 
Bridge, upon the application of the Committee of the 
State of New York, I appointed General Parsons to 
take the command of the troops destined for their 
secret expedition. He gave me his answer in writ 
ing, accepting the command in obedience to orders, 
but, at the same time, desiring that his answer might 
remain in writing, that it might appear, that although 
he cheerfully obeyed orders, yet that he considered 
the taking the command of a body of militia for 
such an attempt, to use his own words, as a sacrifice 
of his character. By your Excellency s orders to me, 
his has escaped, but it seems mine is to receive the 
fatal stab. As I feel myself much interested in this 
matter, your Excellency will bear with me to be a lit 
tle explicit, and to recapitulate the whole expedition. 
Upon my arrival before the fort, I summoned the 
\ garrison to surrender, as your Excellency is sensible 
is the practice on the first investing of a place ; and 
this in particular I did at the motion of a gentleman 
before I left Peekskill, as it was supposed the garri 
son consisted of Hessian troops ; and, from some pre 
ceding circumstances, it might answer a very good 
purpose. And although some of the enemy may 
laugh at a fort being summoned, and not taken, I 
believe they will scarcely publish the summons. Af 
ter this I called a Council of War, as I did in every 
instance of importance during our continuance before 
the fort, and in every one of them the Council were 
unanimous. I have taken the liberty to inclose one 
VOL. i. 29 



338 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

of them, to wit, that preceding our remove, by which 
your Excellency will perceive that the landing of 
Lord Percy, to surround us, was not so much as men 
tioned. 

The facts were briefly these. The troops were 
scattered in a circle of more than eiffht miles. We 

o 

had tried to hut them, but the rain, preceding our 
remove, had driven four of General Lincoln s regi 
ments from their huts, with the loss of nearly all 
their ammunition. The enemy had sallied, early one 
morning, and surprised one of our out-guards. The 
regiment nearest the place were struck with a panic, 
and had quitted their quarters, leaving their baggage. 
The troops were so scattered as not to be collected 
in less than two or three hours ; in which case, those 
who were quartered within cannon shot of the fort, 
as was the case, would be entirely cut to pieces be 
fore they could be supported. A diffidence and un 
easiness were discovered in even the bravest officers. 
In such a situation, and a universal desire to get 
more advantageously quartered, every officer objected 
to a storm, as they apprehended the militia inade 
quate to such an enterprise. Every purpose, it was 
supposed, would be, and has been ^answered, by the 
troops in their present cantonment, except that of 
reducing the fort. 

lS T o officer could be more anxious to effect some 
thing to purpose than I have been during the expe 
dition here, or more harassed, perplexed, and fatigued, 
with an undisciplined militia ; and if, after all this, 
and having taken every step agreeably to the result 
in the Councils of War, I am to be censured, it is 
truly discouraging. However, if there has been error 
in judgment, we have all been in the dark, except 
some who may be distinguished for their sense and 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 339 

judgment. But, if I am not mistaken in them, their 
military propositions, in some instances, have been as 
laughable as my summons may be. It is not uncom 
mon for those unacquainted with military operations 
to expect as much from undisciplined as disciplined 
troops, if their numbers are considerable ; but, in our 
present case, the officers of artillery, one and all, in 
formed me, that they could not be accountable for 
the artillery, if they were to be covered with militia; 
and every officer, acquainted with service, was wishing 
for a few Continental troops, when our conquest would 
have been easy. 

I thank your Excellency for your secret admoni 
tion, but must entreat that you would be pleased to 
let me know who were your Excellency s informers, 
as you were pleased to mention that they were some 
who have been with me. I think, what your Excel 
lency is pleased to mention with respect to the fo 
rage, we are pursuing. I am a little at a loss for your 
final determination, as to my conduct here. In your 
letter of the 3d instant, you are pleased to direct 
that, after fixing a number of troops in this quarter 
and at Peekskill, the remainder should immediately 
march forward and join you; and in your letter of 
the 4th, you are pleased to advise some further at 
tempts on the fort. The last night I ordered a large 
scouting party to march, at one o clock this morning, 
from Ward s, to surprise the out-guards near Fort 
Independence, and attempt whatever might appear 
practicable. I have not as yet heard from them. I 
had yesterday ordered some of the troops lower 
down, and to take quarters below "Ward s. I shall 
immediately endeavour to make the necessary ar 
rangement directed by your Excellency, and shall, in 
obedience to your orders, consult Colonel Duer; other- 



340 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

wise I should not do it in military matters, although 
I much esteem him for his good sense and judgment 
in other affairs. It will, most probably, be several 
days before the troops can move, in which time I 
hope to hear again from you; and in the mean time 
I can assure your Excellency, they shall not be idle. 
I thank your Excellency for the leave you have 
been pleased to grant me to ride to New England. 
Nothing but necessity could have induced me to soli 
cit the favor. I shall endeavour to return in about 
four weeks from the time that I leave Peekskill, 
which will give me about two weeks at home. I 
have the honor to be, 

Your Excellency s most humble servant, 

WILLIAM HEATH. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL SCOTT. 

Fishkill, 14 February, 1777. 

SIR, 

Permit me to acknowledge the receipt of your fa 
vor by Mr. Sacket, by which I esteem myself much 
honored. I wish I had it in my power to give you 
a favorable account of our little expedition, which I 
imagine would have been successful beyond expecta 
tion, had it not been for certain reasons. When I 
found that it was all dwindled into a mere foraging 
business, that our little corps was headed by three 
Major-Generals and two Brigadier-Generals, while my 
command, in point of numbers, was reduced to that 
of a, Major, I thought it my duty, as well to save 
public expense as to be where I could be more use 
ful, to return to the Convention. I left the command 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 341 

of my little handful to Major Fish, who, with another 
Major of this State, very early, a few mornings 
ago, surprised and killed three light-horsemen of the 
enemy out of six, wounded another, and took one 
horse ; and had it not been for the too great prompt 
itude of the other Major, who killed one of the ene 
my with his own hand, the whole little party would 
probably have fallen into our hands. This effort, how 
ever, in a young man, though not altogether prudent, 
yet for a militia officer, whom I would much rather 
see rash than cowardly, is commendable. His name 
is Van Rensselaer. He was Major in my brigade, un 
der Colonel Humphrey, in the last campaign. I am 
pleased to see our officers brave. Service will teach 
them discipline and prudence. 

I am sorry to be obliged to inform you that our 
Convention, in spite of my every effort to prevent it, 
have resolved to adjourn to Esopus, for no other rea 
son than because their lodging here was inconvenient. 
The reasons of a public nature against the removal 
are weighty. Permit me, Sir, to mention them. First, 
the danger that the blocking up of the channel will 
be neglected. Secondly, the danger that the internal 
enemies in Duchess and Westchester will rise up 
in arms. Thirdly, the danger of the oppression, and 
therefore the loss, of the well-affected in those coun 
ties. Fourthly, the danger that our foraging will be 
discontinued. And, fifthly, the danger that the New 
York troops will not be properly equipped for the 
field. 

These, in my humble opinion, were sufficient to 
exclude from consideration every article of private 
convenience ; and you would be surprised were I to 
inform you who were the principal agents in bring 
ing about the resolve to adjourn. If, Sir, you should 
29* 



342 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

view the matter in the same light that I do, I am 
sure you would do every thing in your power to 
bring them back. I hope I may be honored in my 
opinion by a conformity of sentiments in you. Should 
this be the case, a line from you will, in consequence 
of the great deference I am sure they pay you, have 
the desired effect. Were the matter now to be moved, 
it could not be carried. They seized the lucky mo 
ment. If you should think it advisable to write to 
them on the subject, I beg you may do it without 
delay, and conceal the quarter from whence you ob 
tained your information. 

You may think it vanity in me, Sir, to add my 
application to that of our Convention, for the ex 
change of the four officers of my brigade, concerning 
whom they write to you. My only motive for doing 
it is, that perhaps my assurance of their merit, on a 
personal knowledge of them, may have some weight. 
I am, Sir, with every possible assurance of real respect 
and esteem, 

Your most obedient, humble servant, 

JOHN MORIN SCOTT. 



FROM GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 

Lebanon, 21 February, 1777. 

SIR, 

I am honored with yours of the 1st instant, and 
although it would have made me very happy to have 
been able to procure a release of all our officers in 
captivity, I freely acknowledge and acquiesce in the 
justice and impartiality of the measures you have 
taken respecting them. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 343 

We have now granted to our proportion of the six 
teen battalions the additional bounty of thirty-three 
dollars and one third, estimating that proportion at 
one thousand men. In making this estimate, we are 
governed by the proportion which the quota assigned 
by Congress to this State bears to the whole number 
to be raised, namely, as eight is to eighty-eight. This 
I trust will put the officers you have appointed in this 
State upon an equal footing with those of the eight 
regiments allotted to us before, and remove every 
impediment in the way of raising their men. 

I am not insensible, that the step taken by the 
New England States, of granting an additional bounty 
to their quotas of the Continental army, is objected 
to, as tending to produce discontent and disorder in 
the army. You will, therefore, permit me to state 
the reasons which have prevailed to induce the giv 
ing it, and the manner in which this State hath been 
drawn in to accede to it. 

The length and severity of our winters in this cli 
mate are such, that a soldier can neither clothe nor 
support himself, or a family, so cheaply at any time 
as he can in a southern climate. Many, indeed most 
of our soldiers, have small families at home depend 
ent, in a good measure, upon the savings they can 
make out of their wages for subsistence, which must 
always be the case while most of our youth many 
at the age of twenty-one years, or thereabouts. The 
almost total interruption of commerce, and the scarcity 
of materials for manufactures, have and must still 
greatly increase the prices of clothing and other arti 
cles, whilst the demand for all kinds of provisions for 
the army has likewise rendered every necessary arti 
cle of subsistence much dearer than at the commence 
ment of hostilities. At that time the wages given to a 



344 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

common laborer were about forty shillings per month; 
now ten dollars are rather less than a medium, and all 
articles of produce are risen in proportion. Add tha,t 
the seaman is offered twenty dollars per month, and 
tradesmen and artificers in proportion. Neither is this 
chargeable to any ill principle, but the necessary con 
sequence of drawing off so many of our men into the 
service. When these facts are considered, it was 
thought to be very apparent, that a New England 
soldier cannot, and in justice ought not to serve upon 
the same pay and allowances that were given in 
1775, or that one from the Southern States, when 
his expense for clothing and subsistence for himself 
and family is so much less, now can. Our people 
in general are so fully persuaded of this difference, 
it is alleged that it would be fruitless, as well as 
unjust, to attempt to engage them upon it, and vain 
to expect success in the attempt. 

These considerations induced the Massachusetts As 
sembly, in October, to offer an additional monthly pay. 
The Assembly of this State, who had before rejected 
the measure when proposed by some of their own 
members, followed their lead, and offered the same 
additional pay; but when they were advised of the 
disapprobation of Congress, and had your Excellency s 
objections laid before them, they cheerfully retracted, 
and determined to trust to the bounties and pay of 
Congress, with some encouragement in furnishing 
them with necessaries at prime cost, to induce them 
to enlist. In the mean time, all the other New Eng 
land States offered large additional bounties; Massa 
chusetts and New Hampshire, sixty-six dollars and 
two thirds ; Rhode Island, twenty dollars. It was 
soon evident, that these bounties would entice a great 
part of our men into the service of the States con- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 345 

tiguous to us on the east and north, which, besides 
the obstruction which would thence arise to the rilling 
up our own battalions, would be highly prejudicial to 
the agriculture of this State, and, in effect, to the 
general service, as the army must still depend, for a 
very considerable part of its subsistence, on this State. 

In this situation the matter rested until the enemy 
took possession of Newport. It then became neces 
sary to provide for the immediate defence of the New 
England States, and Commissioners met at Providence 
to concert proper measures for that purpose. They 
immediately agreed to raise an army of six thousand 
men for a temporary defence, until the Continental 
army might be raised. 

Sensible that an attempt to raise a separate army 
for their own defence, must effectually obstruct the 
raising a Continental army, and otherwise be liable 
to great objections, they considered raising the Con 
tinental battalions speedily, as the only sure means 
of defence against the enemy, should they fall upon 
any of these States 5 and proceeded to deliberate upon 
proper measures for this purpose. 

The rapid increase of the prices of the necessaries 
and conveniences of life operates strongly to discourage 
soldiers from enlisting. These they attempted to limit 
by recommending prices to be affixed by law, beyond 
which they might not rise, by recommending that a 
stop be put to emitting further bills of credit, and 
measures to be taken to reduce the quantity now cir 
culating. 

The number of men employed on board privateers 
and merchant vessels, formed another obstacle to rais 
ing an army. They recommended an embargo upon 
all privateers and merchant vessels, except those sent 
after necessaries by permit, until the army was raised. 



346 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

The bounties offered by the other States were al 
leged as an impediment to raising the quota for the 
army in this State and Rhode Island. The Commis 
sioners from this State strongly urged, that the addi 
tional bounties should be withdrawn, and encourage 
ment, by supplying necessaries at a certain price, be 
substituted in their place. In this they were over 
ruled; and then, sensible of the mischief that must 
arise from the great bounties given by the other 
States, they consented, in case Massachusetts and 
New Hampshire would reduce their bounty to thirty- 
three dollars and one third, to recommend to this 
State to give the same bounty to our soldiers, which 
was agreed to, and recommended accordingly. 

Our Assembly, with reluctance, for the sake of 
uniformity, and to avoid what they considered as a 
greater evil, acceded to the recommendation, and 
offered the proposed bounty. 

I must leave the other New England States to 
give their reasons for the measures they have adopt 
ed, and only add, that it is my wish and desire that 
all jealousies and occasions of disunion and animosity 
of the several States, may be avoided and laid aside. 
It is not wonderful, that diversity of sentiments hap 
pens at a time that government is so far convulsed 
arid unhinged. It is necessary, as far as possible, to 
become all things to all men, and not suffer our ene 
mies to avail themselves of any discord or disunion 
among these States. I am, Sir, with great truth and 
respect, 

Your obedient, humble servant, 

JONATHAN TRUMBULL.

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Baltimore, 25 February, 1777. 

SIR, 

From the resolves, which I have the honor of 
transmitting herewith, you will perceive the measures 
Congress have taken to reenforce your army at this 
juncture. 

I have wrote to the Convention of New York to 
place a proper guard of militia at the passes in the 
Highlands, in case you should think proper to call 
to your assistance the troops under General Heath, 
which will be highly agreeable to Congress. 

I have likewise wrote to the Governor of New Jer 
sey, and to the Council of Safety of Pennsylvania, 
to call forth their militia at this important crisis. It 
is indeed devoutly to be wished, and is the earnest 
desire of Congress, that the army under your com 
mand may be made, not only strong enough to con 
fine the enemy within their present quarters, and 
prevent them from getting supplies from the coun 
try, but totally subdue them before they can be fur 
ther reenforced. You will, therefore, be pleased to 
write to the Colonels, or other commanding officers 
of the regiments that are raising in the New Eng 
land States, as well as those of New York and New 
Jersey, and order them immediately to march the 
troops under their command, in the most expeditious 
manner, to head-quarters. Similar letters will be 
written by the Board of War to the commanding 
officers in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and Vir 
ginia. I beg leave to refer your attention to the 
whole of the inclosed resolves. 

Your favor of the 20th instant came to hand the 



348 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

24th, and was immediately laid before Congress. I 
have the honor to be, with sentiments of the great 
est esteem and respect, Sir, 

Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK, President. 

P. S. In consequence of your letters, and one 
from Mr. Morris, Congress have suspended their re 
move to Philadelphia for a few days. 



FROM ROBERT MORRIS. 

Philadelphia, 6 March, 1777. 

SIR, 

I am honored with yours of the 2d instant. The 
good opinion you are pleased to entertain of me, 
makes me very happy, because there is no man s 
opinion I reverence more ; and that very circumstance 
is, at the same time, the source of trouble in my 
mind, as you force me to abandon that idea of secu 
rity which I was desirous of maintaining. It is 
truly lamentable, that we have never been able to 
this day to conquer that fundamental error made in 
the outset by short enlistments. It was not until 
conviction of the absolute necessitv__of it, stared every 
man in the face, that frltr -wholesome measure of en 
listing for three years, or during the war, could be 
carried in Congress; and since it was carried there, 
it meets with insuperable obstacles, raised by the 
former practice ; for the bounties, high wages, and 
short service, have vitiated the minds of all that class 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 349 

of people, and they are grown the most mercenary 
beings that exist. 

I do not confine this observation to the soldiery 
merely, but extend it to those who get their livings 
by feeding and entertaining them. These are the 
harpies that injure us much at this time. They keep 
the fellows drunk while the money holds out ; when 
it is gone, they encourage them to enlist for the 
sake of bounty, then to drinking again ; that bounty 
gone, and more money still wanted, they must enlist 
again with some other officer, receive a fresh bounty 
and get more drink, &c. This scene is actually car 
rying on here daily, and does immense injury to the 
recruiting service ; but still I hope our new army 
will be got together before long, at least so many as 
will enable you to put a good face towards your 
enemies ; and if that is accomplished, I think they 
will not venture this way at present. It seems to be 
their object ; and, in your situation, I really do not 
see what is to f prevent their taking possession of it, 
unless the want of stores, forage, &c., retards their 
movements, or renders it impracticable for them to 
come on. In the mean time, the public stores are 
removing, and Congress has adjourned back to this 
place, many of the members are come up, and the 
rest on the road.* I do not expect they will make a 
House sooner than Monday; but your late despatches 
shall be delivered to the President as soon as he 
arrives. 

I wish with you, Sir, that they had complied with 
General Lee s request; and when I sent forward those

written to the President of Congress the following letter. 

"New York, 10 February, 1777. 
"Sm, 

" As it is of the greatest consequence to me, and I think of no loss 
to the public, I am persuaded that the Congress will comply with the 
request I am going to make. It is, that they will permit two or three 
gentlemen to repair to New York, to whom I may communicate what 
so deeply interests myself, and, in my opinion, the community. The 
most salutary effects may, and I am convinced will, result from it, and, 
as Lord and General Howe will grant a safe conduct to the gentlemen 
deputed, it can possibly have no ill consequences, unless the fatigue and 
inconveniency to the particular gentlemen who are appointed ; to lighten 
which and save time, which, in the present situation of affairs, is a matter 
of the most material consideration, I cannot help expressing my wishes 
that some of those gentlemen, who at present compose the Committee 
at Philadelphia, might be nominated ; but this must be referred to your 
better judgment. If my own interests were alone at stake, I flatter 
myself that the Congress would not hesitate a single instant in acquies 
cing in my request ; but this is far from the case ; the interests of the 
public are equally concerned, at least in the opinion of one who is and 
ever shall be most sincerely attached to their welfare. 

I arn, &c., CHARLES LEE. 

" P. S. The gentlemen deputed must pass through General Washing 
ton s camp, where passports will be ready for them." 

After this letter was read, Congress resolved ; 

" That General Washington be directed to inform General Lee, that 
Congress are pursuing, and will continue to pursue, every means in 
their power to provide for his personal safety, and to obtain his liberty. 

" That General Washington inform him of the steps taken to effect 
these ends, and at the same time acquaint him, that Congress judge it 
altogether improper to send any of their body to communicate with him; 
and that they cannot perceive how a compliance with his request will 
tend to his advantage or the interest of the public." Journals, February 
21 st.

know ; but I much doubt it, as from the little conver 
sation I have had with some of the members now 
here, they seem very averse to it. However, I ex 
pect this matter, as well as the confinement of the 
Hessian field-officers, will at least be referred to the 
consideration of a Committee, in consequence of your 
letters on the subject ; and, if I can influence a com 
pliance with your wishes, it will give me pleasure, 
for my own sentiments coincide with yours exactly 
in these two points. 

At the same time, I must hint to you what I 
take to be one of the most forcible arguments that 
probably has been used in Congress against this 
measure. I have not heard that it was used, but it 
occurred to myself on reading General Lee s letters. 
I mean, the effect it may have at the Court of 
France, should they hear, as they undoubtedly would, 
that members of Congress visited General Lee, by 
permission of the British Commissioners. The meet 
ing with Lord Howe, at Staten Island, last summer, 
injured Mr. [Deane s] negotiations much, and retarded 
supplies intended for us. 

I am now at the 15th of March, and must apolo 
gize to you, sir, for not answering fully your letter, 
and not having sent this away long since; but I have 
been attacked by a weakness in my eyes, and writ 
ing is the most dangerous thing I can do whilst it 
continues. On this account I am obliged to absent 
myself from Congress, and refrain from business; but 
in all situations of life I shall ever remain, with the 
sincerest esteem, your Excellency s 

Most obedient and humble servant, 

ROBERT MORRIS. 



352 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SULLIVAN. 

Peekskill, 9 March, 1777. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

I have called on General McDougall, and informed 
him, confidentially, of the state of our army. He says 
there are about six hundred Continental troops here, 
with two Massachusetts militia regiments. He is of 
opinion, that the Continental troops here should be 
sent forward, and that this State should garrison this 
post, for which purpose he will call on Mr. Jay, and 
consult with him upon the most effectual measures to 
bring it about. 

Dear General, since I left the army I have been 
informed that General St. Clair is to take the com 
mand at Ticonderoga the ensuing campaign. Though 
I never wish to complain, I cannot help the disagree 
able feelings, so common to mankind, when they find 
themselves slighted and neglected. When I had com 
pleted the disagreeable retreat from Canada, I was 
with circumstances of indignity. Since which, 
and before, every Major-General, except myself, has 
had the honor of commanding posts, separated from 
the main army. General Putnam has commanded at 
New r York and Philadelphia; General Gates at Ticon 
deroga and Philadelphia; General Greene in the Jer 
seys, when the army was at New York; General 
Spencer at Rhode Island ; and General Heath the 
forces in this State. I have never yet been thought 
worthy to intrust with the command of a separate 
post. I have felt those things most sensibly, and 
wish to know, to what it is owing. If it be to my 
want of prudence, resolution, or whatever other cause, 
I wish to know it, that I may rid the Continent of 
an officer who is umvorthy to trust with command. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 353 

I once had the command in Canada by an act of 
Providence ; and even malice itself cannot censure my 
conduct. I was soon deprived of the command, and 
rewarded with disgrace for saving the army and 
stores in that country. I know that Ticonderoga will 
become an important object with the enemy. They 
must try for it, and therefore he that has the com 
mand there will have the post of honor. I do there 
fore humbly claim it as my right, and as the first 
separate post intrusted to my care; and cannot think 
of the command being given to a younger officer, 
without conceiving myself a second time treated with 
neglect, which I well know my conduct has not de 
served. 

I wish your Excellency to forward me a line by 
the post upon this subject, which will be gratefully 
acknowledged by 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

JOHN SULLIVAN.* 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL ARNOLD. 

Providence, 11 March, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I am now to acknowledge your Excellency s favors 
of the 6th and 20th ultimo, and 3d instant. On re 
ceipt of the former, I was ordered to Boston, with the 
view of collecting four or five Continental battalions 
for our intended attack. On my return, General Spen 
cer thought it necessary for me to go to Point Judith, 



* See the answer to this letter in Washington s Writings, Vol. IV. 
p. 364.

354 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

from whence I returned last night, and was then pre 
sented with your Excellency s favors of the last date, 
prior to the receipt of which we had laid aside all 
thoughts of making a general attack on Rhode Island. 
The new levies of the Massachusetts Bay being all 
ordered to Ticonderoga, and those of Connecticut ino 
culated for the smallpox, deprives us of the aid of 
Continental troops, on whom we had placed our chief 
dependence. 

When the attack was first proposed, we had reason 
to think your Excellency had a force superior to the 
enemy in the Jerseys. I am sorry to say, we now 
have reason to think the case is altered. After duly 
weighing the matter, and considering the difficulties 
and risk of attacking and making good a retreat, and 
the fatal consequences attending the failure of suc 
cess, I was dubious of the propriety of the attack, as 
the enemy now rest secure and easy in their quarters. 
I am fully of opinion it will be imprudent to force 
them to action, until our new levies are in a manner 
complete. From our strength and numbers, which do 
not exceed four thousand raw militia, we have no rea 
sonable prospect of succeeding against four thousand 
well-disciplined troops. Notwithstanding, the Assembly 
of this State have lately requested General Spencer to 
make an attack on the enemy on Rhode Island, which 
he seems inclined to do, and the militia are collecting 
for the purpose. It is proposed to attack the west 
end of the Island, with three thousand men. I am 
much averse to this plan, as I am fearful it will bring 
on a general action, and end in our disgrace, or cause 
the troops in Newport to embark, both of which I 
wish to avoid at this critical juncture. From some 
of our own people, and several deserters from the 
enemy, we are informed they are near four thousand 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 355 

strong. It is said two thousand have lately arrived 
at Newport from New York. I am rather inclined to 
think they are a body of men lately sent to Martha s 
Vineyard, for ten transports passed Point Judith 
this day week to the westward, and appeared full of 
troops. Twenty odd sail are gone to England, and 
fifty sail remain at Newport. 

I am greatly obliged to your Excellency for inte 
resting yourself so much in my behalf in respect to 
nay appointment, which I have had no advice of, and 
know not by what means it was announced in the 
papers. I believe none but the printer has a mis 
take to rectify. Congress have doubtless a right of 
promoting those, whom, from their abilities, their long 
and arduous services, they esteem most deserving. 
Their promoting junior officers to the rank 6f~Majw- 
General, I view 7 as a very civil way of requesting 
my resignation, as unqualified for the office I hold. 
My commission was conferred unsolicited, received 
with pleasure only as a means of serving my coun 
try. With equal pleasure I resign it, when I can no 
longer serve my country with honor. The person 
who, void of the nice feelings of honor, will tamely 
condescend to give up his rights, and hold a com 
mission at the expense of his reputation, I hold as a 
disgrace to the army, and unworthy of the glorious 
cause in which we are engaged. 

When I entered the service of my country, my 
character was unimpeached. I have sacrificed my in 
terest, ease, and happiness in her cause. It is rather 
a misfortune than a fault, that my exertions have not 
been crowned with success. I am conscious of the 
rectitude of my intentions. In justice, therefore, to 
my own character, and for the satisfaction of my 
friends, I must request a court of inquiry into my con-

duct; and, though I sensibly feel the ingratitude of 
my countrymen, every personal injury shall he buried 
in my zeal for the safety and happiness of my coun 
try, in whose cause I have repeatedly fought and 
bled, and am ready at all times to resign my life. I 
shall cautiously avoid any hasty step, in consequence 
of the appointments that have taken place, that may 
tend to injure my country." 

Particular attention shall be paid to your Excel 
lency s commands respecting the prisoners. I have 
the honor to be, with very great respect and esteem, 
your Excellency s

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 17 March, 1777. 

SIR, 

I have the honor to transmit to you sundry re 
solves of Congress, of a very important nature, to 
which I beg leave to solicit your attention. 

The Congress, having had your letters of the 1st 
and Gth instant under consideration, have come to 
the inclosed resolve on the subject, by which you 
perceive they decline making any alteration in the 



* Congress had recently appointed five Major-Generals, and had not 
included Arnold in the number, although they were all his juniors in 
rank. See Sparks s Life of Benedict Arnold, p. 85. On the 2d of 
May he was appointed a Major-General, in consequence of his brave 
conduct in resisting the enemy s forces on their retreat from Danbury, 
but the date of his commission still left his rank below that of the five 
Major-Generals who had been promoted over him. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 357 

resolve of the 6th of January, and that it was not 
their intention that Colonel Campbell should expe 
rience any other hardship than such confinement as 
is necessary to his security for the end they had in 
view when they passed that resolve. 

The obvious distinction made by General Howe, in 
his treatment of General Lee, who is notoriously com 
mitted to the custody of the provost, and denied his 
parole, while our other officers are admitted to it, 
was the ground on which Congress proceeded when 
they passed that resolve, the intention of which was 
to show that, in proportion as severities against him 
were increased, the same treatment should be exer 
cised on six field-officers. 

The principle of retaliation was early adopted by 
the States of America, and, if adhered to, will be 
the most likely way to prevent our enemies from 
making distinctions, which have no other foundation 
but the gratification of their revenge; General Lee 
having an undoubted right to every indulgence that 
our other officers, prisoners among them, may re 
ceive. 

I have wrote to the Governor and Council of Vir 
ginia, and likewise to Colonel Stephen, on the sub 
ject of the inclosed resolves. 

The Congress have endeavoured to put a stop to 
foreigners coming over to America to enter the ser 
vice, not only by directing the Committee of Secret 
Correspondence to write to the agents abroad to dis 
courage them from such views, but by declaring that 
they shall not be employed unless they are well ac 
quainted with our language. 

Your several favors of the 20th, 23d, and 28th of 
February, and 1st and Gth of March, have been duly 
received and laid before Congress. I am also this 



358 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

minute honored with your favor of the 14th, which 
shall be laid before Congress as soon as possible. I 
have the honor to be, with sentiments of the great 
est esteem. Sir, 

Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK, President. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 26 March, 1777. 

SIR, 

I have the honor of transmitting such resolves of 
Congress as have passed since my last, which are 
either relative to your department, or necessary for 
your information. The Congress have authorized you 
to proceed in the exchange of prisoners, agreeably to 
the cartel at present existing, or such other regula 
tions as you may think proper to make in the mat 
ter, provided the enemy will relax in their treatment 
of General Lee, and acknowledge him. to be a pri 
soner of Avar, and as such entitled to be exchanged. 

I congratulate you on the arrival of a vessel at 
this port, from France, with eleven thousand stand of 
arms in good order, and, I am informed, fit for im 
mediate use. She has brought likewise fifteen hun 
dred gun-locks, and a large quantity of flints. Six 
thousand eight hundred of the arms are public pro 
perty. The balance, which belong to individuals, the 
Congress have empowered the Secret Committee to 
purchase immediately. I have wrote to General Gates 
to repair to Ticonderoga, agreeably to the inclosed re 
solve. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 359 

Colonel Clinton was yesterday appointed a Briga 
dier-General, in consequence of a very warm recom 
mendation from the Convention of New York. As 
lie is an officer of established good character, and is 
now engaged in obstructing the river, his station at 
the Highlands will be more convenient, and highly 
agreeable to the Convention of New York. 

Your favor, by General Greene, was duly received, 
and a Committee appointed to confer with him, the 
result of which shall be immediately transmitted. I 
have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem 
and respect, Sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK, President. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL ARNOLD. 

Providence, 26 March, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I was made very unhappy, a few days since, by 
hearing your Excellency was exceedingly ill with a 
fever. I soon after had the pleasure of hearing, 
by Mr. Learned, you were so far recovered as to be 
able to ride out. My fears have not entirely sub 
sided. I am still anxious for your safety, and appre 
hensive your zeal for the public service will induce 
you to exert yourself before you are perfectly reco 
vered. 

I wrote your Excellency the llth instant, since 
which our intended expedition against Rhode Island 
is laid aside. We now confine ourselves to a defen 
sive opposition only. Desertions from the Island are 



360 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

frequent. The most intelligent persons agree that 
the enemy have six battalions of Hessians, and four 
of British troops ; the whole about four thousand men. 
Several inhabitants, who came from Newport the eve 
nings of the 23d and 25th instant, say that all 
the enemy s transport-ships are hauled off from the 
wharves, their water in, and sails bent, and ready for 
sailing. Sir Peter Parker has sent his baggage on 
board, and was to embark soon. It is said, by their 
seamen, that they are bound for New York. From 
appearances, they will doubtless soon leave Newport, 
and probably join General Howe. 

In my last, I intimated to your Excellency the 
impossibility of my remaining in a disgraceful situa 
tion in the army. My being superseded must be 
viewed as an implicit impeachment of my character. 
I therefore requested a court of inquiry into my con 
duct. I believe the time is near at hand, when I 
can leave this department without any damage to the 
public interest. When that is the case, I will wait 
on your Excellency, not doubting my request will be 
granted, and that I shall be able to acquit myself of 
every charge malice or envy can bring against me. 

General Spencer writes your Excellency very par 
ticularly by this opportunity. I have only to add 
my sincere wishes for your restoration to perfect 
health, and preservation in any danger, and am, very 
respectfully, dear General, 

Your affectionate and most obedient servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 361 

FROM PATRICK HENRY, GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA. 

Williamsburg, 29 March, 1777. 

SIR, 

I am very sorry to inform you, that the recruiting 
business of late goes on so badly, that there remains 
but little prospect of filling the six new battalions, 
from this State, voted by the Assembly. The Board 
of Council see this with great concern, and, after 
much reflection on the subject, are of opinion that 
the deficiency in our regulars can no way be sup 
plied so properly as by enlisting volunteers. There 
is reason to believe a considerable number of these 
may be got to serve six or eight months. But, as 
you were pleased to signify to me that great incon 
veniences had arisen by the admission of transient 
troops at the camp, the Board do not choose to adopt 
the scheme of volunteers, until we are favored with 
your sentiments on the subject. I believe you can 
receive no assistance by drafts from the militia. 
From the battalions of the Commonwealth none can 
be drawn as yet, because they are not half full. 

The volunteers will consist of men chiefly from 
the upper parts of the country, who would make the 
best of soldiers, could they continue so long in the 
service as to be regularly disciplined. They will find 
their own arms, clothes, and blankets, and be com 
manded by captains and subalterns of their own 
choosing ; the field-officers to be chosen by the others. 
They will be subject to the Continental Articles of 
War, and I believe will be as respectable as such a 
corps can be expected, without training. 

I cannot speak with any certainty as to their 
numbers. In a very little time, seven companies were 
VOL. i. 31 



362 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

made up in Augusta. In the other counties no great 
progress was made, because Government stopped it, 
on being informed that it was a prejudice to the 
regular enlistment. But on the failure of this, the 
other may be revived, I believe, with success. Vir 
ginia will find some apology with you for this defi 
ciency in her quota of regulars, when the difficulties 
lately thrown in our way are considered. The Geor 
gians and Carolinians have enlisted probably two bat 
talions at least. A regiment of artillery is in great 
forwardness. Besides these, Colonels Baylor and Gray- 
son are collecting regiments, and three others are 
forming for this State. Add to all this our Indian 
wars and marine service, almost total want of neces 
saries, the false accounts of deserters, many of whom 
lurk here, the terrors of the smallpox, and the many 
deaths occasioned by it, and the deficient enlistments 
are accounted for in the best manner I can. 

As no time can be spared, I wish to be honored 
with your answer as soon as possible, in order to 
promote the volunteer scheme, if it meets your ap 
probation. I should be glad of any improvements 
on it that may occur to you. I believe about four 
of the six battalions may be enlisted, but have seen 
no regular [return] of their state. Their scattered 
situation, and being many of them in broken quotas, 
is a reason for their slow movement. I have issued 
repeated orders for their march long since. With 
sentiments of the highest esteem and regard, I have 
the honor to be, Sir, 

Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

PATRICK HENRY, JR. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 363 

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 4 April, 1777. 

SIR, 

The inclosed resolves of Congress, which I have 
the honor of transmitting, will naturally claim your 
attention, from their great importance. The regula 
tions relative to the payment of the troops and the 
department of the Paymaster-General will, I hope, be 
the means of introducing order and regularity into 
that part of the army, where, it must be confessed, 
they were extremely wanted. 

General Gates having laid before Congress the pro 
ceedings and sentence of a Court-Martial on a cer 
tain James Molesworth, who was accused and found 
guilty of being a spy, they immediately approved the 
same. He has since suffered the punishment due to 
his crime. From his repeated confession, it appears 
that Mr. Galloway was extremely active in engaging 
him to undertake this infamous business, and was 
the person employed to make the bargain with him. 
He says, indeed, Lord Howe was present; but, from 
the description he gave of his person, it is supposed 
he must be mistaken. 

The Congress have directed General Gates to take 
General Fermoy with him to Ticonderoga, and such 
other French officers as he may think proper. General 
St. Clair, being ordered to Ticonderoga, but previously 
to repair to this city to await the further order of 
Congress, you will please to direct him to repair here 
accordingly, as soon as possible. I have the honor to 
be, with the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir, 
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK, President. 



364 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 9 April, 1777. 

Sm, 

Yesterday evening, the Congress completed the bu 
siness of the Medical Department, and on so large 
and liberal an establishment that we may rationally 
expect the most beneficial effects will flow from it. 
Every encouragement is given to gentlemen of skill 
and reputation in that art to enter into our army ; 
and a variety of regulations adopted to carry the 
plan more effectually into execution. As I have the 
honor of inclosing the resolves on this subject, I beg 
leave to refer your attention to them. 

It is with particular pleasure I transmit the reso 
lution of Congress directing monuments to be erected 
to the memory of Major-General Warren and Briga 
dier-General Mercer. Every mark of distinction shown 
to those illustrious men, who offer up their lives and 
liberty for the happiness of mankind, reflects the 
highest honor upon those who pay the tribute, and, 
by holding up to others the prospects of fame and 
immortality, will animate them to tread in the same 
path. I have the honor to be, with the greatest re 
spect and esteem, 

Your most obedient and humble servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK, President.

FROM COLONEL PICKERING. 

Salem, 9 April, 1777. 

SIR, 

I esteem it as a singular honor, done me by your 
Excellency, in offering me the post of Adjutant-Gene 
ral; and it pains me sensibly that I am obliged to 
decline it. It is an honor to which I did not aspire, 
because I did not account myself equal to the import 
ant business of the office. Your Excellency does not 
mistake my attachment to the interests of the United 
States. It is sincere and unalterable. But my mili 
tary character, which you are pleased to mention as 
a motive to the appointment, is, in my own estima 
tion, of no great account. I have, it is true, studied 
the rudiments of the military art, but have very 
small, or rather no pretensions to capacity and skill 
in the important scenes of war, and much fear I 
should disappoint your Excellency s expectations con 



cerning me. 



I have domestic reasons and private concerns, which 
powerfully urge my staying at home ; but these I 
should not mention, did they exist alone. But, be 
side the command of a regiment of militia on the 
sea-coast, I hold divers civil offices, which are suffi 
cient to engage my constant attention; those of 
Judge of one of the Maritime Courts, Judge of the 
Inferior Court of Common Pleas, acting Justice of 
Peace and Register of Deeds for the County of Es 
sex. The exercise of these offices I could, without 
any very great inconvenience, quit for a season ; and, 
therefore, at the time of making the late levy of mi 
litia, as there appeared some backwardness in the 
31 * 



366 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

people, I encouraged their engaging, and stepped forth 
and offered my own personal service. 

Nevertheless, I would forever abandon all these 
employments, if I thought myself capable of doing 
more service to my country, by acting in the office 
to which your Excellency has been pleased to invite 
me. But, as I do not thus think of myself, and con 
ceive it not difficult to find a person not otherwise 
employed, and, to say the least, as able to discharge 
the duties of the office as I, I must beg leave to de 
cline it. I am, with the greatest veneration, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

TIMOTHY PICKERING, JR. 



FROM RICHARD HENRY LEE. 

Philadelphia, 10 April, 1777. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

The resolves of Congress, that you will receive by 
this messenger, you may be assured are not intended, 
by any means, to obstruct your views a single moment. 
If your judgment should incline you to think that 
the troops had better march to head-quarters as quick 
as possible, you have only to order it, and it will 
give pleasure to every good man here. The business 
of speedily reenforcing you will not be obstructed, 
but accelerated ; because they now enter the city, 
where every day s stay is thirty days injury to the 
great purpose of strengthening your hands ; and 
should the enemy destine here, something like a mili 
tary collection may produce a greater resort. If you 
will indulge my conjecture, I think they cannot pur 
pose coming here, because the water securities against 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 367 

such a plan are really formidable, and the situation 
of the land, where the water obstructions are fixed, is 
such that great delay, and probable ruin, forbids the 
enterprise, as they cannot so fix land batteries as to 
remove the strong vessels that protect the chevaiix-de- 
frisCy added to the numerous fire-rafts and fire-ships 
that, in a narrow water, with strong current, may de 
stroy their fleet. 

Your army, Sir, feeble as it is, and the North Ri 
ver, are more tempting objects, because they are not 
strong, and because the defeat of the one and the ac 
quisition of the other, would avail our enemies greatly. 

My wishes are, Sir, and I think they correspond 
with the true interests of America, that you should 
quickly be possessed of a strong army ; that your 
powers might be such as to gratify your wishes of 
crushing our enemies, before an addition of strength 
to them may render the business more difficult and 
uncertain. I think I well know your situation, and, 
from your excellent disposition, I know your feelings; 
and I do most ardently wish to make the former 
good, and to render the latter agreeable ; and there 
fore whenever I can know either from yourself, all 
the powers I possess shall be exerted to accomplish 
both. The troops of Maryland are now under inocu 
lation, and so are about one thousand Virginians from 
Baltimore to Wilmington inclusive. Here, we sup 
pose, may be near one thousand of all kinds, who, 
by the new plan of encampment, will be in tents as 
quickly as the physicians can discharge them, or the 
officers collect them from this attractive scene of de 
bauch and amusement. With every hearty wish for 
your health and prosperity, I remain, dear Sir, 
Most affectionately yours, 

RICHARD HENRY LEE. 



368 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 



FROM COLONEL PICKERING. 

Salem, 14 April, 1777. 

SIR, 

I sent, by the express, an answer to your letter 
respecting the offiee of Adjutant-General, and gave 
what appeared to me sufficient reasons to excuse my 
declining to accept it; but I have since been uneasy 
lest you should deem them otherwise, and that I was 
too willing, under the civil offices I sustain, to shelter 
myself from the dangers and fatigues of war; an 
opinion which, if it has taken place, I wish to remove. 

The case was this. I had concluded to accept the 
office ; but, meeting with a number of unavoidable 
interruptions in the way of business, was unable to 
give my answer to the express till the evening, at 
eight o clock, at which time I had directed him to 
call, and it was then, in fact, sealed up, and ready 
to be delivered ; the same which I now inclose to 
your Excellency. But the express delaying his com 
ing a full hour, I of course continued to revolve the 
matter in my mind, and, upon a review of the reasons 
on both sides of the question, those against my ac 
cepting the post, increased by the suggestions of my 
nearest friend, whose happiness and tranquillity of 
mind lay near my heart, preponderated, and occasion 
ed the answer your Excellency has already received. 
Besides the reasons there given, others weighed with 
me, which I had not time to mention. The civil offi 
ces I sustain yield me an income that contents me, 
and, in a time of peace, would maintain my family. 
These I must have relinquished, without an expecta 
tion of resuming them. Consequently, had I taken 
the post of Adjutant-General, and some cause had 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 369 

arisen (an event far from impossible), rendering it 
expedient for me to quit the camp, I should have re 
turned divested of the principal means of supporting 
my family. 

Whenever I thought of a military employment, the 
condition of my eyes was no small discouragement to 
me. I am so near-sighted that I, although placed in 
the best situation, cannot, with any degree of accuracy, 
discern the position of a body of men beyond the 
size of a single regiment. It is true, in viewing dis 
tant objects, my spectacles help me to see nearly as 
well as people in general do with the naked eye ; 
but they are frail things; and rain or snow beating 
against them (I found in the winter s campaign) so 
obstructs the vision as to render them almost useless. 
My business as Register of Deeds had, by my ab 
sence, got behindhand ; it seemed to be daily increas 
ing, and my office was riot in such order as I wished 
to leave it in to a successor. These, with the reasons 
mentioned in my former letter, and many others of 
lesser moment, determined my answer in the nega 
tive. I regretted the proposal could not have been 
made me while at head-quarters, where I could 
have inquired particularly into the nature and ex 
tent of the office of Adjutant-General, and thence 
judged more certainly whether or not I was able to 
discharge the duties of it. The want of such inform 
ation left doubts on my mind that were no small 
obstacle to my accepting it. 

On the other hand, I am sensible that to support 
the army is of essential importance ; that on the fail 
ure of it, besides the general calamity of my coun 
try, every prospect of advantage or enjoyment to me 
must vanish. I have been, therefore, ever ready to 
serve the public to the utmost of my power. But 



370 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

perhaps the comforts of civil life, the love of ease, 
the enjoyment of my friends, and the powerful allure 
ments springing from the nearest connection on earth, 
have led me to mistake the object. From a sacred 
regard, therefore, to the interests of my country ; from 
the ardent desire I have to approve myself to your 
Excellency; from the pain it has given me to deny 
the request of the last of men to whom I would re 
fuse any thing, I submit the whole matter to your 
Excellency s determination. If, upon a view of all 
circumstances, you judge it my duty to exchange 
the civil for a military life, I will do it. And then, 
should the office of Adjutant-General (for, from what 
conception I have of it, none would be more agreeable) 
be once more vacant, or any other post or employ 
ment present, to which you shall deem me competent, 
I will not again confer with flesh and blood, but in 
stantly obey your Excellency s commands. 

I beg your Excellency s pardon for imposing on 
your patience this second long letter. But I feared 
lest, by my backwardness, I might have offended. 
And I was led to make the above tender of my ser 
vices, because your Excellency s good opinion of me, 
and the urgency of your request, have raised me to 
sonic importance with myself. I am, with the high 
est veneration and esteem for your Excellency, your 
Excellency s 

Most obedient and most humble servant, 

TIMOTHY PICKERING, JR. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 371 

FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL GEORGE CLINTON.* 

New Windsor, 18 April, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

Being from home when your Excellency s letter of 
the 31st ultimo was left at my house, prevented my 
answering it by the return of the express, and till 
now I have not had any other opportunity. Before 
the receipt of it, I had, in consequence of powers 
given me by the Convention of this State, ordered 
out about twelve hundred of the militia of this and 
Orange county; five hundred of them to relieve Colo 
nel Pawling, at the post near Sydman s Bridge, and 
do the duties which had been assigned him, as the 
time for which his regiment stood engaged was ex 
pired; the remainder to reenforce the garrison of 
Fort Montgomery, and carry on the works necessary 
for its defence. I also ordered from Dutchess county 
eight hundred, and three hundred and fifty from 
Westchester, to reenforce the garrisons on the west 
side of Hudson s River, and to give protection to the 
inhabitants of the latter county, into which, for want 
of a proper force, the enemy make frequent incur 
sions, and take off large droves of cattle, horses, and 
other supplies. 

The unhappy affair at Peekskilh/j- and apprehension, 
entertained by our Convention, that the enemy might 
surprise and take our forts in the Highlands, induced 
me to take this step without waiting to get your

f On the 23d of March the British made a descent upon Peekskill, 
and seized or destroyed the provisions and military supplies deposited 
there. See Washington s Writings, Vol. IV. p. 3 09. 



372 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

Excellency s approbation of the measure. I Avonld 
fain hope that it will not be disagreeable, as these 
troops, if wanted, are to continue in service till the 1st 
of August ; yet they may be dismissed at any time 
before, and great pains have been taken to draw 
them out in such a manner as to promote the recruit 
ing service, and I doubt not but it will be a means 
to complete our regiments for the standing army 
much sooner than they otherwise would have been. 
As yet, however, not above one half of the above 
number of militia have inarched, and I much fear the 
whole will not easily be got out, if ever so much 
wanted. 

I most sincerely thank your Excellency for the 
very polite and kind manner in which you are pleas 
ed to mention my appointment to a command in the 
Continental army. At the same time my precarious 
state of health, and want of military knowledge, 
would have rather induced me to have led a more 
retired life than that of the army, had I been con 
sulted on the occasion, and at liberty of pursuing my 
own inclinations. But as, early in the present con 
test, I laid it down as a maxim not to refuse my 
best, though poor, services to my country, in any 
way they should think proper to employ me, on this 
principle I cannot refuse the honor done me by Con 
gress in the present appointment; and shall be happy 
if, in my best endeavours to serve my country in the 
military line, I shall at any time prove so successful 
as to merit your Excellency s approbation. 

We have, some considerable time since, drawn the 
chain across the river at Fort Montgomery ; and as 
the tide, as it is now fixed, has not the least impres 
sion on it, and it is greatly strengthened by a num 
ber of anchors and cables, I am in hopes it will 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 373 

answer some good end. The works in the river near 
this place go on well, and I have not the least doubt 
but they will be effectual when completed; and had 
the Convention suffered rne to have paid my whole 
attention to this business, it would have been the 
case nearly by this time. As it is, they are in great 
forwardness, and in a few days will become formida 
ble. The companies for which I nominated officers, 
are successful in recruiting, two of them having al 
ready near thirty men each. I, through mistake, ap 
pointed a First-Lieutenant more than I was directed; 
and as he is an active person, and has enlisted a 
number of men, I wish he could be provided for. I 
am, with the highest esteem, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

GEORGE CLINTON. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL MCDOUGALL. 

Peekskill, 29 April, 1 P. M., 1777. 

SIR, 

The wind blowing fresh northerly on Monday, and 
likely to continue for two or three days, when I re 
ceived a little provision for the men, I marched, at ten 
at night, with about twelve hundred, and one field- 
piece, towards Bedford, in hopes to fall in with the ene 
my there, from the intelligence contained in Number 
Eight of the inclosure. At ten the next morning, I 
arrived at the south end of the town, at the road 
leading from Ridgefield, which is ten miles from Bed 
ford. I had but just arrived there, when two ex 
presses came in, and informed me that the enemy 
had left Ridgefield that morning at daybreak, and 

VOL. i. 32 



:&gt;74 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

inarched towards Norwalk, which is but seventeen 
miles from the former; and that they had met with 
no opposition all the morning. This intelligence de 
prived me of all hopes of coming up with them, in 
that distance, as they had rested at Ridgefield the 
night before, and we had inarched twenty-one miles, 
through very rough ground, without sleep or refresh 
ment. Although I hoped the public and niy superi 
ors would justify iny risking this post, when there 
was some prospect of advancing the service, yet I 
considered it madness to risk it in a fruitless pursuit 
of the enemy, and therefore returned here this mo 
ment, after a very fatiguing march, which the troops 
endured with great patience. 

Your favor of the 26th found me at Bedford, and 
that of the 28th two miles south of Croton Bridge. 
The inclosures will give all the intelligence I am 
possessed of. I am 

Your Excellency s humble servant, 

ALEXANDER McD DUG ALL. 



FROM COLONEL PICKERING. 

Boston, 7 May, 1777. 

SIR, 

I had the honor to receive your Excellency s let 
ter by Colonel Lee, conferring upon me the office of 
Adjutant-General; and since, notwithstanding all my 
objections, it is your Excellency s pleasure, I am hap 
py to declare my acceptance of it. At the same 
time, I am constrained, from my real feelings, again 
to express my fears that I shall fall short of your 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 375 

Excellency s expectations. Few people are competent 
judges of military abilities ; and most are apt to form 
their opinions very superficially. Hence I have as 
often been mortified as pleased by the favorable sen 
timents which some have expressed concerning me, 
conscious that many times I did not merit their ap 
plause. I know not who have recommended me to 
your Excellency ; I wish they may not have judged 
too favorably of my abilities. However, I am deter 
mined to exert myself to the utmost to serve your 
Excellency and my country; and if, after all, I fail 
of executing the office with propriety, seeing I at first 
declined it. partly from an apprehension of inability, 
your Excellency will acquit me of presumption in ac 
cepting it at your repeated request. 

My affairs are complicated, but I will prepare to 
attend you with all possible despatch. General Glo 
ver accepts the post assigned him, and we shall 
doubtless go to head-quarters together. I am, Sir, 
Your most obedient servant, 

TIMOTHY PICKERING, JR. 



FROM ROBERT MORRIS. 

Philadelphia, 10 May, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have not taken the liberty of giving you any 
trouble for some time past; and, indeed, I never do 
it but with great reluctance, because I know how 
much your attention and time must be engaged in 
the most important pursuits. 

The bearer of this, the Marquis Armand de la 
Rouerie, is entitled to my warmest recommendations, 



376 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

because he brought from his own country letters to 
me that I am obliged to attend to, and put great 
faith in, as they come from persons worthy of the 
utmost credit. One of them is from Mr. Deane, who 
not only mentions him as a gentleman of rank., good 
family, and fortune, but also as a man of great me 
rit ; desiring my particular attention to him, and that 
I should supply him with money, which will be re 
paid in France by a gentleman to whom America 
is under the most important obligations. You will, 
therefore, excuse and oblige me at the same time by 
your favorable attention to Monsieur Armand, for he 
chooses to pass by that name ; and, should he want 
money, I will pay his drafts for what he stands in 
need of. I find he is a little disgusted at an ap 
pointment made for him by Congress this day; and 
I believe it was through the inattention of a Com 
mittee, which I shall get set right again in a short 
time.* I am, dear Sir, with the greatest esteem and 
affection,

CLINTON. 

Peekskill, 17 May, 1777. 

MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 

We have examined the obstructions in the North 
River, and beg leave to observe, that the object is 
too important to be trusted to its present security. 
If those obstructions in the river can be rendered 
effectual, and the passes into the Highlands be pro-

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 377 

perly guarded, which can be done with about four or 
five thousand troops, the rest of the army will be at 
liberty to operate elsewhere. 

To render the obstruction at Fort Montgomery com 
plete, it will be necessary to have a boom across the 
river, and one or two cables in front of the chain, to 
break the force of the shipping before they come up 
to it. The two Continental ships should be imme 
diately manned and fixed, and the two row-galleys 
be stationed just above the obstruction, which will 
form a front fire equal to what the enemy can bring 
against them. The fire from the ships and galleys 
in front, and the batteries upon the flank, will ren 
der it impossible for the shipping to operate there, 
if the obstructions in the river bring them up ; which, 
with the additional strength proposed, we have great 
reason to expect. 

The communication between the Eastern and West 
ern States is essential to the Continent; and the 
advantages we shall have over the enemy by the 
communication, and the great expense that will be 
saved in transportation of stores, by having the com 
mand of the river, warrant every expense to secure 
an object of so great magnitude. We are very con 
fident, if the obstructions in the river can be ren 
dered effectual, the enemy will not attempt to ope 
rate by land, the passes through the Highlands are 
so exceeding difficult. We are, with the greatest 
respect and esteem,

378 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 5 June, 1777. 

SIR, 

The inclosed resolves are all I have in charge from 
Congress to forward at this time. 

General Mifflin having applied to Congress, in con 
sequence of your letter to him, he has their permis 
sion to repair immediately to head-quarters, agreeably 
to his own desire. I have made him acquainted with 
this determination of Congress. 

In order that you may be enabled to meet Gene 
ral Howe upon his own ground, who has long since 
offered rewards to induce the soldiers of the Ameri 
can army to desert, the Congress have authorized 
you to fix on such rewards or sum of money as you 
may judge proper, to encourage deserters from the 
enemy, both horse and foot. You will, therefore, be 
pleased to carry this resolve into execution in such 
way as you may think most expedient, and best 
suited to answer the end. I have the honor to be, 
with the utmost esteem and respect, Sir, 

Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK, President. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL KNOX. 

Camp, Middlebrook, 5 June, 1777. 

SIR, 

A resolution, of the 30th ultimo, has been shown 
to me by some French officers attached to the corps 
of artillery under my command, ordaining that all 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 379 

officers of artillery, engaged by Mr. Deane in France, 
shall take rank, in the American artillery, according 
to the dates of their brevet commissions in the French 
service. 

I believe the Congress did not sufficiently consider 
the consequences of such a resolution, or that they 
had not full information to form it, consistent with 
that justice which is due their own officers. 

The French Minister of Marine, or Minister of the 
Colonial Department, gave these officers brevet com 
missions, to be in force in their Colonies only, or 
rather on this Continent, of superior rank to those 
which they then held in France, in order to give 
them an ideal rank here. They have had the rank 
given to them implied in their brevet commissions, 
and some higher than they expected. But this re 
solution of Congress gives them another superiority, 
which perhaps was not intended. Nearly all the Cap 
tains now in the Continental artillery served for the 
last two campaigns as Captain-Lieutenants, and are 
such only of that class as distinguished themselves 
by their abilities and special services. They are ar 
ranged, in the different battalions of artillery, accord 
ing to their seniority, but do not take rank as full 
Captains until the commencement of the present year ; 
whereas the French officers brevet commissions are 
dated in November and December, 1776. 

The resolution of Congress pervades all the differ 
ent ranks in the artillery, of Captains, Captain-Lieu 
tenants, and Lieutenants, and supersedes all the offi 
cers in these different stations. 

I confess that it surprises me much, and that I am 
totally unacquainted with the principles upon which 
it is founded. No military ones most certainly can be 
assigned. These French gentlemen, in general, have 



380 LETTERS TO W A SPUN G T ON . 

never been in so much actual service as the Ameri 
can officers, who are not accused of any demerits ; 
hut. on the contrary, their reputation, as a corps, is 
equal to any in the service. Why, then, should they 
all be superseded and disgraced ? They have exerted 
themselves to recruit their companies on the new es 
tablishment, and inarched them to camp. 

I conceive the most fatal consequences will arise to 
the artillery, except this resolution be repealed, at 
least so far as respects the seniority of rank. All 
that can with propriety be done, is to give them com 
missions dated at the same time that Congress accept 
ed their services. Any thing more will occasion the 
resignation of every officer of spirit in the corps, who, 
though they are actuated by every tie of attachment 
and interest in the service of their country, yet will 
infinitely prefer serving as volunteers, than under peo 
ple who can have no other tie than the pay they re 
ceive, and who cannot give a single order that can 
be understood. 

In justice to the merit of the officers under rny com 
mand, and to promote the good of the sendee, I make 
this representation to your Excellency, begging that 
you would be pleased to transmit it to the Honorable 
Congress for -their information. If they repeal the 
resolution, I shall be happy. If they do not, I shall 
be clear of any bad consequences which may follow. 
I am, with the greatest respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

HENRY

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 13 June, 1777. 

SIR, 

You will perceive, from the inclosed resolves, the 
fixed determination of Congress to retaliate, as nearly 
as lies in their power, on our enemies, should they 
think proper to send any of their prisoners to Great 
Britain, or to any other part of the British King s 
dominions beyond sea. This resolution you will please 
to convey to General Howe, as soon as possible, as 
it is of the utmost importance. 

If the sixteen additional battalions are not all pro 
vided with commanding officers, the Congress, in con 
sequence of a letter from Governor Caswell (an ex 
tract of which I inclose to you), have recommended 
Colonel Abraham Shepherd to the command of one of 
the said battalions, and doubt not you will honor him 
with the appointment. I beg leave to request your 
attention to the whole of the resolves herewith trans 
mitted. 

Inclosed you have the observations of Monsieur Du- 
coudray on Billingsport, and the other fortifications in 
this river, which I forward for your perusal. Every 
possible measure is taking to render the fortifications 
complete. 

I have the honor to be, with the utmost esteem and 
respect, Sir, 

Your most obedient, and very humble servant,

382 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Saratoga, 14 June, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

I do myself the honor to inclose your Excellency 
a letter to Congress, under flying seal. The variety 
of affairs, which claim my attention, does not permit 
me time to communicate to your Excellency and 
Congress, separately, such information as it may be 
necessary both should know. You will, therefore, 
please to excuse the mode I take. 

Our numbers are so few to the northward, and we 
have so little prospect of their increasing, that should 
a disaster befall us at Ticonderoga, Ave should have 
very few troops indeed to oppose them. If the ene 
my should make an attempt to penetrate into the 
country, I shall probably be under the necessity of 
calling for assistance from Pcekskill. Perhaps your 
Excellency may think proper to lodge an order with 
the commanding officer to comply with my requisition, 
if I should make one, ascertaining the number you 
may think proper to spare. Be assured that I shall 
not ask any aid, as long as there is a possibility of 
doing without. 

Your letter of the llth of May, to General Gates, 
was this day delivered to me by Brigadier-General 
Learned. The clothing for Colonel Shepherd s regi 
ment, if at Ticonderoga, will be immediately sent 
down. I am, dear Sir, with the sincerest esteem, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

PHILIP SCRTTLER. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 383 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Fort Edward, 16 June, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

I did myself the honor to address you from Sara 
toga on the 14th instant. On the next day, Ams- 
bury and Adams (mentioned in General St. Glair s 
letter, copy whereof I transmitted to Congress by 
letter under cover to your Excellency) arrived at Sa 
ratoga. What passed between us, and what informa 
tion he gave, is noted in paper Number One. Num 
ber Two is the letter which was inclosed between 
the bottoms of the canteen. 

If the information which Amsbury gives is to be 
relied upon, as I think it is, we shall soon be air 
tacked at Ticonderoga ; and although I think the 
force now there may be sufficient to hold that import 
ant post, yet I have no troops to oppose either Sir 
John Johnson, if he should penetrate to the Mohawk 
River, or any to prevent the communication between 
this and Fort George from being cut off; nor have I 
force, if these should not be attempted by the enemy, 
to march to the relief of Ticonderoga. In this situa 
tion, I am under the necessity of applying to your 
Excellency for a reenforcement. 

From the time I left Albany till my return to 
that place, nothing, comparatively speaking, has been 
done towards throwing into Ticonderoga a stock of 
provisions of the meat kind ; and of the little that is 
left there, I fear to learn that a very considerable 
part is damaged ; and what is equally bad, if not 
worse, is, that we have very little hopes of a supply 
of fresh meat. A week or two may remedy the 
latter, but it may then be too late to convey a quail- 



384 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

tity to Ticonderoga. If, therefore, any salted pork 
or beef can be spared from Peekskill, or elsewhere, 
I wish it may be ordered up, without the least delay. 

Should your Excellency order me a re enforcement, 
permit me to suggest, that, if there are no vessels 
at Peekskill or Fishkill to transport the troops to 
Albany, it may be proper, by express, to direct the 
commanding officer at Albany to send down from 
thence a sufficient number of sloops. 

Such is the inattention, in this department, that 
not less than a thousand barrels of flour are now 
lying at this post, and only five wagons employed to 
carry it to Fort George, the distance of fifteen miles. 

Permit me to beg that your Excellency will com 
municate the contents of this despatch to Congress, 
as I cannot find time to do myself the honor to 
write to them. 

I shall (consulting with the General Officers at Ti 
conderoga) try to send an answer to Mr. Levius s 
letter, as from General Sullivan, in which I shall 
leave him to suppose (what I do not by any means 
believe) that General Sullivan has entered into his 
views. Your Excellency will please to mention my 
intention to General Sullivan, and to assure him that 
my only view is to serve the public. I am, dear 
Sir, most sincerely, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

PHILIP SCHUYLER. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL ARNOLD. 

Cornell s Ferry, 1C June, 1777; 8 o clock, P. M. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

I wrote your Excellency yesterday, that the boats, 
scows, &c. ? were sent up the river, eleven miles, to a 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 385 

place called Tohegan, except such as were necessary 
here, which would be secured from the enemy in case 
of their approach. Since which I have had no direct, 
and but very imperfect intelligence from your Excel 
lency. I am at a loss if any part of your army has 
removed from Middlebrook, and more so of your Ex 
cellency s intentions. The enemy, I am informed, are 
at Somerset Heights, intrenching. General Sullivan 
is at Flemington, with sixteen hundred Continental 
troops, the Jersey militia, and one thousand men I 
have sent him from this place, half Continental, the 
others militia, I expect Colonel Bull here to-morrow, 
with five hundred State troops, part of two battalions 
engaged for the war. 

General Mifflin wrote me yesterday, that the City 
militia will move this morning; I am informed there 
are about two thousand of them ; they bring ten 
pieces cannon, and one royal howitzer, two hundred 
tents, one thousand felling axes, one thousand spades 
and shovels. One quarter part of the militia of this 
State are ordered out immediately, except two of the 
western counties. The whole, including the City 
militia, I am informed, will make ten thousand men. 
Three thousand of the Southern Continental troops 
are on their march, and will be in Philadelphia in 
the course of a week ; six heavy pieces cannon, 
four galleys, and ten armed boats, are arrived at Bris 
tol and Trenton ferries. The enemy must be des 
perate indeed, if they attempt to push for Philadel 
phia. 

As the militia can be but illy spared at this busy 
season, I wish to know, as early as possible, your Ex 
cellency s orders respecting them ; if you wish to have 
them in the Jerseys or on this side the Delaware. 
If the latter, for the defence of the passes on the 
VOL. i. 33 



386 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

river, one half will effectually answer the purpose. I 
have examined; and inclosed your Excellency a sketch 
of the passes between this and Trenton Ferry. Four 
or five thousand men, with a few pieces of cannon, 
will effectually guard the whole, and as for down as 
Philadelphia, with the assistance of the galleys and 
armed boats, against twenty thousand men. Above 
Coryell s Ferry, I am convinced the enemy will never 
attempt to pass. I hope the troops will be ordered 
for a different purpose, that of securing the enemy 
where they are, in the Jerseys. If they are detained 
here, I shall employ them in fortifying the banks of 
the river against the passes. 

I have sent off, this evening, via Flemington, four 
wagons, and musket cartridges sixty-six thousand, 
under an escort of seventy-five men. I have only 
to add, with great respect and esteem, I am 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL REED. 

Philadelphia, 18 June, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

By some accident Mr. Peters omitted sending me 
your favor of the 14th instant, so that I did not 
receive it till several days after he returned.* I 
cannot sufficiently acknowledge the kind sentiments 
which your letter breathes, nor express the satisfac 
tion it has given me. If I had been capable of the 



See this letter in Washington s Writings, Vol. IV. p. 540. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 387 

disingenuity, which might seem to appear, I should 
certainly have guarded it; but, as niy letter, to which 
that was an answer, contained nothing that could 
make any caution necessary, none was used. While 
there was a prospect of General Lee s release, I pur 
posely avoided an explanation, as I hoped my letter 
might have been preserved.* Certain I am, it con 
tained no other sentiments than lamenting the loss 
of Mount Washington, as occasioned, I frankly ac 
knowledge, by hesitating too long between clashing 
opinions, the want of assistance . to enable your Ex 
cellency to bear the load of accumulated losses and 
misfortunes, and to enable you to extricate yourself 
from the difficulties which surrounded us. 

I pressed him to hasten with his troops to our re 
lief, as necessary to raise the spirits of our broken 
army; and as General Greene s judgment had just 
then proved so erroneous, I urged General Lee, by 
every motive of regard to the cause, and his own 
honor and safety, to hasten his march, that his judg 
ment and experience might, in some degree, supply 
that defect. To induce him to exert himself, I re 
member I told him that I knew you had a great 
confidence in his abilities as well as the public, and 
that the opinions of others had kept you in suspense. 
I believed your own judgment was fixed. His answer, 
you may recollect, followed these ideas, though min 
gled with those expressions, and a style which, you 
may recollect, was peculiar to himself. 

I gratefully remember the honor you often did me 
in hearing my sentiments, and should have been suffi 
ciently encouraged to have expressed my apprehen- 



* A copy of the letter was afterwards procured. It is printed in the 
Life and Correspondence of Joseph Reed, Vol. I. p. 255. 



388 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

sions of any quality of the mind, whose operations 
might prejudice the service and your own honor, if 
my views and subject had led to it. But at that 
time I had nothing more upon my mind, or in pros 
pect, than the affair of Mount Washington, and a 
speedy junction with General Lee. But I will not 
trouble you any farther upon this subject than to 
give you my most sincere thanks for the kind and 
obliging manner in which you have relieved my 
mind from the anxiety which the apprehended loss 
of your favor and friendship had occasioned. 

I saw Dr. Shippen yesterday, who surprised me 
very much by mentioning that you had received no 
letters from me on the subject of the late appoint 
ment.* I assure you, my dear Sir, I wrote imme 
diately on receiving information of your kind inten 
tions ; and when I had determined, which I would not 
do hastily or without advice of my friends, I wrote 
immediately and sent the letter to Mr. Hancock s, as 
the proper place to be forwarded. I confess my in 
clinations led me strongly to accept, and more espe 
cially when I was assured of your favor and friend 
ship ; but, upon a calculation of the expense which 
would attend it, and for which the Congress have 
not made any special provision, I found that in two 
or three years I should probably sink my little for 
tune, and do injustice to the public or discredit the 
station. This, added to the many promotions made 
in the interior, were my principal reasons. My pros 
pects in the civil line are considerable ; these I must 
also have sacrificed. 

For all these I am sure you will make due allow- 



* He Lad been appointed by Congress a Brigadier-General in the 
Continental army on the 12th of May. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 389 

ances, and, I hope, not disapprove my declining the 
honor you intended me. I can hardly flatter myself 
with the hope of contributing any thing to your ease 
or honor, but my prayers and wishes for both will 
ever be as sincere as my attachment and respect are 
lasting and ardent. I have this morning seen a copy 
of your letter to General Arnold, expressive of your 
plan and views of the enemy s intentions. It cannot 
be unacceptable to you to know that it is highly 
approved. I have lately had a collection of English 
papers, by way of France. I read, with great plea 
sure, the encomiums which the British officers have 
wrote to their friends, not only on the virtue of your 
private character, but conduct of the war. The praise 
of an enemy cannot be suspected. Be assured you 
stand high in the opinions of the first military charac 
ters in Europe. As far as my poor opinion can go, 
I think your present system and plan have the fair 
est chance of success, and will meet with it, if some 
of those unforeseen strokes, to w T hich war is subject, do 
not intervene. We have had a letter published here, 
which says we must fight or forfeit our honor. It is 
said to be wrote by some General Officer. I cannot 
think he intended it for publication. Your letter 
contains different, and, I think, juster sentiments 
upon this important point. 

Colonel Moylan writes, that he thinks my know 
ledge of the country and people would be of use in 
the quarter where he is, and presses me to come up, 
which I shall do immediately, and pay my respects 
at head-quarters as soon as possible. I have been 
employed, for some time, in laboring an accommoda 
tion with the contending parties in this State, which, 
through General Armstrong s and Mifflin s influence, 
is at last effected, so as to afford the fairest pros- 
33* 



390 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

pects of bringing forth the force of this State. Gen 
eral Mifflin addressed the people at a town-meeting 
in your name, and requested them all to turn out; 
but, on trial, this was found impracticable. About 
four thousand, besides those in the field, will proba 
bly be the number, provided they can get arms, ac 
coutrements, and tents ; but there is at present so la 
mentable a deficiency in these articles, that I very 
much fear difficulties will arise after the men are pro 
cured. General Armstrong is indefatigable in his en 
deavours, and I hope will be more successful than at 
present he seems to expect. 

I presume the hurry in which General Mifflin came, 
prevented a formal application from yourself to the 
persons in authority here. I would just hint it to 
your Excellency, as I observe they think themselves 
passed by in the mode which has been taken, and 
which, most probably, has been purely accidental. 

I am too well acquainted with your many engage 
ments to take up more of your time. Allow me only 
to add, that I am, with the most sincere respect and 
attachment, my dear General, your most obliged, 
Affectionate, and obedient humble servant, 

JOSEPH REED. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 24 June, 1777. 

SIR, 

Your favor of the 23d, containing the agreeable 
intelligence that the enemy had retreated from 
Brunswick, I had the honor of receiving yesterday 
afternoon, and shall this morning, with the greatest 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 391 

pleasure, lay it before Congress. Give me leave to 
congratulate you very sincerely upon this event; as 
it must be principally ascribed to the prudence and 
wisdom of your operations, which had so embarrassed 
the enemy as to reduce them to the necessity of 
acting in the manner they have done. Should they 
be compelled finally to abandon the Jerseys, which I 
Hatter myself will be the case, it will be the most 
explicit declaration to the whole world, that the con 
quest of America is not only a very distant, but an 
unattainable object. We have seen them, after pene 
trating some miles into our country, precipitately 
driven back, and in a moment obliged to evacuate 
towns, after keeping possession of them only a few 
months. 

I do myself the honor to inclose you the resolves 
of Congress respecting the Commissary s Department, 
together with a list of the persons appointed to carry 
it into execution. I beg leave to request your atten 
tion to them, and to the other resolves herewith trans 
mitted. 

Your favor of the 20th instant was duly received, 
and immediately communicated to Congress. I have 
the honor to be, with the greatest esteem, Sir, 

Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK, President. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Albany, 28 June 1777; 11 o clock, A. M. 

DEAR SIR, 

Your Excellency s favor of the 20th instant I had 
the honor to receive at Saratoga, in the evening of 
the 26th. 



392 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

I am this moment favored with a letter of the 
25th instant from General St. Glair, copy whereof I 
herewith transmit.* Should an accident happen to the 
garrison of Ticonderoga, and General Burgoyne make 
a push to gain the south part of the Lake, I know of 
no obstacle to prevent him. Comparatively speaking, 
I have not a man to oppose him; the whole number 
at the different posts at and on this side of the Lake, 
including the garrisons of Fort George and Skenes- 
borou^h, not exceeding seven hundred men, and 

O / O 

these I cannot draw away from their several stations, 
in every one of which they are already much too 
weak. It is therefore highly necessary that a strong 
reenforcement should, without delay, be sent me. If 
the sloops are not yet sent to bring the troops your 
Excellency has ordered to be kept in readiness at 
Peekskill, I shall push them off without delay. 

As it is not probable that we shall in time be 
supplied with field-pieces from the eastward, I must 
entreat that the reinforcements may bring some up 
with them. 

I have this moment also received a letter from Mr. 
Deane, the Indian Interpreter, an extract whereof I 
inclose to you. As the information tallies exactly with 
what I had before, it leads me to conclude that an 
irruption will be made from the [westward]. 

I shall apply for the aid of the militia of this and 
the neighbouring States, but I fear it will not be very 
powerful, as many must be necessarily left at home. 

I have received a letter from the Commissary- 
General, which I think neither so temperate or de 
cent as it should be. I shall take the first leisure 
hour to transmit you a copy, with my answer, in 



* See this letter in the Appendix. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 393 

which, I believe, it will be evinced from authentic 
returns, that the scarcity of provisions in this depart 
ment is, in a great measure, if not altogether, to be 
imputed to a want of attention in the persons whose 
duty it was to supply this department. I am, dear 
Sir, with great regard and esteem, 
Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

PHILIP SCHUYLER. 

P. S. I have sent an express to General Putnam 
to hasten on the troops your Excellency had ordered 
to be in readiness for this quarter. 

Since writing the above I have received another 
letter from General St. Clair, a copy whereof is in 
closed. I am in pain about Fort George, but have 
no troops to throw in, and some time will necessarily 
elapse before the militia can be got to march. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Saratoga, 7 July, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

Soon after I had despatched the letter, which I did 
myself the honor to address to your Excellency from 
Stillwater, I met with Lieutenant-Colonel Hay, De 
puty Quartermaster-General, who was at Ticonderoga. 
lie informs me, that on Saturday it had been agreed 
upon to retreat from Ticonderoga and Mount Inde 
pendence ; that between two and three o clock on 
Sunday morning, General St. Clair, with the rest of 
the General Officers, and the army, marched out of 
the lines at Mount Independence ; that Colonel Long, 
with about six hundred men, embarked on board our 



394 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

few vessels, and in. bateaux; that, just before they 
arrived at Skenesborough, they were overtaken by 
the enemy s vessels and gunboats, and were obliged 
to abandon the vessels, in which we lost all our am 
munition. Indeed, Colonel Hay assures me that not 
one earthly thing has been saved. 

The troops under Colonel Long arc arrived at Fort 
Ann. Where General St. Clair is, with the main 
body, I have not yet learnt. Colonel Hay imagined 
he would come by the way of Skenesborough. If so, 
he will fall in with the enemy, who have taken pos 
session there. Captain Dantignac, who is just ar 
rived here, confirms Colonel Hay s account, except 
as to General St. Clair, who he understood was to 
march to Number Four. This is not likely. I have 
despatched an officer to meet General St. Clair, and 
requested that he should march, by the shortest route, 
to Fort Edward. As I have related the above from 
memory, I may have omitted some, and misappre 
hended other circumstances/ 1 

It is impossible to say what post we shall take. 
It depends on the route the enemy mean to pursue. 
My prospect of preventing them from penetrating, is 
not much. They have an army flushed with victory, 
plentifully provided with provisions, cannon, and every 
warlike store. Our army, if it should once more col 
lect, is weak in numbers, dispirited, naked, in a man 
ner, destitute of provisions, without camp equipage, 
with little ammunition, and not a single piece of 
cannon. In this situation, it is of the most urgent 
necessity, that your Excellency should afford me a 
very respectable reinforcement, besides that now com- 



* See General St. Glair s letter to General Sclmyler, dated July 8th, 
and other letters on this subject, in the Appendix.

ing up under Brigadier-General Nixon ; for it will be 
impossible for me to keep the militia together any 
time in a country very thinly inhabited, in which 
they cannot find shelter, and must lie out exposed 
to the weather. 

As the Continental troops have lost every thing, 
your Excellency will please to order up to me, the 
soonest possible, tents for four thousand men, five 
hundred camp kettles, a quantity of fixed musket 
ammunition, cartridge-paper, twelve pieces heavy can 
non, with travelling carriages, sixteen field-pieces, and 
a considerable quantity of ammunition for them ; a 
competent number of artillerymen, in addition to 
Major Stevens s corps, so as to be sufficient to man 
age the artillery; all the implements necessary to 
the artillery, horses, harness, and drivers; about six 
hundred intrenching tools, sorted, excluding pickaxes, 
of which we have a considerable number. Please 
also to send me a good engineer or two. I am, dear 
Sir, with great respect and esteem, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

PHILIP SCHUYLER. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Fort Edward, 9 July, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

Since I wrote you from Saratoga, I have not been 
able to learn what is become of General St. Clair 
and the enemy. The army followed the troops that 
came to Skenesborough as far as Fort Ann, where 
they were yesterday repulsed ; notwithstanding which, 
Colonel Long, contrary to my express orders, evacu 
ated that post, I am here, at the head of a hand- 



:-&gt;96 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

ful of men, not above fifteen hundred, without pro 
visions, little ammunition, not above five rounds to 
a man, having neither ball, nor lead to make any; 
the country in the deepest consternation ; no car 
riages to move the stores from Fort George, which I 
expect every moment to learn is attacked. And 
what adds to my distress, is, that a report prevails 
that I had given orders for the evacuation of Ticon- 
deroga, whereas not the most distant hint of such an 
intention can be drawn from any of my letters to 
General St. Clair, or any other person whatever. 
I am informed, from undoubted authority, that the 
garrison was reenforced with twelve hundred men at 
least two days before the evacuation, and that eighty 
head of cattle had got in, and a number of sheep. 
What could induce the General Officers to a step 
that has ruined our affairs in this quarter, God only 
knows. 

By the information of some of the prisoners I 
learn, that the enemy have already a brigade on the 
w r ay from Skenesborough to this place. General Nix 
on s is not yet come up ; but, if it does, we shall 
still be too weak to make any capital opposition. I 
will, however, throw as many obstructions in the ene 
my s route as possible. A party is parading to fell 
trees across the road between this and Fort Ann, to 
take up all the bridges, drive off all the cattle, and 
bring away the carriages. 

I inclose your Excellency a proclamation of Gene 
ral Burgoyne, which he has caused to be industriously 
spread through the country, and, I fear, will be at 
tended with the most evil consequences to us. I am, 
dear Sir, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

PHILIP SCIIUYLER. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 397 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Fort Edward, 14 July, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

On the 12th instant General St. Glair arrived here. 
As he fell in with Hudson s River about twelve 
miles below this, I ordered the troops to halt at Fort 
Miller, having no kind of shelter for them at any 
other place, and not even a sufficiency of boards at 
that. What the number is that have arrived I have 
not yet been able to learn, as the greatest confusion 
imaginable prevails here. General St. Clair supposes 
about fifteen hundred. Nor can I say what militia 
are in this quarter. I do not, however, suppose that 
our whole strength, in this department, exceeds four 
thousand five hundred men. 

Colonel Warner, with the remains of his regiment, 
I have ordered to remain on what are commonly 
called the New Hampshire Grants, together with the 
militia from that part of this State. He has direc 
tions to drive off all the cattle and carriages; but 
whether he will be able to effect it is a doubt, as I 
am informed a very great proportion of the inhabit 
ants are taking protections from General Burgoyne, as 
most of those in this quarter are also willing to do. 

Two regiments of the militia from, the State of the 
Massachusetts, under the command of Learned and 
Wells, who were sent up to supply, in part, the de 
ficiencies of the other regiments from that State, are, 
to a man, gone home. 

General Nixon arrived the night before last, with 
his brigade. From the slowness with which they 
moved from Albany to this, being four days march 
ing forty-six miles, I was led to conclude that they 
VOL. i. 34 



398 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

were a formidable body; but to my great mortifi 
cation, I find the whole to consist of five hundred 
and seventy-five, rank and file, fit for duty, and ele 
ven sick. Several of these are nogroes, and many 
of them young, small, and feeble boys. Desertion 
prevails, and disease gains ground ; nor is it to be 
wondered at, for we have neither tents, houses, barns, 
boards, or any shelter, except a little brush. Every 
rain that falls, and we have it in great abundance 
almost every day, wets the men to the skin. We 
are, besides, in great want of every kind of necessa 
ries, provisions excepted. Camp-kettles we have so 
few, that we cannot afford above one to twenty men. 
Although we have near fifteen tons of powder, yet 
we have so little lead, that I could not give each 
man above fifteen rounds; and although I have saved 
about thirty pieces of light artillery, yet I have not 
a single carriage for them, so that my whole train 
of artillery consists of two iron field-pieces, which Ge 
neral Nixon brought up with his brigade. 

I have, indeed, written to Springfield for the can 
non which were there ; but the answer I got was, that 
they were all ordered another way. I have also 
written for a variety of articles to that place and to 
Boston ; not that I expect any thing will be sent me, 
but that I may stand justified, for I have never yet 
been able to get much of any thing from thence. 
In this situation I have only to look up to your Ex 
cellency for relief ; and permit me to entreat you to 
send a reenforcement of troops, and such a supply 
of artillery, ammunition, and every other necessary, 
except provisions and powder, as an army ought to 
have, if it can possibly be spared. 

An express has passed through the country from 
General Burgoyne to General Howe. The latter will, 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 399 

probably, on receipt thereof, immediately move up 
Hudson s River. 

I inclose your Excellency copy of the proceedings 
of a Council of General Officers, held at Ticonderoga, 
a copy of which I beg you will transmit to Con 
gress, and be so good as to mention that I have not 
time to do myself the honor to write them. It con 
tains the principles on which the evacuation of that 
fortress took place. 

If the enemy will permit us to pass unmolested, 
three days longer, to Fort George, I shall be able to 
bring away all the stores from thence, and then draw 
off the few troops we have there. 

Yesterday, accompanied by the General Officers and 
engineers, I examined the country, and found a very 
defensible spot about four miles below this, to which 
place we are this day moving part of the army, and 
our stores. I propose remaining here until Fort 
George is abandoned, and as much longer as the 
enemy will permit me. 

General Nixon, with his brigade, supported by 
about six hundred militia, is advanced to Fort Ann, 
to fell trees into Wood Creek, and into the road 
from Fort Ann to this place. I have also stationed 
a body of militia about five miles on this side of 
Fort George, to cover the retreat of the garrison 
now at that place. 

We are informed that part of the enemy are still 
at Skenesborough, and that a body is coming by the 
way of Lake George. I hope it will not be very 
soon. Adieu, my dear Sir; and believe me, unfeign- 
edly, and with great respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

PHILIP SCHUYLER. 



400 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL ST. CLAIR. 

Fort Edward, 17 July, 1777. 

SIR, 

Your Excellency s letters of the 12th and 13th in 
stant, to General Schuyler, have been by him com 
municated to me. Considering that my letter to him 
of the 5th, the day before I left Ticonderoga, was 
not delivered, and one I wrote to him whilst on the 
march to this place has miscarried, and that your 
Excellency has had no intimation of the motions and 
destination of our army, I do not wonder that you 
should have some doubts about the propriety of my 
conduct, though it gives me a very painful sensation 
to know myself, but for a moment, the subject of 
a doubt with you. I have, however, the strongest 
hopes, when your Excellency comes to be fully in 
formed of our situation and force, you will not con 
demn me ; and, although I am not solicitous about 
the opinion of the world, though very far from dis 
regarding it, I wish to hold a character with your 
Excellency something more than merely negative. 

Returns of the strength of my garrison were regu 
larly transmitted to General Schuyler, and by him, no 
doubt, to you. By them, your Excellency will see, 
that our force consisted of little more than two thou 
sand effectives. With these, I had lines and redoubts 
of more than a league in extent to defend. Jud;e 

o o 

how poorly they could have been defended by these 
numbers, had they been perfected, which they were 
very far from being. In fact, they were not defensi 
ble at all upon the Ticonderoga side, unless the ene 
my would have been so complaisant as to attack us 
in front of the old French lines, and take no notice 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 401 

of the flanks of them, which were both open. We 
had, last year, nine thousand men at these posts, and 
they were found barely, sufficient for the defence of 
the works. The system was a little altered this sea 
son, but not so as to make a smaller number answer, 
but to make a greater number necessary. 

The enemy had nearly invested us, nothing being 
wanting to complete it but their occupying a -narrow 
neck of land, betwixt the East Creek and the Lake, 
on the Mount Independence side. This, I had inform 
ation, would certainly take place in the course of 
the next twenty-four hours, and had been left open so 
long only with a view to intercept any cattle that 
we might bring in from the country, and then our 
communication would have been effectually cut off. 
We could have received neither supplies of provisions 
nor reenfor cements, for, depend upon it, Sir, the mili 
tia of this country cannot yet be brought on to raise 
a siege. 

But, it may be asked, why I had not called in 
the militia to assist in the defence of the posts. For 
this plain reason, I had not provision for them, and 
very little prospect of an effectual supply. When I 
first had notice of the approach of the enemy, there 
was no more than ten days provision in store for the 
troops then upon the ground. To have called in the 
militia, in that situation, would have been certain 
ruin. So soon as a supply arrived, although but a 
scanty one, I did call for them, and about nine hun 
dred joined me the day before the resolution to eva 
cuate the posts was taken. They had come out in 
such a hurry, and almost entirely without clothes, 
they did not propose to remain but a very few days 
at the utmost. The term of Learned and Wells s 
regiments, which made part of the garrison, expired 



402 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

also in two days, and the commanding officers had 
acquainted me that they could not prevail upon the 
men to remain beyond the time they were engaged 
for. Your Excellency knows, but too well, the dispo 
sition of these people on such occasions. 

The batteries of the enemy were ready to open in 
three different quarters, and our whole camp, on the 
Ticonderoga side, was exposed to the fire of each ; 
and, as soon as they did open, every man I had 
must have been constantly on duty, as, from our 
weakness, of which the enemy could not be ignorant, 
I had reason, every moment, to expect an assault. 
Judge, Sir, how long w r e could have sustained it, or 
whether our resistance must not have been a very 
feeble one indeed, especially when you take into the 
account that a great number were mere boys, and 
that not more than a tenth part were furnished with 
bayonets. 

Revolving these circumstances in my mind, I was 
at no loss to determine what part I ought to take ; 
but I thought it prudent to take the sense of the 
other General Officers. A copy of the Council has 
been transmitted to your Excellency by General Schuy- 
ler. They were unanimously of opinion that the posts 
ought to be evacuated immediately; wisely, in my 
judgment, considering that a retreat, even with the 
loss of our cannon and stores, if it could bo effected, 
would be of infinitely greater service to the country, 
and bring less disgrace upon our arms, than an army, 
although a small one, taken prisoners, with their 
cannon and stores. I was fully in sentiment with 
them, and believe I should have ordered the retreat, 
if they had been of a contrary way of thinking. 

But here, again, it may be asked why, when I 
found myself in the situation I have described, I did 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 403 

not retreat sooner, when every thing might have been 
saved. I have only to answer that, until the enemy 
sat down before the place, I believed the small gar 
rison I had to be sufficient. The intelligence that 
Congress had received, that no serious attempt in 
that quarter was intended, as it gained credit with 
them, I never doubted, and was unwilling to be the 
occasion of- drawing off any part of your army, as 
your operations might thereby be rendered less vigor 
ous; and I knew, too, that you could very ill spare 
them. Besides, until the case became so urgent that 
I had no alternative but the evacuation of my posts, 
or the loss of the army, it did not lie with me to 
determine upon. 

The retreat was begun a little before day, on the 
6th instant, unperceived by the enemy, after having 
embarked as much of the stores and provision, and 
as many of the cannon, as was possible in the course 
of one very short night ; and our march would pro 
bably have been unperceived for some time, if Gene 
ral Ferrnoy s house had not been set on fire. How 
that happened, I know not. I had previously given 
orders against burning any of the buildings, that our 
march might be the longer concealed ; but it served 
to the enemy as the signal of our leaving the place, 
and, in consequence, they were upon the Mount be 
fore our rear was clear of it, and fired a few times 
upon it, but without effect. 

Colonel Long, with his regiment, and a detachment 
from the other regiments, and the invalids with the 
hospital, were sent to Skenesborough, by water ; while 
I took the road to the same place, through Castleton, 
with the body of the army. As the enemy were at 
least four times my numbers, I had nothing for it 
but a forced march ; and I pressed it as much as 



404 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

possible, and reached Castleton that night, thirty miles 
from Ticonderoga, having, on our way, fallen in with 
and dispersed a party of the enemy, from whom we 
took twenty head of cattle, three British prisoners, 
and five Canadians. 

The rear guard, under Colonel Warner, which, with 
those that had failed upon the march, amounted to a 
thousand, imprudently halted six miles short of Cas 
tleton, and wasted so much time in the morning, that 
they were overtaken and surprised by a strong de 
tachment from Ticonderoga, which had been sent up 
the East Bay, which runs into the country very near 
the place where he was. They sustained the attack 
with great bravery, but were finally obliged to give 
way, with the loss of about fifty killed and wounded. 
On the first of the firing, I sent orders to two regi 
ments of militia, who had left me the night before, 
and were lodged within two miles of Colonel War 
ner s post, to move up to his assistance, which had 
they done, that party would have been cut off. But, 
instead of that, they made all possible haste to rejoin 
me, and at the same instant I received the account 
of the enemy s being in possession of Skenesborough, 
and having taken and destroyed every thing that 
had been sent there. 

I was then constrained to change my route, both that 
I might avoid the being put between two fires, and 
that I might be able to bring off Colonel Warner. I 
therefore sent him orders to retire to Rutland, where 
he would find me to cover him. A considerable part 
of his detachment joined me at that place, and he, 
with about ninety more, two days afterwards, at Man 
chester. A great many are still missing, though few, 
I believe, have fallen into the enemy s hands, as they 
did not pursue Colonel Warner but a very small dis- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 405 

tance, and, from all accounts, suffered much in the 
action. The ninth regiment followed Colonel Long 
towards Fort Ann, and were almost entirely cut off. 
I have despatched officers to Bennington and Num 
ber Four to pick up the stragglers who, I suppose, 
have taken these routes to New England; and, on 
the 12th instant, I joined General Schuyler, at this 
place, after a very fatiguing march. 

Thus, Sir, I have laid before you, without the least 
reserve, every thing I can recollect respecting Ticon- 
deroga, and the retreat from thence. Happy should I 
be, if my conduct therein meets with your approba 
tion ; and I can, with the strictest truth, affirm I was 
actuated by no motives but what sprang from a sin 
cere regard for the public welfare. I have the honor 
to be your Excellency s 

Most obedient and very humble servant, 

ARTHUR ST. CLAIR. 



FROM MAJOR AARON BURR. 

Peekskill, 20 July, 1777. 

HONORED SIR, 

I was this morning favored with your Excellency s 
letter of 29th ultimo, and my appointment in Colo 
nel Malcom s regiment. I am truly sensible of the 
honor done me, and shall be studious that my de 
portment in that station be such as will insure your 
future esteem. 

I am, nevertheless, Sir, constrained to observe, that 
the late date of my appointment subjects me to the 
command of many who are younger in the service, 
and junior officers the last campaign. With sub- 



406 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

mission, and if there is no impropriety in requesting 
what so nearly concerns me, I would beg to know 
whether it was any misconduct in me, or extraordi 
nary merit or services in them, which entitled the 
gentlemen, lately put over me, to that preference ; or, 
if a uniform diligence and attention to duty has 
marked my conduct since the formation of the army, 
whether I may not expect to be restored to that 
rank, of which I have been deprived rather, I flatter 
myself, by accident than design. I would wish equal 
ly to avoid the character of turbulent or passive, and 
am unhappy to have troubled your Excellency with 
a matter which concerns only myself; but, as a de 
cent attention to rank is both proper and necessary, 
I hope it will be excused in one who regards his 
honor next to the welfare of his country. 

I am not yet acquainted with the state of the regi 
ment, or the prospect of filling it, but shall immedi 
ately repair to the rendezvous, and receive Colonel 
Malcom s directions. I have the honor to be, with 
the greatest respect, 

Your Excellency s very humble servant, 

AARON BURR.* 



FROM CHARLES THOMSON. 

Summerville, 21 July, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

Having lately met with an ordinance of the King 
of France, passed last December, for establishing the 
corps of engineers, I made a hasty translation of it, 



* This letter is indorsed " not answered." 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 407 

from which I apprehend some useful hints may be 
taken for establishing such a corps in this country. 
And as I know of no better hands into which it may 
be put for this purpose, I have taken the liberty to 
send you a copy. 

You are doubtless informed of the four engineers 
sent over by Dr. Franklin and Mr. Deane, three of 
whom are arrived and taken into the service of the 
Continent, the first as Colonel, the second as Lieu 
tenant-Colonel, and the third as Major of engineers. 
What probability there is of their being men of ex 
perience you will see by the inclosed ordinance, and 
the rank they held in the royal corps of engineers. 
Whether their being taken into the service as Colo 
nel, &c., of engineers, will give them, rank of those 
heretofore engaged simply as engineers, with similar 
ranks, will, I presume, be left to your determination 
agreeably to the rules of the army. 

I congratulate you on the capture of General Pres- 
cott, and I hope soon to hear of the release of Gene 
ral Lee. The haughty instrument of tyranny will, I 
trust, abate his insolence, at least admit the propriety 
of now insisting on General Lee s release, "when 
you have an officer of equal rank to offer in ex 
change." Though I must confess I should be very 
glad, before any exchange even now took place, that 
a cartel was settled on such plain arid equal princi 
ples as to remove all grounds of cavil. The Board 
of War have had the cartel settled between the 
French and English in the year 1759, lately reprinted, 
which you have undoubtedly seen. 

I cannot forbear thinking that the posts held in 
the army ought to be attended as much, if not more, 
than nominal rank. Without this, our enemy will 
have greatly the advantage. Their General Officers 



408 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

have all regiments, so that there are but few Colo 
nels. Ought not, therefore, Lieutenant-Colonels, or 
even Majors, when they command regiments, to be 
estimated as Colonels ? 

But I am transgressing rny line, and I fear tres 
passing on your time. I am, Sir, 

Your obedient, humble servant, 

CHARLES THOMSON. 



FROM JAMES LOVELL.* 

Philadelphia, 24 July, 1777. 
SIR, 

So long ago as December 2d, 1775, direction was 
given by Congress to the Committee of Secret Cor 
respondence to procure from Europe four good engi 
neers. This was not, however, accomplished till the 
13th of last February, when the bearer, the Chevalier 
Duportail, with M. La Iladiere, M. Gouvion, and one 
other officer, who is left sick in the West Indies, were 
engaged by Dr. Franklin and Mr. Deane to come over 
to America. I beg your Excellency to observe well, 
that these are the only officers, of any species, who 
have been procured from abroad by express direction 
of Congress. And this I do. because I am about to 

O 

furnish you with several circumstances peculiarly with 
in my knowledge, relative to a point of equity well 
worthy of your Excellency s attention. 

The corps of engineers is very honorable in France, 
and officers from it are sought by different European 
powers. These gentlemen, who are come over into 

* Member of Congress from Massachusetts, and for some time Chair 
man of the Committee of Foreign Affairs. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 409 

our service., made an agreement with our Commission 
ers to rise one degree from the rank they held at 
home, upon a supposition that the practice of Europe 
had been regarded here. But, when they arrived, 
they found instances very different with respect to 
officers in all other corps. It was their mishap, also, 
to see a Major of artillery affecting to be exalted 
four ranks, as a chief, in his proper line and theirs 
also. They made a representation of these circum 
stances, and appealed to the equity of Congress. But 
they had arrived at a time when the infatuation of 
some here, and the wild conduct of one abroad, had 
rendered a spirit of reformation absolutely necessary 
as to the point of rank. 

The ingenuous, however, must own, that there is 
singular hardship in the case of these gentlemen. 
The only officers ever sent for by us, procured by 
the real political agents of Congress, coming out with 
the good wishes of the French Ministry, being of un 
doubted rank and ability in their profession, find 
themselves in the dilemma of becoming the first ex 
amples of our new reforming spirit, or else of going 
home during a campaign, which their high sense of 
honor will not allow. But, though the Chevalier Du- 
portail was not made a Brigadier, yet it appeared too 
gross to expose him to be directed, in his peculiar 
line, by such as will readily acknowledge his preten 
sions, by regular education and discipline, to be great 
ly superior to their own. His commission prevents 
this, and enables him so to distribute, in work, the 
others who came with him, as to prevent them who 
have been within a few months as long in service as 
himself, from being interfered with by such as never 
belonged to the Royal Corps of Engineers in France, 
or perhaps but a very short time to any other. 



VOL. i. 35 



410 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

Your Excellency cannot but wonder at the strange 
manner of wording the commission. I shall explain 
it with the greatest freedom. M. Ducoudray being 
employed as a good artillery officer to examine the 
arsenals in France, to see what cannon, &c., could be 
spared from them, acted with great industry in that 
employment, and much seeming regard to America. 
In the course of his transactions between the Coinpte 
de St. Germain and Mr. Deane, he was not blind to 
perceive that he might take occasion to serve him 
self. Besides being paid for his trouble and expenses 
in France, he procured an agreement from Mr. Deane, 
which has already been shown to your Excellency, 
and has affected you, doubtless, with the same sur 
prise and indignation which it has excited in others, 
almost without a single exception. 

I shall omit any remarks upon that treaty, or a 
long too ingenious memorial presented to Congress 
with it, except such as are strictly connected with 
the occasion of this letter. M. Ducoudray, having 
created himself to the command of artillery and engi 
neers, persuaded Mr. Deane that it would be impos 
sible to get any from the military corps of engineers, 
now called royal, because their demands would be so 
exorbitant, and that it would be also unnecessary, be 
cause we ought not to build fortified places in Ame 
rica to serve as secure holds to our enemy, when 
once taken from us; and that, therefore, a few bridge 
and causeway-makers would answer all the ends of 
military engineers. Such he brought with him, who 
were quite ready to fall under the command of an 
artillery direction, when not the lowest officer of the 
Royal Corps of Engineers would have submitted to 
such a novel pretence. 

It is needless to inquire whether it be true, that 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 411 

Mr. Deane acknowledged he had been surprised into 
this uncouth compact. It is sufficient that Dr. Frank 
lin made an after one, which Mr. Deane also signed. 
Is not this in fact tantamount to a disavowal of the 
first treaty, so far as relates to the orders of Con 
gress? For, if those orders were fulfilled by the first, 
why was a second treaty made ? The agents show 
that there had been a deception, or that there had 
not been any attempt to follow the instructions of 
Congress as to engineers, in all the train attending 
M. Ducoudray. 

Another remark may not be impertinent here. As 
these four engineers showed their treaty to the 
Compte de St. Germain, to whom they have also 
written from hence, it cannot be supposed that he 
would have permitted a Lieutenant-Colonel of the 
Royal Corps of Engineers, and two old Majors of the 
same, to come over hither to be under the immediate 
command of a young Major of artillery. It is not to 
be conceived. From whence I conclude that M. Du 
coudray never let his exorbitant and whimsical treaty 
be knoAvn to that Minister of the War Department, 
who must have been shocked at the confusion of 
corps in the principles of contract. 

Excuse me, dear General, I will not again wander 
from the point which I said I would explain. M. 
Ducoudray has given full scope to his species of in 
genuity here, as in the neighbourhood of Mr. Deane. 
I have been told that he has said, if he could not be 
employed himself, he would bring it about that these 
others should not. This may be an absolute false 
hood. But, I will own, it comes the nearest of any 
thing which I can conceive of, to explain the delays 
which have taken place in regard to these engineers, 
who ought, to have been sent to your Excellency 



412 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

long ago. They have remained subject to the cruci 
fying expenses of this city, because their employ 
ment seemed to interfere with M. Ducoudray s preten 
sions, though those very pretensions had been reject 
ed. Your Excellency would doubtless smile, if you 
should ever hear, that even a number of peasants dis 
puted three days about the difference between the 
consequences of a man s being Colonel-in-chief, or 
First Colonel, or Colonel to take rank and command 
of all heretofore appointed, or Colonol-commandant of 
engineers. Would not a Brigadier or Major-General 
of engineers alike annul the supremacy of the differ 
ently-worded commissions? Or rather, do not the 
four different modes give like command? 

I shall pass from rank to pay. These gentlemen, 
not only far from the prophesied exorbitancy in de 
mand of rank, never received one shilling in France 
as gratification; though others, who were not sent 
for, received large sums, and claim pay from their 
embarkation, and even pensions for life. But Dr. 
Franklin, supposing it would be less trouble to him 
self and more agreeable to the engineers to see to 
their own passages, stipulated their pay from the 13th 
of February. 

As no regulations have yet been made in regard 
to cavalry or engineers, these gentlemen have receiv 
ed five months pay as infantry, which will not refund 
the expenses of their voyage. I am really uneasy, 
when I find manly, honorable intentions do not meet 
with at least equal emoluments with artful, suspicious, 
tricking contractors. If these officers do not walk to 
camp, it is not because they were furnished by the 
Board of War with horses upon my application for 
them; and yet the nature of their profession demands 
M provision of the kind. Are they suddenly to re- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 413 

connoitre a camp, a river, a shoal, or a whole neigh 
bouring country, through which an army is to march, 
and to make the speediest return to the Generals, on 
foot? I trust your Excellency, when asking for en 
gineers, had ideas of something beyond what the 
sinister views of an ambitious foreigner have sought 
to inspire us with here; which is, forming a causeway, 
or cutting a ditch, or planking a bridge. And I shall 
consequently rest satisfied that you w r ill receive the 
officers, now presenting themselves to you, and secure 
to them such honors and emoluments as you shall 
find them to merit from their education and abilities, 
exemplified under your command. No one has been more 
backward than I in desiring to see foreigners in our 
service, to the slight of my countrymen. And, ex 
cept engineers, I could not admit the thought of our 
wanting any military strangers, other than one or 
two veteran Adjutants or Majors, who know our lan 
guage well, and could serve as instructors at large to 
our spirited and well-attached young American offi 
cers. 

I wish these engineers could speak English better 
than they do ; but they can receive orders and give 
them in English, and will speedily learn to speak. 

I hope your Excellency will not think amiss of the 
freedom I have taken at this time, both as to the 
matter of rny letter and the interruptive length of it. 
I do not write officially, as of the Committee on Fo 
reign Applications. In that capacity I have more than 
once communicated to you proceedings of Congress, 
in a style which might lead you to misconjecture my 
individual opinion. I write as a friend to my coun 
try, and the reputation of its Congress, its army, and 
agents abroad. I write as being w r ell acquainted with 
your Excellency, or, in other words, as thinking I 
35* 



414 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

know you. In short, I write because I had determin 
ed it to be my duty so to write. That path once 
determined, I never ask myself whether there may 
not be a lion in the way. 

After the important kindnesses, which your Excel 
lency has done me, I so far forgive the late injury 
of your apologizing for a short answer written by one 
of your hurried family, as not to revenge myself, by 
entreating you to excuse my rough, wwopied sheets to 
a violent headache. AUqiiando dormitat did not ap 
pear an unnatural charge against Homer. Nimium 
vigilat would have appeared so against Seipio or Marl- 
borough, and yet I am led by you to think they 
might have given provocation for it. With truest 
vows for your prosperity, I am your Excellency s 
Obliged friend and humble servant. 

JAMES LOVELL. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL GEORGE CLINTON. 

Fort Montgomery, 26 July, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

When I had the pleasure of seeing your Excel 
lency at Ramapo, I mentioned that the terms, for 
which the two militia regiments stationed at this 
post were engaged in service, expired the last of 
this month, at which time, unless a re enforcement is 
sent here by General Putnam, the whole strength we 
shall have, at this important station, will be Colonel 
Dubois s regiment, two companies of artillery, and a 
detachment of about one hundred and fifty Continen 
tal troops under Lieutenant-Colonel Meigs. 

I have this day wrote to General Putnam on the 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 415 

subject, that he may so order matters as to furnish a 
reinforcement to this garrison, if he shall judge it 
expedient. 

I have had a second call to attend at Kingston, 
and take the oath of office in consequence of my 
late appointment ;* and as the new Legislature of this 
State are to meet on the 1st of August, it will be 
necessary that I shall leave this, so as to be there a 
day or two previous to their meeting. 

This I have also mentioned to General Putnam, 
and requested leave of absence for an unlimited 
time, as the affairs of Government render it uncer 
tain whether I shall be able, during the present cam 
paign, to return to the command of this post. 

It is with a degree of pain that I am under a 
necessity of asking permission, at this time, to quit 
the service, especially as the designs of the enemy 
are not fully known ; and should the business of my 
new appointment admit of it, I will most cheerfully 
return to the army, until the fate of the present 
campaign is determined. I am, with much esteem, 
Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

GEORGE CLINTON. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Saratoga, 28 July, 1777. 

DEAR, SIR, 

I am honored with your favor of the 24th instant, 
which I received half an hour ago, having just arrived 
from Moses Creek, where I keep my quarters. 

* He had recently been chosen Governor of the State of New York 



416 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

So far from the militia that are with me increas 
ing, they are daily diminishing, and I am very con 
fident that in ten days, if the enemy should not dis 
turb us, we shall not have five hundred left ; and al 
though I have entreated this and the Eastern States 
to send up a reenforcement of them, yet I doubt much 
if any will come up, especially from the Eastern 
States, where the spirit of malevolence knows no 
bounds, and I am considered as a traitor. 

I believe your Excellency has spared me all the 
troops you prudently could, but we are still too weak 
in this quarter, especially as sickness decreases us 
with great rapidity. Our men living entirely upon 
fresh meat occasions much disease. Salt meat we 
have none of, nor is any to be got in this quarter. 
If it can be spared from any post below, I wish a 
quantity may be ordered up. 

I have informed you that, on the 26th, an advanc 
ed picket was attacked near Fort Edward. Last night 
a body of regular troops appeared at that place, how 
ever not in such force but that they suffered our 
men, about one hundred and fifty in number, to come 
off unmolested. I believe their main body will be 
down in a few days. We are preparing to receive 
them in the best manner we can. 

I shall be happy to see General Lincoln. He may 
possibly be able to do something with the New T Eng 
land militia. 

I do not think it would be prudent, at present, to 
send General Arnold to Fort Schuyler. I w r ill try to 
send another General Officer to that place. I am, dear 
Sir, with great regard and esteem, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

PHILIP SCIIUYLER. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 417 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL PUTNAM. 

Peekskill, 31 July, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I received your favor of the 28th instant, and have, 
according to your direction, ordered two brigades, 
namely, General McDougall s and Huntington s, to 
put their heavy baggage over the river, and to be in 
readiness to march on the arrival of further orders. 
I have sent Lieutenant-Colonel Dimon to the White 
Plains, with his regiment, to relieve Colonel Cort- 
landt s detachment there, consisting of his own, Colo 
nel Livingston s, and a party from Colonels Durkee s 
and Chandler s regiments. 

You may think it not necessary to keep a party 
at the White Plains, but, unless we do, the inhabit 
ants will be ruined; their grass, grain, and cattle 
will all be taken off by the enemy. There are seven 
hundred militia at the forts and different posts, whose 
time is out to-day, and must be discharged. I have 
advised with General Clinton in respect to calling in 
the militia, and concluded that one thousand should 
be called for immediately, five hundred from Connects 
icut, and five hundred from this State ; and an ex 
press was immediately sent off to Governor Trumbull, 
requesting them to be sent without delay. But the 
season of the year renders it very difficult and doubt 
ful whether they will turn out or not. When the two 
brigades are marched, now under orders, there will be 
left on this side the river two small brigades, con 
sisting of two thousand three hundred and forty-seven, 
of which two thousand and fifty-one are returned fit 
for duty. Five hundred must be kept at the White 
Plains for the reasons above mentioned, five hundred 



418 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

at the Forts Independence, Montgomery, and Consti 
tution. A subaltern s guard is kept at Fredericksburg 
to guard the stores, another is necessary at Robin 
son s Mills for the same purpose, although, at pre 
sent, the latter is only a sergeant s. The men for the 
ships and boats are principally out of these brigades, 
so that there will not be left a thousand men to keep 
up our guards, and to defend this important post and 
the passes. There are, I am well assured, five or six 
thousand troops at King s Bridge and Fort Washington. 

You had not received my two last letters, I per 
ceive, at the time of writing yours. You will see, 
Sir, by this stating, how exposed and weak we are 
at this post, as well as the whole Eastern country, 
in case an attack should be made on any part. 

I am so unhappy as to differ from your Excellency 
with respect to the enemy s motions. Many consider 
ations concur to evince that this post, or some more 
eastward, will be the real point of attack. This will 
divide and distract the New England militia, directly 
coincide with General Burgoyne s operation, who is 
making his way to Albany, divide the Continent, faci 
litate the junction of their forces, and cut off all 
communication between the Northern and Southern 
States. In addition to this, their fleet was seen from 
Blue Point, standing eastward, of which I wrote you 
in my last. To draw the forces from this post, so as 
to return and get possession of the passes through 
the Highlands, is, I conceive, an object of so much 
consequence, that no cost or pains would be spared 
by General Howe for the obtainment of it. If it is 
not absolutely certain that the enemy are gone for 
Philadelphia, it is certain they may come here or go 
eastward; and should they, as they will, if my con 
jectures are right, it is certain the consequences must 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 419 

be very serious and unhappy, on account of so many 
of the troops being gone to the southward. 

If their real design is for this, or further eastward, 
it is very certain they would make as great show of 
a real intent to go to Philadelphia as possible. By 
a deserter, who canie from King s Bridge day before 
yesterday, I learn that three hundred horses, with 
wagons, are come from Long Island to King s Bridge; 
that they are building a new redoubt that is to mount 
six guns, which will be finished this week, and then 
they design to come out with a great foraging party, 
as they say; but something more is doubtless intend 
ed. But, if no more, Colonel Dimon s regiment will 
be unequal to their force, and it may be thought 
imprudent for me to leave this post. I am further 
informed by a Captain that has been in their service 
and left them, that there were two thousand men on 
Staten Island, two regiments of Hessians, and Cort- 
land Skinner s brigade. There is a report that Gen 
eral Burgoyne is at Saratoga. I am, most respect- 
fully, 

Your most obedient humble servant, 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Stillwatcr, 4 August, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

By the unanimous advice of all the General Offi 
cers, I have moved the army to this place. We pro 
pose to fortify our camp, in hopes that reenforce- 
ments will enable us to keep our ground, and pre 
vent the enemy from penetrating further into the 



420 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

country. But if I should be asked from whence I 
expect reinforcements, I should be at a loss for an 
answer, not having heard a word from the Massachu 
setts on my repeated applications ; nor am I certain 
that Connecticut will afford us any succour. Our 
Continental force is daily decreasing by desertion, 
sickness, and loss in skirmishes with the enemy ; and 
not a man of the militia, now with me, will remain 
above one week longer. And whilst our force is di 
minishing, that of the enemy augments by a constant 
acquisition of Tories ; but if we, by any means, could 
be put in a situation of attacking the enemy, and 
giving them a repulse, their retreat w r ould be so 
extremely difficult that, in all probability, they would 
lose the greater part of their army. I am, dear 
General, most respectfully, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

PHILIP SCIIUYLER. 



FROM GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Fort Montgomery, 9 August, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

Immediately on the receipt of your Excellency s 
letter, directing from one thousand to fifteen hundred 
of the militia of this and the State of Connecticut, 
to reenforce this garrison and the army under Gene 
ral Putnam, I issued orders for drawing out eight 
hundred and ten, including non-commissioned officers, 
from this State, for the above purposes. Since which 
I have been induced, from the situation of our affairs 
to the northward, in addition to the above numbers, 
to order out five hundred of the militia from the 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 421 

northern parts of Ulster and Duchess counties, one 
thousand from the county of Albany, and five hun 
dred from the county of Try on, to reenforce the 
army under the command of General Schuyler, and 
to continue in service until the first day of Novem 
ber next, unless your Excellency shall think proper 
to dismiss them before. Those from the two former 
counties, I have reason to believe, are by this time 
on their march, but I have not yet been advised 
what success they have experienced in getting the 
proportion allotted for the other counties. I fear, not 
so good as could be wished. The people in that 
quarter consider the Western frontier equally liable 
to the invasions of the enemy, and, influenced by 
this consideration, are unwilling to leave their fa 
milies exposed, and join our army. As the enemy 
advance, many of the best of the inhabitants are 
employed in moving off their families and effects. 
Indeed, I have always observed that the militia of 
any part of the country most in danger, are, for the 
above reasons, least forward in opposing an enemy. 
Some, too, decline acting under those circumstances, 
from unworthy principles. 

Your Excellency s letter of the 1st instant, dated 
at Chester, I received in Kingston, on Wednesday 
last, and thereupon ordered four regiments of militia 
to this place, three to join General Putnam at Peeks- 
kill, and one to occupy the post at the mouth of the 
Clove. The last of those ordered here arrived yes 
terday, and I learn from General Putnam, that those 
designed for him are also arrived at Peekskill. All 
the remainder of the militia of the State are under 
marching orders. 

I never knew the militia come out with greater 
alacrity ; but as many of them yet have great part 
VOL. i. 36 



422 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

of their harvests in the field; I fear it will be diffi 
cult to detain them long, unless the enemy make 
some movements that indicate a design of coming 
this way suddenly, and so obvious as to be believed 
by the militia. I cannot but express my surprise 
that no reinforcements, as I have heard, have yet 
arrived to our northern army from the eastward. 
The want of confidence in the General Officers to 
the northward, is the specious reason. To me it ap 
pears a very weak one. The mutilated and distressed 
condition of this State renders our utmost exertions 
to oppose the common enemy, in appearance but 
little, better than one half of it being out of our pos 
session. Common gratitude to a sister State, as well 
as duty to the Continent at large, conspire in calling 
on our eastern neighbours to step forth on this occa 
sion, and more especially as they only are in a situ 
ation totally to destroy General Burgoyne s army, by 
intercepting his supplies, and even cutting off his 
retreat to the Lakes. 

The detachment of eight hundred and ten for this 
garrison and Peekskill is not yet completed, owing 
to the body of the militia being so suddenly called 
out, but will be effected immediately on their return 
home ; till which time I will endeavour to detain an 
equal number of them here. 

I have not yet received the late resolves of Con 
gress for recruiting the army, alluded to in your Ex 
cellency s letter of the 4th instant. As soon as they 
come to hand, I will do every thing in my power 
to render them effectual, and forward the requested 
information. I am, with much esteem, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

GEORGE CLINTON. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 423 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Stillwater, 12 August, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

Agreeably to your Excellency s orders, I waited 
upon General Schuyler, on my way to the militia 
who had assembled and were assembling at Manches 
ter, on the Grants, received his instructions, and met 
the troops the 2d instant. I found only five or six 
hundred there; but one regiment was on the road 
from the Massachusetts, and about thirteen or fourteen 
hundred from New Hampshire. Before many of them 
arrived, I received General Schuyler s orders to join 
him, with all the troops excepting one small regi 
ment. Part of them began their march yesterday; 
the remainder were to leave the Grants this day. The 
army here is to take post upon a small island in the 
Mohawk River, where it unites with the Hudson. 
That post is supposed to be more favorable than the 
one now occupied by them. 

I am to return with the militia from the Massa 
chusetts, New Hampshire, and the Grants, to the 
northward, with a design to fall into the rear of Bur- 
goyne, who, from the best information we can obtain, 
hath left a very naked and uncovered rear, and, if 
possible, cut off his communication with the Lakes. 
This movement, probably, will cause him to reenforce 
the several posts of which he hath possessed himself, 
and which, at all hazards, he must attempt to main 
tain, or induce him to make a detachment with a 
view to attack us. In either case, it will greatly 
weaken his main body, and may give the force here 
an opportunity to act against them with success. The 
Massachusetts, I hear, have ordered out two thousand 



424 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

of their militia. From the best accounts we can ob 
tain, the enemy are not more than six thousand strong. 
If Burgoyne falls down into the country this way, I 
see nothing but he must be ruined, unless supported 
by General Howe, which, by his movements, he un 
doubtedly expects. 

I am happy to inform your Excellency, that I now 
enjoy my usual good state of health. I am, dear 
General, with sincere regard and esteem, 

Your most obedient, humble servant, 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 17 August, 1777; Sunday morning. 

SIR, 

The complaints of the want of men to the north 
ward are so great and urgent, that Congress, with a 
view of affording them some assistance, have come to 
the inclosed resolve ; by which you will perceive it 
is their desire that five hundred riflemen, under the 
command of an active officer, should be immediately 
sent into that department, to oppose the incursions of 
the Indians. 

Your favor of the 16th instant, I was last night 
honored with, containing sundry inclosures, which shall 
be communicated to Congress to-morrow. The plan 
you have adopted and recommended for the defence 
of the River Delaware, is ordered to be carried into 
execution. As soon as Congress shall come into any 
resolves on the subjects of your several letters, the- 
result shall be immediately transmitted. I have the 
honor to be, with the greatest respect, Sir, 

Your most obedient, and very humble servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK, President.

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Van Schaick s Island, in the mouth of the 
Mohawk River, 19 August, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have the honor to congratulate your Excellency 
on a signal victory gained by General Stark over a 
detachment of about fifteen hundred of the enemy 
near Bennington, on the 16th instant, an account 
whereof I have this moment received in a letter from 
General Lincoln, of which the following is a copy. 

"Bennington, August 18th, 1777. Dear General, 
the late signal success of a body of about two thou 
sand troops, mostly militia, under the command of 
Brigadier-General Stark, in this part of the country, 
on the 16th instant, over a party of about fifteen 
hundred of the enemy, who came out with a mani 
fest design to possess themselves of this town, as 
will appear by the inclosed, is an event happy and 
important. Our troops behaved in a very brave and 
heroic manner. They pushed the enemy from one 
work to another, thrown up on advantageous ground, 
and from different posts, with spirit and fortitude, 
until they gained a complete victory over them. 

" The following is the best list I have been able 
to obtain of the prisoners, their killed and wounded, 
namely : One Lieutenant-Colonel, one Major, five Cap 
tains, twelve Lieutenants, four Ensigns, two Cornets, 
one Judge-Advocate, one Baron, two Canadian officers, 
and three Surgeons, thirty-seven British soldiers, three 
hundred and ninety-eight Hessians, thirty-eight Cana 
dians, and one hundred and fifty-one Tories taken. 
The number of wounded fallen into our hands, ex 
clusive of the above, is about eighty. The number

of their slain has not yet been ascertained, as they 
fought on the retreat for several miles in a wood, 
hut supposed to he about two hundred. Their artil 
lery, which consisted of four brass field-pieces, with a 
considerable quantity of baggage, likewise fell into 
our hands. We have heard nothing of Burgoyne, or 
his army, for these two days past. The prisoners 
have been sent into the State of Massachusetts Bay, 
except the Tories. Shall wait your direction respect 
ing them, as most of them belong to the State of 
New York. We have now about two thousand at or 
near this place. 

" I am, dear General, with regard and esteem, 
"Your very humble servant, 

" BENJAMIN LINCOLN." 

"N. B. We had about twenty or thirty killed in 
the action, and perhaps fifty wounded." 

I also inclose copy of General Burgoyne s orders 
to Lieutenant-Colonel Baum, which were transmitted 
to me with the above. 

I have great hopes that we shall soon have the 
satisfaction of learning, that General Arnold has rais 
ed the siege of Fort Schuyler. General Gates, I am 
informed, arrived last night at Albany. I am, dear 
Sir, with the most respectful sentiments, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

PHILIP SCHUYLER. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 427 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GATES. 

Head-Quarters, 22 August, 1777. 

SIR, 

Upon my arrival in this department, I found the 
main body of the army encamped at Van Schaiek s 
Islands, which are made by the sprouts of the Mo 
hawk River joining with Hudson s River, nine miles 
north of Albany. A brigade, under General Poor, 
encamped at London s Ferry, on the south bank of the 
Mohawk River, five miles from hence, A brigade, 
under General Lincoln, had joined General Stark at 
Bennington; and a brigade, under General Arnold, 
marched the 15th instant to join the militia of Try on 
country, to raise the siege of Fort Stanwix. 

Upon my leaving Philadelphia, the prospect this 
way appeared most gloomy, but the severe checks 
the enemy have met with at Bennington and Tryon 
county, have given a more pleasing view of public 
affairs. Particular accounts of the signal victory gain 
ed by General Stark, and of the severe blow General 
Herkimer gave Sir John Johnson and the scalpers 
under his command, have been transmitted to your 
Excellency by General Schuyler. I anxiously expect 
the arrival of an express from General Arnold, with 
an account of the total defeat of the enemy in that 
quarter. By my calculation, he reached Fort Stanwix 
the day before yesterday. 

Colonels Livingston s and Cortlandt s regiments ar 
rived yesterday, and immediately joined General Poor s 
division. I shall also order General Arnold, upon his 
return, to march to that post. I cannot sufficiently 
thank your Excellency for sending Colonel Morgan s 
corps to this army; they will be of the greatest ser- 



428 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

vice to it; for, until the late success this way, I am 
told the army were quite panic-struck by the In 
dians, and their Tory and Canadian assassins in Indian 
dress. Horrible, indeed, have been the cruelties they 
have wantonly committed upon the miserable inhabit 
ants, insomuch that all is now fair with General Bur- 
goyne, even if the bloody hatchet he has so barba 
rously used should find its way into his own head. 

Governor Clinton will be here to-day. Upon his 
arrival, I shall consult with him and General Lincoln 
upon the best plan to distress, and I hope finally to 
defeat the enemy. I am sorry to be necessitated to 
acquaint your Excellency how neglectfully your or 
ders have been executed at Springfield; not any of 
the musket ball, or lead, which you ordered so long 
ago to be sent to this department, is yet arrived, 
and I am exceedingly distressed for the want of it. 
Upon my arrival at Albany, I despatched an express 
to Colonel Hughes, with the inclosed return of ord 
nance stores wanted in this department, and directed 
what he could not furnish might be immediately or 
dered to be supplied from Springfield. Few of the 
militia demanded are yet arrived, but I hear of great 
numbers upon the march. Your Excellency s advice 
in regard to Morgan s corps, &c., &c., shall be care 
fully observed. My scouts and spies inform me, that 
the enemy s head-quarters and main body are at Sa 
ratoga, and that they have lately been repairing the 
bridges between that place and Stillwater. 

As soon as times and circumstances will admit, I 
shall send your Excellency a general return of this 
army. I am, Sir, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Congress, 22 August, 1777; half past 1 o clock, P. M. 

SIR, 

This moment an express is arrived from Maryland, 
with an account of near two hundred sail of Mr. 
Howe s fleet, being at anchor in the Chesapeake Bay. 
A copy of the letter, brought by express, I inclose to 
you, and to which I refer you. In consequence of 
this advice, Congress have ordered the immediate re 
moval of all the stores and prisoners from Lancaster 
and York, in this State, to places of greater safety. 

Congress have this moment come to the inclosed 
resolution, to which I beg leave to refer you; and, 
indeed, I need not add, as the whole matter is sub 
mitted to you. I will not detain the express only to 
say, that I am, with every sentiment of esteem and 
respect, Sir, 

Your very humble servant,

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 1 September, 1777. 

SIR, 

Your several favors to the 30th ultimo, inclusive, I 
have had the honor of receiving, in the order of their 
dates. 

From the inclosed resolves, you will perceive that 
the Congress have appointed a committee to collect 
and arrange the evidence relative to the evacuation 
of Ticonderoga, which will be afterwards transmitted 



430 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

to you, that a court-martial may be thereupon insti 
tuted for the trial of the General Officers who were 
in the Northern Department when the evacuation took 
place. 

The great demand for arms to equip the militia, 
who are called into service, has induced the Congress 
to pass the inclosed resolve, directing that a number 
of workmen, conversant in the business of repairing 
firelocks, should be immediately detached from the 
militia, to be employed in repairing the arms in this 
city, there being between two and three thousand 
that in a short time may be rendered fit for use. 

I have the pleasure to congratulate you on our 
further success in the Northern Department, in raising 
the siege of Fort Schuyler. The enemy, on the ap 
proach of General Arnold, fled with the utmost pre 
cipitation, leaving behind them their tents, ammuni 
tion, provision, &c. As I forward herewith several 
letters for you from that quarter, which I make no 
doubt contain an account of the matter, I beg leave 
to refer you to them for further particulars. I have 
the honor to be, with the greatest respect, Sir, 

Your most obedient, and very humble servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK, President. 



FROM GOVERNOR HENRY. 

Williamsburg, 5 September, 1&lt;77. 



SIR, 

Edmund Randolph, Esq., communicated to me that 
part of your last letter to him, in which you are 
pleased to take notice of your lady s reception at this 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 431 

place. I beg you to be assured, that every expres 
sion of regard falls far short of that which I feel, and 
shall retain through life, for such distinguished merit. 

You are pleased also to observe, that you have not 
received any answer from me to your two favors of 
the loth of April and 17th of May last. The latter 
has never been received ; the former would have been 
answered, but really, when I have considered the ex 
tent, variety, and importance of the things which oc 
cupy your attention, I have been afraid of pestering 
you with letters. The scheme of embodying volun 
teers was no more thought of after the receipt of 
yours, in which it appeared to be against your wishes. 
In that, as in every military measure, I shall be 
solely guided by your opinions. 

Upon the appearance of the British fleet, about 
three thousand militia were embodied. They have 
shown great alacrity. A third part of the militia of 
Prince William, Loudoun, Fairfax, Culpepper, Fau- 
quier, Berkeley, Dunmore, and Frederic, is ordered to 
rendezvous at Fredericktown, in Maryland, and there 
to await your orders. I have thought it of great 
consequence to throw some troops on the eastern 
shore. But it is rather disagreeable to the militia, 
and, for want of more regulars, two companies only are 
gone there. Colonel N. Gist, with seventeen Chero- 
kees, being here, chose also to go over, and is gone. 

Although a good peace is made with the Chero- 
kees, yet our south-western frontier is much harassed 
with small parties of Indians. General Hand expects 
pretty warm work about Pittsburg. 

Could any particular assistance to you be rendered 
by Virginia, at this juncture, I should be made happy. 
Early intelligence of the enemy s motions may be of 
the highest moment, should they come down the Bay.

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 6 September, 1777. 

SIR, 

You will perceive, from the inclosed resolves, that 
Congress, desirous of reenforcing the army at this 
critical period, have recommended to the States of 
Pennsylvania and New Jersey to order out immedi 
ately a considerable part of their militia; and I have 
no doubt of their compliance. 

I have wrote to Governor Livingston on the sub 
ject, and informed him that, should he think proper 
to appoint General Dickinson to the command of the 
three thousand requested from that State, it will bo 
extremely agreeable to Congress. That gentleman 
has, I understand, signified his readiness to act when 
ever called upon; and, as he possesses the confidence 
of the militia, and has talents equal to the task, I 
am persuaded the appointment will give general sa 
tisfaction. 

Your favor of the 3d instant, and likewise of yes 
terday by the hands of General St. Clair, I have been 
duly honored with. The latter I shall lay before 
Congress this morning. I have the honor to be, with 
the greatest respect, Sir,

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 9 September, 1777. 

SIR, 

I have the honor to transmit, at this time, copies 
of the several letters from General Livingston and 
General Ducoudray to Congress. As Governor Li 
vingston seems apprehensive of an irruption from the 
enemy on Staten Island, and says they are collecting 
there for this purpose, the Congress have directed 
General Putnam to hold in readiness fifteen hundred 
men, under the command of a Brigadier, to cross the 
North River when you may think proper to order it. 
A copy of the resolve I shall immediately forward 
to General Putnam. 

The inclosed letter, from Monsieur Ducoudray, con 
tains a proposal of forming a camp between Wil 
mington and Philadelphia, the propriety of which the 
Congress have referred entirely to you. Colonel Har 
rison s favor of the 7th instant was duly received. I 
beg leave to request your attention to the inclosures ;

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL DICKINSON. 

Elizabcthtown, 20 September, 1777; 
G o clock, P.M. 

SIR, 

I wrote your Excellency this morning, since which 
I have had the honor of receiving your favor of yes 
terday s date. Your Excellency will be much sur 
prised to hear there are not more than one thousand 
of our militia now embodied, all of which are at this 
post. Since the receipt of your Excellency s letters, 
I have been considering in what way I could most 
speedily reenforce the army under your Excellency s 
command, as that is the object; and I am clearly of 
opinion, that the most expeditious is, to march the 
troops from this post, and collect what numbers I can 
upon our march. I shall, therefore, order all the guards 
called in before day, and march, with the utmost ex 
pedition, the routes directed. Your Excellency may 
be assured my utmost exertions shall not be wanting 
upon the present occasion. 

I flatter myself I shall be able, in a short time, to 
bring on a reinforcement of two thousand men. Had 
it not been for the late unlucky alarm in this State, 



THE AMEKICAN REVOLUTION. 435 

I have great reason to believe, I should have crossed 
the Delaware with four thousand men. I have order 
ed General Wines to collect and march his brigade 
to this post, with all despatch. This State will be in 
a very defenceless situation, and there is little doubt 
but the enemy will soon be apprised of it, and make 
ji visit. I am a little apprehensive many of the men 
will desert us before we cross the Delaware, having 
dreadful apprehensions from the vicinity of the ene 
my. Every precaution shall be used to keep them 
together, and bring them on speedily. I have the 
honor to be, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant,

Lancaster, 24 September, 1777. 

SIR, 

In consequence of your letter of the 22d, directed 
to the President, or any member of Congress, I have 
conferred with William Henry, Esq., of this place, 
upon the most expeditious method of collecting the 
arms and accoutrements in the hands of the inhabit 
ants here; and he is of opinion that it may be ac 
complished by your warrant to him, grounded on the 
late resolution of Congress for that and other pur 
poses. As there is not a prospect of having a Con 
gress, or Board of War, for several days, to give him 
authority, and the articles are immediately wanted,

he has consented to proceed on the business without 
delay, in expectation that, on the receipt of this, you 
will give him full powers to justify his conduct, and 
date them the 22d, that the time of his transaction 
may comport with his commission. 

With wishes of success to your Excellency, and the 
cause in which you are engaged, I remain, Sir, very 
respectfully,

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Yorktown, in Pennsylvania, 30 September, 1777. 

SIR, 

Since my departure from Philadelphia, I have to 
acknowledge the receipt of your favors to the 23d 
instant. I met the Congress on Saturday last, at 
Lancaster, and, upon consultation, it was judged most 
prudent to adjourn to this place, where we now are, 
and where we can prosecute business without inter 
ruption, and where your despatches will meet us. 

I have just now received, by General Gates s 
Aid-de-camp, Major Troup, sundry letters, copies of 
which I have the honor to inclose to you, by which 
it appears that our affairs in the Northern Depart 
ment wear a favorable aspect, and I hope soon to 
transmit you an account of an issue to the contest 
in that quarter. 

I wish soon to receive the most pleasing accounts 
from you. We are in daily expectation of agreeable 
tidings, and that General Howe is totally reduced.

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GATES. 

Head-Quarters, Camp, Behmus s Heights, 
5 October, 1777. 

SIR, 

Since the action of the 19th ultimo, the enemy 
have kept the ground they occupied the morning of 
that day, and fortified their camp. The advanced sen 
tries of my pickets are posted within shot, and oppo 
site the enemy s. Neither side have given ground an 
inch. In this situation, your Excellency would not 
wish me to part with the corps the army of General 
Burgoyne are most afraid of. From the best intelli 
gence, he has not more than three weeks provision in 
store ; it will take him at least eight days to get 
back to Ticonderoga ; so that, in a fortnight at far 
thest, he must decide w r hether he will rashly risk, at 
infinite disadvantage, to force my camp, or retreat to 
his den. In either case, I must have the fairest pros 
pect to be able to reenforce your Excellency, in a 
more considerable manner than by a single regiment. 

I ain sorry to repeat to your Excellency the dis 
tress I have suffered for want of a proper supply of 
musket cartridges from Springfield, or the materials to 
make them. The inclosed, from the Commissary of 
Ordnance Stores at Albany, will convince your Excel 
lency of the truth of this assertion. My anxiety, also, 
upon account of provisions has been inexpressible ; a

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL PUTNAM. 

Fishkill, 6 o clock, Wednesday morning, 
8 October, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

It is with the utmost reluctance I now sit down 
to inform you that the enemy, after making a vari 
ety of movements up and down the North River, land 
ed, on the morning of the 4th instant, about three 
thousand men, at Tarrytown; and, after making an 
excursion about five miles up the country, they re 
turned and embarked. The morning following they 
advanced up near King s Ferry, and landed on the 
east side of the river ; but in the evening part of 
them reembarked, and, the morning after, landed a 
little above King s Ferry, on the west side ; but the 
morning being so exceeding foggy concealed their 
scheme, and prevented us from gaining any idea what 
number of troops they landed. In about three hours 
we discovered a large fire at the Ferry, which we 
imagined to be the store-houses, upon which it was 
thought they only landed with a view of destroying 
the said houses. 

The picket and scouts, which we had out, could not 
learn the exact number of the enemy that were re 
maining on the east side of the river; but, from the 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 439 

best accounts, they were about fifteen hundred. At 
this same time a number of ships, galleys, &c., with 
about forty flat-bottomed boats, made every appear 
ance of their intentions to land troops, both at Fort 
Independence and Peekskill Landing. Under all these 
circumstances, my strength, being not more than 
twelve hundred Continental troops and three hundred 
militia, prevented me from detaching off a party to 
attack the enemy that lay on the east side of the 
river. After we had thought it impracticable to quit 
the heights, which we had then possession of, and 
attack the enemy, Brigadier-General Parsons and my 
self went to reconnoitre the ground near the enemy, 
and, on our return from thence, we were alarmed 
with a very heavy and hot firing, both of small arms 
and cannon, at Fort Montgomery, which immediately 
convinced me that the enemy had landed a large 
body of men at the time and place before-mentioned. 
Upon which, I immediately detached off five hundred 
men to reenforce the garrison. But before they could 
possibly cross the river to their assistance, the ene 
my, who were far superior in numbers, had possessed 
themselves of the fort. Never did men behave with 
more spirit and alacrity than our troops upon this oc 
casion. They repulsed the enemy three times, which 
were in number at least five to one. Governor Clin 
ton and General James Clinton were both present; 
but the engagement continuing until the dusk of the 
evening, gave them both an opportunity, together with 
several officers and a number of privates, to make 
their escape. 

The loss of the enemy in this affair, Governor 
Clinton thinks must be very considerable. Our loss, 
killed and wounded, is by no means equal to what 
he might have expected. General James Clinton was 



440 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

wounded in the thigh, but I hope not mortally. Go 
vernor Clinton arrived at Peekskill the same evening, 
about eleven o clock; and, with the advice of him, 
General Parsons, and several other officers, it was 
thought impossible to maintain the post at Peekskill 
with the force then present, against one that the 
enemy might, in a few hours, bring on the heights 
in our rear. It was, therefore, agreed that the stores 
ought to be immediately removed to some secure 
place, and the troops take post at Fishkill, until a 
reinforcement of militia should come to their aid. 

I have repeatedly informed your Excellency of the 
enemy s design against this post ; but, from some mo 
tive or other, you always differed with me in opinion. 
As this conjecture of mine has, for once, proved right, 
I cannot omit informing you that my real and sin 
cere opinion is, that they now mean to join General 
Burgoyne, with the utmost despatch. I have written 
General Gates, and informed him of the situation of 
our affairs in this quarter. Governor Clinton is ex 
erting himself in collecting the militia of this State. 
Brigadier-General Parsons I have sent off to forward 
in the Connecticut militia, which are now arriving in 
great numbers. I therefore hope and trust that, in 
the course of a few days, I shall be able to oppose 
the progress of the enemy. Time will not permit me 
to add any thing more respecting the engagement, 
only that our loss (I believe, from the best informa 
tion,) does not exceed two hundred and fifty, killed, 
wounded, and taken prisoners. This evening I in 
tend writing you again, but am now very busy. I 
am, dear General, with sincere regard, 

Your very obedient, humble servant, 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 441 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL PUTNAM. 

Fishkill, 8 October, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

Since I wrote you this morning, I have waited on 
Governor Clinton, to consult about our present cir 
cumstances, and fix upon the most effectual measure 
that could be pursued against the enemy, w r ho are 
now landing a considerable number of troops at Fort 
Constitution, and proceeding up the river with their 
ships, galleys, flat-bottomed boats, &c. They will, from 
all appearance, be at the chevaux-de-frise in the space 
of an hour. They well know the situation of our 
troops, and I sincerely believe that their intentions 
are to make all expedition to get above us. I do 
not think weighing the chevcmx-de-frise is a matter of 
great moment to them. 

If they cannot effect it with the greatest ease, 
they w T ill proceed up the river with the flat-bottomed 
boats, and such small vessels as can convey the bag 
gage of the troops, stores, &c., to Half-Moon. If 
they attempt to march by land, on the west side the 
river, Governor Clinton will annoy them as much as 
possible with about four hundred Continental troops, 
which I yesterday detached over, and the militia, 
which he is now collecting. If this side should be 
their route, I will, with the remainder of the Conti 
nental troops and the Connecticut militia (which, I am 
happy to inform your Excellency, are coming in very 
fast), oppose them to the utmost of my power. All 
our stores, baggage, &c., except a few barrels of flour 
and bread, are removed from Peekskill. I have now 
a small guard at that place, and, if I can with any 
safety remove it from thence, I shall be glad. All 
the ordnance stores, which are not immediately want- 



442 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

ed, I .have ordered to the eastward. All our bag 
gage, except what is absolutely necessary, I shall 
send off in the morning to some place of security; 
after which my troops will be light, and I flatter 
myself will either be able to fight them, or keep 
pace, should they keep upon the water. 

I have the pleasure to inform you that many more 
of our troops made their escape than w r hat I was at 
first informed of. Colonel Dubois, who is one of the 
number, this day collected near two hundred of his 
regiment, that got off after the enemy were in the fort. 
About five o clock the enemy demanded a surrender 
of the fort; but, to their surprise, and the honor of 
our commanders, they had an answer that it should 
be defended to the utmost of their power. This re 
newed the action with double ardor, which continued 
till quite dark, when the enemy (who, we have since 
learnt, were five thousand in number) forced our 
lines ; after which, our troops would not surrender, 
but fought with bayonets, swords, &c., in such a man 
ner as reflects the highest honor on our noble gar 
rison. General James Clinton was wounded with a 
bayonet in his thigh, and a number of other officers 
and men with the same weapon. 

Yours, of the 1st instant, I have this day received. 
The ten pieces of artillery you mention were ordered 
from Springfield by Congress, two of which, from a 
request of General James Clinton, were sent to Fort 
Montgomery ; two I have with me ; and the other six 
are on the other side the river, with Governor Clin 
ton. I am, dear General, with great regard, 

Your obedient, humble servant, 

ISRAEL PUTNAM.

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 443 

FKOM THOMAS MCREAN. 

Newark, [Delaware] 8 October, 1777. 

SIR, 

By the captivity of President McKinly, of the 
Delaware State, on the 12th of last month, and the 
absence of the Vice-President, the command in chief 
devolved on me, as Speaker of the Assembly, agreea 
bly to the Constitution. I had some time before ac 
cepted the office of Chief Justice of Pennsylvania, 
and, at the time this unfortunate event happened, 
was out of the Delaware State, but thought it my 
duty to my country to repair thither, which I did on 
the 20th following. On my arrival, I found that all 
the records and public papers of the county of New 
castle, and every shilling of the public money, to 
gether with the fund belonging to the Trustees of 
Newark Academy, and upwards of twenty-five thou 
sand dollars in the Continental Loan-Office, &c. &c., 
had been captured at Wilmington, at the same time 
the President was taken by the enemy. The people 
were dispirited and dispersed; and the Tories, and 
less virtuous part that remained, were daily employed 
in supplying the British troops, both in Wilmington 
and at Newcastle, on board the ships of war, with all 
kinds of provisions. 

Among other things, I called out the one half of 
the militia into actual service, and ordered the re 
mainder to be in readiness to march at an hour s 
warning; and, to render the service as easy and as 
agreeable as possible, allowed the Colonel or com 
manding officer of every battalion in the State to 
assign posts to the militia within the bounds of the 
battalion. My intention was afterwards to reduce the 
number of posts, and to strengthen those nearest the 



444 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

enemy, and, if a sufficient force could be collected, 
to advance towards them. Above ten days were em 
ployed in this experiment, almost in vain. The Whigs 
in Sussex county are said to be rather too few to 
keep the Tories there quiet, the latter being most 
numerous. The same is said of Kent county, anc 1 
the militia there absolutely refuse to march out ol 
that county. In Newcastle county the lower class 
of the people have got an opinion that, by remain 
ing quiet, they will not be molested, and seem un 
willing to join their officers, or that any troops should 
be assembled in their neighbourhood ; and many of 
the officers and better sort of the inhabitants appre 
hend that, by attempting any thing without the as 
sistance of the others, they will expose themselves to 
certain destruction. 

This, Sir, is a true portrait of the Delaware State, 
at present, and I really fear a total defection, with 
out some effectual remedy is speedily applied. There 
are so many virtuous and brave men in the State, 
who will be sacrificed to their inveterate enemies, by 
leaving them in their present situation, that my blood 
runs cold at the reflection. The only remedy I can 
suggest is, to have a regiment of Continental troops 
forthwith despatched here to Newark. This will give 
new life to the virtuous, who will immediately join 
them; and, from their example and through their 
influence, I make no doubt most of the lower class 
will come forth. By this means, our internal enemies 
will be kept in awe, and, by securing some of them 
(which must be done), the spirit of the rest will be 
broken, and our foreign enemies will be no longer 
supplied with necessaries, and, very probably, be 
obliged either to throw in more troops to Wilming 
ton, which will, in proportion, weaken their army op- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 445 

posed to you, or to abandon it entirely. If a greater 
force could be spared from the main army (say five 
hundred good men), Avith some officers of abilities, and 
some field-pieces, the reconquest of Wilmington might 
be meditated. 

Upon the whole, Sir, you will judge for yourself, 
and the common good, and do what you think best 
at this critical period. If you are in force, you will 
spare as many men as requisite ; if not, the Dela 
ware State must take its fate, and not occasion the 
loss of a battle, which may prove more injurious to 
the common cause, though I shudder at the thought. 

With heart-felt gratitude to the Divine Disposer 
of all events, and next, to you, I received an account 
of your success on Saturday last, from some Quak 
ers returning to Nottingham, in Chester county, and 
to Elkridge, in Baltimore county, from their yearly 
meeting at Philadelphia, which you broke up on Sa 
turday night, by the actions of the day. These men 
would not relate a single word of any thing that 
happened at Philadelphia, during the eight days they 
were there ; saying they did not go there to carry or 
to bring news, and seemed unwilling even to stop so 
long as to make this speech. However, I compelled 
them to stop, made them dismount, and examined 
them separately, and in private. They said, at first, 
they had no new r s, &c. I mention these minute cir 
cumstances to satisfy you that their account, being 
given with great reluctance, was that of the Tories 
and the English themselves. 

It is, in brief, as follows ; That you attacked the 
picket of the enemy, consisting of four or five hun 
dred men, near Beggarstown, about three o clock in 
the morning, and drove them until supported by the 
British light infantry, at which time you had taken 
VOL. i. 38 



446 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

nine field-pieces, and killed or taken most of the 
picket ; that the infantry were driven near two miles 
into Germantown ; that they are all cut off except a 
very few; that, at Germantown,, there were thirty- 
five o f some English General s guard killed, and it 
was supposed he himself was taken prisoner ; that, 
during the action, all the British troops, except part 
of a regiment of grenadiers, not exceeding fifty, went 
from Philadelphia, and joined General Howe, who 
commanded in person ; that the main body of the 
enemy were at the end of Germantown next Phila 
delphia, and, upon their advancing, were once repuls 
ed by you ; but afterwards, about nine o clock, oblig 
ed the Americans to retreat to the ground they oc 
cupied the day preceding ; that General Agnew was 
killed ; and John Pierpoint, one of the examinants, 
said, he saw two Hessian Generals brought into the 
city wounded, one of them mortally, the other not so 
badly; that a great number of Colonels and many 
other officers were killed, and about a thousand men; 
that one hundred wagons, and upwards, came into the 
city after night, about nine o clock, with the wound 
ed ; some had three, others seven, and between these 
numbers, in them, according to the severity of their 
wounds, as they were told ; that a Virginia regiment 
had grounded their arms, and, with others, amounting 
in the whole to five hundred rebels, were taken pri 
soners by the English, and that General Wayne was 
killed; but they heard of no other American officer 
of distinction that was. 

They further said, they heard that the English 
could never form until they joined their main body 
below Germantown, and that you had the advantage 
of the ground ; that a wounded Hessian told one of 
them, that he had fought French and Spaniards, but 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 447 

that the rebels would beat them both; and that he 
had never seen men fight as they did ; and, in fine, 
that though the English had got the ground, which 
they called the victory, it w r as agreed, on all hands, 
that the British had not met with so great a loss 
since they came to America. 

John Pierpoint, who seemed willing enough to tell 
all he knew, informed me that the Delaware frigate 
was given up by the pressed men on board ; that 
there were but two brass cannon, twelve-pounders, 
fired from the fort upon the frigate, and but one 
man killed in the fort, and one in the frigate ; that 
she was manned with English, and lay above the 
town on Sunday morning, when he came away; that 
the English had strong lines, some heavy cannon, 
and a fortification, about half way between German- 
town and the City, as he was told ; that the Quakers 
could get no provender but hay for their horses ; 
that butter had sold from three shillings and nine- 
pence to five shillings a pound; and that a famine 
was expected by the citizens in general, though some 
said they might subsist for a month. A Mr. Hus 
bands told me he saw upwards of two thousand 
troops at Chester, on Monday last, escorting wagons, 
that were loaded from thirteen ships which lay there ; 
that four men-of-war were then at the chevaux-de-frise, 
and that he saw two hundred and fifty Hessians, 
who had crossed Schuylkill on the same day, pro 
ceeding down the neck towards Delaware, it was 
supposed, to forage, plunder, &c. This is all that 
seems, in any degree, worth communicating ; indeed, 
none of it is perhaps worth your reading; however, 
if any use can be made of it, you have it.* 

If your Excellency attacks and disables a thou-

FROM THE REVEREND JACOB DUCIIE. 

[Philadelphia], 8 October, 1777* 

SIR, 

If this letter should find you in Council, or in the 
field, before you read another sentence, I beg you to 
take the first opportunity of retiring, and weighing 
its important contents. You are perfectly acquainted 
with the part I formerly took in the present unhap 
py contest, I was, indeed, among the first to bear 



* This extraordinary letter was immediately transmitted by Washing 
ton to Congress. In a letter to the President of Congress, dated Octo- 
ber 16th, which accompanied it, he wrote as follows; 

" I yesterday, through the hands of Mrs. Ferguson, of Graham Park, 
received a letter, of a very curious and extraordinary nature, from Mr. 
Duche, which I have thought proper to transmit to Congress. To this 
ridiculous, illiberal performance, I made a short reply, by desiring the 
bearer of it, if she should hereafter, by any accident, meet Mr. Duche, 
to tell him I should have returned it unopened, if I had had any idea 
of the contents; observing, at the same time, that I highly disapproved 
the intercourse she seemed to have been carrying on, and expected it 
would be discontinued. Notwithstanding the author s assertion, I cannot 
but suspect that the measure did not originate with him, and that he 
was induced to it by the hope of establishing his interest and peace more 
effectually with the enemy." 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 449 

my public testimony against having any recourse to 
threats, or indulging a thought of an armed opposition. 

The current, however, was too strong for my feeble 
efforts to resist. I wished to follow my countrymen 
as far only as virtue, and the righteousness of their 
cause, would permit me. I was, however, prevailed 
on, among the rest of my clerical brethren of this 
city, to gratify the pressing desires of my fellow-citi 
zens, by preaching a sermon to the second city batta 
lion. I was pressed to publish this sermon, arid reluct 
antly consented. From a personal attachment, of 
near twenty years standing, and a high respect for 
your character, in private as well as public life, I 
took the liberty of dedicating this sermon to you. I 
had your affectionate thanks for my performance, in 
a letter, wherein was expressed, in the most delicate 
and obliging terms, your regard for me, and your 
wishes for a continuance of my friendship and appro 
bation of your conduct. Farther than this I intended 
not to proceed. My sermon speaks for itself, and 
wholly disclaims the idea of independency. My sen 
timents were well known to my friends. I com 
municated them, without reserve, to many respect 
able members of Congress, who expressed their warm 
approbation of it then. I persisted, to the very last 
moment, to use the prayers for my Sovereign, though 
threatened with insults from the violence of a party. 

Upon the declaration of independency, I called 
my vestry, and solemnly put the question to them, 
whether they thought it best, for the peace and wel 
fare of the congregation, to shut up the churches, or 
to continue the service, without using the prayers for 
the Royal Family. This was the sad alternative. I 
concluded to abide by their decision, as I could not 
have time to consult my spiritual superiors in Eng- 
38* 



450 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

land. They determined it most expedient, under such 
critical circumstances, to keep open the churches, that 
the congregations might not be dispersed, which we 
had great reason to apprehend. 

A very few days after the fatal declaration of in 
dependency, I received a letter from Mr. Hancock, 
sent by express to Gerrnantown, where my family 
were for the summer season, acquainting me I was 
appointed Chaplain to the Congress, and desired my 
attendance next morning, at nine o clock. Surprised 
and distressed, as I was, by an event I was not pre 
pared to expect; obliged to give an immediate at- 
tendance, without the opportunity of consulting my 
friends, I easily accepted the appointment, I could 
have but one motive for taking this step. I thought 
the churches in danger, and hoped, by this means, 
to have been instrumental in preventing those ills I 
had so much reason to apprehend. I can, however, 
with truth, declare, I then looked upon independ 
ency rather as an expedient, and hazardous, or, in 
deed, thrown out in terror em, in order to procure some 
favorable terms, than a measure that was seriously 
persisted in, at all events. My sudden change of 
conduct will clearly evince this to have been my 
idea of the matter. 

Upon the return of the Committee of Congress 
appointed to confer with Lord Howe, I soon dis 
cerned their whole intentions. The different accounts 
which each member gave of this conference, the time 
they took to make up the matter for public view, 
and the amazing disagreements between the news 
paper accounts and the relation I myself had from 
the mouth of one of the Committee, convinced me 
there must have been some unfair and ungenerous 
procedure. This determination to treat on no other 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 451 

strain than that of independency, which put it out 
of his Lordship s power to mention any terms at all, 
was sufficient proof to me that independency was the 
idol they had long wished to set up, and that, rather 
than sacrifice this, they would deluge their country 
with blood. From this moment I determined upon 
my resignation, and, in the beginning of October, 
1776, sent it, in form, to Mr. Hancock, after having 
officiated only two months and three weeks; and 
from that time, as far as my safety would permit, 
I have been opposed to all their measures. 

This circumstantial account of my conduct, I think 
due to the friendship you were so obliging as to ex 
press for me, and, I hope, will be sufficient to justify 
my seeming inconsistencies in the part I have acted. 

And now, dear Sir, suffer me, in the language of 
truth and real affection, to address myself to you. 
All the world must be convinced you are engaged in 
the service of your country from motives perfectly 
disinterested. You risked every thing that was dear 
to you, abandoned the sweets of domestic life, which 
your affluent fortune can give the uninterrupted en 
joyment of. But had you, could you have had, the 
least idea of matters being carried to such a dan 
gerous extremity? Your most intimate friends shud 
dered at the thought of a separation from the mother 
country, and I took it for granted that your senti 
ments coincided with theirs. What, then, can be the 
consequence of this rash and violent measure, and 
degeneracy of representation, confusion of councils, 
blunders without number ? The most respectable cha 
racters have withdrawn themselves, and are succeed 
ed by a great majority of illiberal and violent men. 
Take an impartial view of the present Congress, and 
what can you expect from them ? Your feelings 



452 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

must be greatly hurt by the representation of your 
native Province. You have no longer a Randolph, 
a Bland ; or a Braxton, men whose names will ever 
be revered, whose demands never ran above the first 
ground on which they set out, and whose truly glo 
rious and virtuous sentiments I have frequently heard 
with rapture from their own lips. Oh ! my dear Sir, 
what a sad contrast of characters now presents ; oth 
ers, whose friends can ne er mingle with your own. 
Your Harrison alone remains, and he disgusted with 
the unworthy associates. 

As to those of my own Province, some of them 
arc so obscure, that their very names w r ere never in 
my ears before, and others have only been distin 
guished for the weakness of their understandings, 
and the violence of their tempers. One alone I ex 
cept from the general charge ; a man of virtue, drag 
ged reluctantly into their measures, and restrained, 
by some false ideas of honor, from retreating, after 
having gone too far. You cannot be at a loss to dis 
cover whose name answers to this character. 

From the New England provinces can you find 
one that, as a gentleman, you could wish to associate 
with, unless the soft and mild address of Mr. Han 
cock can atone for his want of every other qualifica 
tion necessary for the seat which he fills? Bank 
rupts, attorneys, and men of desperate fortunes, are 
his colleagues. Maryland no longer sends a Tilgh- 
man and a protestant Carroll. Carolina has lost her 
Lynch ; and the elder Middleton has retired. Are 
the dregs of Congress, then, still to influence a mind 
like yours ? These are not the men you engaged to 
serve ; these are not the men that America has chosen 
to represent her. Most of them were chosen by a 
little, low faction, and the few gentlemen that are 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 453 

among them now are well known to lie on the ba 
lance, and looking up to your hand alone to turn the 
beam. Tis you, Sir, and you only, that support the 
present Congress; of this you must be fully sensible. 
Long before they left Philadelphia, their dignity and 
consequence were gone ; what must it be now, since 
their precipitate retreat ? I write with freedom, but 
without invective ; I know these things to be true, 
and I write to one whose own observation must have 
convinced him that it is so. 

After this view of the Congress, turn to the army. 
The whole world knows that its only existence de 
pends upon you ; that your death or captivity dis 
perses it in a moment, and that there is not a man 
on that side the question, in America, capable of suc 
ceeding you. As to the army itself, what have you 
to expect from them ? Have they not frequently 
abandoned you yourself, in the hour of extremity ? 
Can you have the least confidence in a set of undis 
ciplined men and officers, many of whom have been 
taken from the lowest of the people, without prin 
ciple, without courage ? Take away them that sur 
round your person, how very few are there you can 
ask to sit at your table ! As to your little navy, of 
that little, what is left ? Of the Delaware fleet, part 
are taken, and the rest must soon surrender. Of 
those in the other provinces, some are taken, one or 
two at sea, and others lying unmanned and unrigged 
in your harbours. 

And now, where are your resources ? Oh ! my 
dear Sir, how sadly have you been abused by a fac 
tion void of truth, and void of tenderness to you and 
your country ! They have amused you with hopes of 
a declaration of war on the part of France. Believe 
me, from the best authority, it was a fiction from the 



454 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

first. Early in the year 1776, a French gentleman 
was introduced to me, with whom I became inti 
mately acquainted. His business, to all appearance, 
was to speculate in the mercantile way. But, I be 
lieve, it will be found that in his country he moved 
in a higher sphere. He saw your cause. lie became 
acquainted with all your military preparations. He was 
introduced to Congress, and engaged with them in a 
commercial contract. In the course of our intimacy, 
he has frequently told me, that he hoped the Ameri 
cans would never think of independency. He gave me 
his reasons. "Independency can never be supported, 
unless France should declare war against England. 
I well know the state of her finances. Years to 
come will not put them in a situation to enter upon 
a breach with England. At this moment, there arc 
two parties in the Court of Versailles ; one enlisted 
under the Duke de Choiseul, the other under the 
Count Maurepas. Choiseul has no chance of succeed 
ing, though he is violent for war Maurepas must get 
the better; he is for economy and peace." This was 
his information, which I mentioned to several mem 
bers of Congress. They treated it as a fable, depend 
ing entirely on Dr. Franklin s intelligence. 

The truth of the matter is this ; - - Dr. Franklin 
built upon the success of Choiseul. Upon his arrival 
in France, he found him out of place, his counsels 
reprobated, and his party dwindled into an insigni 
ficant faction. This you may depend upon to be the 
true state of affairs in France, or the court of Dr. F. ; 
and, further, by vast numbers of letters found on 
board prizes taken by the king s ships, it appears 
that all commerce with the merchants, through whom 
all your supplies have been conveyed, will be at an 
end, the letters being full of complaints of no remit- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 455 

tances from America, and many individuals having 
generally suffered. 

From your friends in England you have nothing to 
expect. Their numbers have diminished to a cipher ; 
the spirit of the whole nation is in activity ; a few 
sounding names among the nobility, though perpe 
tually ringing in your ears, are without character, 
without influence. Disappointed ambition has made 
them desperate, and they only wish to make the de 
luded Americans instruments of revenge. All orders 
and ranks of men in Great Britain are now unani 
mous, and determined to risk their all with content. 
Trade and manufactures are found to flourish, and 
new channels are continually offering, that will per 
haps more than supply the loss of the old. 

In America, your harbours are blocked up, your 
cities fall one after another; fortress after fortress, 
battle after battle is lost. A British army, after 
having passed unmolested through a vast extent of 
country, have possessed theniselves of the Capital of 
America. How unequal the contest ! How fruitless 
the expense of blood ! Under so many discouraging 
circumstances, can virtue, can honor, can the love of 
your country, prompt you to proceed? Humanity it 
self, and sure humanity is no stranger to your breast, 
calls upon you to desist. Your army must perish for 
want of common necessaries, or thousands of innocent 
families must perish to support them ; wherever they 
encamp, the country must be impoverished ; wherever 
they march, the troops of Britain will pursue, and 
must complete the destruction which America herself 
has begun. Perhaps it may be said, it is better to 
die than to be made slaves. This, indeed, is a splen 
did maxim in theory, and perhaps, in some instances, 
may be found experimentally true ; but when there

is ilio least probability of an happy accommodation., 
surely wisdom and humanity call for some sacrifices 
to be made, to prevent inevitable destruction. Yon 
well know there is bnt one invincible bar to such an 
accommodation; could this be removed, other obstacles 
illicit readily be removed. 

It is to yon, and yon alone, your bleeding country 
looks, and calls aloud for this sacrifice. Your arm 
alone has strength sufficient to remove this bar. May 
Heaven inspire you with this glorious resolution of 
exerting your strength, at this crisis, and immortal 
izing yourself as friend and guardian to your coun 
try ! Your penetrating eye needs not more explicit 
Lmjmagc to discern my meaning. With that pru- 

O O / Cj 

deuce and delicacy, therefore, of which I know you 
possessed, represent to Congress the indispensable ne 
cessity of rescinding the hasty and ill-advised decla 
ration of independency. Recommend, and you have 
an undoubted right to recommend, an immediate ces 
sation of hostilities. Let the controversy be taken 
up where that declaration left it, and where Lord 
Howe certainly expected to find it left. Let men of 
clear and impartial characters, in or out of Congress, 
liberal in their sentiments, heretofore independent in 
their fortunes, and some such may be found in 
America, be appointed to confer witli his Majesty s 
Commissioners. Lot them, if they please, propose 
some well-digested constitutional plan, to lay before 
them at the commencement of the negotiation. When 
they have gone thus far, I am confident the usual 
happy consequences will ensue ; unanimity will im 
mediately take place through the different provinces ; 
thousands who are HOAV ardently wishing and praying 

/ O IT */ O 

for such a measure, will step forth, and declare them 
selves the zealous advocates for constitutional liberty ; 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 457 

and millions will bless the hero that left the field of 
war, to decide this most important contest with the 
weapons of wisdom and humanity. 

Oh! Sir, let no false ideas of worldly honor deter 
yon from engaging in so glorious a task. What 
ever censures may be thrown out by mean, illiberal 
minds, your character will rise in the estimation of 
the virtuous and noble. It will appear with lustre in 
the annals of history, and form a glorious contrast to 
that of those who have fought to obtain conquest, 
and gratify their own ambition by the destruction of 
their species and the ruin of their country. Be as 
sured, Sir, that I write not this under the eye of any 
British officer, or person connected with the British 
army, or ministry. The sentiments I express are the 
real sentiments of my own heart, such as I have long 
held, and which I should have made known to you 
by letter before, had I not fully expected an oppor 
tunity of a private conference. When you passed 
through Philadelphia, on your way to Wilmington, I 
was confined, by a severe fit of the gravel, to my 
chamber ; I have since continued much indisposed, 
and times have been so very distressing, that I had 
neither spirit to write a letter, nor an opportunity to 
convey it when written ; nor do I yet know by what 
means I shall get these sheets to your hands. 

I would fain hope that I have said nothing by 
which your delicacy can be in the least hurt. If I 
have, I assure you it has been without the least 
intention, and, therefore, your candor will lead you to 
forgive me. I have spoke freely of Congress and of 
the army; but what I have said is partly from my 
own knowledge, and partly from the information of 
some respectable members of the former, and some 
of the best officers of the latter. I would not offend 
VOL. i. 39 



458 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

the meanest person upon earth; what I say to you I 
say in confidence, to answer what I cannot but deem 
a most valuable purpose. I love my country ; I love 
you but to the love of truth, the love of peace, 
and the love of God, I hope I should be enabled, if 
called upon to the trial, to sacrifice every other in 
ferior love. 

If the arguments made use of in this letter should 
have so much influence as to engage you in the glo 
rious work which I have warmly recommended, I shall 
ever deem my success the highest temporal favor that 
Providence could grant me. Your interposition and 
advice, I am confident, would meet with a favorable 
reception from the authority under which you act. 

If it should not, you have an infallible recourse 
still left ; negotiate for your country at the head of 
your army. After all, it may appear presumption, as 
an individual, to address himself to you on a subject 
of such magnitude, or to say what measures would 
best secure the interest and welfare of a whole Con 
tinent. The friendly and favorable opinion you have 
always expressed for me, emboldens me to undertake 
it, and which has greatly added to the weight of this 
motive. I have been strongly impressed with a sense 
of duty upon the occasion, which left my conscience 
uneasy, and my heart afflicted, till I fully discharged 
it. I am no enthusiast ; the course is new and sin 
gular to me ; but I could not enjoy one moment s 
peace till this letter was written. With the most 
ardent prayers for your spiritual as well as temporal 
welfare, I am your most 

Obedient and humble friend and servant,

OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 

MAJOR JOHN BROWN TO GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 

Crown Point, 14 August, 1775. 

MAY IT TLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 

On the 24th of last month, by the General s order, I set out 
for Canada with four men, with directions to penetrate the coun 
try, and get all the intelligence that could be had in regard to 
the military preparations making there by the king s troops, Ca 
nadians, or Indians ; what the situation of St. John s, Chamblee, 
Montreal, and Quebec ; how many troops at each place ; whether 
the Canadians designed to take up arms against us ; whether any 
reinforcements had arrived in the Colony, &c. 

I arrived in Canada on the 30th. Had a tedious and fatiguing 
march through a vast tract of swamp lying on the west side of 
the Lake, in which I lodged three nights. But I pass by the 
particulars of the adventure ; how pursued and surrounded by a 
large party of the enemy, when in a house ; escaping out of a 
back window, and pursued two days, on my return ; notwithstand 
ing which I continued in the country four days, being protected 
by the Canadians, who, I can assure you, are our friends, with 
out whose protection I must have fallen into the hands of the 
enemy. It is impossible for me to describe the kindness received 
from the French, as also their distressed situation, being threat 
ened with destruction from the king s troops by fire and sword. 
Though they refuse to take up arms against the Colonies, they 
wish and long for nothing more than to see us, with an army, 
penetrate their country. They engage to supply us with every

tiling in their power. The Indians are determined to act in con 
junction with the Canadians. Colonel Guy Johnson has arrived 
at Montreal with a party of three hundred, mostly tenants, unac 
quainted with arms. There are also some Indians arrived with 
him, via Oswego. They held a Council with the Iroquois and 
St. Louis, and are determined to act with the Canadians, except 
it be to go on discovery. 

The regulars are fortifying St. John s ; have raised two bat- 
teres, which mount nine guns each. They have intrenched and 
picketed out some distance from their other works. Two large 
row-galleys, of sixty or eighty feet in length each, are on the 
stocks, and will be finished soon. They mount twelve guns each. 
There are about seven hundred of the king s troops in Canada ; 
near three hundred at St. John s, about fifty at Quebec, the re 
mainder at Montreal, Chamblee, and at the upper posts. Now, 
Sir, it is time to carry Canada. It may be done with great ease 
and little cost, and I have no doubt but the Canadians would 
join us. There is great defection among them. They have lately 
raised a mob, seized on the French officers lately appointed, and 
taken away their commissions. They were under arms several 
days, and it seemed that the king s troops durst not resent it ; 
but their captain, with one of my men (a Canadian) whom I 
sent to Montreal to do business, are both taken prisoners and in 
close hold. This, I imagine, will raise the resentment of the 
Canadians to a higher pitch than any thing that has yet been 
done. 

I left the country on the 3d instant, being informed by the 
Canadians that two scouts, of fifty men each, were sent out often ; 
the one up the Lake, the other to Montreal. I steered to the 
east north-east three days, and came to the Bay of Missisco, 
where I got a small canoe ; and, on the 10th instant, arrived at 
the Point. 

Should a large reinforcement arrive in Canada, it will turn 
the scale immediately. The Canadians must then take up arms, 
or be ruined. 

It seems that some evil planet has reigned in this quarter this 
year, for notwithstanding the season far advanced, and a fine op 
portunity presents of making ourselves masters of a country, with 
the greatest ease, which, I fear, may cost us much blood and trea 
sure, if delayed, New York have acted a droll part, and are de 
termined to defeat us, if in their power ; they have failed in men 
and supplies.

I beg your Honor s pardon for troubling you with this letter; 
but, as every friend and well-wisher to the success of our arms 
is curious as to the probability of the success, I have taken it 
on me to acquaint your Honor of the state of Canada, which 
doubtless you may have from the General in a more perfect 
manner. It is by Mr. Benn.et s motion, in part, that I give your 
Honor this trouble. I hope, as my paper, ink, and eye-sight are 
bad, that you will pass by mistakes. I am, Sir, 

Your Honor s most obedient, humble servant,

COLONEL ETHAN ALLEN TO GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

September 14, 1775. 

Wednesday, the 6th of September, set out from Isle-aux-Noix. 
On the 8th instant, I arrived at Chamblee; found the Canadians 
in that vicinity friendly; they guarded me under arms night and 
day, escorted me through the woods, as I desired, and showed me 
every courtesy I could wish for. The news of my being in this 
place excited many Captains of the militia, and respectable gen 
tlemen of the Canadians, to visit and converse with me, as I 
gave out I was sent by General Schuyler to manifest his friendly 
intentions towards them, and delivered the General s written 
manifesto to the Chiefs of the Caghnawaga Indians, demanding 
the cause why sundry of the Indians had taken up arms against 
the United Colonies. 

They sent two of their Chiefs to me, who plead that it was 
contrary to the will and orders of their Chiefs. The king s troops 
gave them rum, and inveigled them to fight General Schuyler ; 
that they had sent their runners and ordered them to depart 
from St. John s, averring their friendship to the Colonies. Mean 
while the Sachems held a general council, sent two of their Cap 
tains and some beads of a wampum belt as a lasting testimony 
of their friendship, and that they would not take up arms on 
either side. These tokens of friendship were delivered to me, 
agreeably to their ceremony, in a solemn manner, in the presence 
of a large auditory of Canadians, who approved of the league 
and manifested friendship to the Colonies, and testified their good 
will on account of the advance of the army into Canada. Their 
fear, as they said, was, that our army were too weak to protect 



464 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [1775. 

them against the severity of the English government, as a defeat 
on our part would expose our friends in Canada to it. In this 
dilemma, our friends expressed anxiety of mind. 

It furthermore appeared to me, that many of the Canadians 
were watching the scale of power, whose attraction attracted them. 
In fine, our friends in Canada earnestly urged that General 
Schuyler should immediately environ St. John s ; that they would 
assist in cutting off the communication between St. John s and 
Chamblee, and between these forts and Montreal. They further 
more assured me that they would help our army to provisions, 
&c.; and that, if our army did not make a conquest of the king s 
garrisons, they would be exposed to the resentment of the Eng 
lish government, which they dreaded, and consequently, that the 
attempt of the army into Canada would be to them the greatest 
evil. They furthermore told me, that some of the inhabitants, 
that were in their hearts friendly to us, would [resolve] to ex 
tricate themselves and take up arms in favor of the crown ; and, 
therefore, it was of the last importance to them that the army 
immediately attack St. John s, which would cause them to take 
up arms in our favor. 

Governor Carleton threatens the Canadians with fire and 
sword, except they assist him against the Colonies, and the Seign- 
ieurs urge them to it. They have withstood Carleton and them, 
and keep under arms throughout most of their parishes, and are 
now anxiously watching the scale of power. 

This is the situation of affairs in Canada, according to my most 
painful discoveries, given under my hand, upon honor, this 14th 
day of September, 1775. 

ETHAN ALLEN.* 

* In his published "Narrative," Allen speaks of this expedition as 
follows ; "I advanced with the army to Isle-aux-Noix, from whence I 
was ordered by the General to go, in company with Major Brown and 
certain interpreters, through the woods into Canada, with letters to the 
Canadians, and to let them know that the design of the army was only 
against the English garrisons, and not the country, their liberties, or 
religion. And having, through much danger, negotiated this business; 1 
returned to the Isle-aux-Noix the forepart of September, when Gene 
ral Schuyler returned to Albany ; and, in consequence, the command 
devolved upon General Montgomery, whom I assisted in laying a line 
of circumvallation around the fortress at St. John s." Allen s Narra 
tive, p. 7.

GENERAL MONTGOMERY TO GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Jamp, near St. John s, 19 September, 1775. 
DEAR SIR, 

I take the opportunity of Fulmore s* return with the Oneidas, 
to acquaint you of our arrival here on the 17th, in the evening. 
Yesterday, I marched, with five hundred men, to the north side 
of St. John s, where we found a party of the King s troops, with 
tield-pieces. This party had beaten off Major Brown f a few 
hours before, who had imprudently thrown himself in their way, 
depending on our more early arrival, which, through the dilatori- 
ness of our young troops, could not be sooner effected. The 
enemy, after an ill-directed fire for some minutes, retired with 
precipitation ; and lucky for them they did, for had we known 
their situation, which the thickness of the woods prevented our 
finding out till it was too late, not a man of them would have 
returned. The old story of treachery spread among the men; as 
soon as we saw the enemy, we were trepanned, drawn under the 
guns of the fort, and what not. The woodsmen % were not so ex 
pert at forming as I expected, and too many of them hung back ; 
had we kept silence at first, before we were discovered, we should 
have got a field-piece or two. 

I have left the five hundred men at the joining of the two 
roads ; this day I have sent them intrenching tools. 

Things seem to go on well among the Canadians. It is 
strongly reported, that the King s stores are embarked at Mon 
treal, in order to be removed. I have sent Colonel Allen to 
Chamblee, in order to raise a corps. Send me money as fast as 
possible, my dear General. Guy Johnson and Claws have repre-

Canadians, and join the army at St. John s, as soon as it should arrive 
there.

sented us as beggarly miscreants, who have nothing to give away 
to the Indians, nor to pay for what we get. Fulmore will give 
you an account of our Council. 

I have great dependence on your presence, to administer to 
our many wants. 

I most earnestly hope this will find you relieved from the 
acuteness of your pain ; a perfect cure, in so short a time, can 
hardly be expected. Believe me, dear Sir, with the fullest 
esteem and respect, 

Your most obedient servant, 

RICHARD MONTGOMERY. 

P. S. On the 17th, at night, Major Brown intercepted eight 
carts going to the fort, laden with rum and gun-carriages for the 
vessel ; these things were hid in the woods, and were not re 
covered by the enemy on Brown s discomfiture. 



COLONEL SETH WARNER TO GENERAL MONTGOMERY. 

Laprairie, 27 September, 1775. 
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR HONOR, 

I have the disagreeable news to write to you, that Colonel Allen 
hath met with a defeat by a stronger force, which sallied out of 
the town of Montreal, after he had crossed the river about a 
mile below the town. I have no certain knowledge of Allen as 
yet, whether he is killed, taken, or fled. But this defeat hath 
put the French people into great consternation ; they are much 
concerned for fear of a company coming over against us. Fur 
thermore, the Indian Chiefs were at Montreal, at the time of 
Allen s battle, and there was a number of the Caghnawaga Indians 
in the battle against Allen, and the people are very fearful of 
the Indians ; there were six in here last night, I suppose sent as 
spies. I asked the Indians concerning their appearing against us 
in every battle ; their answer to me was, that Carleton made 
them drunk, and drove them to it ; but they say they would do 
so no more. 

I should think it proper to keep a party at Longueil, and my 
party is not big enough to divide, if I tarry here. I should be 
glad of my regiment, for my party is made up with different 
companies, and different regiments, and my reputation is not so

good as I could wish for. Subordination to your orders is my 
pleasure. I am, Sir, with submission, 

Your humble servant, 

SETH WARNER. 

P. S. This morning arrived, from Colonel Allen s defeat, Cap 
tain Duggan, with the following intelligence. Colonel Allen is 
absolutely taken captive into Montreal, with a few more, and 
about two or three killed, and about as many wounded. The 
living have not all come in. Something of a slaughter made 
among the King s troops.* From yours to serve, 

SETH WARNER. 



GENERAL MONTGOMERY TO GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Camp, near St. John s, 28 September, 1775. 
DEAR SIR, 

Since my last of the 24th, we have opened a battery of two 
twelve-pounders, upon the ship-yards and schooner. She was 
obliged immediately to haul near the wharf, or rather as near 
the north end of the fort as she could get, This battery is 
screened from the guns of the fort by an epaulement, in a good 
measure. 

I fear I have neither men nor ammunition to carry on any 
attack with success ; to which purpose, it would be absolutely ne 
cessary to occupy a very advantageous piece of rising ground on 
the west side, and there erect my battery to rack their defences. 
The largest of the mortars is useless, and on the mortars I prin 
cipally depended for distressing the garrison. The weather has 
been and is still so exceedingly bad, and the encampment so 
swampy, that I feel exceedingly for the troops; and withal, pro 
visions so scanty, flour as well as pork, that it will require, not 
only good fortune, but despatch, to keep us from distress. I 
hope the thirteen-inch mortar and more powder are on the way. 

Allen, Warner, and Brown are at Laprairie and Longueil, 
with a party of our troops, and some Canadians. How many, I 
cannot tell. They all speak well of the good disposition of the 
Canadians. They have a project of making an attempt on Mon- 

* Allen gives a particular account of this adventure in his Narrative, 
pp. 8-14. 



468 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [1775. 

treal. I fear the troops are not fit for it. Caiieton has certainly 
left that town, and it is in a very defenceless state. 

As the garrison is shut up, I hope the Kennebec expedition 
will meet with no obstruction in the attack upon Quebec. Should 
any thing not go well, I tremble for the fate of the poor Cana 
dians, who have ventured so much. What should I do with them 
should we be obliged to evacuate the country ! Though I hope 
this will not be the case. If possible, do not let us want ammu 
nition, my dear General. I have seen Mr. Livingston, lie has a 
considerable body of Canadians in arms at Chamblee, is very 
active, and they have great confidence in him, I believe. I wish 
to have him taken notice of by the Congress, in a manner suit 
able to his services, and the risk he runs. I am, my dear Sir, 
with the warmest wishes for the recovery of your health, 
Your faithful, humble servant, 

KICHARD MONTGOMERY. 



GENERAL MONTGOMERY TO GENERAL SCIIUYLER. 

Camp, south side of St. John s, G October, 1775. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

Your vigilance and foresight have saved us from the difficul 
ties that threatened us. We are no longer afraid of starving. I 
wait now with impatience for the arrival of those troops, men 
tioned in your last, which I believe, from the number of boats on 
the way, will soon be here, to take the advantageous post I for 
merly spoke of, on a hill to the westward. 

Since my last, I have had some proposals of an accommoda 
tion, through the channel of the Caghnawagas, from the formi 
dable St. Luc le Corne, and other principal inhabitants of Mon 
treal. To-morrow is appointed for a conference at Laprairie. I 
have sent Major Brown to manage it. Macpherson goes with 
him, and Mr. Livingston of Chamblee will attend. The result 
of this negotiation I hope soon to make you acquainted with. 
Mr. St. Luc s character gives me all the reason in the world 
to be on my guard against him. I shall insist on some substan 
tial proof of his sincerity. Mr. Livingston, some days ago, took 
post at Ilazen s house, with near two hundred Canadians. They 
are erecting a battery there, which seems to make the garrison 
very uneasy. 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 469 

Yesterday they attacked them with their row-galley, but were 
beaten back without loss on the side of the Canadians. No cer 
tain intelligence yet of Arnold s arrival, though there are flying 
reports to that purpose. I wish he was at Quebec, with all my 
heart. I believe there is nothing to oppose him. I am ex 
tremely happy you have sent for more powder. I believe we 
have not more than t\vo and one-half tons. This I am afraid 
will not do. Send us as many men as you can possibly fur 
nish with provisions. I am greatly in want of them. Our feeble 
ness has intimidated the Canadians from embarking in so uncer 
tain an adventure. Were I strong enough to send five hundred 
men to Montreal, it would certainly declare for us ; at least I 
have great reason to think so. The miserable weather we have 
had has distressed us much, but I hope it is now over. 

Let the hard cash come as soon as possible, that our reputa 
tion may hold good. 

Mr. Carleton has not departed, as I informed you. We want 
both iron and steel, and turner s tools. The large mortar is 
ready to play, I shall send some more boats in a few days. 

I am, &c., &c., 

RICHARD MONTGOMERY. 



GENERAL MONTGOMERY TO GENERAL SCHTJYLER. 

Camp, near St. John s, 13 October, 1775. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

Some time ago I informed you of my intentions to make my 
approaches on the west side, as soon as the expected reenforce- 
ment enabled me to undertake it. I had had a road cut to the 
intended ground, and some fascines made, when I was informed 
by Major Brown, that a general dissatisfaction prevailed ; that 
unless something was undertaken in a few days, there would 
be a mutiny ; and that the universal sense of the army was to 
direct all our attention to the east side. The impatience of the 
troops to get home has prevented their seeing the impossibility 
of undertaking this business sooner, the duty being hard for the 
troops, even on the present confined state of operations. 

When I mentioned my intentions, I did not consider I was at 
the head of troops who carry the spirit of freedom into the field, 
and think for themselves. Upon considering the fatal conse 
quences which might flow from a want of subordination and dis- 

YOL. i. 40 



470 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [1775. 

cipline (should this ill humor continue), my unstable authority 
over troops of different Colonies, the insufficiency of the military 
law, and my own want of powers to enforce it, weak as it is, I 
thought it expedient to call the Field-Officers together. Inclosed 
I send you the result of our deliberations. 

RICHARD MONTGOMERY. 

liCSi M of the Proceedings of a Council of War, held at St. John s, 
October 13th, 1775. 

I proposed establishing a battery of all our spare heavy can 
non, on the rising ground exactly opposite the stone house in the 
north redoubt (in the west face of which there is but one em 
brasure open), at the distance of about four hundred yards, securing 
this battery with a work capable of being well defended by 
two hundred men. From this battery our approaches might be 
continued to the ditch, and by the time we arrived there, the 
fraise around the berme would be destroyed, the rampart in a 
ruinous state, and the large house (which is said to be their 
principal barrack) would be destroyed, as every shot that miss 
ed the rampart, must take the house. Two four-pounders on 
the east side would answer the end of securing the west ram 
part in reverse, and thereby slackening the opposition of the 
enemy. 

By this mode of proceeding, if our ammunition held out, there 
would be, in my opinion, some prospect of success, notwithstand 
ing the superior artillery of the garrison, which could not be 
mounted in its proper place in time enough to prevent the 
erection of our battery. The Field-Officers were, to a man, of 
opinion that my reasons were insufficient, being afraid the de 
signed ground was at this season too wet for approaches, and 
strongly of opinion our heavy cannon on the cast side would 
more effectually distress the enemy by annoying their buildings, 
the fort having a gentle slope to the river, and (which was 
urged as the strongest motive) by destroying their schooner. In 
vain I represented, that even if every building was destroyed, 
the garrison would not surrender without a probability of an 
assault, which could never arise from any attack on the op 
posite side of the river ; that the vessel could not be destroyed, 
because she would change her place in such a manner as to 
elude our batteries ; that we had little powder or time to throw 
away on experiments; that I had a moral certainty they would 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 471 

find themselves mistaken ; and finally that they must take it 
upon themselves, for I would not oppose the general sense of 
the army, and should enforce the measure by every effort in 
my power. 

I cannot help observing, to how little purpose I am here. 
Were I not afraid the example would be too generally followed, 
and that the public service might suffer, I would not stay an 
hour at the head of troops whose operations I cannot direct. 
I must say I have no hopes of success, unless from the garri 
son s wanting provisions. 

RICHARD MONTGOMERY. 



BROOK WATSON TO WILLIAM FRANKLIN, GOVERNOR 
NEW JERSEY. 

Montreal, 19 October, 1775. 
DEAR SIR, 

I had the pleasure to write you from Quebec, the 18th ultimo, 
per the Cillery, Captain Hardie ; since which I have been much 
alarmed by a letter from Boston, dated the 5th ultimo, advising 
of Halifax being taken ; but I was soon relieved by a letter 
from Mr. Butler, dated the 1st September, which was soon fol 
lowed by others of the 16th and 21st, by which I learn, to my 
great comfort, that the Province was not in any immediate dan 
ger. Nor do I conceive these people will be so mad as to send 
a body of men, where, let their success be ever so great, they 
cannot winter them. Indeed, the Admiral s orders to destroy their 
vessels will, if executed, effectually prevent their crossing the Bay 
of Fundy. 

It is my opinion General Gage cannot winter the army in 
Boston, and that he will soon be obliged to quit it. If so, part 
of them must winter at Halifax, and part at Quebec, where they 
are indeed much wanted ; for such is the wretched state of this 
unhappy Province, that Colonel Allen, with a few despicable 
wretches, would have taken this city on the 25th ultimo, had not 
its inhabitants marched out to give them battle. They fought, 
conquered, and thereby saved the Province for a while. Allen 
and his banditti were mostly taken prisoners. He is now in 
chains on board the Gaspee. This little action has changed the 
face of things. The Canadians before were nine tenths for the 
Bostonians. They are now returned to their duty, many in arms 



472 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [1775. 

for the King, and the parishes, who had been otherwise, are 
daily demanding their pardon, and taking arms for the Crown. 
St. John s is still invested. They have in the fort eight hundred 
men, well fortified and appointed. There is little danger of its 
being taken ; yet I cordially wish for a few battalions of the 
King s troops to chase them out of the country. Our weather 
has been remarkably fine and mild, or they would soon be 
moving. 

The Adamant is nearly loaded. I hope to sail from Quebec 
about the 10th of next month, and to arrive in England before 
Parliament shall adjourn for the holidays. Let me entreat you 
to remit the balance of Mr. Louberbahler s account. Every shil 
ling is a relief at this time of general distress. 

My good wishes attend Mrs. Franklin and the children; and I 
pray you to believe, that I am, dear Sir, 

Your faithful, humble servant, 

BROOK WATSON. 



GENERAL MONTGOMERY TO GOVERNOR CARLETON. 

Camp, before St. John s, 22 October, 1775. 
SIR, 

I have received information, from different quarters, that the 
prisoners you have made are treated with cruel and unnecessary 
severity, being loaded with irons ; and that Colonel Allen himself 
meets with this shocking indignity. 

Your character, Sir, induces me to hope I am ill informed ; 
nevertheless, the duty I owe the troops committed to my charge, 
lays me under the necessity of acquainting your Excellency that, 
if you avow this conduct and persist in it, I shall, though with 
the most painful regret, execute with rigor the just and necessary 
law of retaliation upon the garrison of Chamblee, now in my 
possession, and upon all others who may hereafter fall into my 
hands. I must be understood to stipulate for those unfortunate 
Canadians, your prisoners, who have thrown themselves into the 
arms of the United Colonies for protection, whose enraged coun 
trymen have with difficulty been restrained from acts of violence 
on the garrison of Chamblee. 

I shall expect your Excellency s answer in six days. Should 
the bearer not return in that time, I must interpret your silence 
into a declaration of a barbarous war. I cannot pass this oppor- 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 473 

tunity, without lamenting the melancholy and fatal necessity which 
obliges the firmest friends of the Constitution to oppose one of 
the most respectable officers of the Crown. I am, &c., 

RICHARD MONTGOMERY. 



MAJOR PRESTON TO GENERAL MONTGOMERY. 

St. John s, 1 November, 1775. 
SIR, 

I am credibly informed that the prisoner you permitted to 
pass here this evening is frequently subject to fits of insanity, and 
therefore cannot lay much stress on what he says. 

Equally anxious to prevent the further unnecessary effusion of 
blood, and zealous to maintain the honor of his Majesty s arms, I 
now inform you that, should no attempt be made to relieve this 
place within the space of four days, I will then offer to you 
my proposals relative to a surrender. The low state of my 
provisions, the destruction of artillery stores, tools, &c., are points 
with which the deserter was not w 7 ell acquainted. In whatever 
way the fate of this garrison may be determined, I flatter myself 
it will never depend on the assembling of Canadians, who must 
have rendered themselves equally contemptible to both parties. I 
am, Sir, &c., 

CHARLES PRESTON, 
Major of the StGth Regiment, commanding at St. John s. 



GENERAL MONTGOMERY TO MAJOR PRESTON. 

1 November, 1775. 
SIR, 

The advanced season of the year will not admit of your pro 
posal. I do assure you, upon the honor of a gentleman, that 
what the prisoner has informed you of is true, as far as has 
come to my knowledge. However, if it wants further confirma 
tion, Mr. Depane, of Montreal, who is also my prisoner, will, I 
believe, give you the same intelligence. 

Having now acquitted my conscience, I must, to save time 
and prevent trouble, acquaint you, if you do not surrender this 
day, it will be unnecessary to make any future proposals. The 

40*

&lt;mrrison shall be prisoners of war without the honors of 
and I cannot insure the officers their baggage. Should you wish 
to send an officer to Mr. Depane, who is on board the sloop, you 
have my permission. Captain Stewart carries an order for that 
purpose. Should you still be inclined to persist in a useless 
defence, you will immediately fire a cannon without shot, as a 
signal. I am, &c., 

RICHARD MONTGOMERY. 



GENERAL MONTGOMERY TO GENERAL SCIIUYLER. 

Camp, near St. John s, 3 November, 1775. 
MY DEAR GENERAL, 

I have the pleasure to acquaint you the garrison surrendered 
last night. This morning, we take possession ; to-morrow, I hope 
the prisoners will set off. Inclosed you have the capitulation, 
which I hope will meet your approbation and that of Congress. 

I have ventured to permit an officer or two to go to their 
families, which are in some distress, at Montreal, upon their pa 
role. They can t do us any harm, and there would have been 
a degree of inhumanity in refusing them. When we had played 
on the fort some hours from our battery of four twelve-pounders, 
on the north-west, and another, of two twelve-pounders and two 
four-pounders, on the east side, some prisoners arrived who had 
been taken in an action with Governor Carleton, at Longueil. He 
made an attempt to land with thirty-four boats, full of men. 
Warner s detachment, consisting of the Green Mountain Boys 
and second regiment of Yorkers, repulsed them with loss ; took 
two Indians and two Canadians prisoners. We have buried three 
Indians, and it is supposed many in the boats must have been 
killed ; we had not a man even wounded. This, I believe, is his 
last effort. 

One of the above-mentioned prisoners I sent into the fort to 
inform Major Preston of the circumstances of the action, that he 
might judge what prospect he had of relief. It had the desired 
effect; the garrison having been on half allowance for some time. 

I am making the necessary preparation to proceed immediately 
to Montreal, by way of Laprairie, as the enemy have armed ves 
sels in the Sorel. Send everybody you possibly can immediately 
down, as it is much to be apprehended many of the men on this 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 475 

service will insist on returning home when their times are ex 
pired. It will not be necessary to keep people with arms for the 
present at Ticonderoga. Several men of rank in Canada are 
among the prisoners. I have permitted them to remain at Crown 
Point till the return of two gentlemen they send to their friends 
for money, &c. They pleaded hard to return home ; but they 
are too dangerous to let loose again. 

I have this moment received your letter of the 27th October. 
Not a word of Arnold yet. I have sent two expresses to him 
lately ; one by an Indian, who promised to return with expedi 
tion. The instant I have any news of him, I will acquaint you 
by express. 

Colonel Easton and Major Brown, with that corps, and Mr. 
Livingston, with, I believe, one thousand Canadians, are going to 
wards the mouth of the Sorel, and pushing Colonel Allan Mc 
Lean before them. McLean had many Canadians, but they 
joined him through fear of fire and sword; you may judge easily 
how they will fight. I send you a list of stores, articles, &c., 
and am, my dear Sir, with respect and esteem, 

Your much obliged, humble servant, 

RICHARD MONTGOMERY. 

Neither Macpherson nor Rensselaer have commissions. 

P. S. Half after six. Just received your favor of the 31st 
October; a good deal of artillery stores, but we have not time 
to ascertain them. 



COLONEL ARNOLD TO GENERAL MONTGOMERY. 

St. Marie, 21-2 leagues from Point Levy, 

8 November, 1775. 
DEAR SIR, 

Your favor of the 29th ultimo, I received at ten o clock this 
morning, which gave me much pleasure. I heartily congratulate 
you on your success thus far. I think you have had great reason 
to be apprehensive for me, the time I mentioned to General Wash 
ington being so long since elapsed. I was not then apprised, or 
indeed apprehensive, of one half the difficulties we had to encoun 
ter, of which I cannot at present give you a particular detail. I 
can only say we have hauled our bateaux up over falls, up rapid 
streams, over carrying-places, and marched through morasses, 



47G OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [1775. 

thick woods, and over mountains, about three hundred and twenty 
miles, many of which we had to pass several times to bring over 
our baggage. These difficulties the soldiers have, with the great 
est fortitude, surmounted ; and about two thirds of the detachment 
are happily arrived here, and -within two days inarch, most of 
them in good health and high spirits. The other part, with Co 
lonel Enos, returned from Dead River, contrary to my expecta 
tion, he having orders to send back only the sick, and those that 
could not be furnished with provisions. 

I wrote to General Schuyler the loth of October (by an In 
dian I thought trusty), inclosed to my friend in Quebec ; and, as 
I have had no answer from either, and he pretends to have been 
taken sick at Quebec, I make no doubt he has betrayed his trust ; 
which I am confirmed in, as I find they have been some time 
apprised of our coming in Quebec, and have destroyed all the 
canoes at Point Levy, to prevent our passing. This difficulty 
will be obviated by birch canoes, as we have about twenty of 
them, with forty savages, wiio have joined us, and profess great 
friendship, as well as the Canadians, by whom we have been 
very friendly received, and who will be able to furnish us with 
a number of canoes. 

I am informed, by the French, there are two frigates and seve 
ral small armed vessels lying before Quebec, and a large ship or 
two, lately arrived from Boston. However, I propose crossing 
the St. Lawrence as soon as possible, and, if any opportunity 
offers of attacking Quebec with success, I shall embrace it ; other 
wise, I shall endeavour to join your army at Montreal. I shall, 
as often as in my power, advise you of my proceedings, and beg 
the favor of hearing from you by every opportunity. 

The inclosed letter to his Excellency General Washington, I 
beg the favor of your forwarding by express. 

I am, very respectfully, dear Sir, your most obedient, humble 
servant, 

BENEDICT AKNOLD. 

P. S. Since writing the above, I have seen a friend from 
Quebec, who informs me a frigate of twenty-six guns, and two 
transports, with one hundred and fifty recruits, arrived from St. 
John s, Newfoundland, last Sunday, which, with the inhabitants 
who have been compelled to take up arms, amount to about three 
hundred men ; that the French and English inhabitants in gene 
ral are on our side, and that the city is short of provisions. I 
shall endeavour to cut off their communication with the coun- 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 477 

try, and make no doubt, if no more recruits arrive, to bring 
them to terms soon, or at least keep them in close quarters 
until your arrival here, which I await with impatience ; but, if 
St. John s should not have surrendered, and you can possibly 
spare a regiment this way, I think the city must of course fall 
into our hands. 



GENERAL MONTGOMERY TO THE INHABITANTS OF MONTREAL. 

12 November, 1775. 
GENTLEMEN, 

My anxiety for the fate of Montreal induces me to request, 
that you will exert yourselves among the inhabitants to prevail 
on them to enter into such measures as will prevent the neces 
sity of opening my batteries on the town. When I consider the 
dreadful consequences of a bombardment, the distress that must 
attend a fire (at this season especially), when it is too late to re 
pair the damage which must ensue, how many innocent people 
must suffer, and that the firm friends of liberty must be in 
volved in one common ruin with the wicked tools of despot 
ism, my heart bleeds at the dire necessity which compels me 
to distress that unfortunate city. I conjure you, by all the ties 
of humanity, to take every possible step to soften the heart of 
the Governor, who, if he be sincere in his professions to the 
people committed to his charge, must commiserate their condi 
tion. In vain will he persist in a resistance, which can only 
be attended with misery to the inhabitants and with lasting dis 
grace to his own humanity. I am, gentlemen, with earnest 
wishes for the success of your negotiation, 

RICHARD MONTGOMERY. 

P. S. I have just heard it has been falsely and scandalously 
reported that our intentions are to plunder the inhabitants. I 
have only to appeal to your own observation, whether such a 
proceeding be consistent with our conduct since we have en 
tered this Province.

APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 479 

GENERAL MONTGOMERY S ANSWER. 

I do hereby certify, that the above articles were presented to 
me, to which I have given the following answer ; 

The city of Montreal, having neither ammunition, artillery, 
troops, nor provisions, and having it not in their power to fulfil 
one article of the treaty, can claim no title to a capitulation. 

The Continental army have a generous disdain of every act of 
oppression and violence; they are come for the express purpose 
of giving liberty and security. The General, therefore, engages 
his honor to maintain, in the peaceable enjoyment of their pro 
perty of every kind, the individuals and religious communities of 
the city of Montreal. 

The inhabitants, whether English, French, or others, shall be 
maintained in the free exercise of their religion. 

The present unhappy contention between Great Britain and 
her Colonies puts it out of his power to engage for freedom of 
trade to the mother country; nor can he make a general pro 
mise of passports; as far as it may consist with the safety of 
the troops and the public good, he shall be happy to promote 
commerce, and, for that purpose, promises to grant passports for 
the upper countries, when required. 

The General hopes to see such a virtuous Provincial Conven 
tion assembled, as will enter with zeal into every measure that 
can contribute to set the civil and religious rights of this and her 
sister Colonies on a permanent foundation. He promises for him 
self, that he will not compel the inhabitants of the town to take 
up arms against the Mother Country, or contribute towards the 
expenses of carrying on the present war. 

The Continental army came into this province for its protec 
tion ; they, therefore, cannot consider their opposers as taking up 
arms for its defence. 

It is not in the General s power to engage for the return of 
prisoners ; motives of humanity will induce him to use his in 
terest for their return to their families, provided it can be done 
without endangering the public safety. 

Speedy measures shall be taken for the establishing Courts 
of Justice upon the most liberal plan conformable to the British 
Constitution. 

The inhabitants shall not be burdened with troops but when ne 
cessity requires it; of which necessity the General must be judge. 

The inhabitants of the country, and savages, shall not enter 
the town till the guards are posted. 



480 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [1775. 

To-morrow morning, at nine o clock, the Continental troops 
shall take possession of the Recollect Gate. The proper officers 
must attend, with the keys of all public stores, upon the Quar 
termaster-General at nine o clock at the Recollect Gate. 

This engagement is understood and declared to be binding on 
any future commanding officer of the Continental troops, that 
may succeed me in this district. 

RICHARD MONTGOMERY, 
Brigadier- General Continental Army. 

Montreal, 12 November, 1775. 



GENERAL MONTGOMERY TO GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Montreal, 13 November, 1775. 
MY DEAR GENERAL, 

The badness of the weather, and worse roads, have put it 
out of my power to get here before yesterday. A favorable 
wind enabled, the night before, Mr. Carleton to get away, with 
his little garrison on board ten or eleven little vessels, reserved 
for that purpose, and to carry away the powder and other im 
portant stores. I don t despair of getting hold of the pow 
der yet. No diligence shall be wanting for that purpose. By 
intercepted letters, I find that Colonel Arnold is certainly ar 
rived in the neighbourhood of Quebec ; that the king s friends 
are exceedingly alarmed, and expect to be besieged; which, with 
the blessing of God, they shall be, if the severe season holds off, 
and I can prevail on the troops to accompany me. The Lizard, 
man-of-war, is arrived there; she has brought twenty thousand 
pounds sterling, and one hundred marines. They have had some 
other little reinforcements of recruits for McLean s regiment, and 
artificers, to the amount, in all, including marines and sailors, 
of four hundred and fifty men. One of the brigs is arrived 
with clothing and arms for the faithful Canadians, as Mr. Carle- 
ton with propriety terms them. 

This morning we have taken possession of the town ; I send 
you their articles of capitulation, with my answer, and hope it 
may meet with approbation. 

I can t help feeling great uneasiness till I know the deter 
mination of the troops with respect to engaging for six months 
longer. I was obliged, at St. John s, to promise all such their 
dismission as chose it, to coax them to Montreal. 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 481 

Indeed, Wooster s regiment showed the greatest uneasiness. 
I make no doubt of retaining as many as will hold the ground 
already gotten ; but it is of the utmost importance to finish this 
business at once, that the Ministry may have no hopes left 
of carrying on their infernal plan in this important quarter. 
At any rate, it will be highly expedient to throw in a large 
body of troops, as soon as the ice will bear, in order to make 
n vigorous attack on Quebec, before the arrival of succours in 
the spring, should it not fall into our hands this winter ; but, 
should this instance of good fortune crown our labors, some 
advantageous post must be chosen below Quebec, where a large 
corps of troops, strongly posted, a boom over a narrow chan 
nel, and floating batteries, may baffle all attempts from Europe. 
I am told a difficult pass, termed the Travers, will answer this 
purpose. If your health will not permit you to engage in this 
affair, I think Lee ought, by all means, to have the command 
here. I send some choice letters of that worthy and steady 
friend of the Colonies, Brook Watson, whose zeal is only to 
be equalled by his sincerity. You will think them of import 
ance enough, I believe, to be communicated to General Wash 
ington and the Congress. Your friend, Mr. William Smith, has 
been pretty well humbugged by this gentleman.* 

I ain exceedingly sorry Congress have not favored me with 
a Committee. It would have had a great effect with the troops, 
who are exceedingly turbulent, and indeed mutinous. My vex 
ation and distress can only be alleviated by reflecting on the 
great public advantages, which must arise from my unparalleled 
good fortune. 

I shall clothe the troops completely, who engage again. I 
find with pleasure that my politics have squared with the views 
of Congress, and shall lose no time in calling a Convention, 
when my intended expedition is finished. 

Will not your health permit you to reside at Montreal this 
winter? I must go home, if I walk by the side of the Lake, 
this winter. I am weary of power, and totally want that pa 
tience and temper, so requisite for such a command. 

I will take it as a favor, if you will send Harry Livingston 
with your despatches for Congress. 

I wish some method could be fallen upon of engaging gentlemen

to serve; a point of honor, and more knowledge of the world, 
to be found in that class of men, would greatly reform disci 
pline, and render the troops much more tractable. 

The officers of the first regiment of Yorkers and artillery 
company, were very near a mutiny the other day, because I 
would not stop the clothing of the garrison of St. John s. I 
would not have sullied my own reputation, nor disgraced the. 
Continental arms, by such a breach of capitulation, for the uni 
verse ; there was no driving it into their noddles, that the cloth 
ing was really the property of the soldier; that he had paid 
for it, and that every regiment, in this country especially, saved 
a year s clothing to have decent clothes to wear on particular 
occasions. I am, &c., RICHARD MONTGOMERY. 



COLONEL ARNOLD TO GENERAL MONTGOMERY. 

Point Levy, 13 November, 1775. 
DEAR SIR, 

The foregoing is a copy of my last by the two Indians you 
sent by express the 29th ultimo, who, I hear this moment, are 
taken five leagues above this ; since which, I have waited two 
or three days for the rear to come up, and in preparing ladders, 
&c. The winds have been so high, these three nights, that I 
have not been able to cross the river. I have near forty canoes 
ready ; and, as the wind has moderated, I design crossing this 
evening. The Hunter sloop, and Lizard frigate, lie opposite to 
prevent us ; but I make no doubt I shall be able to avoid 
them. I this moment received the agreeable intelligence, via 
Sorel, that you are in possession of St. John s, and have invested 
Montreal. I can give no intelligence, save that the merchant 
ships are busy, day and night, in loading, and four have already 
sailed. I am yours, &c., 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



COLONEL ARNOLD TO GENERAL MONTGOMERY. 

Colvil Place, 1 1-2 miles from Quebec, 

14 November, 1775. 
DEAR SIR, 

I wrote you yesterday from Point Levy, by an express sent 



APPENDIX.] OPEKATIONS IN CANADA. 483 

from Sorel, by Colonel Easton, of my intention of crossing the St. 
Lawrence, which I happily effected between nine and four in the 
morning, without being discovered, until my party of five hundred 
men were nearly all over, when a frigate s barge, coming up, 
discovered our landing and prevented our surprising the town. 
We lired into her, and killed three men. 

I am this minute informed, by a gentleman from town, that 
Colonel McLean had determined to pay us a visit this morning, 
with six hundred men and some field-pieces. We are prepared, 
and anxious to see him. Others from town inform me, that the 
inhabitants in general had laid down their arms. By the best 
information, they are in the greatest confusion, very short of wood 
and provisions, much divided, and refused provisions from the 
inhabitants ; and if blocked up by a superior force, must, as soon 
as the frost sets in, surrender. 

I have thought proper to despatch the bearer to inform you of 
my situation, as also with a request I have to make. I must 
refer you to him for particulars ; as I have been so unfortunate in 
my former letters, I do not choose to commit every intelligence 
to writing. It is the current report here, that you have invested 
Montreal and cut off their retreat. This I hope is true, and 
that I shall soon have the pleasure of seeing you here. I am, 
dear Sir, with great respect, 

Your obedient, humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 

P. S. Since writing the foregoing, the enemy found means to 
make prisoner of one of our out-sentinels. I immediately invested 
the town, as near as possible, with my troops, which has oc 
casioned them to set fire to the suburbs of St. John s ; and several 
of the houses without the wall are now in flames. B. A.

Camp, before Quebec, 14 November, 1775. 
SIR, 

The unjust, cruel, and tyrannical acts of a venal British Par 
liament, tending to enslave the American Colonies, have obliged 
them to appeal to God and the sword for redress. That Being, 
in whose hands are all human events, has hitherto smiled on 



484 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [177;;. 

their virtuous efforts. And, as every artifice has been used to 
make the innocent Canadians instruments of their cruelty, by in 
stigating them against the Colonies, and oppressing them on their 
refusing to enforce every oppressive mandate, the American Con 
gress, induced by motives of humanity, have, at their request, 
sent General Sclmyler into Canada for their relief. To coope 
rate with him, I am ordered by his Excellency, General Wash 
ington, to take possession of the town of Quebec. 

I do, therefore, in the name of the United Colonies, demand 
immediate surrender of the town, fortifications, &c., of Quebec, 
to the forces of the United Colonies under my command ; forbid 
ding you to injure any of the inhabitants of the town in their 
persons or property, as you will answer the same at your peril. 
On surrendering the town, the property of every individual shall 
be secured to him ; but if I am obliged to carry the town by 
storm, you may expect every severity practised on such occasions ; 
and the merchants, who may now save their property, will pro 
bably be involved in the general ruin. 

I am, Sir, your most obedient, humble servant,

COLONEL ARNOLD TO LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR CRAMAIIE. 

15 November, 177J. 
SIR, 

I yesterday sent the inclosed with a ilag and officer, who, ap 
proaching near the walls of the town, was, contrary to humanity 
and the laws of nations, fired on, and narrowly escaped being 
killed. This I imputed to the ignorance of your guards, and 
ordered him to return this morning, and, to my great surprise, lie 
was received in the same manner as yesterday. This is an insult 
I could not have expected from a private soldier, much less from 
an officer of your rank ; and, through me offered to the United 
Colonies, will be deeply resented; but at any rate, cannot redound 
to your honor or valor. 

I am informed you have put a prisoner, taken from me, into 
irons. I desire to know the truth of this, and the manner in 
which he is treated. As I have several prisoners taken from 
you, who now feed at my own table, you may expect that they 
will be treated in the same manner in future as you treat mine. 
I am, Sir, your obedient servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD.

DEAR SIR, 

My last was of the 14th instant, advising you of my crossing 
the St. Lawrence, and being before Quebec ; since which I have 
not had the pleasure of hearing from you. I then informed you 
of my situation and prospects. Fearing that may have miscar

of Quebec, and particular friend of mine, who has been kind 
enough to offer his service, and will inform you more fully than

and much more to see you here. I am, dear Sir, with great

GENERAL MONTGOMERY TO GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Montreal, 19 November, 1775. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

I wrote to you the other day, in a great hurry, by express, 
sending a letter for General Washington from Colonel Arnold. 
I have this morning had another express from Colonel Arnold, 
acquainting me he has crossed the river to the Quebec side ; 
that he had been near surprising the town ; that it was closely 
invested ; that they were in the greatest confusion within, the 
inhabitants having refused to take arms. A scarcity of provi 
sions and wood must bring the garrison to terms, were a block 
ade alone to be the measure adopted. Mr. Carleton is in statu 
quo, about fifteen miles on this side of Sorel, where I hope 
they will not let him pass. I suppose Mr. Carleton is on board 
the fleet, which left this upon my arrival; as I have never 
had any account of his making his escape. I have not yet 
been able to adjust the new-formed corps, or get our warm 
clothing ready to go down, touching which I am exceedingly 
impatient, Arnold having no artillery, and being in want of 
warm clothing. 

I have appointed a Mr. Mason, one of our friends in this 
town, postmaster, till the pleasure of Congress be known. 

I find Mr. Price so active and intelligent, so warm a friend 

41* 



486 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [1775. 

to the measures adopted by Congress, that I wish to have him 
mentioned in the strongest terms to Congress. 

I have set a regiment on foot of Canadians, James Livings 
ton, Colonel, to be engaged twelve months, should this unhappy 
controversy last so long. 

I have made the inhabitants acquainted with the views of 
Congress relative to this province, declaring I should call a 
Convention on my return from Quebec. I have had some con 
versation with Pere Flacquet, a Jesuit at the head of the society 
here, and esteemed a very sensible fellow; he complained of 
some little indignities shown their order, particularly in making 
part of their house the common prison by his Majesty s Go 
vernors. I promised redress, and hinted, at the same time, the 
great probability of that society enjoying their estate (notwith 
standing Sir Jeffery Amherst s pretensions), should this province 
accede to the General Union. 

I hope this hint may be of service ; the priests hitherto hav 
ing done us all the mischief in their power in many parishes. 
They will not yet give the people absolution. However, I have 
shown all the respect in my power to religion, and have winked 
at this behaviour in the priests, for fear of giving malice a 
handle. 

I wish I could have apprised you, in time, of your obliga 
tions to Captain McKay. He generously offered Mr. Carleton, 
if he would give him two hundred men, to go and burn the 
new church at Saratoga last summer. He is so inveterate a 
fellow that I think, if the other prisoners should be indulged 
in returning to their families this winter, he ought not to be 
permitted to enter this province. "When a Convention is assem 
bled, I propose requesting the return of the other gentlemen, 
on their parole. The inhabitants are our friends on both sides 
of the river to Quebec; our expresses go without interruption 
backwards and forwards ; a young man who is got out of Que 
bec, informs me, that the Lieutenant-Governor, the Chief Justice, 
and several others, have put their baggage on board ship, and 
that no ship is permitted to sail ; this looks as if they de 
spaired of making a defence. Colonel McLean has threatened a 
[sally,] and Arnold is apprised of it, and his troops wish for it. 

I hear there is a considerable quantity of powder at Niagara ; 
perhaps this may be thought an object worthy of attention; 
they have been very apprehensive of an attack from the Vir 
ginians in that quarter all this summer. 



APPENDIX.] OPEKATIONS IN CANADA. 48 * 

I fear Carleton has thrown a great quantity of powder into 
the river. I have desired a severe message to be delivered 
to him on that subject. 

Farewell, my dear Sir, and believe me, with all regard and 
respect, Your most obedient servant, 

RICHARD MONTGOMERY. 

P. S. Hard money should be sent down. I can get some 
thousands here from Price, though not sufficient to answer all 
expenses, and it is too soon to offer paper. 



COLONEL ARNOLD TO GENERAL MONTGOMERY. 

Point-aux-Trcmbles, 20 November, 1775. 
DEAR SIR, 

I wrote you the 14th and 16th instant from before Quebec, 
which I make no doubt you have received. I have this mi 
nute the pleasure of yours of the 17th instant. I heartily con 
gratulate you on your success, and hope, as fortune has so far 
been favorable, and is generally so to the brave, it may in 
future be equal to your warmest wishes. 

It was not in my power, before the 18th, to make an exact 
scrutiny into the arms and ammunition of my detachment, when, 
upon examination, great part of our cartridges proved unfit for 
service, and, to my great surprise, we had no more than five 
rounds for each man, and near one hundred muskets unfit for 
service. Add to this, many of the men invalids, almost naked, 
and wanting every necessary to make them comfortable. The 
same day I received advice from my friends in town, that Colo 
nel McLean was making preparation, and had determined in a 
day or two to come out and attack us ; and, as his numbers 
were greatly superior to ours, with a number of field-pieces, 
and the limits of Quebec are so extensive, I found it impos 
sible entirely to cut off their communication with the country, 
without dividing the small number of men I have (about five 
hundred and fifty effective), so as to render them an easy sacri 
lice to the besieged. I therefore concluded it most prudent to 
retire to this place, and ordered the main body to march at 
three o clock yesterday morning, and \\aited, with a small de 
tachment, to watch the motions of the enemy until the main 
body were out of danger. They all arrived here last night. I 



488 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [1775. 

have procured leather sufficient to shoe them all in a day or 
two, the only article of clothing to be had in this part of the 
country. Inclosed is a memorandum of clothing absolutely neces 
sary for a winter s campaign, which I beg the favor of your 
forwarding to me as soon as possible. Should it be troublesome, 
I have desired the bearer, Captain Ogden, a young gentleman 
and volunteer from the Jerseys, to procure them, and some 
other articles the officers are in want of, and beg the favor of 
your order to forward them on. 

Captain Napier, in the snow, and a small schooner, passed us 
yesterday, and is now at Quebec. The two frigates were laid 
up the 18th; their guns and men all taken on shore. They are 
getting all the provisions they possibly can out of the country, 
and are doubtless determined to make the best defence. From 
the best accounts I can get, their force is about nineteen hun 
dred men, namely ; landed from the frigate and two transports 
from St. John s, one hundred and fifty recruits; Colonel McLean s 
regiment, one hundred and seventy irregulars ; from the Lizard, 
two hundred seamen and marines ; from the Hunter sloop, one 
hundred ; on board Captain Napier, one hundred and fifty, which 
make seven hundred and seventy; inhabitants, French and Eng 
lish, on their side, one hundred and thirty; ditto, obliged to bear 
arms against their inclination, and who would join us if an 
opportunity presented, six hundred; neutrals, four hundred; total, 
eighteen hundred and seventy. You will, from the above ac 
count, be better able to judge of the force necessary to carry 
the town. If my opinion is of any service, I should think two 
thousand necessary, as they must be divided at the distance of 
three or four miles, to secure the passes effectually ; and as 
there is no probability of cannon making a breach in the walls, 
I should think mortars of the most service ; the situation for 
heaving shells being extremely good, and I think, of course, 
would soon bring them to compliance ; if not, time and perse 
verance must effect it before they can possibly be relieved. 

Colonel Allen and his party have been some time since sent 
to England in irons. Mr. Walker I have not heard of. I 
have ordered Captain Ogden to send down all the powder and 
ball on the road. If he should not be able to procure suffi 
cient, I make no doubt of your forwarding it as soon as pos 
sible. The inhabitants are very friendly, and give all the as 
sistance they dare to do at present. Had we a sufficient force 
to blockade the garrison, I make no doubt of their coming to 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 489 

our assistance in great numbers. As it will doubtless take some 
time in bringing down your artillery, would it not be better, if 
you can spare them, to send down five or six hundred men, 
who, joined to my little corps, will be able to cut off their 
communication with the country? 

I am, dear General, &c. 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 

P. S. My hard cash is nearly exhausted. It will not be 
sufficient for more than ten days or a fortnight, and, as the 
French have been such sufferers by paper money, I do not think 
it prudent to offer it to them at present. B. A. 



COLONEL ARNOLD TO GENERAL WASHINGTON. 

Point-aux-Trembles, 20 November, 1775. 

MAY IT TLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 

My last, of the 14th instant, was from Point Levy. The same 
evening I passed the St. Lawrence without obstruction, except 
from a barge, into which we fired, and killed three men ; but, 
as the enemy were apprised of our coming, and the garrison 
augmented to near seven hundred men, besides the inhabitants, 
it was not thought proper to storm the place, but cut off their 
communication with the country, until the arrival of General 
Montgomery. We accordingly invested the town with about five 
hundred and fifty effective men, took possession of the Nunnery, 
and Colonel C. s house, about half a league from town. We 
marched up several times near the walls, in hopes of drawing 
them out, but to no effect, though they kept a constant cannon 
ading, and killed us one man. 

On the 18th, having intelligence that Captain Napier, in an 
armed snow, with near two hundred men, having made his 
escape from Montreal, was very near, and that the garrison, fur 
nished with a number of good field-pieces, intended attacking us 
the next day, I ordered a strict examination to be made into 
the state of our arms and ammunition, when, to my great surprise, 
I found many of our cartridges unfit for use, which, to appearance, 
were very good, and that we had no more than five rounds to 
each man. It was judged prudent, in our situation, not to hazard 
a battle, but retire to this place, eight leagues from Quebec, 



490 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 1775. 

which we did yesterday, and are waiting here with impatience 
the arrival of General Montgomery, which we expect in a few 
days. 

I have been obliged to send to Montreal for clothing for iny 
people, about six hundred and fifty in the whole, who are almost 
naked, and in want of every necessary. I have been as careful 
of cash as possible, but shall soon have occasion for hard money. 
As the French have been such sufferers from paper heretofore, 
and mine so large, I thought it not prudent to offer it them at 
present. I have written to General Montgomery my situation 
and wants, which I expect will be supplied by him. Had I 
been ten days sooner, Quebec must inevitably have fallen into 
our hands, as there was not a man then to oppose us. However, 
I make no doubt General Montgomery \vill reduce it this winter, 
if properly supported with men, which, in my opinion, cannot 
in the whole be less than two thousand five hundred, though it 
may possibly be effected with a less number. The fatigue will 
be severe at this season and in this inclement climate. I have 
the honor to be, with the greatest respect, your Excellency s 
most obedient and very humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



GENERAL MONTGOMERY TO GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Montreal, 2-i November, 1775. 
MY DEAR GENERAL, 

I am ashamed of dating my letter from hence ; you will be 
surprised at my long stay here, but day after day have I been 
delayed without a possibility of getting to Arnold s assistance. 
His last letter I inclose to you, together with one for Gene 
ral Washington. 

To-morrow, I believe, I shall sail with two or three hun 
dred men, some mortars and other artillery. It is with great 
indignation I hear Lieutenant Ilalsey, whom I left as Assistant 
Engineer at St. John s, to put the barracks in a proper state 
for the reception of a garrison, has run away without leave, 
taking with him the artificers I had left to carry on the work. 
This behaviour deserves the severest punishment. I beg he may 
be made an example of; he is a fit subject of it, and deserved 
to have been dismissed for endeavouring to persuade the sol 
diers to return from St. John s, and not to proceed to Mon- 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 491 

trcal. Lieutenant Graham, of the fourth regiment, and several 
others, can prosecute him. 

It will be necessary to send hard money here immediately, 
as paper will not yet go down. Price has lent me five thou 
sand pounds, York money; Walker has been so fortunate as to 
get home, being retaken in one of the vessels. Poor Allen 
is sent to England in irons. Should any accident befall him, 
I hope Prescott will fall a sacrifice to his manes.* 

I sent by Mr. Schuyler a return of provisions, taken in the 
vessels. I wish Lee could sec off immediately for the command 
here. I have thoughts of disarming the Tories in this town; 
not so much from any apprehensions I have of them, as to 
quiet the jealous apprehensions of the troops. Several Commis 
sioners and other officers are flown without settling their ac 
counts. I hope those people will incur the heavy censure of 
Congress. One, Mr. Waterhouse, who was appointed by Colonel 
Bedel, and whose conduct must be inquired into, having, I fear, 
made great waste of public stores ; one, Mr. Stewart, who acted 
at Laprairie ; one, Mr. Power, who acted at St. John s. Lieu 
tenant-Colonel Warner has, I believe, large accounts unsettled. 
In short, there are great abuses to be rectified. 

I wish exceedingly for a respectable Committee of Congress. 
I really have not weight enough to carry on business by my 
self. I send you the two Indians taken in Carleton s attack. 
I forgot to make you this present before. 

With respect to the Canadian soldiery, I think you may ven 
ture to send them back. The I should imagine might 
influence in some measure the choice of representation for a 
Convention. I am, my dear General, with sentiments of real 
esteem and respect, your most affectionate, humble servant, 

RICHARD MONTGOMERY. 

P. S. The Indians are of the Conosadago. I have not, I 
believe, more than eight hundred effective here. However, I 
can have as many Canadians, as I know how to maintain ; at 
least I think so, while affairs wear so promising an aspect. 

* The British General Prescott had recently been captured. He was 
charged with cruel treatment to Ethan Allen, who had been taken pri 
soner, and was confined on board the schooner Gaspee with irons upon 
his hands and feet, by order of Prescott. General Washington wrote 
to General Howe on the subject, and threatened to retaliate upon Ge 
neral Prescott whatever treatment should be received by Colonel Allen.

GENERAL MONTGOMERY TO GENERAL SCIIL YLER. 

Holland House, near the Heights of 

Abraham, 5 December, 1775. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

I have been this evening favored with yours of the 19th 
ultimo. I return you many thanks for your warm congratula 
tions. Nothing shall be wanting on my part to reap the ad- 
vanta o- e of our ood fortune. The season has proved so favor- 

C5 ^ -* 

able as to enable me to join Colonel Arnold at Point-aux- 
Trembles, where I arrived with the vessels Mr. Prescott made 
us a present of.* They carried the few troops, about three 
hundred, who were equipped for a winter s campaign, with the 
artillery, &c. Colonel Livingston is on his way with some 
part of his regiment of Canadians. 

Mr. Carleton, who is, I suppose, ashamed to show himself 
in England, is now in town, and puts on the show of defence. 
The works of Quebec are extremely extensive, and very in 
capable of being defended. His garrison consists of McLean s 
banditti, the sailors from the frigates and other vessels laid up, 
together with the citizens obliged to take up arms, most of 
whom are impatient of the fatigues of a siege, and wish to see 
matters accommodated amicably. I propose amusing Mr. Carle- 
ton witli a formal attack, erecting batteries, &rc., but mean to 
insult the works, I believe towards the Lower Town, which is 
the weakest part. I have this day written to Mr. Carleton, 
and also to the inhabitants, which I hope will have some effect. 
I shall be very sorry to be reduced to this mode of attack, 
because I know the melancholy consequences. But the approach 
ing severe season, and the weakness of the garrison, together 
with the nature of the works, point it out too strongly to be 
passed by. 

I find Colonel Arnold s corps an exceeding fine one, inured 
to fatigue, and well accustomed to cannon shot (at Cambridge). 
There is a style of discipline among them much superior to 
what I have been used to see this campaign. He himself is 
active, intelligent, and enterprising. Fortune often bailies the 
sanguine expectations of poor mortals. I am not intoxicated 
with the favors I have received at her hands, but I do think 
there is a fair prospect of success. 

* He joined Arnold at Point-aux-Trcmblcs on the 3d of December, 
and they arrived at Quebec the next day. 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 493 

The Governor lias been so kind as to send out of town 
many of our friends, who refused to do military duty ; among 
them several very intelligent men, capable of doing me consider 
able service. One of them, a Mr. Antill, I have appointed 
Chief Engineer. Mr. Mott and all his suite have returned home. 

Be so good as to show Congress the necessity I was under 
of clothing the troops, to induce them to stay, and undertake 
this service at such an inclement season. I think, had their 
Committee been with me, they would have seen the propriety 
of grasping at every circumstance in niy power to induce them 
to engage again. I was not without my apprehensions of not 
only being unable to make any appearance here, but even of 
being obliged to relinquish the ground I had gained. How 
ever, I hope the clothing and dollar bounty will not greatly 
exceed the bounty offered by Congress. 

Whilst the affair of Chamblee was in agitation, Major Brown, 
as I am well informed, made some promises to the Canadians 
who engaged on that service, which I believe I must, from 
motives of policy as well as justice, make good; namely, to 
share the stores, except ammunition and artillery. When mat 
ters are settled, I shall pay them in money, it being incon 
venient to part with the provisions. 

Upon another occasion I have also ventured to go beyond 
the letter of the law. Colonel Easton s detachment at the mouth 
of the Sorel was employed on the important service of stop 
ping the fleet. They were half naked, and the weather was 
very severe. I was afraid that not only they might grow 
impatient, and relinquish the business in hand, but I also saw 
the reluctance the troops at Montreal showed to quit it. By 
way of stimulant I offered, as a reward, all public stores taken 
in the vessels to the troops who went forward, except ammu 
nition and provisions. Warner s corps refused to march, or at 
least declined it. Bedel s went on, and came in for a share 
of the labor and honor. I hope the Congress will not think 
this money ill laid out. 

With a year s clothing of the seventh and twenty-sixth, I 
have relieved the distresses of Arnold s corps, and forwarded 
the clothing of some other corps. The greatest part of that 
clothing is a fair prize, except such as immediately belonged 
to the prisoners taken on board. They must be paid for theirs, 
as it was their own property. We shall have more time here 
after to settle this affair. 

VOL. i. 42 



494 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [1775. 

Should there be any reason to apprehend an effort next 
spring to regain Canada, I would not wish to see less than 
ten thousand men ordered here. The Canadians will be our 
friends so long as we are able to maintain our ground, but 
they must not be depended upon, especially for defensive opera 
tions. The great distance from any support or relief, renders 
it, in my opinion, absolutely necessary to make the most for 
midable preparations for the security of this important Province. 
What advantages the country below Quebec affords for defence, 
I cannot yet assert, but the Rapids of Richelieu, some miles 
above, may be defended against all the navy and all the mili 
tary force of Great Britain, by such a body of troops as I 
have mentioned, provided with sufficient artillery, row-galleys, 
and proper vessels fitted for fire-ships. 

Some time since, you desired a return from General \Toos- 
ter of the men he had discharged between Albany and Ticon- 
deroga. I was afraid there might be something disagreeable 
to him in the desire, and, as it was too critical a time to put 
anybody out of humor, I therefore suppressed it. I shall now 
make him acquainted with your pleasure on that head. 

There are several appointments I have thought necessary to 
make, which I shall soon make known to you. I hope the 
Congress will not yield to any solicitations to the prejudice of 
the troops who have borne the burden of the service here. 
I have paid particular attention to Colonel Arnold s recommend 
ations. Indeed, I must say, he has brought with him many 
pretty young men. 

I do not know that I informed you, that it was in vain to 
think of engaging the troops for twelve months. The loth of 
April, which allows them time to plant their corn upon return 
ing home, was all I dared to ask. I hope the proper mea 
sures will be taken for sending fresh troops into the country 

before that time. I am, &c., 

RICHARD MONTGOMERY. 



GENERAL MONTGOMERY TO GOVERNOR CARLETON. 

Holland House, G December, 1775. 
SIR, 

Notwithstanding the personal ill treatment I have received at 
your hands, notwithstanding the cruelty you have shown to the 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 495 

unhappy prisoners you have taken, the feelings of humanity in 
duce me to have recourse to this expedient to save you from the 
destruction which hangs over your wretched garrison. Give me 
leave to inform you, that I am well acquainted with your situation ; 
a great extent of works, in their nature incapable of defence, 
manned with a motley crew of sailors, most of them our friends, 
and citizens who wish to see us within their walls, a few of the 
worst troops that call themselves soldiers, the impossibility of re 
lief, and the certain prospect of wanting every necessary of life, 
should your opponents confine their operations to a single blockade, 
point out the absurdity of resistance. Such is your situation. 

I am at the head of troops accustomed to success, confident 
of the righteous cause they are engaged in, inured to danger and 
fatigue, and so highly incensed at your inhumanity, illiberal abuse, 
and the ungenerous means employed to prejudice them in the minds 
of the Canadians, that it is with difficulty I restrain them, till 
my batteries are ready, from insulting your works, which would 
afford them the fair opportunity of ample vengeance and just 
retaliation. 

Firing upon a flag of truce, hitherto unprecedented, even among 
savages, prevents rny following the ordinary mode of conveying 
my sentiments. However, I will at any rate acquit my conscience. 
Should you persist in an unwarrantable defence, the consequence 
be upon your own head. Beware of destroying stores of any 
sort, public or private, as you did at Montreal, or in the river ; 
if you do, by heavens there will be no mercy shown. 

RICHARD MONTGOMERY. 



GENERAL MONTGOMERY TO GENERAL WOOSTER. 

Head-Quarters, before Quebec, 16 December, 1775. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

The bearer, Mr. Melchior, I sent express to St. John s for ar 
tillery stores. Be so good as to give him all the assistance in 
your power, particularly in money matters. Yesterday we opened 
a battery of five guns and a howitzer, and, with very little effect, 
I attempted to summon the Governor by a flag of truce. He 
would not receive any letter. The enemy have very heavy 
metal, and I think will dismount our guns very shortly. Some 
they have already rendered almost useless. This gives very little 
uneasiness ; I never expected any other advantage from our ar- 



496 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [1775. 

lillery, than to amuse the enemy, and blind them as to my real 
intention. 

I propose, the first strong northwester, to make two attacks by 
night, one with about a third of the troops on the Lower Town, 
having first set fire to some houses, which will in all probability 
communicate their flames to the stockade lately erected on the 
rock, near St. Roc suburbs; the other upon Cape Diamond bas 
tion, by escalade. I have not time to point out my reasons for 
this particular attack. Let it sufTice that it is founded on the 
nature of the ground, works, and the best intelligence I have been 
able to procure. However, I am not certain whether or no the 
troops relish this mode of proceeding. I am fully convinced of the 
practicability. But should it not appear in the same advantageous 
light to the men, I shall not press it upon them, well knowing 
the impossibility of making troops act with the necessary vigor, 
on such an occasion, if their minds are possessed with imaginary 
terrors . 

We are exceeding weak, it is true, but the enemy are so too, 
in proportion to the extent of their works ; and as they know 
not where they will be attacked, all must be guarded. Indeed, 
their apprehensions for the Lower Town, induce them to bestow 
their greatest attention on that quarter. I hope the arms, lead, 
and flints are on their way. I could wish for a reinforcement, 
if to be spared. We have not much above eight hundred men 
fit for duty, exclusive of a few ragamuffin Canadians. 

I believe you will not think it proper to let the contents of this 
letter go abroad. Should you have no accounts of any cash on 
the way, I must beg you will send an express to hasten it. I 
shall soon be exceedingly distressed, if a supply don t arrive. I 
must therefore beg you to raise what you can, for fear of acci 
dents. Let a considerable number of shirts be sent down as 
soon as possible. Our men are much in want of them. I must 
refer you to Mr. Melchior for particulars. Believe me, dear Sir, 
with much esteem, 

Your affectionate, humble servant, 

RICHARD MONTGOMERY. 



GENERAL MONTGOMERY TO GENERAL SCIIUYLER. 

Head-Quarters, 18 December, 1775. 
MY DEAR GENERAL, 

I have been near a fortnight before Quebec, at the head of 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 497 

upwards of eight hundred men ; a force, you will say, not very 
adequate to the business in hand. But we must make the best of 
it. It is all I could get. I have been so used to struggle with 
difficulties, that I expect them of course. 

I hope the troops will be sent down as soon as possible, for 
should we fail in our first attempt, a second or a third may do 
the business, before relief can arrive to the garrison. Possession 
of the town, and that speedily, I hold of the highest consequence. 
The enemy are expending the ammunition most liberally ; and I 
fear the Canadians will not relish a union with the Colonies, till 
they see the whole country in our hands, and defended by such 
a force as may relieve them from the apprehensions of again 
falling under the ministerial lash. Were it not for these reasons, 
I should have been inclined to a blockade, till towards the first 
of April, by which time the garrison would probably be much 
distressed for provisions and wood. 

With anxious wishes for the recovery of your health, and best 
respects to your family, if you be returned home, I am, niy 
dear Sir, your very affectionate and obliged, humble servant, 

RICHARD MONTGOMERY. 



GENERAL MONTGOMERY TO GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Head- Quarters, before Quebec, 26 December, 1775. 
MY DEAR GENERAL, 

When last I had the honor to write, I hoped before now to 
hive had it in my power to give you some good news. I then 
had reason to believe the troops well inclined for a coup-de- 
main. I have since discovered, to my great mortification, that 
three companies of Colonel Arnold s detachment are very averse 
from the measure. There is strong reason to believe tkeir dif 
ference of sentiment from the rest of the troops arises from the 
influence of their officers. Captain * , who has incurred 

Colonel Arnold s displeasure by some misconduct, and thereby 
given room for harsh language, is at the bottom of it, and has 
made some declarations which I think must draw upon him the 
censure of his country, if brought to trial. Captain and 

Ilubbard seem to espouse his quarrel. A Field-Officer is con 
cerned in it, who wishes, I suppose, to have the separate com- 

* The blanks are in the copy sent by General Schuyler to General 
Washington. 

42* 



498 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [1775. 

mand of those companies, as the above-mentioned Captains have 
made application for that purpose. This dangerous party threat 
ens the ruin of our affairs. I shall at any rate be obliged to 
change my plan of attack, being too weak to put that in execu 
tion I had formerly determined on. I am much afraid my 
friend is deeply concerned in this business. I will have 

an eclaircissement with him on the subject. I will hereafter ac 
quaint you more particularly with this matter. In the mean 
time, I wish you would not mention names, for I know not 
whether the situation of affairs will admit of doing the public 
the justice I could wish. 

Strain every nerve to send a large corps of troops down, the 
instant the Lake is passable. It is of the utmost importance 
we should be possessed of Quebec before succours can arrive ; and 
I must here give it to you as my opinion, and that of several 
sensible men acquainted with this Province, that we are not to 
expect a union with Canada till we have a force in the coun 
try sufficient to insure it against any attempt that may be 
made for its recovery. I believe I have mentioned this in my 
last, but I can t help repeating it again. One difficulty occurs 
to me. How are those troops to be paid here? The Conti 
nental money will not be received by the inhabitants. I had 
distributed part of it to the troops at Montreal ; few would re 
ceive it. The consequence was, the soldier offered it for less 
than its value, and so it became depreciated. One scheme has 
occurred to me, which I shall communicate by this opportunity 
to Price and our other friends at Montreal. If they can send 
down to the army such articles as soldiers choose to lay out 
their money upon, employing sutlers for that purpose, who will 
receive our paper, the troops may then be paid in Continental 
currency, which will not be depreciated ; the soldier will not 
grumble, as he may be regularly paid ; and, by degrees, the 
inhabitants may acquire confidence in it, seeing our merchants 
take it freely. What hard cash can be mustered might pay 
the contingencies of the army, such as transportation of bag 
gage, &c., and purchase provisions. 

I am amazed no money is yet arrived. The troops arc un 
easy, and I shall by and by be at my wits end to furnish the 
army with provisions. I am the more surprised, as I am 
credibly informed cash arrived from Philadelphia at Ticondero- 
ga three weeks since. I have almost exhausted Price, having 
had upwards of five thousand pounds York from him. I must 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 499 

take this opportunity of acknowledging his services. He has 
been a faithful friend to the cause indeed. His advice and 
assistance, upon every occasion, I have been much benefited 
by ; and when I consider that he has been the first mover of 
those measures which have been attended with so many and 
great advantages to the United Colonies, I can t help wishing 
the Congress to give him an ample testimony of their sense 
of his generous and spirited exertions in the cause of freedom. 

Having so early reported to you my determination to return 
home, I take it for granted measures are taken to supply my 
place. Should not anybody arrive shortly for that purpose, I 
must conclude Congress mean to leave the management of af 
fairs in General Wooster s hands ; and therefore, if this busi 
ness should terminate in a blockade, I shall think myself at 
liberty to return. However, if possible, I shall make an effort 
for the reduction of the town. I will shortly comply with 
several articles of directions, which I have received from you, 
and which I deferred in hopes of complying with them before 
now, in peaceable possession of Quebec. The strange divided 
state of the troops all this campaign has prevented my sending 
returns, having never been able to get one with any tolerable 
exactness. The three discontented companies are within a few 
days of being free from their engagements. I must try every 
means to prevent their departure, and in this matter I am much 
embarrassed. Their officers have offered to stay, provided they 
may join some other corps. This is resentment against Arnold, 
and will hurt him so much, that I don t think I can consent to 
it. I am, dear Sir, with great respect and esteem, 

Your most obedient and affectionate, humble servant, 

RICHARD MONTGOMERY.* 



COLONEL ARNOLD TO GENERAL WOOSTER. 

General Hospital, 31 December, 1775. 
DEAR SIR, 

I make no doubt but General Montgomery acquainted you 
with his intentions of storming Quebec as soon as a good oppor- 

* Five days after the date of this letter, General Montgomery was 
slain in the assault on Quebec. 



500 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [177;. 

tunity offered. As we had several men deserted from us a few 
days past, the General was induced to alter his plan, which was 
to have attacked the Upper and Lower Town at the same time. 
He thought it most prudent to make two different attacks upon 
the Lower Town ; the one at Cape Diamond, the other through 
St. Koc. For the last attack, I was ordered, with my own de 
tachment and Captain Lamb s company of artillery. At five 
o clock, the hour appointed for the attack, a false attack was or 
dered to be made upon the Upper Town. 

We accordingly began our march. I passed through St. Roc. 
and approached near a two-gun battery, picketed in, without be 
ing discovered, which we attacked. It was bravely defended for 
about an hour; but, with the loss of a number of men, we car 
ried it. In the attack, I was shot through the leg, and was 
obliged to be carried to the hospital, where I soon heard the disa 
greeable news that the General was defeated at Cape Diamond ; 
himself, Captain Macpherson, his Aid-de-camp, and Captain Cheese- 
man, killed on the spot, with a number of others not known. 
After gaining the battery, my detachment pushed on to a second 
barrier, which they took possession of. At the same time, the 
enemy sallied out from Palace Gate, and attacked them in the 
rear. A field-piece, which the roughness of the road would not 
permit our carrying on, fell into the enemy s hands, with a num 
ber of prisoners. The last accounts from my detachment, about 
ten minutes since, they were pushing for the Lower Town. Their 
communication with me was cut off. I am exceedingly appre 
hensive what the event will be ; they will either carry the Lower 
Town, be made prisoners, or cut to pieces. 

I thought proper to send an express to let you know the criti 
cal situation we are in, and make no doubt you will give us all 
the assistance in your power. As I am not able to act, I shall 
give up the command to Colonel Campbell. I beg you will im 
mediately send an express to the Honorable Continental Congress, 
and his Excellency General Washington. The loss of my de 
tachment, before I left it, was about twenty men, killed and 
wounded ; among the latter is Major Ogden, who, with Captain 
Oswald, Captain Burr, and the other volunteers, behaved ex 
tremely well. I have only time to add that I am, with the 
greatest esteem, &c., 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 

P. S. It is- impossible to say what our future operations will 
be, until we know the fate of my detachment. 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 501 

COLONEL ARNOLD TO GENERAL WOOSTER. 

General Hospital, 2 January, 1776. 
DEAR SIR, 

I wrote you, three days since, of our defeat, and the death of 
General Montgomery and others, with all the information I then 
had of the matter. We have been in suspense, with regard to 
my detachment, until this afternoon, when Major Mcigs was sent 
out, with a flag, for the officers baggage, who, he says, are all 
taken prisoners, except Captain Hendricks, Lieutenant Humph 
reys, of the riflemen, and Lieutenant Cooper, who were killed 
in the action. General Caiieton says our loss, in killed and 
wounded, is a hundred. Major Meigs thinks it does not exceed 
sixty, and about three hundred taken prisoners, who are treated 
very humanely. These brave men sustained the force of the 
whole garrison for three hours, but were finally obliged to yield 
to numbers, and the advantageous situation the garrison had over 
them. Several other officers, I am told, are slightly wounded. 

We had the misfortune of losing one brass six-pounder in the 
engagement, and all our mortars were taken from St. Roc the 
evening after the engagement. This was the fault of some of 
the officers who commanded, as they might very easily have been 
brought away, agreeably to my positive orders for that purpose. 
Our force, at this time, does not exceed eight hundred men, in 
cluding Colonel Livingston s regiment of two hundred Canadians, 
and some scattered Canadian forces, amounting to two hundred 
more. Many of the troops are dejected and anxious to get home, 
and some have actually set off. I shall endeavour to continue 
the blockade, while there are any hopes of success. For God s 
sake, order as many men down as you can possibly spare, con 
sistent with the safety of Montreal, and all the mortars, howit 
zers, and shells, that you can possibly bring. I hope you will 
stop every rascal who has deserted from us, and bring him back 
again. 

Every possible mark of distinction was shown to the corpse of 
General Montgomery, who was to be interred in Quebec this 
day. Had he been properly supported by his troops, I make no 
doubt of our success. We are short of cash. Not more than 
four or five hundred pounds, and only twenty barrels of salt 
pork. If any can be spared from Montreal, I think best to 
bring it down, and all the butter. 



502 GTE RATIONS IN CANADA. [1776. 

I beg you will transmit a copy of this letter to the Honorable 
Continental Congress, and another to his Excellency, General 
Washington. I think it will be highly necessary, with the reen- 
forcement which, I make no doubt, Congress will send, that 
they should order all the large mortars and howitzers at Crown 
Point, Ticonderoga, and Fort George, on to this place. Mon 
sieur Pallasier, who has a furnace at Three Rivers, assures me 
that he can cast any size and number of shells between this and 
the beginning of April. I hope the Honorable Continental Con 
gress will not think of sending less than eight or ten thousand 
men to secure and form a lasting connection with this country. 

I am in such excessive pain from my wound (as the bones of 
my leg are affected), I can only add, that I am, with the great 
est esteem, dear Sir, 

Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 

N. B. Many officers here appear dispirited. Your presence 
will be absolutely necessary. I do not expect to be in a ca 
pacity to act this two months. 



GENERAL ARNOLD TO THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS.* 

Camp, before Quebec, 11 January, 177G. 
GENTLEMEN, 

I take the liberty most heartily to condole with you on the 
loss of the great, amiable, and brave General Montgomery, and 
those brave men who fell with him. By his death the com 
mand of the army devolves on me ; of course, I have care 
fully examined his instructions from the Honorable Continental 
Congress, and their resolutions respecting this country. I find 
it strongly recommended to him to conciliate the affections of 
the Canadians, and cherish every dawning of liberty which ap 
pears among them, and to assure them of the protection and 
friendship of the Congress, and to endeavour to form, on a last 
ing basis, a firm union between them and the Colonies, by 
forming a Provincial Congress, and from that body giving them 
a full representation in the grand Continental Congress. This, 



K " Arnold was appointed a Brigadier-General by Congress on the 
10th of January. 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 503 

I am confident, the General labored with the greatest assiduity, 
and with as great a degree of success as could be expected 
under the present state of affairs. 

The disposition of the Canadians is very favorable to your 
wishes ; the only bar of consequence is Quebec. As this is 
the key, so, in a great measure, it governs the whole coun 
try, who having been so long habituated to slavery, and having, 
as yet, but a faint sense of the value of liberty, are natu 
rally timorous and diffident, and want every possible encourage 
ment to take an active part. This bar removed, I humbly con 
ceive every other obstacle to a firm and lasting union with 
Canada will of course be removed. So long as Quebec remains 
in the hands of the enemy, it will not be in our power to 
assist and protect them ; of course, we cannot expect their hearty 
exertions in our favor. Quebec appears to me an object of 
the highest importance to the Colonies, and, if proper methods 
are adopted, must inevitably fall into their hands before the 
garrison can be relieved. 

The whole garrison of Quebec, including men, women, and 
children, is supposed, by a gentleman who left town the begin 
ning of December, to be four thousand; a gentleman of veracity 
assures me, that Mr. Alsop, the King s Commissary, told him, 
in confidence, that there were not one thousand barrels of flour 
in the town ; and it was notorious among the merchants, that 
there were not eight thousand bushels of wheat, and no conve- 
niency for flouring it. Provisions of meat were known to be 
much less lhan those of bread, though they had some quantity 
of fish. It is generally agreed they had short of four months 
provision on the 1st December. This cannot be exactly ascer 
tained, as the Governor denied the inhabitants liberty of viewing 
the stores, or giving them any satisfaction in regard to the quan 
tity. 

It appears a blockade must answer our purpose ; it is possible 
it may not. Will it be prudent to trust an object of such vast 
importance to the event? With submission, I think it will not. 
What is to be done? A sufficient force employed to reduce it 
by a regular siege, or assault ? If the first is attempted, an addi 
tion of three thousand men. to our present force will, I make no 
doubt, be thought necessary; if the latter, at least five thousand. 
The former, with a vast expense and great waste of ammunition, 
may prove unsuccessful; the latter, from the extensiveness of 
their works, I think cannot; and five thousand men will hardly 
be a sufficient garrison, if the place is taken. 



504 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [1776. 

I beg leave to recommend the sending a body of at least live 
thousand men, with an experienced General, into Canada as early 
as possible ; and, in the mean time, that every possible preparation 
of mortars, howitzers, and some heavy cannon should be made, 
as the season will permit our raising batteries by the middle of 
March, which may very possibly be attended with success, as we 
can place our mortars under cover within t\vo hundred yards of 
the walls, and within one thousand of the centre of the town : 
and, if supplied with shells, carcasses, &c., can set fire to it, 
whenever we please, which I make no doubt would reduce the 
garrison to terms. I am well assured more than one half of the 
inhabitants of Quebec would gladly open the gates to us, but arc 
prevented by the strict discipline and watch kept over them ; the 
command of the guards being constantly given to officers of the 
Crown, known to be firm in their interest. 

The garrison consists of about fifteen hundred men, great part 
of whom Governor Carleton can place no confidence in, or he 
would not suffer a blockade, and every distress of a siege, by 
seven hundred men, our force consisting of no more at present, 
including Colonel Livingston s regiment of two hundred Cana 
dians. I have arranged my men in such order as effectually to 
blockade the city, and to assist each other as early as possible, 
if attacked. The men are obliged to lie on their arms constantly, 
arid to mount guard every other night. Their duty is exceed 
ingly hard. However, the men appear alert and cheerful, though 
wanting many necessaries, which cannot be procured here. I ex 
pect General Wooster from Montreal with a reenforcement every 
minute. I have withdrawn our cannon from the battery, and 
placed them round the magazine, which contains a considerable 
quantity of powder and ordnance stores, which I am fearful of 
removing, lest it should make unfavorable impressions on the 
Canadians, and induce them to withdraw their assistance, and 
Governor Carleton, presuming on our panic, to sally out. I 
thought it most prudent to put the best face on matters, and be 
tray no marks of fear. 

We are in great want of cash. Our finances have never af 
forded any of consequence to the troops, who make heavy com 
plaints, not without reason. We have often been reduced to a 
few Johannes, and never able to procure more than ten days 
sustenance beforehand. Our whole dependence has been on Mr. 
Price, who has done every tiling in his power, and is the only 
resource we have at present. I have received two petards from 
Mons. Pallasier at Three Rivers, who assures me he can supply 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA 505 

us with shells by the 1st of April. Inclosed is a list of officers, 
killed and wounded in the unfortunate attack on Quebec. The 
prisoners and missing amount to about four hundred. Governor 
Carleton has permitted the baggage of both officers and men to 
be sent in, and (strange to tell) treats them with humanity. I 
think myself in justice bound to acknowledge the good conduct 
and intrepidity of both officers and men of my detachment, who 
undauntedly marched up in the face of the enemy s cannon ; in 
particular the volunteers, and Captain Oswald, who signalized 
himself in the attack on their battery, and is now a prisoner. 

I hope, gentlemen, my being confined to my bed with my 
wound, and a severe fit of the gout, will apologize for the inco- 
herency and incorrectness of my scrawl ; and that you will believe 
me, with the greatest respect and esteem, Gentlemen, yours, &c., 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



GENERAL ARNOLD TO THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS. 

Camp, before Quebec, 12 January, 1776. 
GENTLEMEN, 

Since writing the inclosed, General Wooster has acquainted me 
he cannot leave Montreal, but has sent down Colonel Clinton, to 
whom I shall resign the command, until my wound will permit my 
doing duty, which my surgeon thinks will be four or six weeks. 
Colonel Clinton acquaints me we cannot expect more than two 
hundred men from Montreal. I have put on foot the raising a 
regiment of three or four hundred Canadians, which I make no 
doubt of effecting. They are to have the same pay and to be 
under the same regulations as the Continental forces. I make 
no doubt the exigency of our affairs will justify the step I have 
taken (though without authority for so doing), and that it will 
be approved of by the Honorable Continental Congress. I am, 
&c., BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



GENERAL ARNOLD TO THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS. 

Camp, before Quebec, 24 January, 1776. 
GENTLEMEN, 

I wrote, on the llth instant, advising you of our present 
VOL. i. 43 



506 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [177G. 

situation and that of the enemy, and took the liberty of present 
ing you my sentiments on a future plan of operation, for which 
my zeal for the public service, I hope, will apologize ; since 
which I have made an estimate (which I now inclose) of such 
artillery stores, ammunition, &c., which I imagine will be neces 
sary. If it is thought proper to carry on a siege in form, of 
this I can be no judge, as I know not if powder can be spared 
from below, or shot, shells, &c., sent up in season. The artil 
lery, except a thirteen-inch mortar (at Crown Point), is all in 
this country. I have also inclosed a list of such ammunition, 
stores, &c., as we have on hand. A list of such articles as can 
be procured at Montreal, St. John s, and Chamblee, will be taken 
and sent you by General Wooster. 

I had encouragement from Monsieur Pallasier, at Three Rivers, 
of being furnished with shot, shells, &c., in all the month of 
March. I have this minute received advice from him, that the 
want of coal will prevent his supplying those articles before May. 
As coal is his only objection, I have wrote him to procure it, at 
all events, if it can be done, to supply shells, &c., by the 1st 
of April; of which the bearer, Major Ogden, will inform. This 
measure, I hope, will meet your approbation, as the expense of 
bringing shells from below will be great, and, if not wanted here, 
the cost will be trifling. 

It is very probable the city would surrender before half, or 
perhaps one quarter, of the shot, shells, &c. in my memorandum 
were expended; but, if they should make an obstinate resistance, 
perhaps the whole will be necessary. A gentleman now present 
assures me, that the King s magazines, containing upwards of 
three thousand barrels of powder, were all full, and that three 
hundred barrels, his private property, taken from him by Govern 
ment, was obliged to be stored in a private vault. Add to this 
ten thousand stand of arms, seven thousand of which are new, 
and arrived last summer; also seven thousand complete suits of 
new clothing, with a large quantity of artillery stores, two fri 
gates with a number of other vessels in the harbour, &c., &lt;fcc. 
The above-mentioned articles, exclusive of securing an extensive 
country in our interest, and liberating three or four hundred of 
our brave men, appear an object of the greatest importance to 
us under our present circumstances. I make no doubt every 
necessary measure will be adopted for reducing the city. 

Yesterday arrived here a reenforcement of one hundred men 
from Montreal ; sixty men are soon expected. We are still very 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 507 

weak-handed ; of course the duty severe ; however, the enemy 
have not dared to come out, though they are double our num 
bers. Desertions from the garrison are frequent. They are in 
want of fuel, and have attempted to supply themselves by cut 
ting down the houses in St. Roc s suburbs (under their guns,) 
to prevent which I have burnt most of them, with several ves 
sels they had broke up. Every artifice is used by Governor 
Carleton to procure provisions, and induce the Canadians to take 
arms against us, to no effect, though seconded by the clergy, our 
bitter enemies. I make no doubt of continuing the blockade un 
til a proper reinforcement arrives to make use of more coercive 
measures. 

Major Ogden, the bearer of this to Montreal, who came out 
with me a volunteer, proposes going down to Philadelphia. I 
beg leave to recommend him as a gentleman who has acted 
with great spirit and activity through our fatiguing march, and 
at the attack on Quebec, in which he was wounded. 

General Montgomery, on his arrival in this country, was pleas 
ed to appoint Mr. John Halsted Commissary. He is a gentle 
man who has been very active and zealous in our cause, is a 
merchant, and capable in his department, in which I beg leave 
to recommend his being continued. 

Our finances are low ; we have been obliged to beg, borrow, 
and squeeze to get money for our subsistence; and, but for Mr. 
Price, who has been our greatest resource, we must have suf 
fered. 

I have the agreeable intelligence from General Wooster, that 
the Paymaster is at hand. I am, with great esteem, very re 
spectfully, Gentlemen, &c. 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



GENERAL ARNOLD TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Camp, before Quebec, 1 February, 1776. 
DEAR SIR, 

I have the pleasure of acquainting you, that we still hold our 
ground before Quebec, and keep the enemy closely blockaded, 
though we have received but a small reenforcement of one hun 
dred and fifty men from Montreal. The enemy have, within 
these ten days, sallied out twice at Palace Gate, with about four 
or five hundred men, with a view of seizing two field-pieces we 



508 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [1776. 

have on that side. Our men advanced briskly to attack them, 
when they made a precipitate retreat, under cover of their guns. 
I make no doubt of holding our ground, as we expect a rein 
forcement daily, which W T C are anxiously waiting for, as the duty 
is very severe. 

I have taken the liberty, in former letters to the Honorable 
Continental Congress, to give my opinion in regard to men and 
measures necessary for the reduction of Quebec. The neces 
sary ways and means for supporting those men, I have omitted, 
as General Montgomery, in his lifetime, transmitted you his sen 
timents on the matter, as well as on the necessary measures for 
forming a lasting union between this country and the Colonies. 
I have only to observe, if the Capital is taken, I believe paper 
money will soon have a currency. 

Major John Brown, who came down with General Montgomery, 
with about one hundred and sixty men, collected from different 
regiments, now assumes and insists on the title of Colonel, which 
he says the General promised him at Montreal. That the Gene 
ral promised him promotion, he told me some time before his 
death. When Major Brown wrote to remind him of his promise, 
the General handed me his letter, and told me, at the same time, 
as Colonel Easton and Major Brown were publicly impeached with 
plundering the officers baggage, taken at Sorel, contrary to ar 
ticles of capitulation, and to the great scandal of the American 
army, he could not, in conscience or honor, promote him (Major 
Brown), until those matters were cleared up. He then sent for 
Major Brown, and told him his sentiments on the matter very 
freely; after which I heard of no further application for promo 
tion. This transaction, Colonel Campbell, Major Dubois, and 
several gentlemen were knowing to. As Colonel Easton and 
Major Brown have, doubtless, a sufficient share of modest merit 
to apply to the Honorable Continental Congress for promotion, I 
think it my duty to say, the charge before mentioned is the pub 
lic topic of conversation at Montreal, and among the officers of 
the army in general ; and, as such conduct is unbecoming the 
character of gentlemen or soldiers, I believe it would give great 
disgust to the army in general, if those gentlemen were promoted 
before those matters were cleared up. 

This will be delivered you by Mr. David Hopkins, a gentleman 
who came out a volunteer with me. His spirited conduct, botli 
on our march, and since our arrival in this country, merits my 
recommendation to your notice, of which I think him" worthy. 
I am, &c., BENEDICT ARNOLD.

P. S. The contents of the inclosed letter I do not wish to be

GENERAL ARNOLD TO GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Montreal, 20 April, 1776. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

I hope you will pardon my neglect in not writing to you for 
so long a time, when I acquaint you that I have, from time to 
time, communicated every material intelligence .to General Woos- 
ter, who, I make no doubt, has transmitted the same to you. 
The 1st instant, he arrived at the camp before Quebec; on the 
2d, I had, on an alarm, occasion to mount my horse, who un 
luckily fell on me, and violently bruised my lame leg and ankle, 
which confined me until the 12th, at which time I left the camp, 
and arrived here yesterday. Had I been able to take an active 
part, I should by no means have left the camp ; but as General 
"Wooster did not think proper to consult me in any of his matters, 
J was convinced I should be of more service here than in the 
camp, and he very readily granted me leave of absence, until 
recovered of my lameness. 

Inclosed is a list of our force before Quebec, which, I am 
I sorry to say, is so very inconsiderable, and illy supplied with 
every requisite to carry on a siege, that I am very dubious of 
their success. The 2d instant, we opened a battery of three guns 
and one howitzer, on Point Levy. Another battery of six guns, 
two howitzers, and two small mortars, on the Heights of Abra 
ham, and one of two guns, at the Traverse, were nearly com 
pleted when I came away. To supply the whole, there are only 
three or four tons of powder, and ten or twelve of shot; an en 
gineer and a few artillery men. Two fire-ships, one at Orleans, 
and one at Point-aux- Trembles, were nearly completed, to attempt 
burning their ships, as soon as the ice will admit of it. We have 
few seamen, and not one commander, to man those vessels, or 
I should conceive great hopes of their success. 

Our army are supplied with provisions to the 10th of May, 
after which time their only resource for meat is from below. This 
43* 



510 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [1770. 

country, which is not plentiful at best, is nearly exhausted of 
beef. We can procure a supply of flour, if furnished with cash. 
I am now stretching our credit for that purpose, which is at a 
low ebb. I cannot help lamenting, that more effectual measures 
have not been adopted to secure this country in our interest, an 
object which appears to me of the highest importance to the Co 
lonies. Colonel Hazen, who is a sensible, judicious officer, and 
well acquainted with this country, has shown me his letter to 
you, of the 1st instant. I am sorry to say, I think most of his 
remarks too true ; and if we are not immediately supported with 
eight or ten thousand men, a good train of artillery well served, 
and a military chest well furnished, the ministerial troops, if they 
attempt it, will regain this country, and we shall be obliged to 
quit it, the fatal consequences of which are too obvious. 

On my way up, I carefully examined the rapids of Richelieu, 
fifteen leagues above Quebec, which appear to me a very import 
ant post. The channel runs near the shore, and few ships can 
go up without anchoring near the shore, at the foot of the Ra 
pids, where a battery of ten or twelve guns, and three or four 
gondolas above, will, in my opinion, effectually secure the pass, 
as no ships larger than a frigate can go up. I have despatched 
Lieutenant Johnson, of the train, to Crown Point, for four eighteen 
and eleven twelve-pounders, with what shot are at that place, 
for the above purpose, as we have very little time to fortify. I 
have directed him to bring down a gondola, which, I am told, 
is at Crown Point. We ought to have six or eight of them im 
mediately, to secure the river, and prevent our communication 
being cut off with the army before Quebec. The row-galley that 
was at St. John s has been drove over the Falls, stove to pieces, 
and the gondola cut to pieces ; so that we have only one gondola, 
mounting a twelve-pounder, and in a shattered condition. 

Timber and plank for those ordered to be built here have 
been procured, and nothing will be done until they arrive from 
below. Intrenching tools are much wanted. We have very few. 
I have found it necessary to order Colonel Bedel, with two hun 
dred men, to the Cedars, a very important post, fifteen leagues 
above this, to prevent any goods being sent to the upper country, 
and to guard against a surprise from the enemy or their Indians. 
I have also sent a Captain and sixty men to Carringon. We 
have left at this garrison about five hundred men, about half 
of whom are waiting an opportunity to return home. We are 
waiting with the greatest anxiety to receive supplies of men and 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 511 

ammunition from below. Every thing is at a stand for want of 
those resources, and, if not obtained soon, our affairs in this country 
will be entirely ruined. I am, with great respect and esteem, 
dear General, 

Your obedient and humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



GENERAL ARNOLD TO GENERAL SCIIUYLER. 

Montreal, 30 April, 1776. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

I have the pleasure to acquaint you of the safe arrival of the 
gentlemen from Congress, in good health and spirits.* 

At a Council of War, held this morning, it was agreed to for 
tify, at Richelieu and Jacques Cartier, two important posts, the 
last eleven, and the former fifteen leagues above Quebec ; also 
to set on foot and build immediately four row-galleys or gondolas, 
at Chamblee, under my direction; and that Colonel Hazen have 
the overseeing of the workmen, procuring materials, &c., of which 
I make no doubt the Committee of Congress will advise you, as 
also our prospects and resources in this country, which are very 
slender. I hope no time will be lost in hurrying on provi 
sions, &c. 

On my arrival here I sent Colonel Hazen to command at St. 
John s, Chamblee, &c. I have this minute received a letter from 
Lieutenant-Colonel Buell, acquainting me of his being appointed 
to command at those places, and having orders to build a store 
house, for which there are no materials to be procured at present. 
I fancy you have not been apprised of the store-rooms at St. 
John s and Chamblee, which are capable of holding two thousand 
barrels of provisions, and want little repairing. 

We have engaged a number of French carpenters and bateau- 
men to be employed at Chamblee under the direction of Colonel 
Hazen, who is so well acquainted both with the Falls and inha 
bitants of the country, that a more useful man could not be em 
ployed at those posts. Perhaps you will think best that Colonel 
]&gt;uell should remain at this place, or go down to Richelieu, where 
I apprehend he will be of the greatest service ; his want of the 
French tongue is a great hinderance to business here. 

* Franklin, Chase, and Carroll, Commissioners from Congress, " to 
promote, or to form a union between the United Colonies and the peo- 



512 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [1776. 

I should be glad that the small hawsers and anchors at Ticon- 
deroga might be sent to St. John s for the gondolas; and if fifty 
or a hundred good seamen could be engaged out of the troops 
coming up, to man them, with proper officers to command them, 
it will forward the matter much. 

We have received no material advice from Quebec lately. Our 
last was the 24th ultimo, when our batteries were playing on 
the town. Expect soon to hear their effect. I am, very respect 
fully, dear General, 

Your obedient and humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



THE COMMISSIONERS IN CANADA TO GENERAL SCIIUYLER. 

Montreal, 10 May, 177G. 
DEAR SIR, 

Colonel Campbell arrived here early this morning from Que 
bec, lie informs that five ships of war arrived there last Mon 
day, the 5th, about sunrise, namely, two large ships, two frigates, 
and a tender. The enemy made a sally on Monday, between 
ten and eleven o clock, in a body, supposed not to be less than a 
thousand. Our forces were so dispersed, that not more than two 
hundred could be collected at head-quarters. 

In this situation a retreat was inevitable, and made in the ut 
most precipitation and confusion, with the loss of our cannon on 
the batteries, provisions, five hundred stand of small arms, and 
a bateau load of powder, going down with Colonel Allen. Colo 
nel Campbell believes the loss of men inconsiderable, except the 
sick in the respective hospitals, amounting in the whole to about 
two hundred, so ill as not to be removed, who have fallen into 
the enemy s hands. 

Our army are now on their way to the mouth of the Sorel, 
where they propose to make a stand. Colonel Greaton s battalion 
is arrived there ; and we expect the residue of the brigade under 
the command of General Thompson, is arrived before this at St. 
John s. From the present appearance of things it is very pro- 



pie of Canada," according to the instructions with which they were 
furnished. Journals of Congress, March 2Qt7t, 1776. They arrived in 
Montreal on the 29th of April. Franklin remained there but a few 
days. The other two continued till near the time when the American 
troops evacuated Canada. 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 513 

bable we shall be under the necessity of abandoning Canada, at 
least all except that part which lies on the Sorel. We may cer 
tainly keep possession of St. John s till the enemy can bring up 
against that post a superior force, and an artillery to besiege it. 

A further reinforcement will further increase our distress ; an 
immediate supply of provisions from over the Lakes is absolutely 
necessary for the preservation of the troops already in this Pro 
vince. As we shall be obliged to evacuate all this country, ex 
cept that part of it already mentioned, no provisions can be 
drawn from Canada ; the subsistence, therefore, of our army will 
entirely depend on the supplies it can receive, and that immedi 
ately, from Ticonderoga. 

We need not mention the propriety of immediately fitting out 
the vessels at the place to bring over our provisions, and the 
sending off bateaux, and constructing more, for drawing the troops 
out of Canada, should we be constrained, by superior force, to 
take that measure ; and in the interim to bring provisions. 

It is probable, a considerable part of the bateaux now on the 
St. Lawrence will be destroyed, or fall into the enemy s hands. 
We mention this circumstance to show the necessity of construct 
ing more. 

We can form no opinion of the force brought into Quebec by 
the enemy. Colonel Campbell mentions that information, received 
at our camp before Quebec, was, that fifteen sail of ships were 
in the river, though only five were come up, as before mentioned. 

We received your favor of the 2d instant, directed to B. F. 
We are, with great respect and regards, dear Sir, 

Your most obedient, humble servants, 
BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, 
SAMUEL CHASE, 
CHARLES CARROLL, of Carrollton. 



CHARLES CARROLL AND SAMUEL CHASE TO DR. FRANKLIN.* 

Montreal, 10 May, 1776. 
DEAR SIR, 

We are fully sensible of the great risk of taking post at De- 
chambeau. We have suggested, in writing, the difficulties and 



* Dr. Franklin had recently left Montreal and returned to Congress. 



514 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [1776. 

reasons which have occurred to us against that measure, to Ge 
neral Arnold. Our army s remaining at Dechambeau, will de 
pend in great measure on the strength of the enemy s land forces, 
and their activity and diligence in following up the blow they 
have already given our small and shattered army. Before this, 
no doubt, General Thomas has received some information of the 
enemy s numbers and of their motions. We arc inclined to think 
a retreat will be made, first to St. John s and then to the Isle- 
aux-Noix. 

Our letter to General Schuyler will give you all the information 
we have in our power to give, respecting the possibility of subsist- 
ting our army in Canada. We are of the opinion, that General 
Sullivan s brigade ought to be stopped at Fort George, till General 
Schuyler can send over with them a sufficient supply of pork, 
not only for the subsistence of that brigade, but of the rest of 
the army in Canada. Flour we are in hopes of procuring in 
sufficient quantities to support the army, at least for four months, 
provided we can keep possession of the country adjacent to the 
River Sorel, for the space of three weeks. 

"We sincerely wish the perfect ree stablishment of your health. 
Our stay at this place is uncertain. We shall be cautious to re 
treat in time to St. John s. We understand there is but a very 
small garrison there, and exceedingly negligent. No sentries 
posted in the night. This information we had from Mr. Price, 
who was an eye-witness of this negligence. Do speak about it. 
We are, with great esteem, dear Sir, 

Your affectionate, humble servants, 

CHARLES CARROLL, of Carrollton.

GENERAL ARNOLD TO THE COMMISSIONERS IN CANADA. 

Sorel, 15 May, 177G. 
GENTLEMEN, 

I Avrote you the 12th instant, by express, since which I have 
purchased twenty-seven hundred bushels of wheat of Captain 
Cuthbert, at four shillings and sixpence, lawful money, payable 
in our paper bills of exchange, or an order on Congress, which 
shall be most agreeable to you. It is now sending to the mills. 



- 



you 



I have also received two hundred barges of flour from below, 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 515 

and expect a quantity more every moment; also three tons flour, 
which I had engaged before I left Montreal. I make no doubt 
in a few days of collecting a magazine of flour sufficient for ten 
thousand men three months. A Commissary I sent out to pur 
chase provisions, returned yesterday with twenty oxen. I have 
put the people to half an allowance of meat, and added to their 
bread. I make no doubt of supporting the army until provisions 
can come over the Lakes. 

Mr. Bonfield, a gentleman of character, arrived here yesterday ; 
he left Sully on Thursday last, Dechambeau on Saturday morn 
ing, where General Thomas was, with only nine hundred men ; 
Colonel Maxwell was at Jacques Cartier, but the number of men 
with him Mr. Bonfield could not tell. Mr. Bonfield saw a num 
ber of the regular officers and inhabitants of Quebec before he 
left Sully, who acquainted him that on Monday, the 6th instant, 
arrived at Quebec one sloop of war with fourteen guns, one 
twenty and one fifty-gun ship, from England, with two companies 
of the twenty-seventh regiment, and one company of marines, 
which were immediately landed, who, with the garrison that came 
out the same afternoon, made a body of one thousand men, com 
manded by General Carleton, from whom our people made a 
most precipitate retreat, without ever firing a gun. On the 8th, 
arrived a frigate of thirty guns, and a large Indiaman, with five 
hundred men from Halifax, part of General Howe s army, the 
whole of which were on their passage for Quebec; and six thou 
sand Hessians, it is said, are on their way from England. If the 
latter is true, we shall doubtless have our hands full. Colonel 
A 1T en is come out in the ships from England, in irons (it is 
given out), to receive his trial for rebellion, and to be executed 
here.* 

I am sorry to inform you that all the carriages, except five, 
which came with the heavy cannon, were sent down, as they 
came over the Lakes, and fell into the enemy s hands. I have 
wrote to Colonel Hazen to put others in hand immediately, to 
replace them. We are making every possible disposition of de 
fence in our power, and I make no doubt of securing this post 
in a few days. None of the enemy s ships have been able to 
ascend the Richelieu as yet. I make no doubt Mr. Price will 
take effectual measures to supply with provisions the garrison 

* This was a mistake. Colonel Ethan Allen was sent home from 
England, and exchanged as a prisoner of war. 



516 OPEKATIONS IN CANADA. [1770. 

of Montreal, Cliamblee, St. John s, and the Cedars. Inclosed 
you have a letter to Mr. Evans, which fell into my hands, which 
contains a piece of intelligence worth noticing. 

I should be glad to know your sentiments in regard to inocu 
lation, as early as possible. Will it not be best, considering the 
impossibility of preventing the spreading of the smallpox, to ino 
culate live hundred or a thousand men immediately, and send 
them to Montreal, and as many more every five days, until the 
whole receive it, which will prevent our army being distressed 
hereafter; and I make no doubt we shall have more effective 
men, in four weeks, than by endeavouring to prevent the disorder 
spreading ; a period so near, that the enemy will not, with any 
considerable force, be able to reach this place by that time. 

A Quartermaster-General and Commissary are much wanted 
here. I have so much on hand, that I can hardly get one mi 
nute to write. You will be kind enough to excuse haste and 
incolierency, and believe me, with the greatest respect and es 
teem, Gentlemen, 

Your obedient, humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



GENERAL ARNOLD TO THE COMMISSIONERS. 

Sorel, 17 May, 177G. 
GENTLEMEN, 

I have the pleasure of your letter by General Thompson and 
Colonel St. Glair, who arrived safe here last evening. Herewith 
you have a letter from General Thomas, who is hourly expected 
here. It came by an express, who told me he had orders to de 
liver the letter to me, and wait my answer. I apprehended there 
might be some mistake in the superscription, and took the liberty 
of opening it, which you will excuse. 

I am. very happy to find you are in sentiments with me in 
respect to the smallpox. General Thompson and all the officers 
agree with us, and think it advisable to inoculate Colonel Pat 
terson s regiment at Montreal, Colonel Bedel s at the Cedars, and 
the troops posted at Laprairie and Longueil at those places. It 
is thought most advisable to send all the troops at Montreal 
here who have had the smallpox, and to send five or six hun 
dred men from this to Montreal, who will be at no expense of 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 517 

getting up, as they can row themselves. It will be very difficult 
to provide them quarters on the Sorel, except at such a distance 
as will render it extremely difficult to visit and supply them 
with provisions and other necessaries. This difficulty will be ob 
viated at Montreal, as they will be near together, and may be 
quartered on the inhabitants (if the barracks are not sufficient) ; 
and, among the whole, a sufficient number of men will be found 
well to keep the garrison. The distance of time you mention 
between inoculating them will doubtless be most prudent. As 
soon as General Thomas arrives, I expect a Council of War will 
be immediately held. I shall be for keeping Dechambeau by 
all means, if it can be done without too great a hazard of our 
army. Our own strength (which at present is uncertain), and 
the advice which we may receive of the numbers and designs of 
the enemy, must govern our movements. I believe the difficulty 
of provisions may be got over; but the smallpox, and gondolas 
to secure our navigation and retreat, are very great obstacles in 
our way. 

We have here about three tons of powder. There is a quan 
tity at Chamblee ; how much, I am uncertain. The distribution 
of the bateaux is already made, and twenty are sent from this 
to St. John s. Immediately on my arrival here, I sent to Maska. 
I have received from thence one hundred and seventy-six bags 
of flour, I believe the same you refer to. As soon as Mr. 
Bonfield arrives, I shall employ him to collect all the flour in 
this neighbourhood, who will, at the same time, call on Mr. Bel- 
feuil, and receive such goods as may answer our purpose. I 
have in contemplation the sinking a chevaux-de-frise at the is 
lands five miles below this, where the channel is very narrow ; but 
the water is so high we cannot fortify at present. Two other 
vessels will be ordered to Montreal the first fair wind. I beg 
my respectful compliments to the ladies, who, I hear, are return 
ed with you ; and am, with great affection and esteem, Gentle 
men, &c., 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



GENERAL ARNOLD TO THE COMMISSIONERS.

GENTLEMEN, 

One of our men this moment came in, who was taken at the 
VOL. i. 44 



518 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [177G. 

Cedars. He made his escape this morning, and says we have 
lost only ten privates killed; the rest are prisoners at St. Ann s 
and the Cedars. The enemy lost double that number. They 
were last night within three miles of us, with three hundred 
savages, fifty regulars, and two hundred and fifty Canadians, with 
our two pieces of cannon ; but, on hearing we had a large body 
of men here, they made a precipitate retreat. He left them 
above Point Clare. They have only twenty-one canoes, which 
will carry eight or nine men on an average. 

I intend to send off four hundred men in bateaux immediately, 
to proceed to the Isle Perot, and endeavour to cut off the ene 
my s retreat. I expect they will make some stay at Fort St. 
Ann s, by which it may possibly be effected. Pray, hurry on 
the men as fast as possible. I shall push them on from this im 
mediately. We have so much water-craft, that we can always 
keep up a communication between those on land and those on 
water, and be able to act in concert. I am, Gentlemen, &c., 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



SAMUEL CHASE AND CHARLES CARROLL TO GENERAL THOMAS. 

Montreal, 20 May, 177G. 
SIR, 

We are favored with yours of yesterday from Chamblee. We 
went to Sorel on purpose to learn the condition of our army, 
and to know the sentiments of the General Officers respecting the 
future operations of the campaign. We expected to have had 
the pleasure of meeting with you there. On our way to Sorel, 
we were informed of your being taken ill with the smallpox, and 
that you had left the camp. We hoped to have found you at 
Chamblee ; and to converse with you on the state of our affairs 
in this country, was the principal end of our journey thither. 
Unluckily, we passed you on the road. 

In the present situation of the army, w r e think it would be im 
practicable to occupy and fortify the posts of Dechambeau and 
Jacques Cartier. We are sorry to find so little discipline in the 
army, and that it is so badly provided in every respect. We 
have some time since written pressingly to Congress for hard 
money, without which we believe it impossible to relieve our 
wants. The most immediate and pressing necessity is the want 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 519 

of flour. We have advised General Wooster to issue an order 
to the Town Major to wait on the merchants or others having 
provisions or merchandise for sale, and request a delivery of 
what the soldiers are in immediate want of, and pledge the faith 
of the United Colonies for payment; and have given it as our 
opinion, that, on refusal, our necessity requires that force should 
be used to compel a delivery. We have advised the General to 
issue a similar order to Messrs. Price and McCarty. The Ge 
neral has complied with our advice in both instances, and yes 
terday evening despatched an express to St. John s, with a letter 
to those gentlemen. We wrote to them by the same opportunity 
our sentiments. Flour is not to be procured in any considerable 
quantity on this Island, unless immediate steps be taken to se 
cure large quantities of wheat, and have it ground up into flour 
with the utmost despatch. The army will be reduced to the 
greatest straits for want of bread. We most earnestly entreat 
you to turn your attention to this matter, and to use all the 
means which your prudence will suggest to procure flour for the 
troops. None is to be expected, at least for some time, from 
over the Lakes. Our soldiers will be soon reduced to the dread 
ful alternative of starving, or of plundering the inhabitants. The 
laUcr will surely happen, if our troops should not be supplied 
with bread in a regular way. Their other immediate wants may 
in some measure be relieved by compelling a delivery of some 
goods on the same terms with wheat and flour. This, however, 
we confess a violent remedy, which nothing can justify but the 
most urgent necessity, and therefore cannot be long pursued with 
out drawing on us the resentment of the inhabitants. In short, 
Sir, without a speedy supply of hard money, it appears to us 
next to impossible to remain in Canada, even if we had no ene 
my but the inhabitants to contend with. 

We have already mentioned the bad discipline of the army. 
It is no doubt, in a great measure, owing to the cause assigned 
in one of your letters, the short enlistments ; but there appear 
to us other causes. The officers are not sufficiently active ; nor 
do they seem actuated by those disinterested principles and gene 
rous sentiments which might be expected from men fighting in so 
just and glorious a cause. We would not be understood to cast 
a general reflection. There are many officers, we are satisfied, 
who act upon the noblest motives ; but it gives us pain to assert, 
on the best information, that there are several whose conduct 
has too plainly proved them unworthy of the character and trust 
conferred on them by their countrymen. 



520 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [177G. 

We have mentioned our sentiments with freedom. We shall 
always give our opinions with the same. We mean not to dic 
tate, but to advise with you and the general officers on the most 
effectual ways and means of extricating ourselves from our pre 
sent difficulties, and promoting the general service. As by this 
time the virulence of your disorder, we hope, is abated, we re 
commend a meeting of the General Officers at Chamblee, to con 
sult about and agree upon the future operations of the war in 
Canada. The inclosed copy of General Arnold s last letter will 
give you the best intelligence respecting the affair at the Cedars, 
and the actual state of the enemy, and our forces on this Island. 
Colonel Dehaas marched yesterday evening from this town, at 
six o clock, with four hundred men to La Chine. "We flatter 
ourselves we shall drive the enemy off the Island, redeem our 
prisoners, and recover our post at the Cedars. We are, with 
sincere wishes for your speedy recovery,

GENERAL ARNOLD TO THE COMMISSIONERS. 

St. Ann s, 27 May, 177G. 
GENTLEMEN, 

I wrote you from La Chine, yesterday morning, that the army 
marched at six o clock for this place. We arrived here with the 
main body at six o clock in the afternoon, when we discovered 
several of the enemy s, bateaux taking our unhappy prisoners off 
an island at one league distance from us. Words cannot express 
our anxiety, as it was not in our power to relieve them. Our 
bateaux were a league behind, coming up the rapids very slowly. 
I sent several expresses to hurry them. However, it was sunset 
before they arrived and I could embark all my people ; previous 
to which arrived some Caghnawaga Indians whom. I had sent 
early in the morning to the savages, demanding a surrender of 
our prisoners, and, in case of refusal, and that any of them were 
murdered, I would sacrifice every Indian who fell into my hands, 
and would follow them to their towns and destroy them by fire 
and sword. The answer I received was, that they had five hun- 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 521 

dred of our prisoners collected together, and that if we offered to 
land and attack them at Quinze Chiens, where they were posted, 
they would immediately kill every prisoner, and give no quarter 
to any who should fall into their hands hereafter. 

Words cannot express my feelings at the delivery of this mes 
sage. Torn by the conflicting passions of revenge and humanity, 
a sufficient force to take ample revenge, raging for action, urged 
me on one hand ; and humanity for five hundred unhappy wretches, 
who were on the point of being sacrificed if our vengeance was not 
delayed, plead equally strong on the other. In this situation, I 
ordered the boats to row immediately for the island, where our 
prisoners had been confined. We there found five unhappy 
wretches, naked, and almost starved; the rest, they informed me, 
were all taken off by the savages just before, except one or two, 
who, being unwell, were inhumanly butchered. I immediately 
ordered the boats to row for Quinze Chiens, about four miles 
from the island on the main land. There the enemy had two 
brass six-pounders, were intrenched round the church, and well 
fortified. They began firing upon us, when we approached within 
three quarters of a mile of the shore, with their cannon and 
small arms. We rowed near in shore without returning a shot. 
By this time it was so dark we could not distinguish a man on 
shore, and, as Ave were unacquainted with the ground, and our 
people much fatigued, I judged it most prudent to return to St. 
Ann s. 

On our arrival, I called a Council of War, who were unanimous 
for attacking the enemy early in the morning ; and, at two 
o clock in the morning, Lieutenant Parke was sent to me with a 
flag and articles for exchange of prisoners, entered into by Major 
Sherburne and Captain Forster. One article was, that there 
should be an exchange of prisoners of equal rank, and that our 
troops should be under an obligation not to take up arms again; 
but the King s troops were to be at full liberty. This article I 
rejected, and despatched Lieutenant Parke to acquaint Captain 
Forster that I would enter into articles for exchange of prisoners 
on equal terms, which, if he refused, my determination was to 
attack him immediately ; and, if our prisoners were murdered, to 
sacrifice every soul who .fell into our hands. Captain Forster 
agreed to these terms, and sent them back signed. As they 
were not so explicit as I judged necessary, with some alterations 
and explanations I returned them. Inclosed you receive a copy, 
as finally agreed to. This matter was finished at six o clock this 

44* 



522 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [1776. 

evening, and to-morrow morning part of the prisoners are to be 
sent to Caghnawaga. 

You may be surprised that six days were allowed for the deli 
very of the prisoners, and that hostilities should in the mean 
time cease. This does not include the savages. Captain Forster 
pretended it was not in his power to fix on any particular time 
for that purpose, but would engage, on his honor, to deliver them 
as soon as possible ; and proposed, if it could be done in less 
time, hostilities should then commence, of which Captain Forster 
is to determine and acquaint me this evening. The base, hypo 
critical conduct of the King s officers, their employing savages to 
screen them in their butcheries, their suffering their prisoners to 
be killed in cool blood, I will leave with you to comment on. I 
observed to Captain Forster, that it appeared very extraordinary 
to me, that he could influence the savages to deliver up the pri 
soners, and could not keep them from being murdered in cool 
blood, or prevent their being stripped naked, contrary to the 
agreement made with the garrison at the Cedars. 

I intend being with you this evening, to consult on some effect 
ual measures to take with these savages, and still more savage 
British troops, who are still at Quinze Chiens. As soon as our 
prisoners are released, I hope it will be in our power to take 
ample vengeance, or we nobly fall in the attempt. I am, &c., 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 

P. S. A party of fourteen or fifteen Canadians, taken at the 
Cedars, are excluded from the above treaty; Captain Forster 
alleging that he had positive orders from government for that 
purpose. 

ARTICLES FOR EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS. 

After the maturest deliberation on the customs and manners 
of the savages in war, which I find so opposite and contrary 
to the humane disposition of the British Government, and to 
all civilized nations, and to avoid the inevitable consequences of 
the savage customs in former wars (which by their threats and 
menaces I find is not changed), that of their putting their pri 
soners to death, to disencumber themselves in case of their being 
attacked by their enemy ; I have, therefore, in compliance with 
the above disposition in Government, and the dictates of human 
ity, thought fit to enter into the following articles of agreement 






APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 523 

with General Arnold, in the name of the power he is employed 
by, and of the officers and soldiers, who shall be released by 
this agreement, whose rank and numbers shall be indorsed on 
this cartel. 

1st. That there shall be an exchange of prisoners faithfully 
made, returning an equal number of his Majesty s troops of the 
same rank with those released by this agreement, as soon as 
possible, within the space of two months, allowing a moderate 
time for casualties that may render the performance of this ar 
ticle impracticable. 

2d. That the prisoners shall be conducted in safety, with all 
possible convenience and despatch that circumstances will permit 
to the south shore of the River St. Lawrence, from which they 
are to repair to St. John s, and return to their own countries 
immediately, without committing any waste or spoil on their 
march thither, allowing ten or twelve to go to Montreal to 
transact their private affairs. 

3d. That the prisoners so returned shall not, under any pre 
text whatsoever, either in words, writing, or signs, give the least 
information to Government enemies, or their adherents now in 
arms, in the least prejudicial to his Majesty s service. 

4th. That hostages be delivered for the performance of these 
articles to the full, according to the sense and spirit of the agree 
ment, without any equivocation whatsoever. 

5th. That the security of the subscribers be given to the in 
habitants for all the waste and spoil committed by the detach 
ments under Colonel Bedel, on fair accounts, attested and signed, 
being delivered, and for which the hostages are not to be an 
swerable. 

It being our full intention to fulfil the above articles, we 
mutually sign and interchange them as assurances of performance. 

Given under our hands this 27th day of May, 177G. 

VAUDREUIL. 
GEORGE FORSTER, 
Captain Commanding the King s troops. 

Article 2d. The prisoners shall be sent to the south shore 
of St. Lawrence within one league of Caghnawaga, and from 
thence to St. John s and their own country, except twelve, who 
have liberty to go to Montreal, for which purpose six days shall 
be allowed, and hostilities to cease on both sides. 

Article 4^. Four Captains shall be sent to Quebec as hos 
tages, and remain there until prisoners are exchanged. 



524 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [1776. 

Article 5th. The Continental troops, from principle, have ever 
avoided plundering. Upon proof being made of any waste com 
mitted by Colonel Bedel s detachment, reparation shall be made. 
Given under our hands this 27th of May, 177G, at St. Ann s. 

BENEDICT ARNOLD, 
Brigadier-General of the Continental troops. 

GEORGE FORSTER, 
Captain Commanding the Itfng s troops. 

Two Majors, nine Captains, twenty subalterns, four hundred 
and forty-three soldiers. But if the prisoners can be conducted 
in less time, this truce to cease on the return of the last boats 
employed on this service, on notice given. 

GEORGE FORSTER, 
Captain Commanding the Kiiujs troops. 

May 27th, 1770. Answer. If Captain Forster will choose to 
have hostilities commence in less time than six days, it will be 
perfectly agreeable to me, provided the time is fixed on, and 
notice given this evening. 

BENEDICT ARNOLD, 

Brigadier- General. 






GENERAL ARNOLD TO GENERAL SULLIVAN. 

Montreal, 5 June, 1776. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

I have complied with your orders, as for as in my power, 
respecting the destination of the troops. I intended setting off 
this day for Sorel, but have been much hindered by taking the 
goods in town. Fvery possible obstacle has been thrown in 
my way. However, I shall secure many articles much wanted 
by the army. Yesterday, Colonel Dehaas, with his detachment, 
set off for Sorel. Last night and this morning I have received 
intelligence of four or five hundred savages and Canadians be 
ing on the Island, with the intention of attacking our post at 
La Chine ; and, as the garrison is so weak we can spare few 
men from it, I have thought proper to order Colonel Dehaas 
to return. I think it absolutely necessary some effectual me 
thods should be taken with the savages immediately, or we 
shall be obliged to keep up a large force here. I shall be con- 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 525 

tinually harassed with them. This affair will prevent my join 
ing you at Sorel as soon as I could w r ish. It will not be in 
my power to take an account of the goods, and send them off, 
these three days. 

I believe the enemy below will not advance very suddenly. 
I make no doubt you will have time to prepare for them, and 
that we shall be reenforced in time to secure this part of the 
country. I have ordered Colonel Bedel, his Major, and Cap 
tain Young, to Sorel for their trial. 

An express arrived here from Three Rivers yesterday. I 
must refer you to General Thompson for the advice he brought. 
We have only two pieces of cannon here, and no matrosses. 

With great esteem and affection, I am, dear General, 
Your obedient, humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



GENERAL SULLIVAN S INSTRUCTIONS FOR GENERAL THOMPSON.* 

Sorel, 6 June, 1776. 
DEAR SIR, 

You are to march as soon as possible with Colonel Irvine s 
and Colonel Wayne s regiments, together with those of Colonel 
St. Clair now remaining at this place, . and join Colonel St. 
Clair at Kicolet, and take command of the whole party; and 
unless you find the number of the enemy at Three Rivers to 
be such as would render an attack upon them hazardous, you 
are to cross the river, at the most convenient place you can, 
and attack them. You will pay particular attention to the pre 
servation of your bateaux, keeping them at a convenient distance 
above the shipping, which lies at or near the Three Rivers. 
I would by no means advise to an attack, if the prospect of 
success is not much in your favor, as a defeat of your party 
at this time might prove the total loss of this country. 

Sir, as I have (without flattery) the highest opinion of the 
bravery and good conduct of yourself and the officers you com 
mand, I forbear attempting particular instructions, being well 
assured, that neither prudence nor resolution will be wanting to 
answer the great purpose we have in view. I have the high 
est opinion of the bravery and resolution of the troops you 

* General Thomas had died of the smallpox, at Sorel. General Sul 
livan took command there on the 4th of June. 



526 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [1770. 

command, and doubt not but, under the direction of a kind Pro 
vidence, you will open the way for our recovering that ground, 
which former troops have so shamefully lost. Wishing you the 
greatest success and safety, I am, dear Sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

JOHN SULLIVAN. 



GENERAL ARNOLD TO GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Montreal, G Juno, 17 70. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

I this moment received a letter from General Sullivan at 
Sorel, dated at 4 o clock yesterday evening, informing me that 
a body of the King s troops and a number of ships were be 
tween him and Three Rivers, and that he soon expected to be 
attacked. I have sent every man that could be spared to his 
assistance, but am fearful he will be obliged to abandon his 
post. If the enemy land on that side, I am fearful they will 
endeavour to possess themselves of Chamblee and St. John s. 
If they come upon this side (on which they are at present), 
we must evacuate this town. Some days since the sick and 
baggage have been removed to St. John s. I am now remov 
ing a parcel of goods I have seized for the use of the army. 
I expect to have all over this evening. I shall retain only 
four or five hundred men to garrison the place, until I receive 
orders to leave it, or am obliged to quit it by superior force. 
Out of upwards of eight thousand men in this country, not five 
thousand effectives can be mustered. The smallpox has broke 
and divided the army in such a manner that it is almost 
ruined. 

Our want of almost every necessary for the army, and re 
peated misfortunes and losses, have greatly dispirited the troops. 
Our enemies are daily increasing, and our friends deserting us. 
Under these discouragements and obstacles, with a powerful army 
against us, well disciplined, and wanting in no one article to 
carry on their operations, it will be a miracle, if we keep the 
country. My only expectation is to secure our retreat to St. 
John s or the Isle-aux-Noix, where it will doubtless be thought 
necessary to make a stand ; for which purpose all the bateaux 
and vessels on your side the Lake, that can be spared, should 
be sent over. Our gondolas we shall be obliged to destroy. 
Others ought immediately to be taken in hand to secure the 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 527 

Lake. The enemy, I am well informed, have brought a num 
ber with them, framed and done to put up in a short time. 
The want of a little attention in time has lost us this fine 
country. I hope for better things on your side, and that, in 
the rotation of fortune, something better will turn up for us 
here. In every vicissitude of fortune, I am, with great esteem 
and affection, dear General, 

Your obedient, humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



GENERAL ARNOLD TO GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Montreal, 10 June, 1776. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

I received your letter of the 28th ultimo to the Honorable 
Commissioners, respecting the Oneidas, the 6th instant. There 
was a meeting of those Indians and several other tribes at 
Caghnawaga, some of whom agreed to deliver up the hatchet 
received from Governor Carleton last year, and remain neuter 
in the present dispute. On the 7th they came to Montreal, 
when, after the usual speeches and ceremonies, the St. Fran 
cis, Caghnawagas, and Conosadagas gave up the hatchet. The 
Oswagatchas pretended they had no authority for doing it; to 
whom I observed we were ready to receive them as friends, 
but if they preferred war to peace, we were ready to meet 
them as enemies ; that we had it in our power to destroy them 
whenever we pleased, which they would soon be convinced of, 
if they did not lay down the hatchet. The Oneidas received 
the presents you desired, except the blankets and clouts, which 
could not be procured in town, having all been sent to Cham- 
blee. I gave them an order on the Quarter-master there, but 
find, since, that they went directly to St. John s, and did not 
receive them. 

General Thompson left the Sorel three days since, with two 
thousand men, for Three Rivers, where are about three or four 
hundred of the enemy intrenching. One frigate, a brig, and 
eight sloops and schooners are above Richelieu. I expect every 
moment to hear of an action between General Thompson and 
the enemy. A number of Indians and some regular troops are 
about this place, waiting, as is said, for a reinforcement from 
above, and for Governor Carleton to advance, when I expect 
we shall have an opportunity of seeing them here. 



528 OPERATIONS IX CANADA. [1770. 

I have received your instructions respecting the Tories and 
their effects. Most of the former had absconded. Great part 
of the latter is secured. I have sent to St. John s a quantity 
of goods for the use of the army, some bought and some seized. 
I am in hopes of fixing on some method, in a day or two. 
of having them made up, as they are much wanted. I am, 
very respectfully, dear General, 

Your obedient, humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



GENERAL ARNOLD TO GENERAL SL LLIVAN. 

Chamblcc, 10 [11?] June, 177G. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

I went to St. John s yesterday, where I found every thing in 
the greatest confusion ; not one stroke done to fortify the camp ; 
the engineer a perfect sot ; at that place and this-, near three 
thousand sick. I have given orders that the sick draw only half 
rations in future. I have ordered Colonel Antill to St. John s, 
and an abatis and lines to be immediately begun, to inclose the 
two old forts, and an encampment sufficient to hold six thousand 
men. 

I am fully of opinion not one minute ought to be lost in secur 
ing our retreat, and saving our heavy cannon, baggage, and pro 
visions. The enemy will never attack you at Sorel. Their force 
is doubtless much superior to ours, and we have no advice of 
any reinforcements. Shall we sacrifice the few men we have, 
by endeavouring to keep possession of a small part of the country, 
which can be of little or no service to us ? The junction of the 
Canadians with the Colonies, an object which brought us into 
this country, is now at an end. Let us quit them, and secure 
our own country, before it is too late. There will be more honor 
in making a safe retreat, than hazarding a battle against such 
superiority, which will doubtless be attended with the loss of men, 
artillery, &c., and the only pass to our country. These argu 
ments are not urged by fear for my personal safety. I am con 
tent to be the last man who quits this country, and fall, so that 
my country rise. But let us not fall all together. 

The goods I seized at Montreal and sent to Chamblee, under 
the care of Major Scott, have been broken open, plundered, and 
huddled together in the greatest confusion. They were taken in 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 529 

such a hurry it was impossible to take a particular account of 
them. Each man s name was marked on his packages. When 
Major Scott arrived at Chamblee, he received your positive orders 
to repair to Sorel. The guard was ordered to return, and the 
goods to be delivered to Colonel Hazen, to be stored. He refused 
receiving or taking any care of them, by which means, and Major 
Scott s being ordered away, the goods have been opened and 
plundered, I believe, to a large amount. It is impossible for 
me to distinguish each man s goods, or ever settle with the 
proprietors. The goods are delivered to Mr. McCarty. This is 
not the first or last order Colonel Hazen has disobeyed. I think 
him a man of too much consequence for the post he is in. I 
am giving him orders to send directly to St. John s all the heavy 
cannon, shot, powder, bateaux, valuable stores, and the sick. I 
go to Montreal immediately, and beg to have your orders as soon 
as possible for my future conduct. I am, with respect and es 
teem, dear General, 

Your obedient, humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 

P. S. If you should think proper to retire to St. John s, will 
it not be best to order a number of carts to be ready here from 
the neighbouring parishes, and enforce your order by sending a 
number of armed men to secure them ? 



GENERAL ARNOLD TO GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

St. John s, 13 June, 1776. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

I wrote you a few days since, from Montreal, that I had seized 
a parcel of goods for the use of the army, by particular orders 
from the Commissioners of Congress. Our hurry and confusion 
was so great when the goods were received, it was impossible 
to take a particular account of them. Every man s name was 
marked on his particular packages, with intention of taking a 
particular account of them at Chamblee, or St. John s, where the 
goods were ordered to be stored. Major Scott was sent with them, 
with orders to have them stored under the care of Colonel Ilazen, 
who commanded at Chamblee. On his arrival there, he received 
orders from General Sullivan to repair to Sorel. Colonel Ilazen 
VOL. i. 45 



530 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [177G. 

refused taking the goods into store, or taking any charge of them. 
They were heaped in piles on the bank of the river. Colonel 
Hazen finally received them, and placed sentinels over them. 
They were, however, neglected in such a manner, that great 
part were stolen or plundered. On receiving this intelligence, I 
repaired to Chamblee ; the goods were sent to St. John s by 
Colonel Hazen, in different parcels, all under the care of a French 
Corporal, and through them, I found the goods broken open, 
plundered, and all mixed together in the greatest confusion, and 
great part missing. Mr. McCarty has General Sullivan s orders, 
and is now receiving the goods. I have sent over to Ticonde- 
roga a quantity of nails and goods, the property of Thomas 
Walker, Esq., and ordered them to be stored there, and delivered 
to his order. 

We have a report here, that on Sunday last our army, of 
about two thousand men, under the command of General Thomp 
son, attacked the enemy near Three Ivivers, and were repulsed, 
with the loss of twenty men and some bateaux. We have re 
ceived no particular accounts of this matter, though several days 
have elapsed since the affair happened. 

Near one half of our army are sick, mostly with the smallpox. 
If the enemy have a force of six or eight, and some say ten 
thousand men, we shall not be able to oppose them, sick, divi 
ded, ragged, undisciplined, and unofficered, as we are. If we 
are not soon reenforced, I tremble for the event. A loss of our 
heavy cannon, which is all ordered to Sorel, must ensue, if not 
of our army, as our retreat is far from being secured. Not one 
stroke has been struck to secure our encampment here. I have 
ordered men out to-morrow morning to inclose our encampment 
and the two old forts with an abatis and breastwork. 

Dr. Stringer is in a disagreeable situation. Three thousand 
men are sick here and at Chamblee, and no room or conveniency 
for them. I should advise his going to the Isle-aux-Noix, was 
there any conveniency for the sick, or boards to make any. I 
have wrote General Sullivan on the occasion. I have ordered the 
frames of the vessels here taken in pieces, and sent to Crown 
Point. The timbers are all numbered, and easily put together 
again. 

If any more men are ordered for this country, let me entreat 
you to hurry them on, and all the water-craft. I am, dear 
General, 

Your affectionate, obedient, humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD.

GENERAL ARNOLD TO GENERAL SCIIUYLER. 

Chamblce, 13 June, 1776, 10 o clock, P. M. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

Since writing the foregoing, I arrived here, and met Dr. Cen 
ter, who left Sorel at 12 o clock this day. He informs me that 
General Thompson, Colonel Irvine, Drs. McKenny and Me Caw- 
ley, Lieutenants Bird and Curry are prisoners, and about forty 
men missing. General Thompson has wrote for his baggage, 
which has been sent to him. Burgoyne is with the enemy. Sev 
enty transports, and, by the best accounts, ten thousand troops, 
are arrived in Quebec. The whole force we can muster does not 
exceed four thousand effectives, when they are all collected. I 
have wrote General Sullivan my opinion very freely, which is, 
to collect our whole force at St. John s immediately, and secure 
our retreat. I am told his intention is to remain at Sorel, until 
attacked by the enemy. I believe there will be little danger of 
it. I make no doubt the enemy will pass Sorel, and, as soon as 
in possession of Montreal, march immediately for St. John s, and 
endeavour to cut off our retreat. In which case, if we save our 
army, the cannon and heavy baggage must fall into the hands 
of the enemy. 

All the craft on your side the Lake, in my opinion, ought im 
mediately to be sent to St. John s, and a number of gondolas 
built as soon as possible to guard the Lake. You may expect 
soon to hear of our evacuating Canada, or being prisoners. I go 
to Montreal in the morning, where I shall remain until I have 
orders to quit it, or am attacked, when it will be too late. I 
am, respectfully, dear General, 

Yours, &c., 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



GENERAL SULLIVAN TO GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Isle-aux-Noix, 19 June, 1776. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

By a strange reverse of fortune we are driven to the sad 
necessity of abandoning Canada. I had the most sanguine hopes 
of collecting our army together, and driving the enemy below 
Dechambeau, in which I doubt not I should have succeeded, 
had not Burgoyne, with a strong party, arrived in Canada, and 



532 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 

readied the Three Rivers the night before our people made 
the unfortunate attack upon that place under General Thomp 
son. The particulars of this engagement I have not before had 
in my power to give you. I find our loss to amount to about 
a hundred and fifty. Colonel Wayne sustained the greatest, as 
his men began the attack, and behaved with great bravery, as 
did the Colonel himself. In short, all the officers behaved with 
great spirit, except some few of low rank ; and had not the 
number of the enemy been so superior, I doubt not the point 
Avould have been carried, in which case I should have pushed 
for Dechambeau, which, if secured, would have given us the 
command of the country. But this defeat convinced us that we 
came too late for the important purpose. 

I was determined, however, to hold Sorcl, as it seemed the 
pleasure of Congress. But, after taking unwearied pains to for 
tify that post, and to collect the main body of the army to 
defend it, I found but twenty-five hundred at that place, and 
about a thousand more at the other garrisons, most of the lat 
ter being under inoculation, and those regiments, which had not 
the smallpox, expecting every day to be taken down with it. 
At the same time the British Heel, to the amount of thirty- 
six sail, had advanced into the Lake near us, and sixty-six lay 
at Three Elvers. The encampment of the enemy was, to ap 
pearance, very large, and every account proved their number to 
be exceedingly superior to ours. The Canadians, too, as far as 
the enemy advanced, were obliged to take arms or be destroyed. 
In this state of affairs I was much embarrassed, yet was de 
termined to hold my ground at all hazards. 

But, to my great mortification, I found myself at the head 
of a dispirited army, iilled with horror at the thought of see 
ing their enemy. Indeed, I was much surprised to see the 
scattered remains of this army, when I had them collected to 
gether. The smallpox, famine, and disorder, had rendered them 
almost lifeless. The flight from before Quebec, the fate of those 
at the Cedars, and the total loss of Sherburne s party, had, be 
fore my arrival with my brigade, destroyed all spirit among 
these troops ; but, upon our arrival, their spirit seemed to re 
turn. But, when they found this party defeated, and the num 
ber of the enemy increasing, I found a great panic again tak 
ing place among both officers and soldiers. I had no less, I 
believe, than forty officers, who begged leave to resign their 
commissions upon the most trivial pretences, and this even ex 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 533 

tended to Field-Officer?. The prevailing opinion was, that the 
enemy, instead of attacking our works, would get round us, and 
cut off our communication with the upper country, and destroy 
our retreat. This, indeed, they had completely in their power, 
as we had not force to dislodge them. I soon found, that how 
ever strongly I might fortify Sorel, my men would in general 
leave me upon appearance of the enemy. 

In this state of affairs I called a Council of all the Field- 
Officers, with the Baron de Woedtke, and they were almost 
unanimously for quitting the ground. General Arnold was not 
present, but his opinion you have, as well as that of Colonel 
Hazen and Colonel Antill, in the inclosed letters. I then im 
mediately decamped, taking with us every article, teven to a 
spade. The enemy, having a fair wind, was at our works in an 
hour after we left them. Our guards at Bertier, not coming in 
at the time they were ordered, were met by the enemy, forced 
to leave nine bateaux, and take to Chamblee by land. This 
was all the loss we sustained. We retreated as far as Cham 
blee. This post not being tenable, we removed our bateaux 
over the rapids, with all the baggage and stores, except three 
pieces of cannon, which were too heavy to bring over the ra 
pids, and indeed they were but bad pieces of ordnance at best. 
I then proceeded to St. John s, where every thing arrived in 
safety. We burnt the garrison at Chamblee, with the gondolas 
and vessels there, leaving nothing but ruin behind us in the 
fort. We pulled up all the bridges in our way to St. John s. 
General Arnold did the same in the other road from Montreal, 
from which place he made a very prudent and judicious retreat, 
with an enemy close at his heels. 

When we got to St. John s, another Council was held, where 
it was unanimously agreed, that to attempt holding St. John s 
would be to expose the whole army to inevitable ruin, as our 
communication might be easily cut off, and the whole army fall 
a sacrifice. Previous to this, I received the resolves of Congress 
for six thousand militia, which I laid before the Council. They 
were all of opinion, that this would rather weaken than strength 
en our army, and further, that they could not possibly arrive in 
season to save us from a powerful army close at our heels. 
They were fully of opinion that, in the present unhealthy state 
of the army, it would be best to move to Crown Point, fortify 
that post, and build armed vessels to secure the navigation of the 
Lake. Upon this we immediately stripped the garrison of every 

45* 



534 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [177G. 

article, took our bateaux, and retreated to this island. Further 
than this I could not go, without your or General Washington s 
orders, or the directions of Congress. I therefore send on the 
sick, the looks and numbers of which will present you with the 
most dismal spectacle ever furnished from one army in this quar 
ter of the globe. I have sent on General Arnold to give direc 
tions at Crown Point, and receive your orders. The men, who 
are fit for duty, I shall retain here, ready to execute any orders 
you will please to communicate. 

Thus, dear General, I have given you an imperfect account 
of my unfortunate campaign. Claiming no merit, except in mak 
ing a safe and regular retreat, and although driven to it by in 
evitable necessity (as the Grand Post was lost before my arri 
val, and put beyond my power to regain), and although it was 
before an army much more powerful than mine, yet I am suffi 
ciently mortified, and sincerely wish I had never seen this fatal 
country, unless I had arrived in season to have done some good 
to my country, and answered the expectations of Congress. Dear 
General, believe me to be, with the greatest respect, 

Your most obedient servant, 

JOHN SULLIVAN. 



GENERAL ARNOLD TO GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Ticonderoga, 30 July, 1776. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

Your favor of the 20th instant I received last night. I am 
sorry to hear your treaty with the Indians is so long retarded. 
You must have an infinite deal of trouble with them, which I am 
fearful will prejudice your health ; and your presence is much 
wanted both at Skenesborough and this place. I wrote you from 
the former place on the 25th instant, at which time only two 
companies of carpenters were arrived, one from Philadelphia, and 
the other from Connecticut ; since which the whole have arrived, 
(o the number of two hundred. I left them such directions as I 
thought necessary, and orders to begin four row-galleys, nearly of 
the construction of those built in Philadelphia, to carry four 
pieces heavy and two pieces light cannon each. The two largest 
schooners are at Crown Point, the sloop goes this morning, and 
four gondolas will follow in two or three days. I intend to visit 
Skenesborough on Monday next. I shall be happy to accelerate 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 

the business all in my power, and to take as much trouble from 
off your hands as possible, as I am sensible you have more than 
your share of it. 

A Frenchman, arrived here in fifteen days from St. Francois, 
confirms the intelligence respecting the Indians, and adds that all 
the tribes in Canada were determined on a neutrality; that the 
troops were busy in building bateaux and several large vessels 
at St. John s. General Carleton has given the French inhabitants 
notice of his intention of crossing Lake Champlain the last of 
August, or beginning of September, and that he should depend 
on their joining him. If we are supplied with the articles I 
wrote for, we shall soon be in a condition to give him a proper 
reception. 

Inclosed is a return of the ordnance stores, shot, &c., &c., 
by which you will observe there are many articles wanting to 
complete the same, as also there is a great deficiency of shot 
in particular, grape, double-headed, chain, and round, which will 
be very serviceable among vessels and bateaux. More heavy 
cannon will be wanted for the row-galleys. The four now build 
ing w r ill carry eight tw T enty-fours, and eight eighteens. Four 
others will be set up soon, and will require an equal number 
of guns. To supply the row-galleys and lines, we have only 
eleven pieces, and ten twelve-pounders, wdiich may answer, 
though not so well as heavier guns. If they are substituted, 
eleven pieces will still be wanting, with shot, &c., which I w r ish 
may be sent up, if they can possibly be procured. With the 
approbation of General Gates I sent to Connecticut for three 
hundred seamen. The express had orders to call on you (if 
returned), and take your instructions in the matter. As it was 
uncertain, if you were returned, I wrote to Captain Varick de 
siring him to give the express a warrant on the Paymaster- 
General for one thousand pounds, to pay the bounty of the 
seamen, as the treasury was empty. lie has proceeded on to 
General Washington. We are informed, that of the four regi 
ments coming from Boston, there is a very considerable num 
ber of seamen, who are daily expected. I am, &c. 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



GENERAL GATES s INSTRUCTIONS TO GENERAL ARNOLD. 

Upon your arrival at Crown Point, you will proceed with the 



536 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [1776. 

fleet of the United States under your command, down Lake 
Champlain, to the narrow pass of the Lake made by the Split 
Rock, or to the other narrow approach down the Lake, made 
by Isle-aux-Tetes and the opposite shore. You will station the 
fleet in the best manner to maintain the possession of those 
passes, according as your judgment shall determine, cautiously 
avoiding to place the vessels in a manner, which might unne 
cessarily expose them to the enemy s heavy artillery from the 
shore. You will most religiously observe, that it is my positive 
order that you do not command the fleet to sail below the pass 
of the Isle-aux-Tetes, above mentioned, incessantly reflecting, 
that the preventing the enemy s invasion of our country is the 
ultimate end of the important command with which you are 
now intrusted. It is a defensive war we are carrying on ; 
therefore no wanton risk or unnecessary display of the power 
of the fleet is at any time to influence your conduct. 

Should the enemy come up the Lake, and attempt to force 
their way through the pass you are stationed to defend, in that 
case you will act with such cool, determined valor, as will 
give them reason to repent their temerity. But if, contrary to 
my hope and expectation, their fleet should have so increased 
as to force an entrance into the upper part of the Lake, then, 
after you shall have discovered the insufficiency of every effort 
to retard their progress, you will, in the best manner you can, 
retire with your squadron to Ticonderoga. Every vessel in the 
fleet being furnished with a bateau, you will have it in your 
power to keep out scout-boats at night, and occasionally to an 
noy the enemy s small craft. In the daytime your boats can 
act, when opportunity offers, under cover of the cannon of your 
fleet. 

As the most Honorable the Congress of the United States 
rest a great dependence on your wise and prudent conduct in 
the management of this fleet, you will on no account detach 
yourself from it, upon the lesser services above mentioned. A 
resolute but judicious defence of the northern entrance into this 
side of the Continent, is the momentous part which is commit 
ted to your courage and abilities. I doubt not you will secure 
it from further invasion. 

As I am entirely unacquainted with marine affairs, I shall 
not presume to give any directions respecting the duty and dis 
cipline of the seamen and marines on board the fleet. 

I have traced the great outline of that service which your 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 537 

country expects from the rank and character you have acquired. 
I have, as is my duty, fixed the limits beyond which you are 
not to go. But you must communicate that restriction to no 
body. I wish, on the contrary, that words, occasionally dropped 
from you with that prudence which excludes every sort of af 
fectation, and which I believe you possess, may, together with 
all your motions, induce our own people to conclude it is our 
real intention to invade the enemy, which, after all, may hap 
pen. It will keep up their spirits, without affecting your repu 
tation, whatever may be the event. 

It only remains for me to recommend you to the protection 
of that Power, upon whose mercy we place our hopes of free 
dom here, and of happiness hereafter. You will frequently re 
port the state and situation of your fleet, and of every inter 
esting occurrence. 

Given at Ticonderoga, this 7th day of August, 177G. 

HORATIO GATES, Major- General. 



GENERAL ARNOLD TO GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Skenesborough, 8 August, 1776. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

Your favor of the olst ultimo was delivered to me on the 4th 
instant. I feel very sensibly for you in your disagreeable situa 
tion. I wish the fatigue and anxiety you undergo may not im 
pair your health ; and that you may succeed in your expectation 
with the savages, and soon give us the pleasure of seeing you 
here. 

Captain Varick has been very active and industrious in procur 
ing the articles for the navy. Many are arrived at Ticonderoga, 
and proper steps taken to procure the others. The carpenters 
go on with great spirit. Eight gondolas will be completed in a 
few days. One row-galley is gone to Ticonderoga, and will soon 
be fitted and armed. Three others will be launched in ten days 
or a fortnight. Four others will be set up in a few days, great 
part of the timber being cut. Iron, sails, cordage, and anchors 
will be wanted in a few days. About two tons of the former is 
here, and six tons will be wanted to complete the galleys in 
hand ; twelve or fifteen tons will be necessary for the galleys to 
be set up. It will expedite the building if six or eight tons can 



538 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [1776. 

be sent up in spikes from five to seven inches long, chiefly about 
six inches. 

General Gates transmitted to you, last week, the testimony of 
two French Captains, lately from Canada, which is contradicted 
by a Lieutenant B. Whitcomb, who was lately sent from Crown 
Point to St. John s, which place he left the 31st ultimo. He 
went down on the east side as far as Chamblee, and returned on 
the west. Says he observed about forty bateaux at St. John s, 
and some others building, but no large vessels ; believes there 
were about two thousand men there, and one thousand between 
St. John s and Chamblee. 

This afternoon I returned to Ticonderoga, and in a few days 
propose to go down the Lake with the vessels completed, about 
ten sail. 

The militia come in very slowly ; not more than fifteen hun 
dred have arrived. Our work at Ticonderoga goes on briskly. 
The line will be completed in ten days or a fortnight. 

I am, with every sentiment of friendship and esteem, dear Ge 
neral, your obedient, humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



GENERAL ARNOLD TO GENERAL GATES. 

Button-Mould Bay, 31 August, 1776. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

The 24th instant, I left Crown Point; the 25th, at night, 
anchored at "Willsborough. The same night came on a violent 
storm at northeast; the next day, at two, P. M., was obliged to 
weigh anchor and return to this place, where the whole fleet 
arrived the same evening, except the Spitfire, Captain Ulmer, 
who could not clear the shore, and was obliged to come to an 
anchor again, and rode out the storm, though exposed to the 
rake of Cumberland Bay, fifty miles long. The hard gale made 
an amazing sea; and, when I expected to hear the gondola was 
foundered, or drove on shore, she joined us, having received no 
damage, though a light bateau, veered astern of her, was sunk 
with the sea breaking over her. The severe weather prevented 
my despatching Lieutenant Whitcomb before yesterday morning. 
The first fair wind, I will follow him. I should have gone this 
evening, but the breeze is so light, night would have come on 
before we could have reached a safe place of anchorage. 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 539 

I have had no advice from St. John s or Isle-aux-Noix. The 
earliest intelligence I receive shall be communicated to you im 
mediately. I am very anxious to hear from New York, and 
make no doubt when you receive any material advices, I shall 
soon be acquainted with them. 

Inclosed is a return of the strength of the fleet, by which you 
will observe that seventy-four men are wanting to complete the 
numbers proposed for the vessels, which are barely sufficient 
when complete. I should be extremely glad they were sent to 
us soon. If you think proper to send them, the bearer, Lieuten 
ant Calderwood, will take charge of them. 

Mr. Gilliland has the only good draught I know of Lake 
Champlairi, which, he says, was delivered to Captain Bush for 
you. It will be of great service to me, as I have no draught of 
the Lake. 

If a good officer can be procured to act as Captain of the 
Royal Savage, I think lie might be of service in case any acci 
dent should happen to me. The present Master is not fit for the 
command in chief, though a good man in his present station. 

I suppose by this time General Schuyler has paid you a visit. 
Please to make my respectful compliments to him, if arrived, 
and let him know I will write him very particularly as soon as 
I arrive at the other end of the Lake. 

I am, with real affection and esteem, dear General, your obe 
dient, humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



Willsborough, 2 September, 1776. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

I intended sending the foregoing from Button-Mould Bay, but 
waited for a boat that I had sent to this place for a barrel of 
fresh salmon, which I had designed for you. The late freshets 
have broke the dam, so that none can be caught till it is mend 
ed. Mr. Gilliland sent you a few salted ones, very indifferent, 
which we have eaten, expecting to send you some fresh ones. 

Yesterday, at noon, we left Button-Mould Bay, and arrived 
here last night. Before we passed the Split Rock, we saw two 
sail astern, which we supposed were the Lee and a gondola. 
They have not yet joined us. We are now under way, with a 
fresh southerly breeze, and expect to be at the Isle-aux-Tetes 
before night. I hope soon to have it in my power to send you 



540 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [177G. 

a, verv full account of the strength of the enemy by sea and 
land. I hope no time will be lost in forwarding the three gal 
leys. When they have joined us, I am very confident the ene 
my will not dare attempt crossing the Lake. 

I beg my congratulatory compliments to General St. Clair on 
his promotion. When the enemy drive us back to Ticonderoga, 
I have some thoughts of going to Congress, and begging leave to 
resign. Do you think they will make me a Major-General? 

Enire nous, I have received a letter from Samuel Chase, Esq., 
in which he mentions your letter to John Adams, Esq., and de 
sires an explanation. I will send it to you when I have time to 
answer it. 

I am, with every friendly wish, very respectfully, dear Gene 
ral, your obedient, humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



GENERAL ARNOLD TO GENERAL GATES. 

Windmill Point, 7 September. 177G. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

I wrote you the 2d instant, from Willsborough, by Lieutenant 
Calderwood. The same evening, anchored at Schuyler s Island; 
and, on the 3d instant, arrived safe at this place, which is four 
or five miles from the Isle-aux-Tetes, and seven miles from the 
Isle-la-Motte. We found the Isle-aux-Tetes occupied by the ene 
my, and several hundred men encamped between that and us, 
who, the evening of our arrival, made a precipitate retreat. I 
have posted my guard-beats at a point running into the Lake, 
about one mile below us. The enemy s boats have several times 
appeared on the Lake, with a view of decoying our boats ; but I 
have never suffered them to be pursued. Lieutenant Whitcomb 
arrived here the 5th instant, in the evening, and went off the 
same night, with three men, for St. John s, on the west side. I 
sent off Ensign McKay early the next morning, on the cast side, 
with three men. They are to send me intelligence from time to 
time. I expect to hear from them to-morrow. 

Early yesterday morning the boats were ordered on shore, to 
cut fascines to fix on the bows and sides of the gondolas, to pre 
vent the enemy s boarding, and to keep off small shot. One of 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 541 

the boats went on shore (contrary to orders) before the others 
were ready. They were attacked by a party of savages, who 
pursued them into the water. They all reached the boat; but, 
before they could row off, three were killed and six wounded. 
The party was headed by a regular officer, who called to our 
people to resign themselves. On our firing a few shot among 
them, they immediately dispersed. A party was sent on shore, 
who found a laced beaver hat, the button marked forty-seventh 
regiment. 

The Lee and gondola arrived here yesterday morning. We 
are moored in a line across the Lake, in such a manner that it 
will be impossible for a bateau to pass us. I hope the galleys 
are nearly completed. The force of the enemy is uncertain; 
however, they have this advantage, that they can man all their 
bateaux with soldiers, whenever they think proper to attack us ; 
and our vessels are so low that numbers may carry them by 
boarding. This must be attended with great loss on their side, 
as I am positive that they will not be able to surprise us. If I 
find the enemy have a considerable naval force, I design to re 
tire to Cumberland Head, or Schuyler s Island, until joined by 
the three galleys, which will be superior to all our present force, 
when the whole are joined. 

I believe the Isle-la-Motte will be the best stand, as the ene 
my can bring nothing against us by land, nor will they dare to 
come on the Island; and, by our guard-boats, we can prevent 
any boats going from Missisco Bay. As you have more troops 
at Ticonderoga than you want, will it not be prudent to send up 
one thousand or fifteen hundred men, who might encamp on 
the Isle-la-Motte, and be ready at all times to assist us, if 
attacked? Twenty men to a bateau will be sufficient. They 
might load under cover of the vessels, push out and fire, and 
retire under cover again ; and, if the enemy s boats should make 
their principal attack on any particular vessel, those bateaux 
might assist her. Each should be fixed for a swivel in each 
end ; and, if they are arrived, one should be fixed in them. If 
you should think it necessary to send a detachment, it will be 
necessary to bring intrenching tools, that they may cover them 
selves from small-arms. 

We have but very indifferent men in general. Great part of 

those who shipped for seamen know very little of the matter. 

Three or four good gunners are wanted. Inclosed is a list of 

our sick, who increase fast. I have sent up, in three bateaux, 

VOL. i. 46 



542 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [1776. 

twenty-three men, who will be of no service for some time. I 
wish fifty-eight seamen could be procured and sent down. 

I inclose you a letter from Samuel Chase, Esq. You will ob 
serve he requests an explanation of your letter to Mr. Adams. 
He observes, my character is much injured by a report prevail 
ing in Philadelphia, of my having sequestered the goods sek+ed 
in Montreal. As you have had an opportunity of hearing that 
matter canvassed on the trial of Colonel Hazen, I beg you will 
be kind enough to write your sentiments to him on the matter. 
I cannot but think it extremely cruel, when I have sacrificed my 
ease, health, and great part of my private property in the cause 
of my country, to be calumniated as a robber and thief, at a 
time too when I have it not in my power to be heard in my own 
defence. 

The 15th August, when we left Ticonderoga, the fleet was 
victualled for thirty days, which time is elapsed, except six days. 
We have on board the fleet six or eight days provision, besides 
twenty barrels of flour, left at Crown Point, to be baked, and 
ten barrels of pork, which I have ordered Lieutenant Calderwood 
to bring down, which will serve the fleet to the 20th. As the 
Lake is often very difficult to pass for a number of days, we 
ought to have at least one month s provision on hand. Major G. 
goes up with the sick, to whom I must refer you for particulars. 
We are very anxious to hear from New York. I hope soon to 
have that pleasure by one of the galleys, which I think must be 
completed by this time. 

Please to make my compliments to the gentlemen of your 
family, and believe me, with much respect, esteem, and affection, 
dear General, yours, &c., 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



GENERAL ARNOLD TO GENERAL GATES. 

Schuyler s Island, 12 October, 1776. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

Yesterday morning, at eight o clock, the enemy s fleet, con 
sisting of one ship, mounting sixteen guns, one snow, mounting 
the same number, one schooner, of fourteen guns, two of twelve, 
two sloops, a bomb-ketch, and a large vessel (that did not come 
up), with fifteen or twenty flat-bottomed boats, or gondolas, car 
rying one twelve or eighteen-pounder in their bows, appeared 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 543 

off Cumberland Head. We immediately prepared to receive them. 
The galleys and Royal Savage were ordered under way. The 
rest of our fleet lay at an anchor. 

At eleven o clock they ran under the lee of Valcour Island, 
and began the attack. The schooner, by some bad management, 
fell to leeward, and was first attacked. One of her masts was 
wounded, and her rigging shot away. The Captain thought pru 
dent to run her on the point of Valcour, where all the men 
were saved. They boarded her, and at night set fire to her. 

At half past twelve the engagement became general, and very 
warm. Some of the enemy s ships, and all their gondolas, beat 
and rowed up within musket shot of us. They continued a very 
hot fire, with round and grape-shot, until five o clock, when they 
thought proper to retire to about six or seven hundred yards* 
distance, and continued the fire until dark. 

The Congress and Washington have suffered greatly. The lat 
ter lost her First Lieutenant, killed, Captain and Master wound 
ed. The New York lost all her officers, except her Captain. 
The Philadelphia was hulled in so many places that she sunk 
about one hour after the engagement was over. The whole 
killed and wounded amounted to about sixty. The enemy landed 
a large number of Indians on the Island, and each shore, who 
kept an incessant fire on us, but did little damage. The enemy 
had, to appearance, upwards of one thousand men in bateaux, 
prepared for boarding. We suffered much for want of seamen 
and gunners. I was obliged myself to point most of the guns 
on board the Congress, which I believe did good execution. The 
Congress received seven shot between wind and water, was hulled 
a dozen times, had her mainmast wounded in two places, and 
her yard in one. The Washington was hulled a number of 
times, her mainmast shot through, and must have a new one. 
Both vessels are very leaky, and want repairing. 

On consulting with General Waterbury and Colonel Wiggles- 
worth, it was thought prudent to return to Crown Point, every 
vessel s ammunition being nearly three fourths spent, and the 
enemy greatly superior to us in ships and men. At seven 
o clock Colonel Wigglesworth, in the Trumbull, got under way. 
The gondolas and small vessels followed, and the Congress and 
Washington brought up the rear. The enemy did not attempt 
to molest us. Most of the fleet is this minute come to an 
anchor. The wind is small to the southward. The enemy s 
fleet is under way to leeward, and beating up. As soon as our 



544 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [1776. 

leaks are stopped, the whole fleet will make the utmost de 
spatch to Crown Point, where I beg you will send ammunition, 
and your further orders for us. On the whole, I think we have 
had a very fortunate escape, and have great reason to return 
our humble and hearty thanks to Almighty God, for preserv 
ing and delivering so many of us from our more than savage 
enemies. I am, dear General, 

Your affectionate, humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 

P. S. I had not moved on board the Congress when the 
enemy appeared, and lost all my papers and most of my clothes 
on board the schooner. I wish a dozen bateaux, well manned, 
could be sent immediately, to tow up the vessels in case of 
a southerly wind. 

I cannot, in justice to the officers in the fleet, omit mention 
ing their spirited conduct during the action. 



GENERAL ARNOLD TO GENERAL SCIIUYLER. 

Ticonderoga, 15 October, 1776. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

I make no doubt, before this, you have received a copy of my 
letter to General Gates, of the 12th instant, dated at Schuyler s 
Island, advising of an action between our fleet and the enemy s, 
the preceding day ; in which we lost a schooner and gondola. We 
remained no longer at Schuyler s Island than to stop our leaks 
and mend the sails of the Washington. At two o clock, afternoon, 
the 12th, weighed anchor, with a fresh breeze to the southward. 
The enemy s fleet, at the same time, got under way. Our gon 
dolas made very little way ahead. 

In the evening the wind moderated, and we made such pro 
gress that, at G o clock next morning, we were about off Wills- 
borough, twenty-eight miles from Crown Point. The enemy s 
fleet were very little above Schuyler s Island. The wind breezed 
up to the southward, so that we gained very little by beating or 
rowing. At the same time the enemy took a fresh breeze from 
the north-east, and, by the time we had reached Split Rock, were 
alongside of us. The Washington and Congress were in the rear; 
the rest of our fleet were ahead, except two gondolas sunk at 
Schuyler s Island. The Washington galley was in such a sliat- 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 545 

tered condition, and had so many men killed and wounded, she 
struck to the enemy, after receiving a few broadsides. We were 
then attacked in the Congress galley, by a ship mounting twelve 
eighteen-pounders, a schooner of fourteen sixes, and one of twelve 
sixes, two under our stern, and one on our broadside, within 
musket shot. 

They kept up an incessant fire upon us for about five glasses, 
with round and grape shot, which we returned as briskly. The 
sails, rigging, and hull of the Congress were shattered and torn 
in pieces ; the First Lieutenant and three men killed ; when, to 
prevent her falling into the hands of the enemy, who had seven 
sail around me, I ran her ashore in a small creek, ten miles 
from Crown Point, on the east side, when, after saving our small 
arms, I set her on fire, with four gondolas, with whose crews I 
reached Crown Point, through the woods, that evening, and very 
luckily escaped the savages, who waylaid the road in two hours 
after we passed. At four o clock yesterday morning I reached this 
place, exceedingly fatigued and unwell, having been without sleep 
or refreshment for near three days. 

Of our whole fleet, we have saved only two galleys, two small 
schooners, one gondola, and one sloop. General Waterbury, with 
one hundred and ten prisoners, was returned by Carleton last 
night. On board of the Congress, we had twenty odd men killed 
and wounded. Our whole loss amounts to eighty odd. The ene 
my s fleet were last night three miles below Crown Point. Their 
army is doubtless at their heels. We are busily employed in 
completing our lines and redoubts, which, I am sorry to say, are 
not so forward as I could wish. We have very few heavy 
cannon, but are mounting every piece we have. It is the opinion 
of Generals Gates and St. Clair, that eight or ten thousand mili 
tia should be immediately sent to our assistance, if they can pos 
sibly be spared from below. 

I am of opinion the enemy will attack us with their fleet and 
army at the same time. The former is very formidable, a list 
of which I am favored with by General Waterbury, and have 
inclosed. The season is so far advanced, our people are daily 
growing more healthy. We have about nine thousand effectives ; 
and, if properly supported,. I make no doubt of stopping the ca 
reer of the enemy. All your letters to me, of late, have miscar 
ried. I am extremely sorry to hear, by General Gates, you are 
unwell. I have sent you, by General Waterbury, a small box, 
containing all my public and private papers and accounts, with a 
46* 



546 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [1776. 

considerable sum of hard and paper money, which I beg the favor 
of your taking care of. I am, dear General, 

Your most affectionate, humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD.* 



GENERAL ARNOLD TO GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Ticonderoga, 24 October, 1776. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

Your kind favor of the 17th I received four days since. I am 
greatly obliged to you for the friendship you express on my 
safety and having escaped the enemy. 

I am extremely glad to hear the militia are coming to our 
assistance. I believe the enemy, from the best accounts we can 
collect, are endeavouring to fortify Crown Point. I am afraid 
we shall not be able to detain a sufficient garrison for this place 
from the troops now here. 

A boom will be laid across the Lake this day, and a bridge 
to-morrow from Ticonderoga to Mount Independence. We cannot 
ascertain the strength of the enemy. In a few days we shall be 
ready to make a trial of their force, if they think proper to 
attack us. I have only time to add my most respectful compli

* Sir Guy Carlcton, in his letter to Lord George Germain, describ 
ing this action, dated October 14th, states the English forces as fol 
lows; "Inflexible, 18 twelve-pounders; schooner Maria, 14 six-pound 
ers; schooner Carleton, 12 six-pounders; radeau Thunderer, 6 twenty- 
four and 6 twelve-pounders ; two howitzers ; gondola, Loyal Convert, 7 
nine-pounders ; twenty gun-boats, each a brass field-piece, some twenty- 
fours to nines, some with howitzers ; four long-boats, with each a car 
nage-gun, serving as tenders; twenty-four long-boats, with provisions." 

Captain Douglas, writing to the Admiralty Office from Quebec, on 
the 21st of October, said; "The prodigies of labor which have been 
effected since the rebels were driven out of Canada, in creating, re-cre 
ating, and equipping a fleet of above thirty fighting vessels of different 
sorts and sizes, and all carrying cannon, since the beginning of July, 
together Avith the transporting over land, and afterwards dragging up 
the two rapids of St. Tcrese and St. John s thirty long-boats, the flat- 
bottomed boats, a gondola weighing above thirty tons, and above fcair 
hundred bateaux, almost exceed belief." Almon s Remembrancer, Vol.

GENERAL GATES TO GENERAL SCIIUYLER. 

Ticonderoga, 31 October, 1776. 
SIR, 

Monday morning, between eight and nine o clock, our advanced 
guard-boat, down the Lake, made the signal for the approach of 
the enemy s fleet. In about one hour, five of their largest boats 
or gondolas appeared in sight, and a number of troops, Indians, 
and Canadians, were seen landing upon Three-Mile Point. Soon 
after, two of the armed boats stood over to the east side of the 
Lake, inclining upwards, as if sent to reconnoitre. When they 
came considerably within shot, they were fired upon from two 
redoubts very near the shore, and by a row-galley which is sta 
tioned to cover the boom. They thereupon retired. In the mean 
time, the enemy s troops were distinctly seen to land upon 
the back of the Point; and, presently after, thirteen small ba 
teaux and birch canoes crossed from the west to the east side of 
the Lake into a bay, about four miles below our redoubts. 

Upon these threatenings of an attack, our lines, redoubts, and 
posts were all manned ; and as the motions of the enemy seemed 
to indicate they were gathering their main force upon the west 
side of the Lake, as if intending to make their push there, I 
ordered three regiments (Poor s, Bead s, and Greaton s) from 
Mount Independence, to reenforce this side. The orders w r ere 
instantly obeyed, and nothing could exceed the spirit and alert 
ness which were shown by all officers and soldiers in executing 
every order that was given. About four, in the evening, the 
boats and canoes that had passed to the west side of the Lake 
returned, and the enemy were seen plainly to reembark at the 
Three-Mile Point. I immediately ordered the guard-boat to re 
sume her station ; and, by sunset, it was observed the body of 
the enemy had retired. 

By the information I receive daily, I find that General Carle- 
ton continues in his post, and that three large vessels are an 
chored near Putnam s Point; a little below which, all the light 
infantry, grenadiers, and a large body of Indians and Canadians, 
are encamped. Chimney Point and Crown Point are also occu 
pied by the enemy. Yesterday I received the inclosed intelli 
gence from Newbury, Coos. 

If Sir John Johnson did actually march at the time he is said 
to have done it, he must be upon the Mohawk River now; or, 



548 OPERATIONS IN CANADA. [177G. 

if he aims at Fort George, Dayton s regiment cannot be better 
stationed tliun there. Surely, your Oneidas will give you all the 
necessary information upon this head. But how could Sir John 
get back, if he should meet with a check ? I have seen the Mo 
hawk River fast frozen on the 10th of November. 

Colonel Lewis set off yesterday morning by Skene. He has 
memorandums of our wants, and will be with you as soon as 
this letter. Colonel Gansevoort writes me for spades. You must 
answer his demand, for I cannot. 

We received the good news you sent us from New York with 
joyful hearts. It was immediately made public to the arm} r , in 
the manner you advised. I am, Sir, 

Your most obedient, humble servant, 

I ICE ATI o GATES. 



GENERAL GATES TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Ticonderoga, 5 November, 177C. 
SIR, 

I have the honor to congratulate Congress upon the retreat of 
Lieutenant-General Sir Guy Carleton, with the fleet and army 
under his command, from Crown Point, Saturday last. The 
works being put into the best order, the boom and bridge of 
communication finished, and every necessary preparative for de 
fence made, I determined to send a detachment down each side 
of the Lake to beat up the enemy s quarters at their advanced 
post on Putnam s Point and the opposite shore. About eight at 
night, the detachment, under the command of Major Delap, pro 
ceeded down the east side of the Lake ; and the other, under 
Colonel Connor, down the west side. Sunday morning, Major 
Delap, with his detachment, took possession of Putnam s Point, 
which the enemy had just abandoned, and immediately detached 
a subaltern, with a small party, to reconnoitre Crown Point. The 
officer having returned, reported that he saw the enemy embark, 
a number of their vessels under sail, and the whole preparing to 
get under way. Colonel Connor, on taking possession of the post 
opposite to Putnam s Point, found that likewise abandoned. Yes 
terday an officer, with a party whom I sent to Crown Point, re 
turned and reported he had been at Crown Point, with the 
inhabitants there; that the enemy were all gone from that post, 
and the inhabitants would come this day to Ticonderoga, to make 
their submission, and beg the protection of the United States. 



APPENDIX.] OPERATIONS IN CANADA. 549 

I cannot help observing, here, that the removal of our army 
from Crown Point to Ticonderoga was a most fortunate and salu 
tary measure ; for, had it continued at Crown Point after the 
disaster that befell our fleets, the enemy might have cut off all 
our resources, by stationing their fleet above the Point. Despe 
rate must then have been the situation of our army. I have the 
honor to be 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

HORATIO GATES.
