SIR, 
</p><p>
I am just now honored with the receipt of your Excellency's letter of the 14th instant, from White 
Marsh. I have never entertained the smallest idea 
that <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel=''>General Burgoyne</a> should be permitted to ex 
change the port of embarkation, or that the least 
variation of the spirit and letter of the Convention 
would be indulged to the troops under his command. 
There is no doubt but the British regiments, upon 
their arrival in England, will be ordered to do duty there; but the Germans cannot, by the laws, serve in 
Great Britain or Ireland. 
</p><p>
If <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel=''>General Burgoyne</a> has any sinister design, what 
I suggested to Congress in my letter of the 10th 
instant, a copy of which I conclude your Excellency 
has received, will be a good method of delaying, if 
not finally preventing, the execution of his project. 
</p><p>
I shall write to-morrow, by the <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> post, to 
General Glover, who is charged with the embarkation 
of the prisoners under the Convention, and send hima copy of your Excellency's letter. I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant.

SIR, 
</p><p>
To prevent the enemy's army, now marching across 
the Jerseys, from receiving any considerable reenforcement from the troops in and near <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, I 
propose moving the main body of this army to the 
White Plains, and shall take a strong camp in that neighbourhood. I have all my cavalry, and a consider 
able body of infantry, now properly posted between 
the two rivers, to intercept the enemy's parties, and 
cut off their communication with the interior country, 
which has also given the alarm of an attack being 
meditated upon <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, as confirmed by good intelligence, which Colonel Graham assures me he has 
received. Probably the slow movements of the enemy, joined to the obstructions thrown in their way, 
may so retard their march through the Jerseys as 
to give your Excellency an opportunity to harass 
them exceedingly with your dragoons and light infantry, aided by the militia, which will most assuredly 
produce, amongst other good things, a considerable 
desertion, and, perhaps, finally such an opening as 
may enable your Excellency to make a glorious finishing of the war. I should apprehend the enemy's re 
sours for provisions on their march must be scanty ; 
and, if they are once obliged to take a fixed position, 
or force your army from a very strong one, their 
desperation may be their ruin. 
</p><p>
In order to eke out the magazine, I have increased 
the quantity of flour and rice, and reduced the meat. 
Of the two former we have large supplies. I think a 
quantity of cured shad might be sent us from the 
southward. I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient humble servant,

SIR, 
</p><p>
I am this moment honored with the receipt of your Excellency's letter of to-day's date. 
</p><p>
I am sorry for the disgrace we have suffered in 
the Jerseys; but imagine that the enemy take ad 
vantage of the supine ness that constantly seizes our people, when they have been long unmolested. This 
is an evil, that even the best officers cannot remedy. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel=''>General McDougall</a>'s division will be put upon 
the march immediately, as your Excellency has commanded. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will excuse me when I say, I like 
not the divided state of your army. The enemy are 
upon the qui-vive ; they have the advantages of a 
river, to navigate upon each of our flanks. To divide is to conquer, in politics. I hope it may not, with 
regard to us, prove so in the war. 
</p><p>
I hope Lord Stirling and General Maxwell will answer all your Excellency's expectations in the Jerseys ; they certainly are best acquainted with that 
country. 
</p><p>
Inclosed is a letter I have this moment received 
from Major Tallmadge. Your Excellency will please 
to order Colonel Pettit to supply the necessary articles. I am, Sir, your Excellency's

SIR, 
</p><p>
Yesterday I had the honor to receive your Excellency's letter of the 14th ultimo, from <a href='/results.php?city=middlebrook' rel='city'>Middlebrook</a>. 
I am sorry to find your Excellency seems to have 
given over all thoughts of penetrating into Canada 
by the route of Coos, after the preparations made for 
that purpose, at an incredible expense. 
I am satisfied you could not have advised with 
two men, upon this Continent, better acquainted with 
the practicable routes to the River St. Lawrence, than 
General Bayley and Colonel Hazen, the latter being 
an officer of great merit and service, and who long 
resided upon the River Sorel ; and the former, the 
best of any acquainted with the country between 
Coos and Lake St. Peter's, who likewise has the most 
extensive influence upon the brave and numerous in 
habitants in the northern parts of the States which 
lie near Canada. As your Excellency advised with 
them, and determined upon the route by Coos, I beg 
leave to express my astonishment at the sudden 
change of your sentiments, and relinquishment of that 
plan. 
</p><p>
To go into Canada by Lake Champlain, before the 
enemy's fleet are taken or destroyed, is almost impracticable ; to attempt it by Lake Ontario, before 
Niagara is taken, and vessels upon that Lake are re 
moved, is still more difficult, as the Fort at La Galette must be reduced before the passage down the 
River St. Lawrence is open to Montreal. I believe 
that, in the present state of our army, and the actual 
situation of our magazines, to attempt a serious invasion of Canada, by whatever route, would prove unsuccessful, unless the fleet of our allies should, at the 
same time, cooperate with us, by sailing up the River 
St. Lawrence. In that case, the enemy's force would 
all (their fleet excepted) move down the river, to 
succour Quebec ; and our armament from Coos, assisted by the Canadians, who would flock to meet us, 
might march in the utmost security from Coos to 
Lake St. Peter s. The Upper Canada would then be 
wholly ours, and the English fleet on Lake Champlain, thus rendered useless, would be destroyed by its own crews, before these should be ordered down 
the river, to make the best of their way to Quebec. 
</p><p>
I much lament the amazing and needless expense 
that is incurred by the preparations making on the 
upper part of Hudson's River; for, I am confident, 
no force of ours can get into Canada by either of the 
routes from <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, in <a href='/results.php?year=1779'>1779</a>. 
</p><p>
The last paragraph of your Excellency's letter 
alarms me exceedingly. There is no magazine of 
flour in all these States ; and to have no hopes of 
procuring one, either by land or sea, is a most melancholy consideration. 
</p><p>
The Navy Board, here, just now acquainted me 
with their having lost all hopes of any supply of 
rice from South Carolina, that State having laid an 
embargo on that article. With very great respect 
and esteem, I am, Sir, 
</p><p>

SIR, 
</p><p>
Thursday night I had the honor to receive your Excellency's letter of the 1st instant, and immediately gave orders for moving the Continental troops 
over the bay to <a href='/results.php?city=greenwich' rel='city'>Greenwich</a>; but, the weather proving 
so very stormy the whole day, that could not be effected before Saturday evening. I came myself that 
night to <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, and gave orders for Jackson's 
regiment, stationed here, to march this morning for 
Plainfield ; if the weather continues tolerable, I have 
no doubt but the whole will reach <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a> Saturday. 
I have advised with those who are the best acquainted with the different routes at this season of the 
year ; they all prefer that by <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>, upon account 
of the facility of passing the ferries, and the goodness of the roads that way. 
</p><p>
I shall bring with me only four pies of light 
brass field artillery, and propose leaving what is 
called the park, here, with a small guard to take 
care of it. If your Excellency wishes more to be 
brought forward, it may be easily done after the receipt of your farther orders. I am, Sir,

SIR, 
</p><p>
In obedience to the orders contained in your Excellency's letters of the 1st and 2d instant, I marched the whole of the Continental troops from the 
State of Rhode Island, and arrived yesterday morning, with the first division, consisting of a detachment of Colonel Crane's artillery, with two six-pounders, Colonel Livington's, Colonel Jackson's, and Colonel Webb's regiments, at <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>. The second division, 
consisting of the rest of Colonel Crane's, with the 
like artillery, <a href='/results.php?tla=chg' rel=''>Colonel Greene</a>'s, Colonel Angell's, and 
Colonel Sherburne's regiments, will be here this evening. As I find no orders here, and have not received 
any letter from your Excellency since that dated the 
2d instant, I shall encamp the troops, and wait your further commands. I am, Sir,

SIR,

Last night I was favored with your letter of yesterday's date. 
The return you request is by this conveyance transmitted to his 
Excellency <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel=''>General Burgoyne</a>. Surgeons, medicines, and attendance, with every comfort imaginable, have been amply supplied 
to the sick and wounded officers and soldiers, prisoners at <a href='/results.php?city=bennington' rel='city'>Bennington</a>, as it is the wish of every generous mind, that the calamities of war should lie as light as possible upon unhappy individuals who are wounded or taken. You will be satisfied these 
are my sentiments when you examine Ensign and Quarter-master 
Sanders, who were brought by one of my scouts, last year, to 
<a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>. In Brigadier-General St. Leger's retreat from Fort Stanwix, and during the siege thereof, some British officers and 
soldiers have fallen into our hands. As soon as I know their 
names, they shall be sent to you in writing. Your letter, ad 
dressed to the senior British officer, is sent to <a href='/results.php?city=bennington' rel='city'>Bennington</a>. I

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
It is the opinion of all the Generals that I have consulted 
with, that, in the present position and circumstances of General 
Burgoyne's army, considered with his apparent views, your army 
ought to be posted at Stillwater, and that not one moment should 
be lost in your marching them thither. Upon your arrival there, 
you will take possession of the height upon the east side, and fix 
five or six hundred men thereupon. The rest you will encamp 
at the old station. <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel=''>General Burgoyne</a> has not left the smallest 
article at any of the posts in the rear. This, I informed you of 
in my last. You will march by the shortest route to Stillwater. 
Provisions, &c., shall be provided for you there. 
</p><p>
I am, &c.,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel=''>Governor Clinton</a> will present you my letter to him of this 
date, which contains my unalterable sentiments of the measures 
which ought to be taken, should Sir Harry Clinton attempt to 
succour or reenforce Sir William Howe. I will not again repeat 
them here, but only take the liberty earnestly to recommend the 
profoundest secrecy in whatever you determine to do ; for, depend 
upon it, that that consummate, artful woman, Mrs. Robinson, will 
do all in her power to be acquainted with your secrets. 
</p><p>
As to any attack upon <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, I utterly disapprove of it; 
for, while the enemy's ships of war can act in the North and 
East Rivers, the taking of that city would be doubtful, and, if 
I have had as yet no information of the event of Colonel Johnson's 
attack on the Mount. My loss of men, in these several actions, is 
not more than three or four killed, and five wounded. The enemy's 
loss is less. I find myself in possession of two hundred and ninety-three prisoners, namely; two Captains, nine subalterns, two Commissaries; non-commissioned officers and privates, one hundred and forty-three British, and one hundred and nineteen Canadians; eighteen artificers ; and retook more than one hundred of our men ; total, two 
hundred and ninety-three, exclusive of the prisoners retaken. The 
Avater- craft I have taken is one hundred and fifty bateaux, above 
the Falls ; in Lake Champlain, fifty, above the Falls, including several large gun-boats and an armed sloop ; arms equal to the number of 
prisoners ; some ammunition ; and many other things which I cannot 
as yet ascertain. I must not forget to mention a few cannon, which 
may be of great service to us." 
taken, could not be held ; and be assured, that all stores, of any 
value to us, are or will be afloat, before any large detachments 
leave that city, and I can see no good in taking an empty town, 
which we cannot hold. Of course it is not an object to divert 
the attention of the King's Generals from their more important 
designs.

SIR,

I am exceedingly mortified that you did not accept of my offer 
at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, to go to England in a vessel, that the State of Massachusetts Bay would, at my request, have provided. General 
Glover, with whom you are acquainted, was, in that case, to have 
attended you in his own ship ; and I am persuaded you would 
have avoided many disagreements, had it pleased you to have 
accepted that offer. Your case I feel, as I ever shall that of the 
unfortunate brave. If courage, perseverance, and a faithful attachment to your Prince could have prevailed, I might have been 
your prisoner. The chance of war has determined otherwise.

As I have not heard a syllable from you, or <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel=''>General Putnam</a>, 
for a week past, I conclude you are in no want of any further 
assistance from me. Colonel Malcom promised to write as soon

truce to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, on board of which is the widow Cortlandt 
Schuyler, her family, servants, &c., with Lieutenant Swords and 
his family. The sloop is commanded by Captain Van Buren. 
Colonel H. B. Livingston, who went in the bateau that carried 
Lord Viscount Petersham, Aid-de-camp to Lientenant-General 
Burgoyne, has my orders to see you upon his return from General Vaughan, to whom he carried a letter from me. Captain 
Van Buren will also make you his report as lie passes New 
Windsor. I am exceedingly impatient to hear from the south 
and the south-west. I am happy to tell you, that <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel=''>General Lincoln</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel=''>General Arnold</a> are both in a fair way of recovery. 
I am,

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Upon my return last night from Coeyman's, I had the pleasure 
to receive your Excellency's letter of the 30th of last month. If 
Sir Henry Clinton is directed to reenforce the army of Sir William Howe, which I believe to be the case, he will either land 
his troops at Amboy, and march by the lower road to Mount 
Holly, to support any designed attack upon <a href='/results.php?city=fort mifflin' rel='city'>Fort Mifflin</a>, and the 
fortified pass of the Delaware River ; or he will land at <a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a>, and march by Brunswic and <a href='/results.php?city=princeton' rel='city'>Princeton</a> to <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, in order to facilitate Sir William Howe's retreat across the Delaware, 
and through the Jerseys. In either attempt, I am clearly of opinion that all the troops I sent to your assistance, with all that 
can properly, from your neighbourhood, be added to them, should 
march without delay to <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a>, and for their further operations, be governed, in great measure, by the movements of the 
enemy. Of these, the Commanding Officer should procure the 
best intelligence. 
</p><p>
If Sir Henry Clinton marches towards Mount Holly, our army 
will, of course, move directly to <a href='/results.php?city=princeton' rel='city'>Princeton</a>, and hang upon his 
rear and right flank. If he marches towards <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, our army 
will march to Somerset Court-House, and be ready to move, as he 
moves, towards <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a> ; our General carefully acquainting General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> with his own, and the enemy's motions, and receiving his directions for the cooperation of his army. 
</p><p>
The Governor of the Jerseys should, at the same time, be 
requested to order the militia of that State to second the motions 
of our army. If Colonel Morgan and his rifle regiment have 
marched, it would be right to send an express to stop them at 
Van Camp's, and order him to march from thence to Sussex 
Court-House and <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a>. 
</p><p>
The heavy brass artillery I sent down the river, should be sent 
up again by water, or so disposed as to be secured from any 
surprise. The light brass field-guns, which you mentioned in a 
former letter, should be sent with the troops to <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a>. I 
have the best reason to believe, that, with the troops I have 
here, I can secure every thing this way until June, and perhaps 
do more. 
</p><p>
If the public affairs of this State do not require your Excellency's immediate attendance upon them, I wish you could be 
spared to command the army to be assembled at <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a>. 
But if your meeting the Legislature here cannot be dispensed 
with, I wish General Parsons might be ordered for that service, 
and now take the liberty to recommend it to <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel=''>General Putnam</a> by 
this express. Nevertheless, I wish you would immediately cross 
the river to <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel=''>General Putnam</a>, and show him this letter, and confer with him upon this important movement of the troops. 
</p><p>
As I have sent <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel=''>General Putnam</a> a very fine brigade from 
hence, with two excellent regiments of Connecticut militia, I 
think he will be able to spare one brigade of Continental troops 
from his side, with General Parsons. 
</p><p>
I utterly disapprove of any attempt upon <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, knowing 
that while the enemy s" ships of force occupy the East and North 
Rivers, and there is a tolerable garrison on the Isthmus, the 
taking the city would be very doubtful ; and, when taken, it 
would be found without any military stores of consequence ; for 
those, you may be assured, are afloat; and it is also so commanded from the water, that it cannot be held, until we are 
superior at sea. 
</p><p>
If you cannot wait upon <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel=''>General Putnam</a> yourself, send him .a 
copy of this letter, and your sentiments thereupon, with my letter 
to him inclosed. I am, 
</p><p>
