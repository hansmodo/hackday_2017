Sir, 
</p><p>
My public letter to Congress has surely been transmitted to your Excellency. Since then, I have been 
able to collect authentic returns of the killed, wounded, and missing of the officers of the Maryland line, 
Delaware regiment, artillerists, and those of the legion 
under Colonel Armand. They are inclosed. The militia broke so early in the day, and scattered in so 
many directions upon their retreat, that very few 
have fallen into the hands of the enemy. 
</p><p>
By the firmness and bravery of the Continental 
troops, the victory is for from bloodless on the part 
of the foe J they having upwards of five hundred 
men, with officers in proportion, killed and wounded. 
I do not think Lord Cornwallis will be able to reap 
any advantage of consequence from his victory, as 
this State seems animated to reinstate and support 
the army. Virginia, I am confident, will not be less 
patriotic. By the joint exertions of these two States, 
there is good reason to hope that, should the events 
of the campaign be prosperous to your Excellency, 
all South Carolina might be again recovered. Lord 
Cornwallis remained with his army at Camden, when 
I received the last accounts from thence. I am cantoning ours at Salisbury, Guilford, Hillsborough, and 
Cross Creek. The Marylanders and artillerists, with 
the general hospital, will be here ; the cavalry near 
Cross Creek, and the militia to the westward. This is 
absolutely necessary, as we have no magazine of provisions, and are only supplied from hand to mouth. 
Two days after the action of the 16th, fortune seemed determined to continue to distress us; for Colonel 
Sumpter, having marched near forty miles up the 
river Wateree, halted with the wagons and prisoners 
he had taken the 15th; by some indiscretion the 
men were surprised, cut off from their arms, the 
whole routed, and the wagons and prisoners retaken. 
</p><p>
What encouragement the numerous disaffected in 
this State may give Lord Cornwallis to advance further into the country, I cannot yet say. Colonel 
Sumpter, since his surprise and defeat upon the west 
side of the Wateree, has reinstated and increased his 
corps to upwards of one thousand men. I have 
directed him to continue to harass the enemy upon 
that side. Lord Cornwallis will therefore be cautious 
how he makes any considerable movement to the 
eastward, while this corps remains in force upon his 
left flank, and the main body is, in a manner, cantoned in his front. Anxious for the public good, I 
shall continue my unwearied endeavours to stop the 
progress of the enemy, to reinstate our affairs, to recommence an offensive war, and recover all our losses 
in the Southern States. But, if being unfortunate is 
solely reason sufficient for removing me from command, I shall most cheerfully submit to the orders 
of Congress, and resign an office few Generals would 
be anxious to possess, and where the utmost skill 
and fortitude are subject to be baffled by the difficulties which must for a time surround the Chief in 
command here. That your Excellency may meet 
with no such difficulties; that your road to fame and 
fortune may be smooth and easy, is the sincere wish 
of. Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hog" rel="me">Horatio Gates.</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. Your commands, in respect to the Virginia 
line, shall be exactly and faithfully obeyed.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I had, the day before yesterday, the honor of receiving your Excellency's letter, dated the 8th of 
August, from Orangetown. It gave me infinite satisfaction to find you had baffled Sir Harry Clinton's 
designs, and was, to all appearance, in so prosperous 
a situation. Heaven grant you the greatest honor 
and success ! 
</p><p>
As to the situation of affairs here, since my last 
letter to your Excellency of the 3Oth ultimo, I can 
only say no considerable alteration has taken place, 
the enemy remaining still, and the disaffected doing 
nothing of consequence to disturb us. Fourteen hundred of the second draft of the militia of this State 
are marched to cover Salisburg, and the country from 
thence to Charlotte, where Colonel Sumpter has a command, which occasionally acts upon the west side of 
the Wateree, and has hitherto given such a jealousy 
to the British in Camden as to keep them at home. 
Three hundred Virginia riflemen, under Colonel Campbell, and militia from the back counties, are marching 
to the east bank of the Yadkin, at the ford ; and 
General Stevens, with what have not run home, of 
the other Virginia militia, is at Guilford CourtHouse. The Maryland division and the artillery are 
here, to be refitted ; the former will be put into one 
strong regiment, with a good light infantry company, 
under Colonel Williams. The rest of the officers will 
be sent immediately to Maryland, for the purpose 
directed by your Excellency in your letter to the 
Baron de Kalb, of the 27th June, which came to my 
hands only yesterday, from <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, in Virginia. 
General Muhlenberg acquaints me that near five hundred regulars are upon their march from Petersburg 
to this place ; these, with the Marylanders above mentioned, will make us stronger in Continental 
troops than I was before the action. The cavalry, 
under the Colonels White and Washington and Major Nelson, are not quite equipped, so as to be able 
to march to Bock Fish, in the neighbourhood of 
Cross Creek, as I directed ; but I hope they will 
soon be in a condition to obey my orders. 
</p><p>
Colonel Dubuysson, Aid-de-camp to the Baron de Kalb, a most amiable young officer, will soon wait 
upon your Excellency; he was wounded and taken, 
but Lord Cornwallis has permitted him to go to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, on iarole. All the Baron's baggage and 
papers are saved ; they are delivered to Colonel Dubuysson, who will be responsible for them. Too much 
honor cannot be paid by Congress to the memory of 
the Baron de Kalb ; he was every thing an excellent 
officer should be, and, in the cause of the United 
States, has sacrificed his life. 
</p><p>
If I can yet render good service to the United 
States, it will be necessary it should be seen that I 
have the support of Congress and your Excellency ; 
otherwise some men may think they please my superiors by blaming me, and thus recommend themselves 
to favor. But you, Sir, will be too generous to lend 
an ear to such men, if such there be, and will show 
your greatness of soul rather by protecting, than 
slighting, the unfortunate. If, on the contrary, I am 
not supported, and countenance is given to every one 
who will speak disrespectfully of me, it will be better for Congress to remove me at once from a command where I shall be unable to render them any 
good service. This, Sir, I submit to your candor 
and honor, and shall cheerfully await the decision of 
my superiors. With the warmest wishes for your 
prosperity, and the sincerest sentiments of esteem 
and regard, I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,

</p><p>
P. S. Inclosed are two letters of Lord Bawdon, 
found at the house of Rugely, thirteen miles from 
Camden, to whom they are directed ; which will show your Excellency what dark schemes our enemies fall 
upon, in order to effect their nefarious purposes

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been honored with your letter of the 12th 
instant, declaring to me that no charge having been 
brought against me before your Excellency, the Court 
of Inquiry into my conduct could proceed upon no 
other principle, in the military way, than the resolve 
of Congress, of the 5th of October last. Having been 
informed that Congress had no charge against me, I 
transmitted to them, by the President, your Excellency's last letter. Their inclosed resolve is the result; 
and I conceive that your intention, pointed as it was, 
has been mistaken.''' 
</p><p>
This evening, I wrote to his Excellency the President, that " before our disaster at Camden, had a resolve of Congress ordered that every Commanding 
Officer, who shall not beat the enemy, must be recalled, and subjected to a Court of Inquiry, whether 
</p><p>
" October 5th, <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>. Resolved, that the Commander-in-chief be, and 
hereby is directed to order a Court of Inquiry to be held on the conduct of Major-<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='me'>General Gates</a>, as Commander of the Southern army. 
</p><p>
" Resolved, that the Commander-in-chief be, and hereby is directed 
to appoint an officer to command the Southern array, in the room of 
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='me'>General Gates</a>, until such inquiry be made." 
</p><p>
"May 21, <a href='/results.php?year=1781'>1781</a>. Resolved, that the resolutions of the 5th of October 
last, directing a Court of Inquiiy to be held on the conduct of Major<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='me'>General Gates</a>, as Commander of the Southern army, and directing the 
Commander-in-chief to appoint an officer to command the Southern army, in the room of <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='me'>General Gates</a>, until such inquiry be made, did not 
operate as a suspension of <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='me'>General Gates</a> from his command in the Une of the army at lai-ge, as a Major-General ; and as, from the situation of 
affairs in the Southern department, such Court of Inquiry cannot be 
speedily held, that Major-<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='me'>General Gates</a> be informed, that he is at 
liberty to repair to head-quarters, and take such command as the Commander-in-chief shall direct." 
or not any crime be laid to liis charge, I would as 
patiently submit to my fate, as officers who surrender 
a fort, or lose a ship. The special resolve of Congress 
dooms me to temporaiy disesteem, and loss of confidence." For these reasons, Sir, I can neither with 
advantage to the public, nor honor to mjself, accept, 
under my present circumstances, the proffered indulgence of Congress. 
</p><p>
Convinced that you have done every thing, which 
propriety could admit, to protect slandered officers 
against anonymous accusations, I will set out to-morrow morning for Virginia, where I shall wait for your 
Excellency's orders. 
</p><p>
With sincere thanks for the army in general, and 
myself in particular, I have the honor to be. Sir, &c.,

Sir, 
</p><p>
The secrecy and expedition of your Excellency's 
movement from the North River, defeated my wish to 
have paid you my compliments in person upon your 
route, as I never knew of your being upon the 
march until you had passed <a href='/results.php?city=alexandria' rel='city'>Alexandria</a>. In this remote corner, I seldom see a newspaper; and though 
we ought to have a post once a fortnight, we are in 
that often disappointed. 
</p><p>
I hope your Excellency received my letter of the 
22d of May, from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. I should have been 
happy to know jour sentiments thereupon, but do 
most readily conceive the vast public business, with 
which you are constantly surrounded, has deprived 
me of that satisfaction. Ever willing to give my little aid to serve this, our much injured country, I 
should rejoice to be instrumental to your Excellency's 
success in any way you would please to command ; 
but I think you would not wish me to act under the 
stigma, that has been so ungenerously laid upon me. 
</p><p>
The bearer, Mr. Blue, a reputable farmer from the 
south branch of the Potomac, desires to contract for the delivery of three hundred beeves to your army. 
As I believe he is a person that will perform his 
promise, I recommend him to your Excellency. 
</p><p>
That the Supreme Disposer of events may crown 
your labors with a glorious and complete victory is 
the earnest request of, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,

Sir, 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a> has, in his letter of yesterday, acquainted me that it is your Excellency's desire to 
know if I wish to take command in the army this campaign. I beg your Excellency to believe, that I 
am always ready to obey your commands, and shall 
be most happy when I can execute them to your 
satisfaction. I have but to entreat, that no attention 
to me, or my rank, may interfere, or break in upon 
any part of your Excellency's arrangements. My 
zeal for the public interest makes me exceedingly 
anxious to be present at the great concluding stroke 
of this war. 
</p><p>
I intend to proceed immediately to Berkley, and 
prepare myself for taking the field. I brought nothing with me here ; neither did I settle my domestic matters before I left home. This will ' take up 
but a few days ; when finished, I shall hold myself 
constantly ready to obey your orders. I earnestly 
request your Excellency will be assured of my inviolable attachment, and that no time or circumstance 
shall ever shake that resolution. In consequence of 
my application to Congress upon my arrival here, 1 
have received the inclosed resolve, in a very affectionate letter from my worthy friend, <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a>. With sentiments of the greatest esteem and 
respect, I am, Sir, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and most faithful, humble servant,
