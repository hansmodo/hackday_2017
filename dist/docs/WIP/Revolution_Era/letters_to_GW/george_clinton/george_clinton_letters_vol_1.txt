SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your favor of the 12th instant yesterday, 
at this place ; previous to which, about nine o clock 
Saturday morning, the signal at Fort Constitution being  given, and the masters of two sloops, which about 
the same time came to, opposite my house, having 
informed me that the enemy had attacked <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
the evening before, and that they judged, by the report of the cannon, that their shipping had passed by, 
and were up the river as far as King's Bridge, I 
thought it my duty to put the neighbouring militia in motion and accordingly issued orders to three regiments, one immediately to march into these works, 
another into Fort Constitution, and the third to rendezvous at Newburg, on the bank of the river, about 
nine miles above Fort Constitution, with orders to march and reenforce that garrison, upon the next signal given. 
</p><p>
At the same time I issued orders to all the regiments in my brigade, to stand ready to march on a moment's warning, and despatched expresses to all 
owners of sloops and boats twenty miles up the west side of the river, to haul them off so as to prevent their grounding ; that as many of them as were necessary might be ready to carry down the militia to 
the forts. The residue I ordered down to Fort Constitution, as I believe by drawing a chain of them across the narrowest part of the river, and fixing 
them properly to be set on fire, should the enemy's shipping attempt passing by, they would answer a most valuable purpose. Early in the afternoon of 
that day, I marched into Fort Constitution with about 
forty of my neighbours, and in the evening came to 
this fort, being nearer the enemy and better situated 
to discover their motions. Yesterday evening I was 
joined by Colonel Woodhull, with between two and 
three hundred of his regiment; this morning early, 
by Lieutenant-Colonel McClaghry, with upwards of 
five hundred of his ; and I hourly expect parts of 
two other regiments. When these join me, I will 
draft, out of the four, six hundred men, and employ 
them as your Excellency has directed. I have ordered 
the Colonels I have called in, to leave the frontier 
companies at home to protect the country against 
the Indians, should they be troublesome, and as many 
men out of each company as will be sufficient to 
guard against any attempts that might be made by 
internal enemies. 
</p><p>
The men turn out of their harvest fields, to defend 
their country, with surprising alacrity. The absence 
of so many of them, however, at this time, when their 
harvests are perishing for want of the sickle, will 
greatly distress the country. I could wish, therefore, 
a less number might answer the purpose. I would 
fain hope the enemy mean, by their shipping in our 
bays, at present only to cut off the communication 
between the country and city, and prevent our obstructing the channel. Many of the militia may be called in in eight hours ; some in a much less time, 
should there be occasion for them. 
</p><p>
Since writing the above, I received a letter from 
Colonel Hay, of Haverstraw, a copy of which is in 
closed. I will send a small party down there this 
evening, or in the morning, but don t believe I shall 
be able to continue them long, as the militia here 
will think hard to be carried there. The bearer, Mr. Boyd, who is well acquainted with this country, the 
fortifications here, and may be confided in, will be 
able to give your Excellency any further information. 
</p><p>
I am, with great esteem, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gec" rel="me">GEORGE CLINTON</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I should be glad to know whether it is best to keep the sloops, &c., ordered down to Fort 
Constitution, there, as it may be attended with considerable expense, which, however, if they can be 
made to answer a good purpose, ought not, in my opinion, to be regarded.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
When I had the pleasure of seeing your Excellency at Ramapo, I mentioned that the terms, for 
which the two militia regiments stationed at this 
post were engaged in service, expired the last of 
this month, at which time, unless a re enforcement is 
sent here by <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a>, the whole strength we 
shall have, at this important station, will be Colonel Dubois's regiment, two companies of artillery, and a 
detachment of about one hundred and fifty Continental troops under Lieutenant-Colonel Meigs. 
</p><p>
I have this day wrote to <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a> on the subject, that he may so order matters as to furnish a 
reinforcement to this garrison, if he shall judge it expedient. 
</p><p>
I have had a second call to attend at Kingston, 
and take the oath of office in consequence of my 
late appointment ; and as the new Legislature of this 
State are to meet on the 1st of August, it will be 
necessary that I shall leave this, so as to be there a 
day or two previous to their meeting. 
</p><p>
This I have also mentioned to <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a>, 
and requested leave of absence for an unlimited 
time, as the affairs of Government render it uncertain whether I shall be able, during the present campaign, to return to the command of this post. 
</p><p>
It is with a degree of pain that I am under a 
necessity of asking permission, at this time, to quit 
the service, especially as the designs of the enemy 
are not fully known ; and should the business of my 
new appointment admit of it, I will most cheerfully 
return to the army, until the fate of the present 
campaign is determined. I am, with much esteem, 
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Immediately on the receipt of your Excellency's 
letter, directing from one thousand to fifteen hundred 
of the militia of this and the State of Connecticut, 
to reenforce this garrison and the army under <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a>, I issued orders for drawing out eight 
hundred and ten, including non-commissioned officers, 
from this State, for the above purposes. Since which 
I have been induced, from the situation of our affairs 
to the northward, in addition to the above numbers, 
to order out five hundred of the militia from the northern parts of Ulster and Duchess counties, one 
thousand from the county of <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, and five hundred from the county of Try on, to reenforce the 
army under the command of <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>, and 
to continue in service until the first day of November next, unless your Excellency shall think proper 
to dismiss them before. Those from the two former 
counties, I have reason to believe, are by this time 
on their march, but I have not yet been advised 
what success they have experienced in getting the 
proportion allotted for the other counties. I fear, not 
so good as could be wished. The people in that 
quarter consider the Western frontier equally liable 
to the invasions of the enemy, and, influenced by 
this consideration, are unwilling to leave their families exposed, and join our army. As the enemy 
advance, many of the best of the inhabitants are 
employed in moving off their families and effects. 
Indeed, I have always observed that the militia of 
any part of the country most in danger, are, for the 
above reasons, least forward in opposing an enemy. 
Some, too, decline acting under those circumstances, 
from unworthy principles. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letter of the 1st instant, dated 
at Chester, I received in Kingston, on Wednesday 
last, and thereupon ordered four regiments of militia 
to this place, three to join <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a> at Peeks-kill, and one to occupy the post at the mouth of the 
Clove. The last of those ordered here arrived yesterday, and I learn from <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a>, that those 
designed for him are also arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>. All 
the remainder of the militia of the State are under 
marching orders. 
</p><p>
I never knew the militia come out with greater 
alacrity ; but as many of them yet have great part 
of their harvests in the field; I fear it will be difficult to detain them long, unless the enemy make 
some movements that indicate a design of coming 
this way suddenly, and so obvious as to be believed 
by the militia. I cannot but express my surprise 
that no reinforcements, as I have heard, have yet 
arrived to our northern army from the eastward. 
The want of confidence in the General Officers to 
the northward, is the specious reason. To me it appears a very weak one. The mutilated and distressed 
condition of this State renders our utmost exertions 
to oppose the common enemy, in appearance but 
little, better than one half of it being out of our possession. Common gratitude to a sister State, as well 
as duty to the Continent at large, conspire in calling 
on our eastern neighbours to step forth on this occasion, and more especially as they only are in a situation totally to destroy <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>'s army, by 
intercepting his supplies, and even cutting off his retreat to the Lakes. 
</p><p>
The detachment of eight hundred and ten for this 
garrison and <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> is not yet completed, owing 
to the body of the militia being so suddenly called 
out, but will be effected immediately on their return 
home ; till which time I will endeavour to detain an 
equal number of them here. 
</p><p>
I have not yet received the late resolves of congress for recruiting the army, alluded to in your Excellency's letter of the 4th instant. As soon as they 
come to hand, I will do every thing in my power 
to render them effectual, and forward the requested 
information. I am, with much esteem, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gec" rel="me">GEORGE CLINTON</a>.
