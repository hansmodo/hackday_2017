</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I was not honored with the receipt of your Excellency's letter of the 3d instant, before Friday last. I 
am truly sensible that the security of the North 
River is a matter of the utmost importance to the 
United States in the present war, and that the safety 
of this State in a more particular manner depends 
upon it. It gives me real concern, therefore, that so 
little has been yet done to effect it. Works we laid 
out, and began, to defend the chevaux-de-frise, and 
something was done towards finishing and sinking 
such of them as were not completed when the enemy 
came up the river; and these are the only steps that 
have hitherto been taken. 
</p><p>
When the enemy left the river, it was my opinion 
that as many of the troops from the Northern Department should be sent to reenforce the Grand Army 
under your Excellency's more immediate command, as 
could be possibly spared ; that no greater number 
should be left in this quarter than what would be 
barely sufficient to cover the country, which is more 
immediately exposed to the ravages of the enemy ; to 
amuse them from sending large reinforcements to 
General Howe ; and to carry on the necessary works 
for the security of the river. One brigade of Continental troops, with the militia then in service, and 
such of this State as I should be able to call out, I 
conceived fully sufficient for the purposes. Two small 
New Hampshire militia regiments, which were sent 
down from the northward by <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>, about 
seventy Connecticut militia, and those of Colonel Dubois's, who escaped from Fort Montgomery, and a 
regiment of militia of this State, were assigned for 
the works. The rest of the troops, consisting of 
General Warner's brigade of militia (which arrived 
earliest), General Parsons's brigade, and some Connecticut militia, were drawn off to King's Street and 
the adjacent neighbourhood on the Sound, under the 
immediate command of <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a>. 
</p><p>
It was late before the militia from the northward 
arrived, and they were worn out with the fatigues of 
the campaign and their long march hither. The time 
for which they were engaged in the service expired 
the 1st of this month, and of those of this State the 
15th; and while they were with us, the want of tools 
and materials was such as to prevent their being employed to any degree of advantage. Dubois's regiment are the only troops on the spot at present, 
which are by no means sufficient to mount the necessary guards. Of course the works are entirely 
neglected. 
</p><p>
The resolutions of Congress, of the 5th of November, for regaining the forts and passes on Hudson's 
River, and securing the communication thereof, vested 
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> with such ample powers for drawing 
supplies of men and materials from New Jersey, and 
the different States eastward, that something essential 
might yet have been done towards the completion of 
this important business before the opening of the 
spring, would he have taken upon himself the direction of it. But, as I understand that gentleman pro 
poses taking his seat at the Board of War, agreeably 
to his late appointment, those resolutions, as they apply to him particularly, will lose their intended effect ; 
and, though I learn by a letter I received from <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a>, accompanying that from your Excellency, 
that he is directed to turn his views in future to this 
object, yet, however capable he may be for the task, 
I fear he will fall short in the execution of it, unless 
he shall be able to command the same aids, at least, 
which <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> was empowered to do. 
</p><p>
I am clearly of the opinion, that a strong fortress 
ought to be erected either on the opposite side of 
the creek from where Fort Montgomery stood, or 
at <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, opposite Port Constitution. The latter I prefer, as the most defensible ground, and be 
cause the navigation of the river there is more difficult and uncertain, and the river something narrower 
than it is at the former place. A new chain should 
be procured, if possible, and with the boom, which is 
nearly completed, stretched across the river. This, 
with a floating battery or two, and some gun-boats, 
I am persuaded, would answer the purpose effectually; 
and in this 6 pinion I am confirmed, as the enemy 
chose to risk every thing for the reduction of Fort 
Montgomery, rather than to attempt passing it with 
their shipping, while in our possession. If <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a> 
should be the place fixed upon, it might be of 
great advantage to erect a small strong work on the 
high point on the opposite shore, a little above Fort 
Constitution. 
</p><p>
As to the management in this department, of which 
your Excellency desires my sentiments, I am con 
strained to say (but I wish it may be considered as in 
confidence) we have either been very unfortunate, or 
it has not been as wise as might be wished. Prudent 
management of our small force, in my humble opinion, would have saved the forts, though, perhaps, 
with the far less important loss of the Continental 
Village. By losing the forts, the Village fell, of course. 
It is true a few stores were moved from thence, and 
saved, but I dare say not of equal value with those 
lost at the forts, exclusive of the shipping. Besides, 
had we held the forts, we should have commanded 
the navigation of the river, and drove the enemy to 
the necessity of attempting to relieve Burgoyne (for 
it is evident that this was their intention) by land, 
in which case it might have been in our power, by 
calling the militia to our assistance, to have destroyed 
Clinton's whole army. Indeed, without opposition they 
could not have effected a march in season for the in 
tended purpose, and I am confident they never would 
have attempted it. 
</p><p>
I never considered <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>, or the Village, posts 
of great importance, only as they stood connected 
with the defens of the river ; for, without the latter, 
the enemy could, by landing above, come in the rear of the former, in which case they must fall, of course. 
The event has fully proved this. Notwithstanding, 
the chief part of this department were kept idle at 
<a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> and the Village, while the forts were left 
without a sufficient number of men to carry on and 
complete the works, or defend them. If the shipping had been properly manned, and this was often solicited,, the Congress, at least, might have been saved ; 
and even after the loss of the forts, by a prudent 
disposition of the force in this quarter, which was 
soon greatly increased by the coming in of the militia, <a href='/results.php?city=kingston' rel='city'>Kingston</a> might have been saved, and the greater 
part of the mischief, committed by the enemy along 
the shores of the river, prevented. 
</p><p>
A constant intercourse, which has been permitted 
between the country and city, by flags, has, I fear, 
been very injurious, as well by frequently enabling 
the enemy to learn our strength, as otherwise, without 
our being able to derive similar advantages from such 
correspondence. I have heard that there has been a 
weekly exchange of newspapers with Governor Tryon, 
and that the printers, Gaine and London, are permit 
ted the like liberty. The latter I have no doubt of. 
An over share of complaisance and indulgence to the 
disaffected, (which, though arising from principles of 
benevolence and humanity, will always create jea 
lousies and unfavorable suspicions, especially among 
the common people, and often even reach the army,) 
should, therefore, be carefully avoided. In these respects, I cannot help thinking there has been a want 
of common prudence. I have taken the liberty of 
hinting my sentiments of these matters to General 
Putnam, and I would fain hope that there may be 
more circumspection used in future. 
</p><p>
The Legislature of this State is to meet at this 
place on the 5th of next month. The variety of important business to be prepared for their consideration, and other affairs of government, will employ so 
great a part of my time, that I should not be able 
to give that attention to the works for the security 
of the river, as their importance, and the short time 
in which they ought to be completed, require. But 
you may rest assured, Sir, that every leisure hour shall be faithfully devoted to them, and my advice 
and assistance shall not, for any consideration, be 
withheld from the person who shall be intrusted with 
the chief direction of them. I have the honor to be, 
with the most sincere esteem and respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have received your letter of the 23d instant, 
inclosing one to <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>, which I immediately forwarded to him. I am sensible that, however 
distressing the situation of our western frontier may 
be, your Excellency has taken every method to afford it security that is in your power, consistent 
with the general good of the service. I would not 
wish, therefore, that any representation of mine should 
occasion a diminution of your present force ; and, as 
Colonel Graham's regiment is composed of men who 
are intimately acquainted with every part of the 
country between the enemy's lines and yours, and 
may be of peculiar service where they now are, I 
would beg leave to submit to your Excellency's further consideration, whether it would not be most advisable to continue it with you at present; in which 
case, I will endeavour to call out a larger proportion 
of the militia for the defence of the frontiers. This, 
I think, the militia ought cheerfully to submit to, as, 
if they were not required for that service, it would 
be but reasonable that they should march to reenforce the army under your Excellency's immediate 
command. 
</p><p>
I have already ordered out one fourth part of the 
militia of Orange and Ulster to the western frontier 
of those counties, who will amount to near six hundred men, and have directed them to take their stations so as to secure the most important passes leading into the settlements. If they do this, and are 
vigilant, I trust that part of the country will experience a degree of safety. In addition to this, I have 
issued positive orders to Brigadier-General Ten Broeck, 
and the commanding officers of the several regiments 
in Tryon county, to detach one fourth of their militia 
(such regiments as may be necessary for the safety 
of the northern frontier excepted) for the protection 
of the western frontier in that quarter, and to act 
under and assist Colonel Butler in any offensive operations which may be thought necessary to be carried on by him against the enemy. 
</p><p>
Colonel Butler (whose march, on receiving the intelligence I lately transmitted to your Excellency, I 
wished to be hastened) was this morning at New 
Windsor, and will proceed directly to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, and 
from thence to Schoharie or Cherry Valley, as General Stark (whose department he will then be in) 
shall direct; and, if joined by Alden's regiment, and 
the detachment of militia which I have ordered out, 
they will form a pretty respectable force in that 
quarter. In the mean time, if I should receive any 
new intelligence that may render its augmentation 
necessary, it shall immediately be communicated to 
your Excellency. I propose, if nothing extraordinary 
happens to prevent it, to do myself the pleasure of 
waiting on your Excellency next week. I am, with 
the highest esteem and respect,

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have had the honor of receiving your Excellency's letters of the 4th and 6th instant, and am 
happy in being thereby enabled to give such general 
assurances of protection to the frontier inhabitants as, 
I have reason to hope, will prevent their deserting 
their settlements. This your Excellency may be as 
sured will be done, with the utmost regard to that 
secrecy which is necessary to insure success in offensive operations ; and, therefore, the greatest care 
will be taken not to give them the most remote idea 
of any such intention. 
The Legislature, before they adjourned, empowered 
me to embody one thousand men for the defence of the 
northern and western frontiers, or such other service 
as I should judge proper to employ them in. This 
was the most they conceived the State, under its 
present distressed situation, was able to raise ; and 
the greater part of them were intended to join the 
troops to be employed in defensive operations against 
the savages. Since the rising of the Legislature, I 
have received the resolve of Congress for filling up 
the Continental battalions ; and this will put me under the necessity of taking at least one half of these 
levies for the purpose, as it would be impracticable 
to convene the Legislature in season to make any 
new provision for that service, even though our circumstances would admit of it. 
</p><p>
I do not imagine we shall be able to derive any 
considerable force from the inhabitants, whose settlements have been destroyed. Their losses and consequent distresses are so great, that it requires the ut 
most industry to support their families ; and the pay 
in the army, considering the depreciated state of our currency, would not be competent for this purpose. 
The most of their young men are already engaged in 
the Continental battalions. Some, however, from a desire of revenge for their losses, will, at all events, 
engage ; and the neighbourhoods that have been less 
distressed will furnish a considerable proportion, who, 
being as well acquainted with the country, will be 
equally serviceable. 
</p><p>
In order to deceive the enemy into a belief that 
we intend acting on the defensive only, I submit to 
your Excellency the propriety of erecting one or two 
small posts on the nearest navigable waters of the 
Susquehanna, They would not only answer the 
above purpose, but serve also as a security to the 
settlements, and, of course, induce the militia to engage in the service with greater alacrity. I am not 
sufficiently acquainted with the country to determine with certainty the particular places best calculated 
for such posts ; but, from the general idea I have of 
the country, I am led to believe that Unadilla, and 
where the Susquehanna empties out of the Lakes 
west of Cherry Valley, would be the most eligible. 
These posts might be maintained by militia, at least 
while the other troops were employed in offensive 
operations. I have the honor to be, with the highest esteem and regard, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I was honored with your Excellency's confidential 
letter of the 3d instant on the 12th, at <a href='/results.php?city=kingston' rel='city'>Kingston</a>, 
whither I was called by an alarm on the frontiers 
of Ulster county, occasioned by the appearance of 
about one hundred Indians and Tories, at Shendeacon, a small settlement in the gorge of the mountains, 
about twenty miles west of <a href='/results.php?city=kingston' rel='city'>Kingston</a>, and twelve 
from Marbletown. They were joined at this place by 
twenty-seven Tories from the east of Hudson's River. 
mostly Hessian deserters from the Convention troops. 
The sudden assembling of the militia deterred them 
from penetrating farther into the country, and prevented them from doing any material injury. 
</p><p>
It is needless to remark to your Excellency, that 
the execution of military business by militia officers 
is (from the want of activity and knowledge) seldom 
attended with the necessary despatch. Add to this, 
the raising of the levies for the defence of the fron 
tiers, and for filling up the Continental battalions, 
has been unavoidably much interrupted and retarded, 
in the frontier regiments, by almost continual alarms, 
since the departure of Colonel Cortlandt's regiment 
from the former station. I have, therefore, found it 
necessary to order the levies in this county to rendezvous on the western frontiers of Ulster and Orange 
counties, to serve as a cover to the settlements, and 
to afford the militia leisure to make their drafts. The 
officer who commands them has orders, the moment 
this is accomplished, to forward such part of them as 
are to be annexed to the Continental battalions, with 
such additional number as can be spared, consistent 
with the security of the frontier settlements in that 
quarter, to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, by detachments, without the least 
delay. From the best information I have been able 
to obtain, there is a collection of Indians (consisting 
of those who are called Esopus Indians and other 
stragglers) and Tories, at Shohawken and Kollitye, 
on the Delaware, at one of which places it is said 
they have erected a block-house, or some other small 
works of defence. Our accounts were, that they consisted of upwards of one hundred, and we have the 
best evidence of their having been lately joined by a very considerable additional number of Tories and 
deserters. It is this banditti, that have committed 
the most of the mischiefs which have been done in 
the counties of Ulster and Orange, and have occasioned all the late distressing alarms. They are supplied 
with provisions from the different settlements on the 
Delaware by the disaffected inhabitants who live on 
the frontiers. They are perfectly acquainted with the 
back country, and, I am apprehensive, will be very 
troublesome, by rendering the supplies to our western 
army precarious, and by keeping the back settlements 
in perpetual apprehensions of danger. 
</p><p>
The amazing tract of uninhabited and mountainous 
country, which lies between the intended route of 
our army and the western settlements, will afford 
them a secure asylum, as long as they can procure 
provisions. I would therefore submit to your Excellency the propriety of marching a body of men into 
these parts, sufficiently large to scour that country, 
and rout the enemy there, and destroy the settlements which feed and harbour them. As these settlements are scattered and remote from each other, 
and as the enemy may be succoured from the contiguous Indian settlements on the Suscjuehanna, not 
less than five hundred men will be competent to 
perform this business effectually. If the measure is 
approved by your Excellency, I will most readily 
furnish that number from the militia for this short 
service, and undertake to conduct the business my 
self. Nothing will be wanted, but the means of 
transporting about ten days or two weeks provision, 
and some other little matters from the Quarter-master's department, which cannot be obtained otherwise, 
and which, I presume, may be spared from thence, 
without inconveniency, for so short a period. The 
horses wanted may either be impressed in the country by the Quarter-master, or, if purchased, returned 
before the campaign is fairly opened on the sea-coast. 
I am the more desirous of having this business 
accomplished, as it will relieve the inhabitants of the 
frontier settlements from any farther apprehensions of 
danger, and induce many, who have already abandoned 
their farms, to return to them, and also enable us to 
spare a greater proportion of the levies, raised for 
the defence of the frontiers, who are now stationed 
at the different passes, where they at best afford but a very partial security, for active service. It may 
be thought most advisable to delay the matter until 
the army, intended for the western service, begin to 
move ; in which case this may serve as a favorable 
diversion. The intermediate time may be only sufficient to get out the men and make the necessary 
preparations. I have the honor to be, with the most 
perfect respect and esteem, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have to acknowledge the receipt of your Excellency's favors of the 26th ultimo and 12th instant. 
Two days before the former came to hand, I received 
the act of Congress respecting the troops proposed to 
be raised for the defence of our frontiers. Some considerable time will necessarily elapse before they can 
be embodied ; and, as the enemy have already appeared at different times and places on the northern and 
western frontiers, I am very apprehensive that, in 
the interim, the more remote settlements will be 
abandoned. Every measure will be used to expedite 
this business, and your Excellency will have the earliest information of the disposition which, in consequence of your letter, I shall cause to be made of 
these levies. 
</p><p>
The act of Congress, of the 26th of last month, respecting the quotas of supplies for the army, to be 
furnished by the different States, was not received 
until some days after the rising of the Legislature. 
This, together with some other important matters 
from Congress, has induced me to call them together 
at an earlier day than that to which they stand adjourned; and I have accordingly issued my proclamation for convening them at <a href='/results.php?city=kingston' rel='city'>Kingston</a> on the 9th of 
next month, when this business will be submitted 
to their consideration. In the mean time, I think it 
my duty to inform your Excellency, that, in consequence of the several laws which have been enacted 
for obtaining supplies of provision and forage for the 
army, this State is so exhausted, that I am persuaded there is not more grain and meal left in possession of the farmers, than a bare competency for the 
support of its inhabitants until the new crop comes 
in ; and with respect to forage, few of the farmers 
have a sufficiency to bring their stock through until 
grass. Should, therefore, the present supplies, besides 
what are already in the hands of the public officers, 
be wanted before harvest, they are not to be had in 
this State. I should have written to your Excellency 
earlier on this subject, but I did not receive your letter until a few days ago. I have the honor to be, 
with the highest sentiments of respect and esteem, 
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letter of the 10th instant, ad 
dressed to Lieutenant-Governor Cortlandt, was delivered to me yesterday evening, and I immediately for 
warded, by express, your letter to Brigadier-General 
James Clinton, and urged him to the utmost expedition in his march to <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>. I inclose your Excellency a copy of a letter from my brother, of 
the 10th instant, giving the particular disposition of 
the regiments of his brigade, by which it appears, 
that Colonel Gansevoort's was employed in escorting a supply of provisions to Fort Schuyler. As this appeared to me to be a business of too much importance to admit of delay, or be intrusted to the care 
of a weak party, I have therefore taken the liberty 
of advising him to continue this regiment on that 
service until it shall be accomplished, which, I hope, 
will meet your Excellency's approbation. 
</p><p>
I am apprehensive that the other three regiments 
(they having, previous to the receipt of your Excellency's order, marched to the respective stations mentioned in my brother's letter) will not be able to 
reach <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a> on as early a day as might have 
been expected. The militia, in the vicinity of the 
posts in the Highlands, were, before I left <a href='/results.php?city=poughkeepsie' rel='city'>Poughkeepsie</a>, put under orders to hold themselves in constant readiness to take the field on the shortest notice ; and, on the signals of alarm being given, those 
on the west side of the river are to repair to West 
Point, and those on the east side are to rendezvous 
at <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a>, and there wait for further orders. Of this 
I apprised General Howe at the time. I now write 
to him on the subject; and, if it should be thought 
necessary by your Excellency, I will immediately 
order such part of them to <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a> as your Excellency or General Howe may direct, until the arrival of <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel=''>General Clinton</a>'s brigade. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's several letters of the 23d and 
28th ultimo, and 2d instant, were received and opened by Lieutenant-Governor Cortlandt, in my absence, 
and such of them as were proper to be communicated to the Legislature, with the letters from the 
Committee of Congress, of the 25th ultimo, were laid 
before them; and I am happy in being able to as 
sure your Excellency, that they give me reason to 
hope that they will yield a compliance with the requisitions made of this State, on this important occa 
sion, except in the article of forage, of which this 
State is entirely exhausted. 
</p><p>
The moment I closed my last letter to General 
Schuyler, which has been communicated to your Excellency, I embarked for <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, with an intention 
to intercept the enemy, under Sir John Johnson, in 
their retreat from Tryon county, or to succour Fort 
Schuyler, if invested, which I then apprehended might 
have been the case. On my arrival at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, I soon 
had reason to believe that the report of a force having marched against that post was merely calculated 
to favor Sir John Johnson's incursion ; and, as the 
militia had collected, he had retired about six miles 
from Johnstown, and was preparing to return to Canada by a route more northward than that by which 
he entered the country. I therefore directed Colonel 
Van Schaick, who was at Fort Hunter, to march for 
ward and hang close upon and harass his rear, to 
afford time for me to gain his front with the militia, 
to the north of <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, which I expected to be able 
to effect, by striking into Jessup's Patent from Fort Edward. But, before my letter reached Colonel Van Schaick, the militia in that quarter, being out of 
provisions, and finding Sir John retiring, were returning home, which was also the case with those who 
assembled, and I expected to find at <a href='/results.php?city=fort edward' rel='city'>Fort Edward</a>. 
</p><p>
Under these circumstances, I found it necessary to 
alter my plan, to that of passing Lake George, and 
meeting the enemy on the borders of Lake Champlain, which (as the enemy appeared to be much 
fatigued by their long march, and it was to be presumed would move slow as soon as they were advanced such a distance as to conceive themselves out 
of danger) I conceived might still be practicable. I 
accordingly reassembled the militia, and, with the 
levies stationed at <a href='/results.php?city=fort edward' rel='city'>Fort Edward</a>, and a detachment of 
Warner's regiment, crossed Lake George. But, though 
I had a force, superior to that of the enemy, advanced as far as Bulwagger's Bay, below Crown Point, 
the place at which the enemy embarked, within eight 
days after my leaving this place, I was so unfortunate as to find (judging by the information of our scouts, and by the appearance of the bushes and 
bark the enemy had prepared to hut themselves, but 
did not put up, and by other marks as well as the 
sailing of their vessels) we were about six hours too 
late. 
</p><p>
I would fain hope, however, that the attempt, though 
unsuccessful, may be attended with the good effect 
of deterring the enemy from a similar enterprise, as 
it will, at least, discover to them the danger which 
may attend it. I think it my duty to inform your Excellency that, on my request, I was joined by a 
party of two hundred and forty of the militia of the 
Grants, under Colonel Warner and Major Allen, whose 
behaviour on this occasion, in every respect, was very 
agreeable to me. I beg your Excellency will pardon me in troubling you with this long detail, as I 
wish it only to be received as an apology for not 
succeeding in an attempt which I gave you reason to 
believe was practicable, and which undoubtedly might 
have been effected had I found matters in the train 
I had reason to expect. I have the honor to be, 
with the greatest respect and esteem, dear Sir, 
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Immediately after our late misfortune at Fort Montgomery, I 
wrote the Legislature of this State the particulars, requesting 
them, without delay, to forward them to you. My hurry, at that 
time, and since, prevented my answering your favor of the 4th 
instant until now ; since which, the enemy have taken possession 
of Fort Constitution, and are, at this time, riot far below the clievaux-dc-frise. 
My guards fell in with, and took two spies from General Clin 
ton, going to Burgoyne. One of them confessed, that his orders 
were to make all possible despatch, and inform <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a> that he had got Fort Montgomery, the key of America, and that 
he was prepared to weigh the chevaux-de-frise ; and that he, Burgoyne, might now proceed, as all obstacles in the river were re 
moved, lie further says, that Clinton is determined to push up 
the river to relieve Burgoyne from his present difficulty. The 
inclosed confession of Taylor will give you some idea of their 
past manoeuvres and future intentions. 
</p><p>
If I have been rightly informed, your army is now so numerous that you can with safety order a part of it to establish a 
post at, or this side, <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>. In that case, if they move up, 
<a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a>, who is collecting a large body of the Connecti 
cut militia on the opposite shore, will be able to join them. I 
shall endeavour to keep between them and your army, with two 
Continental regiments and some militia; and I hope, by this 
means, to keep them from <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>. Indeed, I am sure it can 
be done, provided you establish a post on this side for us to 
retire to. I cannot, at present, ascertain the number lost at Fort 
Montgomery. My brother, <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel=''>General Clinton</a>, who received a wound 
in his thigh, with a number of other officers, and two hundred of 
Dubois's regiment, made their escape after the enemy were in 
possession of the fort, and have come in safe. 
</p><p>
"We have just received intelligence that General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> 
attacked the enemy, last Saturday, on Chestnut Hill, near <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, defeated, and drove them through Germantown. Night 
coming on, he withdrew, and renewed the attack early on Sunday 
morning, and had gained the victory.* We have as yet received 
no authenticated accounts of the action. 
</p><p>
Colonel Lamb, and most of his officers who were with me at 
the fort, also escaped.

I am, dear Sir, &c.,

SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your favor of the 16th. I am sorry to inform you, 
that by a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>, of the 15th, the enemy had 
not surrendered. You do me the honor to ask my opinion respecting your future movements. It is needless and impossible 
for me to advise; because, having once settled our plan and 
afterwards deviated from it, the concerting any future measures 
might be productive of ruin to one of us, if deprived of those 
succours and that support, which form a part of the general plan 
of operations. My opinion of your attack at King's Bridge is, 
that it will be utterly inefficacious. 
</p><p>
For the rest, as your operations must be governed by circum 
stances, I can only inform you of facts. <a href='/results.php?city=kingston' rel='city'>Kingston</a> was burnt yesterday afternoon, because I had not troops to defend it. Two 
prisoners tell me that <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> is the enemy's object. If I ad 
vance much farther northward, it will be in the power of the 
enemy to ruin my little corps by landing above and below me, 
as I shall then have the Catskill Mountains to the west, and 
Hudson's River to the east. I expect every instant to hear that 
Rhinebeck is in flames. I have the honor to be, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gec" rel="me">GEORGE CLINTON</a>. 
P. S. I trust you must have received <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>'s letter 
of the 13th, of which he sent me a copy, in which he approves 
of the plan of removing our armies up the river on each side.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I am favored with yours of this date. I flattered myself I 
should have had the pleasure of seeing you ere now, as, when I 
left <a href='/results.php?city=kingston' rel='city'>Kingston</a>, it was my principal business ; and, though it was 
dark when I crossed the river, I reached <a href='/results.php?city=poughkeepsie' rel='city'>Poughkeepsie</a> that 
night, when in hopes to have overtaken you there, but was too 
late, as you had left that the preceding day. Ever since I have 
been here, I have been so unwell as not to dare venture out, 
considering the badness of the weather; but the moment the rain 
ceases, I will set out for your quarters. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>, in his letter of the 24th instant, gives me rea 
son to believe a large part of his army are on the move down 
each side of the river. Part of them had reached Hurley yesterday. He supposed the enemy yet to be up the river near <a href='/results.php?city=red hook' rel='city'>Red Hook</a>, and intended to retake Fort Montgomery before they 
could get down to reenforce it. For this purpose he was for 
warding a considerable train of artillery, and asked an interview 
with me at Coeyman's, this side of <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, yesterday. I could 
not attend then for the reasons above, but wrote him, informing 
him of the different situation of the enemy, which will, of course, 
alter his intended plan. At the same time I suggested it as my 
opinion, that the enemy would not now attempt any thing capi 
l up the river this season, but detach their main force to 
strengthen Howe at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, to which grand scene we undoubtedly ought to turn our chief attention, for on our successes there every thing worth regarding depends. 
Yours, sincerely,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I arrived here about noon, when I met your favor of the 25th 
instant. My letter of the 20th, informing you of the enemy's 
fleet having fallen down below <a href='/results.php?city=new windsor' rel='city'>New Windsor</a>, must have reached 
you before this. I have, therefore, only to add, that the enemy 
have demolished Fort Montgomery, and all the other posts in the 
Highlands, and moved down with their whole force towards New 
York ; and to ask how I am to dispose of the troops belonging 
to your department, which you have been so good as to place 
under my direction. As it is probable <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a> may 
think it prudent to make an attempt against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, I am 
the more anxious to have your directions in this respect, that I 
may govern myself accordingly. I am, with the highest esteem 
and respect, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gec" rel="me">GEORGE CLINTON</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. Your troops had not reached <a href='/results.php?city=new windsor' rel='city'>New Windsor</a> yet. The 
last I heard of them, they were at <a href='/results.php?city=kingston' rel='city'>Kingston</a>, since which, to this 
day, I believe the weather has prevented their moving.
