</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I wrote your Excellency from <a href='/results.php?city=poughkeepsie' rel='city'>Poughkeepsie</a> on 
Saturday last, and communicated to you the accounts 
which I had then received from this quarter. The 
next day I set out for this place, and arrived here 
on Monday. Upon my arrival, I found the main 
body of the enemy, which appeared in the northward, 
had returned by the way of Lake George ; and that 
part of the country seemed again to be in a state of 
tranquillity. Yesterday morning, however, I was informed that a party had made its appearance at Ballston, and destroyed some buildings there ; and, about 
noon, received accounts that the enemy were at Schoharie, and it is now confirmed that they have destroyed the whole of that valuable settlement. Their 
numbers of one division are computed at about six 
hundred, and the accounts of the other division are 
uncertain. They have artillery with them. Major 
Woolsey, who commands two hundred of the levies, 
made a sally from one of the small forts there, and 
took two regulars and killed five savages. By what 
route they came, or mean to return, I have not been 
able to ascertain. Yesterday morning I ordered General Van Rensselaer, with some troops, to Schenectady, with directions, as soon as he could make the proper discoveries, and if his force should appear competent, to march and endeavour to intercept them. 
</p><p>
By a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a> at <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>, I 
am informed that the enemy yesterday burnt the 
settlement of white Creek, in Charlotte county; and 
the smoke was discoverable from the heights, near 
his house. 
</p><p>
The post at <a href='/results.php?city=fort edward' rel='city'>Fort Edward</a>, after the removal of The 
stores, is evacuated, the levies, who were stationed 
there, having insisted that their time of service is 
expired ; and Colonel Livingston, the commanding officer, with the other officers, are now on their return. 
I have ordered out the whole of the militia from this 
part of the State. A considerable part are already 
in the field, and I shall leave this immediately for 
Schenectady, in order to make the necessary arrangement. 
</p><p>
From this state of matters, your Excellency will 
perceive the necessity of sending a force, if it can 
possibly be spared, for the defence of this part of the 
country. No dependence can be placed on the militia remaining from home, and the three months' levies 
will soon be dismissed ; so that, without some farther 
protection, Schenectady and this place will be our 
frontier. I received no intelligence from the Grants, 
either whether the enemy have done any mischief 
there, or whether their militia is turning for our assistance. 
</p><p>
am, &c.,

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My last letter was dated at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, and communicated the disagreeable intelligence of the destruction 
of Schoharie, and part of Ballstown, about twelve 
miles north-east of Schenectady ; since which I have 
not been able to write to your Excellency. 
</p><p>
As I then proposed, I immediately left <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, in 
order to take the necessary measures for checking 
the further incursions of the enemy. On my arrival 
at Schenectady, I was advised that the different parties of the enemy at Schoharie and Ballstown, had 
left those places ; the former moving towards the 
Mohawk River, and the latter shaping their course 
towards Sacondaga. General Van. Rensselaer, who had 
arrived at Schenectady before me, and with orders to 
act according to emergencies, on receiving this intelligence immediately moved up the river, in hopes of 
being able to gain their front ; but this proved impracticable, as their route was much shorter, and their 
troops more inured to marching. They reached the 
river at the confluence of the Schoharie Kill, about 
six miles ahead of him, and, in that fertile country, 
recommenced their devastations by burning the houses, 
and with marks of the greatest barbarity, destroying 
every thing in their way. 
</p><p>
Under these circumstances I was exceedingly perplexed. The militia, under General Van Rensselaer, 
were inferior in number to that of the enemy; the 
few I had with me were too far in the rear to sustain them ; and not much could be expected from the 
militia of the country through which the enemy passed, their whole attention being engaged in the preservation of their families ; and the levies were necessarily very much dispersed at the different posts, 
to cover the frontier settlements against the incursions of small parties. General Van Rensselaer, however, continued to move on, and, being soon after 
joined by Colonel Dubois, with between three hundred and four hundred levies, and sixty of the Oneida Indians, pursued the enemy with vigor. He came 
up with them at Fox's Mills, about twenty-six miles 
from where the enemy first struck the river, about 
sunset, and attacked them. After a considerable resistance they gave way, and fled with precipitation, 
leaving behind them their baggage, provisions, and a 
brass three-pounder, with its ammunition. 
</p><p>
The night came on too soon for us to avail ourselves of all The advantages which we had reason to 
promise ourselves from this action. The enemy took 
advantage of passing the river at a ford, a little 
above the place of action, where they again collected, and renewed their march up the river with great 
celerity ; and it became necessary for our troops, who 
had marched upwards of thirty miles without halting, 
to retire from the ground to refresh themselves. The 
pursuit was, however, renewed early in the morning, 
and the enemy so closely pushed, as to prevent their 
doing any further mischief The morning after the 
action, I arrived with the militia under my immediate command, but they were so beat out with fatigue, 
having marched at least fifty miles in less than twenty-four hours, as to be unable to proceed any further. 
I therefore left them, and put myself at the head of 
the advanced troops, and continued the pursuit to 
within about fifteen miles of Oneida -, and, if we could 
possibly have procured provisions to have continued 
the pursuit a day or two longer, there is little doubt 
that we might have succeeded so far as to have scattered their main body, and made many prisoners. 
But there were no supplies but such as I was obliged 
to take from the inhabitants on our route, and these 
were inadequate, and the collection of them attended 
with delay ; nor were the pack-horses, with the small 
quantities procured in this disagreeable manner, able 
to overtake us, in so rapid a march through a perfect 
wilderness. I was therefore obliged, though reluctantly, to return, most of the troops having been near 
two days utterly destitute, and unable to proceed. 
</p><p>
Sir John, Brant, and Butler, immediately after the 
action at Fox's Mills, left their troops, and with a 
party of Indians, on horseback, struck across the 
country, and went towards Oneida, taking their wounded with them. We discovered where they joined their main body again, near the waters of the 
Susquehanna, about six miles on this side, where we 
quitted the pursuit. Brant was wounded through 
the foot. The enemy's force under Sir John, from 
the best account I have been able to collect, amounted to seven hundred and fifty picked troops, from the 
tenth and thirty-fourth British regiments, Hessian Yagers, Sir John's corps, Butler's rangers, and Brant's 
corps of Indians and Tories, and the party that appeared at Ballstown, of about two hundred, chiefly 
British; and, by some accounts, it appears they intended to form a junction at Johnstown. 
</p><p>
In the different skirmishes, a considerable number 
of the enemy were killed ; the exact amount I am 
not able to ascertain. We have taken about forty 
prisoners, recovered most of those they had taken 
from us at Schoharie and other places, with the negroes, cattle, and plunder. Our principal loss is Colonel Brown, of the Bay levies. He, by false intelligence, was led into the fire of the whole body of 
the enemy, and fell, with thirty-nine of his and the 
militia and levies of this State; and two were made 
prisoners. 
</p><p>
The accounts I formerly transmitted your Excellency, respecting the enemy to the northward, are, as 
far as I have since been able to learn, nearly true. 
The little post and garrison of Fort Ann, appears to 
me to have been surrendered through treachery or 
cowardice. Captain Chipman, commanding officer at 
Fort George, having, on the first alarm, sent out his 
whole garrison (supposing the enemy to consist of 
only about thirty Indians and Tories) except fourteen men, obtained a very honorable capitulation before he could be induced to surrender. 
The injuries we have sustained, by these different 
incursions of the enemy, will be most severely felt. 
They have destroyed, on a moderate computation, two 
hundred dwellings and one hundred and fifty thousand 
bushel's of wheat, with a proportion of other grain 
and forage. 
</p><p>
The enemy to the northward continue in the neighbourhood of Crown Point ; and the inhabitants, in consequence of their apprehension of danger, are removing from the northern parts of the State. Colonel Gansevoort, by the advice of General Ten Broeck, 
marched to cover that part of the country, and Colonel Wiessenfels has since marched to Schenectady, 
where his regiment will continue to escort a sufficient 
supply of provisions to Fort Schuyler, a very inconsiderable part of which is as yet provided; and unless 
particular attention is paid to this business, as the 
season for water transportation in the course of a 
month will be over, and it will be impossible to forward supplies by land, the post must, in the course 
of the winter, be abandoned. The levies incorporated 
into this regiment, whose times expire about the 
middle of December, were immediately to march to 
Fort Herkimer, to keep open the communication of 
Fort Schuyler with the country. This regiment, with 
the others of this State, are so exceedingly destitute 
in point of clothing, notwithstanding every attempt 
of the State to supply them, that I could have 
wished some other regiment, better provided against 
the severe climate, had been ordered to garrison on 
that post, especially as I find, from this consideration, 
and because the troops of this State conceive it an 
hardship constantly to perform that duty, it is become extremely disagreeable to them. 
</p><p>
I forgot to mention, that, when we arrived at Fort Herkimer, a letter was despatched to Major Hughs, 
commanding at Fort Schuyler, giving him an account 
of the force and route of the enemy, and of their 
boats lying at Onondaga Lake, that he might, if he 
found it consistent "with the safety of his garrison, 
send out a small party to annoy the enemy on their 
march. By his letter to Colonel Malcom, I find he 
despatched a party of sixty men for this purpose, 
with orders to use the utmost precaution against surprise, or any thing that might prevent their returning 
to the Fort. Since my return from <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> a report 
prevails, that this party were ambushed by the enemy, and defeated ; but from Major Hughs's cautious 
orders, and as I have no official accounts, I do not 
credit it. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gec" rel="me">George Clinton</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. The enemy brought with them two brass 
mortars for four-and-three-quarter shells, which they 
concealed on their route from Schoharie. From some 
discoveries, we are in hopes of finding them.

</p><p>
Reflecting, with a most sincere satisfaction, on the 
marks of confidence which you have so repeatedly bestowed upon the Government of this State, we esteem 
it incumbent on us to afford your Excellency the perusal of a letter which we have addressed to Congress, a copy whereof we have the honor to inclose. 
Minute as we have been in a detail of our distresses, they fall far short of those we at this instant 
actually experience. Since we despatched the letter to 
Congress, petitions have been presented to us from 
every quarter of the frontiers, claiming protection, and 
entreating us, if we cannot afford it, in some degree, 
immediately, and during the campaign more effectually, to advise them of it, that they may take the 
advantage of the snow to remove their families and 
effects to the interior part of the State. Whilst these 
applications were under consideration, in order to devise the means of relief for those unhappy people, the 
enemy have commenced their barbarities, and butchered some of the inhabitants in Tryon county, numbers of whom, impelled by apprehensions too well 
founded, are already moving, and the remainder preparing to follow. In the dilemma to which this calamity has reduced us, we wish, in order to prevent 
a total depopulation of the best part of our remaining territory, to have it in our power to assure the 
inhabitants that the two regiments of our State 
line will be destined for the frontier service ; and we 
therefore take the liberty to request your Excellency 
to enable us to give these assurances, and to be informed from you whether this, or any other equal 
force, will remain for the protection of the northern 
and western frontiers. As nothing but the fullest 
conviction that such severe calamities will follow from 
withdrawing these troops, as will be replete with 
ruin to the common cause, could have induced us to 
this request, we trust in your Excellency's candor 
for a favorable construction of our intentions, as any interference in your command is the farthest from 
our wish. 
</p><p>
A want of ability to raise a competent body of 
troops for the defence of the frontiers, and a conviction of the necessity of at least doubling their number, induce us to entreat your Excellency to afford 
us whatever further assistance you may have in your 
power. Were it necessary to urge any motives to a 
gentleman who so eminently turns his attention to 
the commonweal of the Confederacy, we might state 
many to evince the importance of perfectly securing 
the country in question. We are convinced it is not; 
relying, in the fullest confidence, that all will be 
done for us that with propriety can be expected. 
</p><p>
The want of some artillerists and field-artillery, 
when the enemy penetrated into the country in the 
last campaign, was an evident disadvantage. We 
could, therefore, wish for such a portion of them 
as your Excellency may judge adequate to this service. The frequent calls on the militia, in the course 
of the last campaign, have exhausted all our stock of 
ammunition ; and, as we have not the means of obtaining any, except from the public magazines, permit us to entreat your Excellency to direct a quantity to be expedited to this place for the use of the 
troops (the militia), who may be called into the field. 
</p><p>
The Commanding Officer here will, doubtless, inform 
your Excellency that the troops in this department 
are destitute of provisions of the meat kind ; that, 
on the 6th instant, there was beef at Fort Schuyler 
only for fourteen days, and that the troops in this 
city and Schenectady are billeted upon the inhabitants, for want of that article of provision. As a 
present relief, we have advanced all the money in 
our treasury, amounting to about twelve hundred dollars of the new emission, to our agent to purchase 
beef. From this, however, we expect little success, 
as there are no beef cattle within the State ; and, 
should the agent succeed in making purchases to 
the amount of the cash, it will produce, at most, only 
a temporary supply. We therefore take the liberty 
to suggest to your Excellency the necessity of an 
order from you in favor of the Deputy Commissary 
of Issues, in This department, upon the magazine at 
<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, in Massachusetts, or any of the Purchasing 
Officers in the other States bordering upon this, for 
a supply of beef for the use of the troops in this 
department ; which, if granted, the bearer will convey 
to the Deputy Commissary of Issues, who is now in 
this place. 
</p><p>
By order, and in behalf of the Legislature, I have 
the honor to be, with the most perfect respect and 
esteem, yours, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Although you were pleased, on your leaving the 
State, to express a desire of hearing from me, I 
could not think myself justifiable in troubling your 
Excellency with a line during the campaign, when I 
was sensible every moment of your time must have 
been occupied in matters of the greatest moment, and 
more especially as my letters, in point of information, 
could have been little more than a repetition of what 
I was persuaded you must receive from the Commanding Officer of the department, whose attention, I 
was convinced, would lead him to make the earliest 
communications. 1 flatter myself that my silence will 
not be imputed to want of respect, and that your 
Excellency will believe, that no one was more anxiously concerned for your personal safety, and the success of your operations, than I was, or enjoys with 
greater pleasure the event so distinguishably honorable to the allied arms. 
</p><p>
Induced by the situation of a number of the citizens of this State, who had been captured on the 
frontiers by ravaging parties of the enemy, and carried into Canada, I last spring addressed a line to 
Governor Haldiman, on the subject of their liberation. 
I have lately been favored with his answer; and as 
in it he has taken occasion to introduce his objection 
to the exchange of prisoners taken in arms, I conceive it my duty to transmit to your Excellency copies of this correspondence, which you will find inclosed, in hopes, while in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, your Excellency may be able to have such measures adopted as 
will obviate the difficulties which stand in the way 
of the exchange of our friends in that quarter, many 
of whom have already suffered a long and rigorous 
confinement. 
</p><p>
I lately transmitted to Congress two affidavits, proving a traitorous correspondence between the leaders 
on the New Hampshire Grants, and the enemy ; and 
one of them, that an actual league of amity was settled between them ; which, I presume, have been communicated to your Excellency. There are many other 
circumstances tending to establish the facts contained 
in those affidavits, which would be too tedious to relate. The well-affected in this State, and I believe I 
may venture to say in some of the neighbouring 
States, begin to be exceedingly alarmed at their conduct. Add to this, the violent and oppressive measures pursued by them against some of the most respectable citizens, to support their late extension of 
jurisdiction, will, I am persuaded, before the opening 
of spring, occasion our having recourse to arms to oppose their usurpations. I have the honor to be, with 
the highest respect and esteem. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I was this morning honored with your Excellency's 
letter of the 19th instant. When I transmitted the 
affidavits, &c., inclosed in my last, I was sensible of 
the delicacy entertained by your Excellency respecting 3'onr interference with the internal police of the 
French army ; but, as the persons concerned in the 
dispute were Americans, I should have had great reluctance in making the application to <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague'>Count Rochambeau</a>. I was in hopes, too, that the mere knowledge 
of your Excellency's having been applied to on the 
subject, would have induced the parties to have compromised the matter, which I still hope will be the 
case. 
</p><p>
I very candidly confess I am of opinion with your 
Excellency, that nothing extraordinary is to be apprehended from the late accounts we have had of 
the collection of the enemy's forces at the Isle-auxNoix and Oswego. And this sentiment I expressed 
to Lord Stirling, in the first communication I made 
to him of the intelligence I had received ; though I 
thought it my duty, as I mentioned to your Excellency, to order a part of the militia to be held in 
readiness. I learn, however, that the frontier inhabitants are much alarmed at those hostile appearances ; 
and I am therefore very apprehensive that, if any 
part of the troops on the northern and western frontiers were to be removed before the season is somewhat farther advanced, and thereby even the possibility of the enemy's visiting them with large parties 
be removed, it might create great uneasiness among them, and perhaps induce the more exposed to abandon their settlements, and remove into the interior 
parts of the State ; which would be exceedingly distressing to themselves, and injurious to the public. 
Indeed, if it might be consistent with your Excellency's views, I should conceive that the continuing of 
a small regular force to the northward during the 
winter, might be attended with good consequences, 
especially as they may be comfortably accommodated. 
I have the honor to be, with the highest respect and 
esteem, 
</p><p>
