Dear Sir, 
The subject of your Excellency's letter of the 14th 
instant, is of such extensive importance, that it would 
require more information than I am possessed of to 
form the opinion you request of me, and more leisure 
than the present situation of affairs admits of, to arrange my thoughts (which, at best, I would offer 
with great diffidence) into system. 
It appears to me indispensably necessary that some 
troops should be kept in service in time of peace, 
for the purpose of garrisoning the posts, which it 
may be thought expedient to maintain on the frontiers, and to protect the public magazines. The number must be determined by the posts which it may 
be necessary to occupy, of which I can form no judgment. But, as these will by no means be sufficient 
for defence in case of war; and as the modern systems of military arrangements that obtain in Europe 
would be totally inadmissible with us; and as our 
own experience has abundantly evinced that it is 
hazardous and expensive to the last degree to leave 
the defence of a country to its militia, some plan, in 
my opinion, ought to be adopted, which would preserve the great outlines of an army, in such manner 
as that it may not only be readily completed and 
drawn forth for action, whenever the exigencies of 
the nation shall require, but so as that it can be 
most speedily reduced to order and consistency. 
</p><p>
For this purpose I would therefore propose, â€” that a sufficient number of officers to compose such an army be retained in service, by continuing to them 
their rank. That promotions should take place, and vacancies be filled up, in the same manner as at present. That they should not receive pay, except 
when in actual service, but be entitled to certain encouragements of the negative kind, such as exemption 
from serving in the militia, or in any of the burdensome offices of society; together with some such positive distinctions (if any should be necessary) as 
would not tend to give the most distant cause of jealousy or apprehension among the most scrupulous 
republicans, and at the same time would be sufficient to induce the present gentlemen to retain their ranks. 
</p><p>
And, in order that we may always have a succession of officers well versed in the tactics of war, 
I would farther propose, that, at one seminary of 
learning in each State, where degrees in the arts and 
sciences are conferred, a professorship should be established, lectures read, and degrees conferred in the 
military science. These Professorships to be under 
the inspection of some officer of high rank, and distinguished abilities in the profession, who should have 
an adequate allowance of pay from the public, and 
be obliged to visit the several seminaiies at stated 
periods, and report to the proper office the result of 
his visitations. From these seminaries all vacancies 
should be filled up as they occur, and no person 
should receive a commission, unless he had attended 
a certain number of courses of lectures, and been admitted to his degree. 
</p><p>
A proportion of these officers will necessarily be 
employed with the troops for garrisoning the posts, 
&c. And I would propose that this duty should be 
performed by a certain routine, to be established for 
the purpose ; that, in turn, all should share the advantage which may be derived from actual service, 
on the one hand, and, on the other, the mischiefs, 
which in time of peace might arise from too long a 
continuance in command at fixed posts, would thereby be obviated. 
</p><p>
In all our peace arrangements, we ought, I conceive, to have an eye to the support of the Federal 
Union, as the first and principal object of national 
concern. Influenced by this consideration, I would 
prefer an establishment (however feeble it might appear) that is calculated to maintain that intimate 
connection between the different States, which gave 
us success in war, and upon which I am persuaded 
our happiness and importance will depend in peace. 
And it is this which would induce me to wish to preserve even the name of a Continental army, as well as 
to cherish that sense of military honor, which is so 
nearly allied to public virtue as not to admit of 
distinction, but which, from the peculiar situation of 
our country, may otherwise be too soon extinguished. 
I have the honor to be, with the greatest deference 
and respect. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
This is the first moment I have found myself 
able to acknowledge the receipt of your Excellency's 
obliging letter of the 11th ultimo, and to express 
the grateful sense I entertain of the concern which 
you are so kindly pleased to express for my recovery. The severity of my disorder had so far abated 
as to enable me to leave my room, and attempt a 
little moderate exercise ; but, after two or three days, 
it was succeeded by a slow fever, attended with a 
disagreeable cough and depression of spirits, which 
came upon me every afternoon, and continued until 
morning. Its long continuance has reduced me very 
low, and my recovery is almost imperceptible, so that 
I have little reason speedily to expect a return of 
my usual health. 
I am sorry to learn, that the peace establishment 
is so long delayed ; though it is what I expected, nor 
do I believe one will ever be agreed upon that will 
give respectability to the nation, and security to the 
frontiers. Some States appear now to be exceedingly 
jealous of the Confederation ; and, I observe, even 
towns are giving instructions to their representatives 
to guard against any infringement of it. It would 
become them to reflect, that, not long since, when it 
suited their interest and their humor, a violation of 
it, in a very essential instance, was so far from being 
disagreeable, that it was strongly advocated by those 
States who now appear the most scrupulous. I am 
fully persuaded, unless the powers of the National 
Council are enlarged, and that body better supported 
than it is at present, all their measures will discover 
such feebleness and want of energy, as will stain us 
with disgrace, and expose us to the worst of evils. 
</p><p>
We have as yet no certainty when the British will 
leave the southern district of this State, though all 
accounts agree that their stay will not exceed the 
10th of next month. As my correspondence with 
Sir Guy, since your Excellency left this quarter, has 
ceased, I " am something apprehensive that he may 
not give me timely notice, as he promised to do in 
his first letter, for the establishment of the jurisdiction of the State over that district on his departure; 
and disorders will consequently take place, before measures can be taken by the State to prevent them. I 
could wish, therefore, that the troops on the lines in 
Westchester county might have orders to move to 
the neighbourhood of the city the moment the British 
leave it, and, if there should be no impropriety in it, 
be subject to my direction while they remain there. 
And I would be much obliged to your Excellency, if you will be pleased to inform me by express (the 
expense whereof the State will cheerfully pay), of the 
first advice you may receive of the time proposed by 
Sir Guy for his departure. 
</p><p>
We were under much anxiety on hearing of Mrs. 
Washington's indisposition, and were made extremely 
happy by your account of her recovery. Mrs. Clinton 
joins me in requesting you to accept and to tender 
to Mrs. Washington our most respectful compliments. 
I am, with the highest sentiments of respect and 
esteem, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=gec" rel="me">George Clinton</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. Your Excellency will be pleased to excuse 
this scroll's not appearing in my own hand. I attempted to copy it, but found it too much for me.
