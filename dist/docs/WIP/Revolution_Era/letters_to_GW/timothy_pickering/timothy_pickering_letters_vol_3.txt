Sir, 
</p><p>
You will doubtless, ere this reaches you, have been 
informed that Congress have been pleased to appoint 
me Quartermaster-General. This was so totally unexpected, that it will take me some days yet, before 
I can get ready to proceed to camp. In the mean 
time, I shall make some necessary arrangements for 
conducting the business of the department in this 
State, and the other States southward of it. The 
gentlemen concerned in the department with the army, will, I hope, cheerfully continue to exercise the 
duties of their respective offices until my arrival in 
camp, which shall be as speedily as possible. I have 
the honor to be, with the greatest respect.

Sir, 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='colleague met'>General Knox</a> informed me, to-day, that no artillery 
was to go from hence. I had previously ordered 
fifty draught-horses to be impressed for transporting 
the artillery, ammunition, and tents. I now propose 
to dispose of them as follows; â€” For the Marquis de la Fayette's wagon, four; a baggage tumbril for the 
artillery officers, three ; for three close wagons, in 
which are to be carried from hence eleven horsemen's 
and sixty common tents, twelve ; the Field-Ofificers 
and Captains of artillery, two or three ; total, twenty-two. These may proceed to-morrow for <a href='/results.php?city=pompton' rel='city'>Pompton</a>. The 
residue of the horses and sleighs, impressed on this 
occasion, I have ordered to be employed in carrying 
It was at the same time resolved by Congress, " that he be continued 
as a member of the Board of War, but that the exercise of aU his 
powers at the said Board, and his pay as a member thereof, be suspended during such time as he shall continue Quartermaster-General." 
</p><p>
clothing and provisions to <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, while their forage and the sleighing lasts. 
</p><p>
I wrote yesterday morning to Colonel Hughes, desiring him to give the necessary orders to his assistants at the Village, and King's Ferry, to impress 
twenty-five riding horses, for the Field and Staff Officers of the detachment ; the whole, if he thought best, 
on the west side of the river, to save the trouble of 
crossing. I also desired him to impress ten two-horse 
wagons, and have them at King's Ferry on the 20th, 
to take up the baggage of the officers, and the kettles of the men, as soon as they crossed. That number I judged sufficient, supposing the officers would 
take with them only their blankets, portmanteaus, and 
cooking utensils. Colonel Hughes received these orders, and answered me last evening that they should 
be executed. I have wrote to him this afternoon, desiring him to send one hundred axes to Major Campbell, at the Village, to distribute to the detachment, 
when assembled, if they should need them. I have 
also requested him to examine into the condition of 
the boats at King's Ferry, and see that they are prepared to transport the troops. 
</p><p>
I have sent orders to <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a>, to have one 
hundred and fifty common, and ten or twelve horsemen's tents put in order immediately. These, with 
those proposed to be sent from hence, will be sufficient for the detachment, allowing seven men one 
common tent, and four Captains and subalterns one 
horsemen's tent. If there be three officers to a company, six will have but one horsemen's tent. It is 
proposed to furnish the detachment with two hundred 
narrow axes, one hundred and thirty pickaxes, one 
hundred and fifty spades, and two hundred and fifty 
shovels. By a return, received in November, there 
appeared to be spades, shovels, and one hundred and 
six picks (enough) at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. At the same time, 
there were plenty of good axes at Lancaster, from 
whence the transportation is easy to the Head of Elk. 
There are also five hundred axes at <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a>. But 
if, on my arrival at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, there should be 
found a deficiency of intrenching tools, it will be 
practicable to complete the requisite number in two 
or -three days. 
</p><p>
I have proposed that the horses going from hence 
and King's Ferry, should be relieved at <a href='/results.php?city=pompton' rel='city'>Pompton</a> ; 
that the teams requisite for the tents, at <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a>, 
should be impressed in that neighbourhood, and go 
as far as <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a> ; and that the horses and teams 
impressed at <a href='/results.php?city=pompton' rel='city'>Pompton</a> should be relieved about Somerset Court-House. But should there chance to be 
provision teams at ISIorristown, returning to <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, 
they may be detained a day or two to take up the 
baggage of the detachment, and save an} farther impress, except for the close baggage-wagons. The 
same may take place from <a href='/results.php?city=pompton' rel='city'>Pompton</a> to <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a>, 
should there be teams returninji; from Rino-wood. 
That from Bucks county, in Pennsylvania, teams 
and horses should be collected sufficient for the baggage of the whole detachment, and rendezvous at 
<a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a> Ferry, unless the river should admit of 
water transportation ; that, if the whole proceed by 
land, the Bucks county teams should be relieved at 
Chester ; that teams should be furnished at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> for the intrenching tools, and whatever may be 
taken up there ; and thus the whole proceed to the 
Head of Elk. I have sent Major Piatt to West 
Point to request of <a href='/results.php?tla=wih' rel='colleague'>General Heath</a>, an active officer 
to serve as Quarter-master to the detachment. 
</p><p>
I have provided two Forage-masters, that have appeared to me as clever as any in the service, to 
accompany, or rather precede the detachment, to impress teams and forage; and a Conductor to attend to 
the march of the baggage. The greatest difficulty, 
that I foresee, will he in impressing the teams and 
horses with proper despatch and punctuality, for want 
of dragoons. The time of every impress must be regulated by the orders of the Commanding Officer of 
the detachment. 
</p><p>
I request your Excellency's orders relative to any 
farther arrangement of this business, or alteration of 
the measures here proposed. I am, most respectfully. 
Your Excellency's obedient servant,

</p><p>
Sir. 
</p><p>
I had the honor to inform you, on my return from 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, of what passed there relative to the 
means of procuring the numerous supplies requisite 
in my department for the ensuing campaign ; and 
was unhappy that no prospect was presented of my 
obtaining a single shilling for that end. As the only 
alternative, therefore, I submitted to your Excellency's judgment the expediency of calling on the several States to furnish camp equipage for their own 
troops respectively; which proposal you was pleased 
to approve. This also corresponds with the articles 
of Confederation, wherein it is declared (article nine), 
that Congress shall make requisitions from each State 
for its quota of troops, which requisition shall be 
binding; and thereupon the Legislature of each State shall appoint the regimental officers, raise the men, 
and clothe, arm, and equip them in a soldier-like 
manner, at the expense of the United States. 
</p><p>
I therefore now beg leave to lay before your Excellency the inclosed estimates of tents, knapsacks, 
and haversacks requisite for the troops of the four 
New England States. If in this mode these can be 
supplied, the general provision made and making will 
be adequate to the demands of the other troops composing the main army. In these estimates I have 
omitted camp-kettles, because they are not to be procured in the Eastern States, and I hope to obtain 
them from Pennsylvania. Canteens are making in 
Massachusetts for the whole main army. 
</p><p>
I have made the estimates in detail, that, by inspection only, your Excellency might judge of the 
propriety of the proposed allowances of camp equipage. I thought, too, that in this form they would 
be more satisfactory to the States themselves than 
a general demand. I have the honor to be, with the 
greatest respect,

Camp, ID <a rel="month origin" value="7">July</a>,  <a href='/results.php?year=1781' rel="origin">1781</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='colleague met'>General Knox</a> has called on me to-day, respecting 
a provision of horses for the light artillery. I have 
authorized Colonel Hughes to purchase one hundred 
for thai service onli/, and promised payment by the 
1st of November. He writes me, encouragingly, that 
many may be so procured. The essential service to 
which they are to be applied will, I trust, facilitate 
a grant of money to enable me to fulfil my promise, 
which no ordinary calls would have induced me to 
hazard. 
</p><p>
I have heard nothing of the horses expected from 
Pennsylvania since Colonel Mills wrote me, on the 29th ultimo, that, " on that and the following days, 
he should send money to all the counties where any 
horses remained, to enable the drivers to defray their 
expenses to the army." I desired they might he 
shod before they left the State. This may have 
retarded their progress a few days. I think they 
cannot now be far off. I expect they amount to a 
hundred ; but the numbers given me on paper have 
so often deceived me, I will not undertake to say 
how many will arrive. <a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='colleague met'>General Knox</a> demands one 
hundred for the light artillery, which he is impatient 
to ])ring into the field. There is no practicable way 
of procuring them with despatch, but by an impress. 
In this part of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> there are few or no horses 
worth impressing. The other parts of this State have 
been harassed by impresses during the whole winter. 
Jersey has suffered in this way very little, nor am I 
informed of its having made any material effort either 
in furnishing supplies or services, since the last campaign. If one hundred horses were impressed there 
on this occasion, they might probably be relieved by 
those from Pennsylvania and Colonel Hughes's purchases, in the course of a fortnight or three weeks. 
</p><p>
As the enemy's shipping have gone down the 
river, I request your Excellency's determination whether a ferry-boat or two, capable of carrying horses, 
and some of Major Darby's bateaux, should not be 
brought down to Dobbs's Ferry; whether, if the 
Jersey troops continue on the other side, the transportation of stores from <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a> may 
not be turned thither; and whether the route of the 
expresses from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> may not be shortened in 
the same way. 
</p><p>
I beg leave to add, on the subject of an impress 
of horses, that, if your Excellency should judge it 
expedient to adopt the measure, Lieutenant-Colonel 
Dearborn will cross the river, consult Colonel Dayton, and fix on the proper persons to make the impress, aided by small detachments from the Jersey 
line. I have the honor to be, with the greatest 
respect;

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
It may be proper that I report to your Excellency 
the circumstances and events of my late journey to 
<a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>. I was unable to leave camp the 2d 
instant until late in the afternoon, which prevented 
my reaching <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a> till the evening. 
</p><p>
I immediately waited on the Intendant with Count Chastellux's letter, reciting the agreement he had 
made with me respecting the future employment of 
the vessels, and desiring him to pay me two thousand dollars on account of their services. The Intendant declined doing it, but proposed to see me 
the next morning, when he would get an interpreter, 
that we might fully understand one another. I met 
him at sunrise ; but, after a long conversation, he 
finally refused a compliance, in any respect, with the 
agreement of Count Chastellux. He observed, that 
neither Count Chastellux, as Major-General, nor Count 
Rochambeau, as Commander-in-chief, had a right to 
make any agreements obligatory on him ; that he had 
been constantly disappointed, in every undertaking of 
Government, from Hhode Island to Virginia ; that he was answerable with his head, if the King's army were not duly supplied; that money insured supplies; 
and that he could depend on nothing but the direct 
application of it by his own agents. I was now 
fearful that the proposed plan must be wholly given 
up. But afterwards I concerted measures with Colonel Wads worth and Mr. Carter for prosecuting it, and, 
by their assistance, have been enabled to do it for 
the present. On my arriving at Trebel's Landing, I 
found many vessels unfit for service. These, exceeding twenty in number, I discharged. All the others 
that were unloaded were formed into squadrons for 
different ports, to bring supplies to the army. Most 
of them sailed yesterday morning. 
</p><p>
Commodore Barron arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a> just 
in time to go with me to the Landing ; yet, with his 
assistance, I was not able to arrange the vessels, 
finish the unloading of some, furnish them with provisions, and write their various orders, till yesterday 
morning. A competent number will call on the Count de Grasse to land the marines at the place your Excellency directed, if this should not have been already 
effected ; for Commodore Barron informed that before 
he left the fleet, the Admiral intended to land them 
without delay. 
</p><p>
There is one vessel at the Landing, which came 
from Rhode Island with salted provisions, which yet 
remain unloaded. I do not know the quantity she 
has on board, but I believe not above a hundred or 
a hundred and fifty barrels. If there be no material 
objection, I would have it landed, that the vessel 
might be discharged, or employed in transporting 
supplies. At present she serves only as a storehouse 
for that small quantity of provisions, at the rent of 
two thousand five hundred and fifty-five a year. 
I trouble your Excellency with this information, because Colonel Stewart, some days since, suggested that 
it was your Excellency's desire, that this salted meat 
should be preserved for some special occasions, and 
that it was necessary to have it remain on board. I 
have the honor to be, with the greatest respect. 
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
Agreeably to your Excellency's orders on the 19th 
instant to me, to take possession of the enemy's 
public stores pertaining to my department, I went to 
York myself, with my storekeeper, and at the same 
time desired Colonel Dearborn to go to Gloucester 
with an assistant of the storekeeper, for the purpose 
of receiving the stores. At Gloucester the dragoon horses, with their accoutrements, and the wagonhorses and wagons, were delivered up that day, and 
the whole committed by Colonel Dearborn to militia 
guards. The same evening the dragoon-horses were 
driven out of Gloucester, and delivered to the care 
of the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='colleague'>Duke De Lauzun</a>'s legion ; and, by the inclosed 
certificate and oath of Major Bay ton, it appears that 
no exchanges were made between the receipt of 
those horses from the British, and the delivery of 
them to the Duke's legion. 
</p><p>
On the 20th I sent over the superintendent of 
the horse-yard with a party of men, and a written 
order to take charge of the cavalry-horses ; but Colonel Sheldon told my assistant, Mr. Mix, that they 
should retain the horses till there was an order from 
your Excellency to deliver them up. So the superintendent remained at Gloucester. During the 20th 
and 21st I had persons waiting at Gloucester to receive every species of property pertaining to my 
department, with a party of men for fatigue and 
guards. As soon as the prisoners left their tents on 
the 21st, Mr. Mix applied to the officer of the French 
guard, and told him his orders and business ; but he 
refused to let him take a tent, unless he could produce an order from your Excellency, Count Hochambeau, or General Choisy. The time would not admit 
of an application to either. Night came on, and the 
tents were chiefly stolen. In two hours, the persons 
I had assigned for that service would have had them 
in store. Early that morning I sent Mr. Mix with a 
note to head-quarters, mentioning the embarrassments 
given me by the French and militia guards. But 
your Excellency was gone to the fleet ; though Mr. 
Trumbull said you had previously written to General Choisy on the subject. 
</p><p>
Colonel Dearborn informs me, that a large proportion of the public stores thus lost (tents particularly) 
were taken away by the soldiers and women in the 
British hospitals; so that of one hundred and ten new 
tents returned in the eightieth regiment, only four 
or five were left. This information he received from 
the Quarter-master to that regiment. Some French 
soldiers were yesterday found there, loading two boats 
with tents. Colonel Dearborn's coming probably prevented their completing their design ; but, in defiance 
of him, they carried off what they had got. 
</p><p>
The French have placed safeguards over the houses 
at Gloucester, where the British officers are quartered; 
so that no American officer on duty there can obtain 
any shelter, unless in the vilest hovels. I conceive it 
to be absolutely necessary that these, and the French guards over the stores, be removed, as well as the 
guards of militia ; their places to be supplied, as far 
as shall be found necessary, by Continental troops. 
</p><p>
I request to be fivored with your Excellency's directions, respecting the public stores and tents carried 
off by the people in the British hospital. Colonel 
Dearborn will present this, and explain more circumstantially the proceedings at Gloucester. I have the 
honor to be, with great respect.

Sir, 
</p><p>
I am honored with your Excellency's letter of this 
date respecting the preparations to be made for the 
next campaign. The reason of my stay at the North 
River I mentioned in my letter from thence. As 
soon as I obtained the returns in that quarter, I 
came away. A general return is forming, which, from 
the multiplicity of articles, will be voluminous; but, 
as soon as possible, I will complete and lay it before 
your Excellency. In the mean time, I beg leave to 
submit to your consideration some things which need 
not wait the completion of the return, but on which, 
from their nature and capital importance, an early 
decision seems requisite. 
On considering the mode most proper to be adopted 
in providing ox-teams for the ensuing campaign, the 
Secretary of War and I were decidedly in favor of 
purchasing them. I have since formed the inclosed 
estimate, number One, showing the comparative expenses of hiring and purchasing the necessary number of ox-teams, in which your Excellency will see 
on what foundation our opinion rested. Tents being 
the most expensive and essential articles of camp 
equipage, I extracted from the returns, then in my 
hands, the numbers on which we might rely for the 
ensuing campaign. The Secretary of War, on a cursory view, supposed these numbers would be sufficient. The same extract, a copy of which, number 
Two, is inclosed, shows the state of the knapsacks, 
canteens, &c., at the times mentioned therein. On 
comparing this with my estimate of last year, I think 
nothing more needs be purchased, at least for the present, except knapsacks, canteens, and camp-kettles. 
I was apprehensive that the canteens at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, in 
September, might afterwards have been transported to 
Claverack, and they are an article so frequently lost 
and broken, I concluded with the Secretary of War, 
that six thousand more should be procured in Massachusetts, to be brought on by the teams raised for 
the army ; and I sent orders accordingly to my deputy there by him. 
</p><p>
Number Three, is a return of the public boats in 
the North River. On the back of it I have noted 
the number and species of private vessels on the same 
river, and the amount of their tonnage. But, as they 
have run during the winter, and been ill-prepared, 
probably not more than half of them will be fit for service The ensuing season. I procured this information, as I thought it might be of use, if a question 
should arise, whether the gun-boats and other public 
vessels there should be repaired. 
</p><p>
Number Four contains the terms on which Mr. Sheafe, the superintendent at Wappen's Creek, will 
perform the ship and boatWright's work therein mentioned. Number Five is an estimate of a company 
of artificers, which I apprehend will be necessary in 
the main army the ensuing campaign. Should the 
operations of the army in the State of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> require a greater number, I persuade myself it will 
be easy to engage them for the occasion. On the 
terms stated, I find the company can be raised. I 
left orders with the Commissary of Forage to form a 
magazine sufficient for the posts in the Highlands 
until the first of May, which, if the snow continues, 
I expect will be done. I have contracted with the 
smith at Newburg for all the smiths' work necessary 
for the main army during the next campaign, if I 
choose to continue the contract so long. Its continuance will, of course, depend on the aid which can be 
derived from the Superintendent of Finance. The 
terms are lower than any smiths in this city will engage on. It was the desire of the Secretary at War, 
that your Excellency's determination relative to the 
ox-teams, might be by me communicated to him before he should leave Massachusetts. I have the honor 
to be, with the greatest respect,

Sir, 
</p><p>
I was yesterday honored with your Excellency's 
letter of the 21st, to the several directions in which 
I shall pay due attention. Yesterday I received a letter from Major Clairborne, dated the 12th instant, 
informing me that the two expresses, stationed at 
Bowling Green, had left it some days for want of support. As Colonel Carrington had comprehended, in 
his estimate for Virginia, one charge for expresses, I 
have desired him to ask <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague'>Mr. Morris</a> for authority to 
engage actual payment, and then immediately to write 
Major Clairborne to replace and firmly fix the expresses, W'hom Colonel Carrington will pay on his return to Virginia. I will also apply for the Maryland district, and enable Mr. Yeates to keep his chain complete. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency advised that the ox-teams should 
be assembled by the middle of May last year. I 
would request your direction for the present year on 
this head. The longer their assembling is delayed, 
consistent with the expected operations, the better, 
on account of the pasturage, which, by the middle of 
May, is hardly sufficient for the support of the cattle. 
It is of importance, too, to preserve, as long as possible, all the forage in the vicinity of the army. I 
have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, 
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

I thought it my duty to apprise your Excellency 
of this event. The plaintiff is a Melancthon L. Woolsey. I do not know him, nor ever heard his name 
before ; but a gentleman, who happens to be at my 
office, tells me that he is a trader at <a href='/results.php?city=poughkeepsie' rel='city'>Poughkeepsie</a>, 
who has been purchasing up specie certificates (signed 
by me, and issued pursuant to an act of Congress of 
the 23d of August, <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>), at a very great discount. 
</p><p>
The suit, therefore, is doubtless grounded on such 
certificates. But, on the same ground, some thousands of suits may be brought against me in this 
State alone. 
</p><p>
Congress, by an act of the 19th of March, <a href='/results.php?year=1782'>1782</a>, 
recommended to the several States to pass laws to 
exempt public officers from such suits. Some complied with the recommendation. This State deliberated upon it, and a bill passed the Assembly; but the 
Council of Revision offered objections, and it was 
dropped. To subject public officers to such actions, 
is doubtless cruel oppression. At the same time, 
the community is burdened with a great expense. If 
such suits be multiplied, and the numerous public 
creditors have all as just cause of action, they cannot 
even benefit the prosecutors ; for the property of pub
</p><p>
lie officers, compared with the vastness of the public 
debts, is but as the small dust of the balance. There 
is but one class of people who can derive advantage 
from such prosecutions. They, indeed, will reap a 
rich harvest, if all, or a majority of the public creditors, become equally unreasonable with the few that 
have hitherto commenced such suits. With the writ, 
the Sheriff presented me a letter from Mr. Benson, of 
which the inclosed is a copy. 
</p><p>
I am singularly unfortunate in being subjected to 
suits on specie certificates ; for it was at my instance 
that Congress passed the act authorizing me to issue 
them. My motive was to do the best possible justice to the public creditors, by fixing their dues in 
specie, and allowing them the interest of their money, 
which I saw it was impossible for the public promptly 
to pay. I am, with the greatest respect.

Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been favored with your Excellency's letter 
of the 15th instant, which would have been acknowledged by the subsequent post, had I not been made 
to expect a small supply of money the same week, 
by the bearer of which I meant to write to your 
Excellency. But in this expectation also I was disappointed. My long continuance here has distressed 
me exceedingly, but it appeared to me that the service would be promoted by it. I had, from time to 
time, sent orders to Colonel Hughes to prepare every 
thing that was to be provided in his department for 
the ensuing campaign, and to the Commissary of Forage to procure his supplies, assuring them, agreeably 
to the encouragement I had myself received, that I 
would furnish them with money to fulfil their engagements, every necessary estimate for these purposes 
having been laid before the Superintendent of Finance, 
and the necessity of the supplies admitted. 
</p><p>
These services being undertaken in full confidence 
that I should bring with me the requisite sums 
of money, I did not dare to return without them. 
While the Financier held up to my view the prospect of supplies, I presented the same to Colonel 
Hughes and at my own office, and thereby kept alive 
the hopes of the public creditors, who, had I returned 
moneyless, would have been reduced to absolute despair, and all business and supplies have ceased. But 
I am now more unhappy than ever ; for I cannot 
continue to mention even a prospect of fulfilling my 
engagements. Until I was led to expect supplies of 
money to carry on the business of the department, I 
cautiously avoided making any positive engagements, 
thinking the public creditors had been too long abused by faithless promises to admit of any further deception to the public advantage; and the making of 
promises, without a well-grounded prospect of fulfilling them, being totally opposed to my disposition. 
</p><p>
I have at last reduced my immediate demand of 
money "not to the articles necessary and lest to be 
provided now, but to those, for which unless money 
can be furnished, the credit of the department will 
be irretrievably lost." But I can obtain nothing at 
present. The principal causes of this disappointment 
your Excellency is probably informed of The same 
causes prevent the completing the purchases of oxteams. The sum I received for those purchases was 
in <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague'>Mr. Morris's</a> notes, and amounted only to about 
three fifths of the sum requisite for that service -, and 
whether any purchases could be made with them at 
the eastward, was a matter of uncertainty, from which 
no information from my deputies there has relieved 
me. But, if they have succeeded, it is in such a way 
as forbids the Financier giving me any more of them ; 
for these notes are not received there as cash, but 
only as pledges, which are bought up by speculators, 
who make a run upon the funds assigned for their 
redemption. 
</p><p>
My stay here goads me with perpetual anxiety. 
To return empty, would be mortifying in the highest 
degree, and expose me to infinite vexation. To ask a credit of anybody, after The deceptions with which 
I shall be charged, and before the engagements already made are fulfilled, would be deemed a piece of 
effrontery, and nothing could be obtained without recurring to the odious and expensive mode of impress. 
Thus embarrassed and distressed, I have represented 
my situation to the Secretary at War, who will thereon have some communications with the Superintendent of Finance; and by their opinion or your Excellency's orders I shall be governed. I have the honor 
to be, with the greatest respect. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
