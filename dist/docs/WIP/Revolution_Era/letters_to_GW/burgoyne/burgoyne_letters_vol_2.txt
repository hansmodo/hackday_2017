SIR, 
</p><p>
I beg you to accept my sincerest acknowledgments 
for your very obliging letter. I find the character, 
which I before knew to be respectable, is also perfectly amiable ; and I should have few greater private gratifications in seeing our melancholy contest 
at an end, than that of cultivating your friendship. 
</p><p>
I shall take particular care of your letter to Mr. 
Fairfax. He is a gentleman much esteemed. I hope there is no reason to apprehend his death ; I heard 
no such report when I left England, last spring, nor 
have I seen it in any of the magazines since, most 
of which have come to my hands. I have the honor 
to be, with great respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

SIR, 
</p><p>
The accounts you have given me are very satisfactory, and I doubt not every proceeding under your direction will be the 
same. I beg the favor of you to report whether the route you 
have marched will be practicable with a large corps of cannon, 
without repair, or with what sort of repair. The desirable circumstance for your corps is, at present, to possess <a href='/results.php?city=bennington' rel='city'>Bennington</a> ; 
but should you find the enemy too strongly posted, and maintaining such a countenance as would make a coup de main ardous, I wish you to take such a post as you can maintain till you 
hear further from me ; and upon your reports and other circumstances, I will either support you in force or withdraw you. 
</p><p>
You will please to send to my camp, as soon as you can, wagons and draught-cattle, and likewise such other cattle as are not 
necessary for your subsistence. Let the wagons and carts bring 
off what flour and wheat they can, that you do not retain for the 
same purpose. I will write to you in full to-morrow in regard to 
purchasing horses out of the hands of the savages. In the mean 
time, let them be assured that whatever you select from them, fit 
to mount the dragoons, shall be paid for at proper price. 
</p><p>
I am, &c.,

SIR, 
</p><p>
Major-General Riedesel has requested me to transmit the in 
closed to Lieutenant-Colonel Baum, whom the fortune of war put 
into the hands of your troops at <a href='/results.php?city=bennington' rel='city'>Bennington</a>. 
</p><p>
Having never failed in my attentions towards prisoners, I can 
not entertain a doubt of your taking this opportunity to show mea return of civility ; and that you will permit the baggage and 
servants of such officers, your prisoners, as desire it, to pass to 
them unmolested. 
</p><p>
It is with great concern I find myself obliged to add to this 
application, a complaint of the bad treatment the Provincial soldiers in the king's service received after the affair at <a href='/results.php?city=bennington' rel='city'>Bennington</a>. 
I have reports, upon oath, that some were refused quarter, after 
having asked it. I am willing to believe that this was against 
the order and inclination of your officers ; but it is my part to 
require an explanation, and to warn you of the horrors of a retaliation, if such a practice is not, in the strongest manner, discountenanced and reprehended. 
</p><p>
Duty and principle, Sir, make me a public enemy to the Americans who have taken arms ; but I seek to be a generous one ; 
nor have I the shadow of resentment against any individual, who does not induce it by acts derogatory to those maxims upon 
which all men of honor think alike. 
</p><p>
Persuaded that a gentleman of the station to whom this letter is addressed, will not be comprised in the exception I have made,

I am, personally, Sir, &c.,

SIR, 
</p><p>
I received the resolves of the Congress, of the 8th of January, 
with an astonishment that no occurrence ever before occasioned. 
It would be misplaced to enter now into any reasoning upon the 
subject. 
</p><p>
I apply to you, Sir, as an individual whom I believe to have 
honor, humanity, and generosity. My Aid-de-camp has directions 
to communicate to you my letters to the Congress. I leave to 
your feelings to support that which regards my private situation, 
only begging leave to recall to your recollection the offer you 
made, in regard to my personal embarkation. In the full persuasion of the integrity of that proposal, I thought not of entering 
into reasonings and justifications in my public or private letters 
from <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, in any such degree as the delicacy of a soldier's 
character required, after a series of the most critical situations, 
difficult attempts, and diversified ill success. To die in this country, is nothing ; but to leave my honor unvindicated in my own, 
is more than philosophy or fortitude can be expected to bear. 
</p><p>
I confide in you, to consider this entirely as a private letter, 
and am, 
</p><p>
With sincere regard, Sir, &c., 
</p><p>
