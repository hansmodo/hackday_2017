</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your avocations have been so numerous and important since your entrance into office, that I have 
not troubled you with but one letter, which was to 
recommend Mr. Hall, and to very sincerely congratulate you upon your appointment to the Supreme Magistracy. I am well convinced that to increase the 
number of your correspondents unnecessarily, is to 
do you a serious injury. For, I should suppose, with 
official communications, with proper and improper applications for fovors, and the oppressive correspondence 
of numbers who, with very little information or pleasure to you, write merely for the purpose of boasting 
the honor of your correspondence, — with such I have 
always considered you so overwhelmed that I have 
hitherto forborne to write to you, although motives 
of respect, as well as information, ought frequently to 
have induced me. 
</p><p>
Upon the present occasion, I feel myself in some 
measure obliged, from the situation which I hold, to 
state to you my sentiments on the critical situation 
of our neighbouring State, and eventually the frontiers of this. To predict, with some degree of certainty, what may be the consequence of things remaining in the state they are, and no treaty formed 
with the Creeks and southern Indians, permit me to 
trespass for a moment upon your time, by observing, 
that (however I confess it is conjectural) there appear to me to be good grounds for supposing that 
the situation of our foreign concerns is totally changed 
with respect to Spain. Upon the conclusion of the 
peace, I believe it was the intention of that Court to 
have entered into a treaty of amity and commerce 
with us, to have been our friends, and to have done 
every thing in their power to have promoted the intercourse. But they mistook the means; for, instead 
of forming a treaty upon those terms which would 
have insured a reciprocity of benefits, they thought 
the best way to remove every future ground of difference, to prevent our becoming dangerous neighbours, and to keep us at a distance, was to propose 
the surrender of a right as degrading to the honor, 
as it would have been ultimately injurious to the interests, of the Union. 
</p><p>
I happened to be in Congress at the time the proposal was brought forward through the then Secretary, 
Mr. Jay. Having more leisiu^e, or having more maturely considered the offer, I was requested, by the 
opponents, to prepare an answer to the reasons which 
Mr. Jay offered in support of Mr. Gardoqui's proposal. 
This I did, and being afterwards desired, by many of 
the southern members, to furnish them with coj)ies, I 
had a few printed, which were confidentially delivered 
to some of my friends, for their information upon a 
subject which at that time very much engaged the 
attention of the public. I have the honor to inclose 
you one of the few copies I have left. I do so in 
order that I may not only more clearly illustrate the 
observations I am about to make, but also that, in 
case another attempt should be made to conclude this 
treaty, you may be informed of the reasons which at 
that time induced an opposition. As the business of 
treaties must ever be of a secret nature, vou will 
no doubt consider the communication as it is intended, 
entirely confidential. 
</p><p>
The Court of Spain, being defeated in this measure, 
have appeared to me to entirely change their ground. 
The original, and I believe the only reason, of Spain's 
anxiety to conclude a treaty with us, was to secure 
her American Continental possessions from being at 
any time the object of invasion or insult from the 
southern, or more probably the western, inhabitants 
of the Union. They have ever dreaded the settlement 
of the western territory, and looked forward to the 
time when it would become necessary for its inhabitants to use the Mississippi, as a period very likely 
to produce those uneasinesses, which would perhaps 
end in the invasion of their dominions. 
</p><p>
Had they at first proposed a solid and reciprocally 
beneficial treaty, it would have prevented, or at least 
postponed for a number of years, any danger of this 
sort. But having, as I have already observed, wrongly conceived the means of effecting it, and being foiled in their first attempt, they have now changed 
their ground. They are endeavouring, by every exertion in their power, to attach, not only the southern 
Indians, but as many as they possibly can of the inhabitants of the western territory, closely to their 
interest. They have completely succeeded with some of the most powerful nations of the southern Indians. 
Hence the difficulty of treating with them ; and I 
am sorry to find, from accounts which appear to me 
to be tolerably authentic, that they have diverted a 
considerable number of the inhabitants of some of the 
States, and tempted them to become settlers within 
their borders. 
</p><p>
Thus situated, it seems to me as beyond a doubt, 
that they are the spring of all the present disturbances with the Creeks, and that they are cherishing 
a spirit of discontent and disaffection in them and 
the western inhabitants to the Government of the 
Union. By means of their intrigues, Georgia has 
been, for some years, in a lamentable state of depredation and distress. Although they have hitherto forborne to commit hostilities on the citizens of this 
State, yet the inhabitants are in an uneasy and disagreeable situation. They all look up to the Union 
for the establishment of that solid and permanent 
treaty, which can alone secure to them the peaceable 
enjoyment of their possessions. 
</p><p>
Not having been officially informed of the reasons 
of the late Commission's miscarrying, I am unable to 
form any judgment of the motives which occasioned 
it. As I am confident a general Indian war would 
not only be attended with great inconvenience to 
Georgia and our frontiers, but with a very considerable expenditure of blood and treasure to the Union, 
I have made it a point to acquire, from the most respectable authority on their borders and elsewhere, 
such information as is the most to be depended upon. 
Not to detain you with a circumstantial account of 
the means used to obtain it, or a detail of their relations, the result is, that however anxious the Spanish Court are to foment and continue the existing 
animosities, yet there is a disposition in the Indians, 
upon just and proper principles, to again become the 
friends, and probably the allies, of the Union. In this 
temper they now are ; and I am convinced, that detaching Mr. McGillivray from his Spanish connections, 
and confirming him the friend, and perhaps the useful agent, of the United States, is not a difficult or 
improbable measure. 
</p><p>
To you. Sir, I have been repeatedly requested to 
suggest these opinions. From the weight and influence of your character and situation, much is very 
properly expected. As the organ, therefore, of a 
growing and important territory, whose future population and consequence depend upon the friendship 
and intercourse of their Indian neighbours, I entreat 
the early and earnest attention of the General Government, to whom, with great propriety, the sole 
management of Indian affairs is now committed. I am 
the more anxious on this point, because, on the renewal of hostilities in June last, the Executive of 
Georgia, in virtue of the Union, made a formal requisition on me for the aid of this State. Fortunately, 
a truce was concluded before it was necessary to interfere. 
</p><p>
When I consider the number and force of the hostile Indian tribes ; how formidably their number might 
be increased, should the same intrigues induce the 
Choctaws to join them; how much the power of the 
Indian nations must be increased by the arrangement 
of their affairs being in the hands of such a man as 
Mr. McGillivray ; and how amply they are assisted 
by the Spanish Court, not only in stores and money, 
but even in the aid of disciplinarians, to introduce as 
much order as Indians are capable of receiving ; — 
when I add to these the little that is to be obtained 
l)y a ^Yar, and the distresses and expenses it must occasion, you will pardon, I am sure, the anxiety I am 
under to have a permanent and solid peace. No 
State arrangement, no truce, no partial compromise, 
will be sufficient. They must be taught to revere 
the justice of the Union, and look up to it as the 
sole means of giving to them a lasting treaty, and 
the secure possession of their real rights. 
</p><p>
So much for business of a public nature. Permit 
me now to thank you for the many marks of regard 
I received while with you in <a href='/results.php?year=1787'>1787</a>; particularly in 
furnishing me with introductory letters to your friends 
in Europe, had I pursued the route I at that time 
intended. Although I have hitherto been prevented, 
by marrying, and being requested by my friends to 
accept the GoA^ernment, I have by no means given it 
up altogether. 
</p><p>
My term of office will expire in a twelvemonth, 
when, if nothing prevents, I shall endeavour to execute my former plan. I am strengthened in this idea 
by the wish of my wife to revisit that part of the 
world. She is the daughter of Mr. Laurens, and sister to your former Aid-de-camp, our deceased and 
much-lamented friend. Colonel John Laurens. From 
the age of seven to fourteen, she was educated in 
France, and, until she came to this country, remained 
in England ; so that her accurate knowledge of the 
French language, and acquaintance with their customs, will be extremely useful, should curiosity or 
business make it necessary for me to go there, or to 
any of the neighbouring States of Europe. 
</p><p>
From your late tour we are flattered with the hope 
of your one day visiting this country. Whenever 
you so fjxr honor us, I am sure that every thing in 
our power will be done to render your visit pleasing 
.and agreeable to you. I am, with the sincerest respect and esteem, 
</p><p>
Dear Sh', your truly much obliged, 
</p><p>
Charles Pinckney.

FROM JONATH.iN TRUMBULL, JR. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=lebanon' rel='city'>Lebanon</a>, 15 <a rel="month origin" value="11">November</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1783' rel="origin">1783</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
It may be a matter of curiosity to your Excellency to see the address of Governor Trumbull to the General Assembly and freemen of the State, declining 
any further election to public office. As such, I take the liberty to inclose it to you, with the reply of the Legislature on the occasion. 
</p><p>
To show your Excellency the cautious jealousy of our Legislature, which takes its tone from the people, 
and has arisen to a pitch of very extraordinary excess, I inclose also a paragraph, which was reported 
by a Committee of the General Assembly, as part of their reply, but which was rejected by the lower 
House of Assembly, lest, by adopting it, they should seem to convey to the people an idea of their concurring with the political sentiments contained in the 
address; — so excessively jealous is the spirit of this State at present, respecting the powers and the engagements of Congress, arising principally from their 
aversion to the half-pay and commutation granted to the army. Principally, I say, arising from this cause, because it is but too true that some few are wicked 
enough to hope that, by means of this clamor, they may be able to rid themselves of the whole public debt, by introducing so much confusion and disorder 
into public measures as shall eventually produce a general abolition of the whole. 
</p><p>
Lamentable as this idea is, I fear the sentiment is 
but too growing a one. What from the interested 
motives of some, and the wicked designs of others, 
there is too much reason to apprehend its prevalence. 
But <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> is wise; and that same Divine superintendence, which has so remarkably watched over 
our Revolution, will, I trust, still guard us from the 
machinations of wicked men, and prevent the fatal 
consequences of the ill-judged policy of interested and 
designing ones. 
</p><p>
You will pardon me. Sir, for troubling you with this gloomy tale. For myself, I have not lost my 
confidence in the final issue of our political establishment ; and your Excellency's firmness and resolution I know to be superior to any desponding ideas. I 
give it to you, as the present temper of the people only, which, though for a time misled by the artful, interested, and contracted views of the designing part 
of the community, too many of whom, mounted upon the hobby-horse of the day, have rode into confidence, yet must take a turn soon, overcome by the superior 
good sense of the virtuous part of the public, some of whom already begin to perceive the delusion. 
</p><p>
Our Assembly, who did nothing in their last session, stand adjourned to January. The popular clamor 
against commutation, which alone prevented a compliance with the recommendations of Congress, is on 
the decline ; and it is hoped that the next Assembly, following the example of Massachusetts, will pass the impost without restriction. 
</p><p>
I expect this will reach your Excellency at your own seat; the long wished-for place of your retreat 
from public cares and business. In this happy retirement may you enjoy many pleasant days and years of unenvied felicity, partaking every domestic and 
social happiness that your exalted virtues and merits so justly entitle you to ! May I beg your Excellency 
to present my most respectful compliments and regards to Mrs. Washington, for whose health and future happiness I feel a very particular desire. With 
the most respectful attachment and sincere regard, I have the honor to be, Sir, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and obliged humble servant, 
</p><p>
Jonathan Tkumbull, Jk. 
</p><p>
P. S. I have in charge to convey to you the Governor's very sincere respects and compliments, with his earnest wishes for your future health, prosperity, and every felicity.

FROM THEODORIC BLAND, IN CONGRESS. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city origin'>Philadelphia</a>, 25 <a rel="month origin" value="3">March</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1783' rel="origin">1783</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
Many events have lately occurred, which have occasioned me to trouble your Excellency with my 
correspondence of a private nature. I now take the 
liberty of writing to you, by desire of a Committee, 
of which I have the honor to be one, to whom your 
very interesting despatches to Congress, of the 15th 
of this month, were committed. 
</p><p>
You will, without doubt, have been informed. Sir, 
and have received with pleasure the intelligence, of 
the vote for the commutation having passed Congress, 
the same day on which your Excellency's despatches, 
containing the truly sensible and patriotic resolutions 
of the officers of the army, convened by your Excellency's authority, were received. On that happy 
event I most cordially congratulate you. Sir, and my 
quondam brother officers. I think it must give the 
most sensible pleasure to every friend of this country, that an event so interesting should take place 
at the very moment that a certainty of peace was 
announced ; and that the civil and military, at that 
critical juncture, should so harmonize on the capital 
object of their wishes. This event will, I trust, eradicate from the minds of every generous and thinking man in the United States, in whatever station he 
may be, every vestige of suspicion, which those of 
an opposite complexion might have endeavoured to 
implant. 
</p><p>
If my conceptions of the sense of Congress are 
right, I think I can assure your Excellency, that all 
those suspicions, which may have been entertained of 
want of gratitude to the army, or a desire to do 
them complete and ample justice, are totally groundless. Your Excellency, I hope, knows too well my 
candor to imagine I would attempt to deceive. If I 
have built my opinions, on this head, on an erroneous idea of Congress, the moment such error is discovered by me, I shall think myself unpardonable not 
to disclose it You will perceive, Sir, by the inclosed 
rough copies, numbers One and Two, which the Committee have had under their consideration, what is 
their sense, and, what they have reason to think is 
the sense of Congress. We have thought it necessary to make to you. Sir, a confidential communication of our sentiments, in hopes that you will favor 
us with your opinion thereon at large. 
</p><p>
Our doubt arises solely from this consideration, 
namely, — that the enormous expense of keeping the 
whole army in the field, until their " accounts are liquidated, the balances accurately ascertained, and funds 
established for the payment" would be productive of 
the most ruinous consequences to the United States ; 
might occasion clamors among the citizens, embarrass 
the measures which Congress mean to take, and so 
affect their finances as to render it impossible to 
comply with what the army most desire, namely, a 
punctual discharge of the debt due to them on settlement. Your Excellency will, I think, require no 
argument to show the force of these observations. 
</p><p>
I will say nothing of the effects, which ever have and ever will arise from keeping a large army in the 
field, in a state of inactivity, without any other object to employ their minds on, than their past sufferings and present distresses ; a relief of which must be 
inevitably removed to a further distance by the very 
means they appear to point out to procure it. Although the resolutions of the army, on the address to 
them by your Excellency, are perfectly explicit, and 
breathe the most entire confidence in the justice of 
Congress, and the sincere intentions of that body towards them ; yet, lest some latent spark of suspicion, 
undiscovered by the Convention, should unexpectedly 
discover itself, and lay hold of an ambiguous expression, or even the silence of Congress on some material point, does not your Excellency conceive an explicit and full declaration of Congress, not only of 
their intentions to do ample justice, but of the mode 
by which it is to be done, as far as depends on 
them, will be proper ? Should you. Sir, think proper 
to offer any amendment to either of the inclosed resolutions, or to start any new idea, that may be 
thought more effectual than those they contain, you 
may be assured of their being laid before the Committee in the most confidential manner, and of receiving all possible attention. 
</p><p>
Although I write now at the request of the Committee, you will be pleased to consider this communication as not of a public, or official nature, and communicable only to those in whom the most entire confidence is reposed. I need not inform your Excellency of the earnest desire which the Committee have 
to make their report on this subject as speedily as 
possible, as you are fully apprised of the necessity 
of it, rendered, in my opinion, the more necessary, by 
the great and glorious event, which has been so lately 
announced to us of a general peace ; on "wliicli occasion, I most cordially and sincerely congratulate your 
Excellency, with an assurance that peace or war will 
never change in me the unalterable affection and 
esteem, with which I am your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient, and most humble servant, . 
</p><p>
Theodorig Bland. 
</p><p>
P. S. You will excuse. Sir, the hasty manner in 
which this has been written, as a fear of losing the 
opportunity by the post has deprived me of the power 
of revising it.

FROM THEODORIC BLAND, IN CONGRESS. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city origin'>Philadelphia</a>, 16 <a rel="month origin" value="4">April</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1783' rel="origin">1783</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been honored with your Excellency's two favors of the 31st ultimo and the 4th instant ; the 
latter, accompanied with your full and explicit answer 
on the subject on which I addressed your Excellency 
in my last, at the request of the Committee. It has 
been, according to your desire, communicated to Colonel Hamilton and the other members who compose 
the Committee, confidentially, and is now under consideration. We have conferred with the Superintendent of Finance, and be assured our utmost endeavours shall not be wanting to bring to a speedy, 
and, I hope happy conclusion, the objects your Excellency has pointed to with so much clearness, candor, and energy. 
Confident I am, that there is every disposition in 
Congress to appreciate the services and sufferings of 
the army — unquestionably the most meritorious class 
of citizens in this long, and, at length, successful contest. I am not less persuaded, in my own mind, that 
what depends on the States respectively, to put the 
finishing hand to a complete compensation of their 
long and meritorious services and sufferings, will be 
cheerfully complied with. But these, Sir, are the expectations, or opinions, of an individual strongly impressed, and ardently (perhaps too sanguinely) hoping 
for that desirable event ; in which expectation if I 
am disappointed, I shall, with you. Sir, have to lament the most fatal infatuation and the grossest ingratitude, that ever seized the heads, or corrupted 
the hearts of a nation and its counsels, towards a 
body of men to whom they owe their political existence, and all those blessings which every good man 
wishes to see flow from our Union and independence. 
</p><p>
We hope to have the answer to-morrow from the 
Superintendent of Finance, on the practicability of 
the measure, which, should it be even in the negative (which I do not expect), I think I can assure 
your Excellency, such is the interest the Committee 
take in the welfare of the army, that they will not 
stop in their endeavours to devise such measures as 
may, in the end, prove as beneficial and satisfactory 
as those which your Excellency has thought of, if in 
their power. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's observations on the necessity of 
establishing a national character, stamped with the 
indelible traits of justice, gratitude, and faith, carry 
with them the irresistible force of conviction, and 
meet with my most cordial concurrence. Nor have I 
a doubt that, when the tumult of war has subsided. 
this enlightened country, although at present young 
in politics, will soon discover the importance and 
truth of your observation, and adopt it as the surest 
basis on which must be founded the future greatness 
and prosperity of these rising and important States. 
It is with infinite pleasure that I think I have observed such ideas succeeding rapidly to those of 
chicane, which so strongly marked the counsels, as 
well as manners, of the people at large in the days 
of paper and depreciation. 
</p><p>
From these considerations, I am led to form the 
most pleasing augury of our future greatness and respectability among nations, which has, in a great 
measure, dispelled the fears and bodings of those 
evils, which a jarring of interests among so many 
sovereignties, united in one federal chain, seemed to threaten. I am happy to think, that local interests 
and ijrcjudices loill give imy to a great and general good, ivJien clearly seen and well understood, and 'prudently and 
constitutionally jmrsued. These, Sir, are, in my apprehension, the grand objects of our general council ; a 
steady pursuit of which, without turning to the right 
or to the left, from local considerations, party animosity, partial views, or corrupt influence, will certainly 
guide the vessel of the State to a safe anchorage, 
and reward the pilots with the estimation and applause of their fellow citizens, and the admiration and 
respect of foreign powers. 
</p><p>
I am happy to inform your Excellency, that a requisition to the States, on such principles as the Federal Constitution will authorize, if adopted, and on 
such liberal principles as I hope will facilitate, if not 
insure, the adoption, is now so far advanced as to be 
on the point of its passing through Congress, which 
will afford the means of providing ample and permanent funds for the payment of the interest^ not only 
to our army, but to foreign and domestic creditors 
of every description, as well as for sinking the principal. I cannot here omit suggesting to your Excellency, that your personal interest with some of the 
leading members of our Legislature, and perhaps with 
some of the other States, might give a happy turn 
to those requisitions when they are laid before the 
Assemblies ; especially if grounded on the feelings 
and true situation of the army, with which you, Sir, 
are universally acknowledged to be better acquainted, 
and more conversant, than any other person can possibly be. 
</p><p>
Embarked in the same cause, and, I flatter myself, 
on the same principle as your Excellency, I hope I 
need not apologize for the length of my letter, as its 
contents will fully demonstrate the interest I have 
in the successful issue of our common endeavours, 
that peace shall not arise without its blessings, content and happiness, to those by whose exertions it 
has been principally procured. Nor need I give an 
additional proof, I hope, of that entire confidence and 
esteem with which I am, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
Theodoric Bland. 
</p><p>
P. S. I have not yet received any answer from 
Sir Guy Carleton to my letter, which you were so 
obliging as to send in. Should I receive it, I shall 
certainly communicate its contents to your Excellency ; or should any letter come from him through 
your hands, directed to me, your Excellency will be 
pleased to open and peruse it, for your satisfaction 
on the subject you mention.

<a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, 16 <a rel="month origin" value="4">April</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1783' rel="origin">1783</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
In making military arrangements for a peace, a 
possible war has the first consideration; next, our 
finances; but I should suppose the necessary dispositions and institutions need not be expensive. If the 
system is perfect in its formation and execution, it 
will have' such effects on the minds of those who are, 
or wish to be, our enemies, as to deter them from 
hostilities and even from secret machinations. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a> has been held as the key of the United 
States. The British viewed it in the same point of 
light, and will, it is presumed, keep their eye upon 
it, as long as they regret the loss of the country, or 
have a passion for power and conquest. <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a> 
is exposed to a coiip-de-main, and ought therefore to 
be always in a complete condition of defence. With 
a little more expense than that of maintaining a garrison of five hundred or six hundred men, it may be 
made a safe deposit where every military article may 
be kept in good order and repair; and, with a small 
additional expense, an academy might be here instituted for instruction in all the branches of the military art. 
</p><p>
To provide the garrison, in the first instance, retain 
the three years' men until their terms of service expire. In the mean time take boys of fourteen years 
of age, of whom there will be a sufficient number 
among the poor, whose circumstances will compel 
them; if not, among the middle and higher ranks, 
whose inclination will lead them, to engage for seven 
years for the sake of subsistence, clothing, mechanical 
trades, and other useful learning; and to devote a 
part of their time to arms and garrison fatigue. 
</p><p>
The next, and perhaps only other object worthy the attention ,of Congress, are some barriers against 
the Indians. The first measures with relation to them 
will make deep and lasting impressions, and ought 
therefore to be taken "with caution. In the first instance, as large a body of troops as the British 
usually kept up in their country, would from us give 
them no alarm or uneasiness ; but, whatever the Indians may think, it will behoove us to keep pace with 
the British, so far as to secure the country from their 
encroachments, awe the Indians, protect and enjoy 
their trade. Five or six hundred regular troops, in 
the western country, may be sufficient for those purposes, and at the same time greatly facilitate the 
settlement of it; and that, in turn, will supersede 
the necessity of regular troops in that quarter. 
</p><p>
I am, &c., 
</p><p>
Jedediah Huntington.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have had the honor to receive, by the hands of 
Major-General Baron de Steuben, your Excellency's 
letter of the 12th of July last, communicatmg to me 
your having received instructions from the Congress 
of the United States to make pro^Dor arrangements 
with the Commanders-in-chief of the British forces in 
America, for receiving possession of the posts in the 
United States, occupied by the troops of His Britannic 
Majesty, agreeably to the seventh article of the provisional treaty ; and your having appointed the Baron 
de Steuben to form the said arrangements with me, 
for receiving the posts and fortresses under my direction ; and also acquainting me, that the Baron is 
charged with instructions from your Excellency to 
visit the posts within the boundary of the United 
States upon the river St. Lawrence and the Lakes 
above, for the purpose of having a report made to 
you of the measures necessary for the garrisoning and 
support of them. 
</p><p>
In answer to your Excellency's letter, I beg leave 
to assure you. Sir, that few things would afford me 
greater pleasure than to manifest my readiness to 
comply with your Excellency's wishes, as far as it is 
consistent with my duty. Persuaded that your Excellency does not expect I should do more, I proceed 
to acquaint you, that His Majesty's proclamation, declaring a cessation of hostilities with the powers at 
war, and particular orders to comply with it, are the 
only instructions I have yet received upon the important subject of peace. Thus situated, a strict observance of my duty, and of the rules of war practised by all nations, leaves me no alternative, but 
that of deferring a compliance with your requests, 
until I shall be properly authorized to receive them. 
While I regret the unavoidable disappointment, 
which the Baron de Steuben has met with in the 
execution of your Excellency's commands, I feel myself indebted to an occurrence, which has procured to 
me the acquaintance of an officer of so much repute 
in the line of his profession, and who stands so high 
in your Excellency's esteem. 
</p><p>
As the Baron will communicate to your Excellency 
the substance of our conversation upon the subject 
of his commission, I shall add no more here, than to 
assure your Excellency that every measure, which 
obedience to the commands of my sovereign, and the 
most humane inclinations, could suggest, and which the 
indefatigable endeavours of my officers serving in the 
upper country, and the force of presents, could effect, 
has been unweariedly employed in restraining the 
Indians, and reconciling them to peace. And it is 
with sincere pleasure, I acquaint your Excellency, 
that my efforts have been completely successful, notwithstanding the hostile attempts, which were made 
against the upper country, long after their happy 
effects had been experienced upon the frontiers. I 
have the honor to be. Sir, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient, and most humble servant,

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Since my last, nothing new has occurred. I suppose the crippled state of Congress is not new to 
you. We have only nine States present, eight of 
whom are represented by two members each; and of 
course, on all great questions, not only a unanimity 
of States, but of members, is necessary; a unanimity 
which can never be obtained on a matter of any importance. The consequence is, that we are wasting 
our time and labor in vain efforts to do business. 
Nothing less than the presence of thirteen States, represented by an odd number of delegates, will enable 
us to get forward a single capital point. 
</p><p>
The deed for the cession of western territory by 
Virginia, was executed and accepted on the 1st instant. I hope our country will, of herself, determine 
to cede still further to the meridian of the mouth of 
the great Kenhawa. Further she cannot govern ; so 
far is necessary for her own well-being. The reasons 
which call for this boundary (which will retain all 
the waters of the Kenhawa) are, — that within that 
are our lead mines. Secondly, this river, rising in 
North Carolina, traverses our whole latitude, and offers 
to every part of it a channel for navigation and commerce to the western country. But, thirdly, it is a 
channel which cannot be opened but at immense expense, and "with every facility which an absolute 
power over both shores will give. Fourthly, this 
river, and its waters, form a band of good land, 
passing along our whole frontier, and forming on it 
a barrier, which will be strongly seated. Fifthly, for 
one hundred and eighty miles beyond these waters 
is a mountainous barren, which can never be inhabited, and will of course form a safe separation between 
us and any other State. Sixthly, this tract of country lies more convenient to receive its government 
from Virginia than from any other State. Seventhly, 
it will preserve to us all the upper parts of Youghiogany and Cheat Rivers, within which much will 
be to be done, to open these, which are the true 
doors to the western commerce. 
</p><p>
The union of this navigation with that of the Potomac is a subject on which I mentioned that I 
would take the liberty of writing to you. I am sure 
its value and practicability are both well known to 
you. This is the moment, however, for seizing it, if 
ever we mean to have it. All the world is becoming" 
commercial. Was it practicable to keep our nev/ 
empire separated from them, we might indulge ourselves in speculating whether commerce contributes 
to the happiness of mankind. But we cannot separate ourselves from them. Our citizens have had too 
full a taste of the comforts furnished by the arts and 
manufactures, to be debarred the use of them. We 
must then, in our own defence, endeavour to share 
as large a portion as we can of this modern source 
of wealth and power. That offered to us from the 
western country is under a competition between 
the Hudson, the Potomac, and the Mississippi itself 
DoW'U the last, will pass all heavy commodities ; but 
the navigation through the Gulf of Mexico is so 
dangerous, and that up the Mississippi so difficult 
and tedious, that it is not probable that European 
merchandise will return through that channel. It is 
most likely that flour, lumber, and other heavy articles, will be floated on rafts, which will be themselves an article of sale as well as their loading; the 
navigators returning by land, or in light bateaux. 
</p><p>
There will, therefore, be a rivalship between the 
Hudson and the Potomac, for the residue of the commerce of all the country westward of Lake Erie, on 
the waters of the Lakes, of the Ohio and upper parts 
of the Mississippi. To go to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, that part of 
the trade, which comes from the Lakes or their waters, 
must first be brought into Lake Erie. So also must 
that which comes from the waters of the Mississippi, 
and of course must cross at some portage into the 
waters of the Lakes. When it shall have entered 
Lake Erie, it must coast along its southern shore, on 
account of the number and excellence of its harbours ; the northern, though shortest, having few harbours, and these unsafe. Having reached Cuyahoga, 
to proceed on to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, will be nine hundred 
and seventy miles from thence, and five portages; 
whereas it is but four hundred and thirty miles to 
<a href='/results.php?city=alexandria' rel='city'>Alexandria</a>, if it turns into the Cuyahoga, and passes 
through that, Big Beaver, Ohio, Youghiogany (or Monongalia and Cheat), and Potomac, and there are but 
two portages for the trade of the Ohio, or that which 
shall come into it from its own waters or the Mississippi. It is nearer to <a href='/results.php?city=alexandria' rel='city'>Alexandria</a> than to New 
York by seven hundred and thirty miles, and is interrupted by one portage only. Nature then has declared in favor of the Potomac ; and through that 
channel offers to pour into our lap the whole commerce of the western world. But, unfortunately, the channel bj the Hudson is already open and known 
in practice ; ours is still to be opened. This is the 
moment in which the trade of the west will begin to 
get into motion, and to take its direction. It behooves us, then, to open our doors to it. 
</p><p>
I have lately pressed this subject on my friends 
in the General Assembly, proposing to them to endeavour to have a tax laid, which shall bring into a 
separate chest from five to ten thousand pounds a 
year, to be employed, first, in opening the upper 
waters of the Ohio and Potomac, where a little 
money and time will do a great deal, leaving the 
Great Falls for the last part of the work. To remove 
the idea of partiality, I have suggested the propriety 
and justice of continuing this fund, till all the rivers 
shall be cleared successively. But a most powerful 
objection always arises to propositions of this kind. 
It is, that public undertakings are carelessly managed, 
and much money spent to little purpose. To obviate 
this objection is the puipose of my giving you the 
trouble of this discussion. You have retired from 
public life ; you have weighed this determination, and 
it would be impertinence in me to touch it. But 
would the superintendence of this w^ork break in too 
much on the sweets of retirement and repose ? 
</p><p>
If they would, I stop here. Your future time and 
wishes are sacred in my eye. If it would be only a 
dignified amusement to you, what a monument of 
your retirement would it be ! It is one which would 
follow that of your public life, and bespeak it the 
work of the same great hand. I am confident, that 
would you either alone, or jointly with any persons 
you think proper, be willing to direct this business, 
it would remove the only objection, the weight of 
which I apprehend. Though the tax should not come in till the fall, its proceeds should he anticipated by 
borrowing from some other fund, to enable the work 
to be begun this summer. When you view me as 
not owning, nor ever having a prospect of owning, 
one inch of land, on any water, either of the Potomac or Ohio, it will tend to apologize for the trouble 
I have given you of this long letter, by showing, 
that my zeal in this business is public and pure. 
The best atonement for the time I have occupied 
you, will be, not to add to it longer than while I 
assure you of the sincerity and esteem with which I 
have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
Thomas Jefferson. 
</p><p>
P. S. The hurry of time, in my former letter, 
prevented my thanking you for your polite and 
friendly invitation to <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>. I shall certainly pay my respects there to Mrs. Washington and

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The sanction given by your favor of the 12th instant to my desire of remunerating the genius which 
produced "Common Sense/' led to a trial for the purpose. The gift first proposed was a moiety of the 
tract on the Eastern Shore, known by the name of 
"The Secretary's land." The easy reception it found 
induced the friends of the measure to add the other 
moiety to the proposition, which would have raised 
the market value of the donation to about four thousand pounds, or upwards, though it would not, probably, have commanded a rent of more than one 
hundred pounds per annum. In this form, the bill 
passed through two readings. The third reading proved that the tide had suddenly changed, for the bill 
was thrown out by a large majority. An attempt 
was next made to sell the land in question, and apply two thousai^d pounds of the money to the purchase of a farm for Mr. Paine. This was lost by a 
single voice. 
</p><p>
Whether a greater disposition to reward patriotic 
and distinguished exertions of genius, will be found 
on any succeeding occasion, is not for me to predetermine. Should it finally appear that the merits of 
the man, whose writings have so much contributed to 
infuse and foster the spirit of independence in the 
people of America, are unable to inspire them with a 
just beneficence, the world, it is to be feared, will 
give us as little credit for our policy as for our 
gratitude in this particular. The wish of Mr. Paine 
to be provided for by separate acts of the States, 
rather than by Congress, is, I think, a natural and 
just one. In the latter case, it might be construed 
into the wages of a mercenary writer; in the former, 
it would look like the returns of gratitude for voluntary services. Upon the same principle, the mode 
wished by Mr. Paine ought to be preferred by the 
States themselves. 
</p><p>
I beg the favor of you to present my respectful 
compliments to Mrs. Washington, and to be assured 
that I am, with the profoundest respect and sincerest 
</p><p>
regard, &c., &c.,

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
After I had the pleasure of seeing you in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, I made an excursion to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and from 
thence up the North River as far as <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>. One 
motive for extending my tour so far that course, was 
to visit the springs in the vicinity of <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>, which 
I recollected you once recommended to me as a remedy for the rheumatism. They are now much frequented by the uncivilized peoJ)le of the back country; but very few others resort to them, as there is 
but one small hut within several miles of the place. 
Colonel Armstrong and myself spent one week there, 
which was equal to a little campaign ; for the accommodations were very wretched, and provisions 
exceedingly scarce. The country about the springs 
being uncultivated, we were forced to send to the 
borders of the Hudson for what was necessary for 
our subsistence. 
</p><p>
During our stay, we made a few little experiments 
on the waters. Bark of a restringent quality turned 
them to a purple color very suddenly, and we thought 
that iron was discoverable even to the taste. They 
have certainly a very great quantity of salts. A 
quart of the water, boiled down, produced a spoonful, which being diluted in common water, there remained on the surface a quantity of insijoid, tasteless 
matter, like chalk, which we collected ; then x^ouring 
off the water into a clean vessel, we found remaining at the bottom something like slacked lime. The 
water, in which the first production was diluted, being boiled down, produced half a spoonful of very 
acute salt. But that which distinguishes these waters, 
in a very conspicuous degree, from all others, is the 
great quantity of fixed air which they contain. They 
are exceedingly pungent to the taste, and, after being 
drank a short time, will often affect the nose like 
brisk, bottled ale. The water will raise flour sooner 
than any other thing, and cannot be confined so that 
the air will not, some how or other, escape. Several 
persons told us that they had corked it tight in 
bottles, and that the bottles brake. We tried it with 
the only bottle we had, which did not break, but the 
air found its way through a wooden stopper, and the 
wax with which it was sealed. A trout died in the 
water in less than a minute, or seemed dead, but recovered in common water. This experiment was repeated with the same effect. We observed, in digging, 
that the rocks which are about the springs, and 
which, in one or two places, project themselves above 
the earth in a conic form, go not deep into the 
ground, but are formed by the waters, which (the 
man who lives at the plafce informed us) overflow 
once per month, when not disturbed, and the earthy 
parts, being exposed to the air and sun, petrify, and 
increase. This opinion is strengthened by the shells 
and bodies of insects which we found in broken 
parts of the rock. 
</p><p>
I have given you my observations, because, I 
think, you told me what you knew of these extraordinary springs was from information. 
</p><p>
At Clermont, Mrs. Livingston charged me with a 
letter for Mrs. Washington, and with her most respectful compliments to you, Sir. All that amiable 
family joined in affectionate compliments to 3'on, and 
to Mrs. Washington; and I beg you will permit me 
to add my own.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
This day's post brought me your favor of the 11th, 
which I have the pleasure of answering from <a href='/results.php?city=annapolis' rel='city'>Annapolis</a>, having been prevented leaving Maryland by a 
variety of occurrences in the last week. I think, 
however, I shall, at all events, get away in the course 
of the next week, and probably so early as to complete my journey to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
</p><p>
I thank you for your opinions. They concur perfectly with my own sentiments on those subjects, 
and, I am sorry to add, there is too much truth in 
your observation on the management of our affairs. 
Let the blame fall where it ought, — on those, whose 
attachment to State views, State interests, and State 
prejudices, is so great, as to render them eternally 
opposed to every measure that can be devised for 
the public good. The evil is not, however, as yet, 
entirely incurable. I hope and trust the next Congress will be more willing and able to avert the mischiefs that appear to me to threaten the Union. If 
that cannot be done, we must look about, and see if 
some more efficient form of government cannot be 
devised. I have long entertained my doubts of the 
present form, even if the States were all disposed to 
be honest, and am sorry to say, such a conclusion 
would, how^ever, be against premises. I will determine nothing rashly, and hope for the best. My most 
strenuous endeavours shall not be wanting to secure 
the peace and stability of the Federal Union, and 
the government, as long as it is possible ; but, I ow^n, 
I shall not hesitate to join in attempting another, 
when I see, from experience, that we have instituted 
is not adequate to the purposes for which it was ordained. Congress either have too little or too much 
power. To be respectable, they must be enabled to 
enforce an obedience to their ordinances ; else why 
the farce of enacting what no State is bound to execute ? If this is denied, Congress is, I think, an unnecessary and useless burden, and should not hold 
from the individual States a great many powers, 
which they cannot exercise, and had better be remitted to the individual sovereignties. Of this, more at 
another time. 1 ask your Excellency's pardon for so 
long trespassing on your patience at this time, without treating the subject more copiously and conclusively. 
</p><p>
Colonel H. J. Laurens is arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>; is 
seven weeks from London, and brings advices, that 
the King and IMinistry of Great Britain are very 
favorably disposed towards the United States, and 
wish to have a liberal commercial treaty. 
</p><p>
The Marquis de Lafayette came to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> on 
the 9th instant. Advices from our Ministers abroad, 
by his hands, were by him delivered to Mr. Mifflin, 
at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and are not yet come to hand. 
</p><p>
What think you of the State of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> undertaking to hold a treaty, of its own authority, with 
the Six Nations, in defiance of our resolves, and the 
clause of the Confederation restricting the individual 
States ? The Governor is actually now at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> for 
the purpose. Such a step will render all our endeavours abortive, and be attended with worse consequences, with respect to the Indians, than almost any 
other that State could take. It is said to be under 
an express law of the State. If this conduct is to 
be pursued, our Commissioners are rendered useless. 
As long as the savages believe there are distinct, independent, and perhaps jealous powers, to treat with 
them, they will certainly avail themselves of the circumstance, much to the disadvantage of the Union. 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> has taken no steps, with regard to the 
troops required for garrisoning the north-western frontier.

I beg my best respects to your lady, and that you 
will always believe me to be, &c., &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Every thing on this side the water seems to indicate a certainty of war. The Emperor seems decided 
in not receding from the right to navigate the Scheldt, 
and the Dutch as determined not to yield it. I suppose that this Court, and that of Berlin, will take 
part with the Dutch. The Turks, of course, become 
"parties in a war against the Emperor; and it seems 
as probable that the Empress of Russia will join him. 
</p><p>
There are many who believe he will yet retract; but 
every public appearance is against this supposition. 
I own myself astonished he should have gone so far; 
but I should be more so, were he now to retire. He 
is indeed in a perilous predicament. If he recedes, 
his character, which his public acts have placed on 
very high ground, dwindles to that of a petty bully, 
and is marked, as his enemies denote it, with eccentricity and inconsistence. If he persists, the probable 
combination against him seems to threaten his ruin. 
When the season arrives for opening a campaign, we 
shall know decidedly, and probably not before. 
</p><p>
The disposition of Great Britain does not seem 
very favorable to us; all information from thence represents the people, and still more the merchants, as 
extremely hostile. I think it probable we shall take 
a trip to that Court, in order to bring their intentions to a decided issue. It seems probable, also, 
that Spain will refuse to treat at this place, and 
oblige us to visit Madrid. I had lately a letter from 
Mr. Carmichael, at Madrid. He informs me that a 
Mr. Harrison, of Cadiz, had, on your behalf, applied 
to him to procure permission to send you a jack of 
the best race ; and that, on his making the application, the King had ordered two of the very best 
to be procured and sent you as a mark of his respect. Besides the pleasure I receive from every 
testimonial of this kind, I view this present as likely 
to be of great public utility. I had before intended 
to endeavour to procure a male of that race, but shall 
now change my object to the procuring one or more 
females, that we may be enabled to propagate and 
preserve the breed. Should I go to Spain, I shall 
surely be able to effect this. 
</p><p>
The Executive of our State have remitted to Dr. Franklin and myself the care of having the statue 
made, which the Assembly directed as a mark of 
their gratitude to you. I was unwell when I received 
the letter, and have not yet been able to see and 
confer with Dr. Franklin on the subject. I find that 
a Monsieur Houdon, of this place, possesses the reputation of being the first statuary in the Vv^orld. I 
sent for him, and had some conversation with him on 
the subject. He thinks it cannot be perfectly done 
from a picture ; and is so enthusiastically fond of being the executor of this work, that he offers to go 
himself to America for the purpose of forming your 
bust from the life, leaving all his business here in the 
mean time. He thinks that being three weeks with 
you would suffice to make his model of plaister, with 
which he will return here ; and the work will employ 
him three years. If Dr. Franklin concurs with me, 
we shall send him over, not having time to ask your 
permission, and await your answer. I trust that, having given to your country so much of your time 
heretofore, you will add the short space which this 
operation will require to enable them to transmit to 
posterity the form of the person whose actions will 
be delivered to them by history. Monsieur Houdon 
is at present engaged in making a statue of the 
King of France. A bust of Voltaire, executed by 
him, is said to be one of the first in the world.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I received yesterday your letter of the 5th; and, 
as the subject therein referred to belongs to the department of Foreign Affiiirs, I have transmitted it to 
]Mr. Jay. 
</p><p>
I have no doubt but the Minister, who is to negotiate with the Court of London, will have occasion 
for the list ; but, as it would not be safe to trust a 
paper of such importance to the common conveyance 
by the post, and as it is proper that you should 
keep either the original or a copy, to prevent a 
chasm in your files, I have taken the liberty of suggesting to Mr. Jay the propriety of sending one of 
his clerks to take a copy, and to bring up either it 
or the original, leaving the other with you. 
</p><p>
The last time I had the pleasure of seeing you, I 
entertained, and, I believe, expressed, a fond hope 
that measures would speedily be adopted to enable 
you, without much trouble, and without putting you 
to any expense, to have your files arranged, copied, 
and secured, so as to be preserved from danger or 
accident. I consider them as invaluable documents, 
from which future historians will derive light and 
knowledge. I consider it as a most fortunate circumstance, that, through all your dangers and difficulties, 
you have happily preserved them entire. And although the adjournment which took place last summer, and the subsequent removal since the meeting 
in November, have prevented Congress from adopting 
the measure I wished, yet I trust they will, at a 
convenient time, attend to the subject, and take proper steps for preserving so invaluable a treasure. 
</p><p>
I am now busily employed in preparations for the

Sir, 
</p><p>
As the manuscript papers of General Lee, after his 
decease, came into my hands, I have been induced, 
from several motives, to arrange and prepare them 
for publication. The General, in his lifetime, requested it from me ; and my profession, as a printer and 
bookseller, made it an object of interest worthy my 
attention. But, as I cannot be ignorant of some unhappy differences which subsisted between your Excellency and General Lee, I have thought proper to 
acquaint your Excellency with my conduct in this 
business. 
</p><p>
Influenced by no party consideration, and altogether devoid of any sinister intention of exalting one 
character at the expense of another, I have taken 
care to suppress many passages that might be offensive in the General's pieces and correspondence. 
While it was my duty to preserve what was useful 
in military and political knowledge, I took the liberty to suppress such expressions as appeared to be 
the ebullitions of a disappointed and irritated mind; 
so that I flatter myself your Excellency will be convinced of the candor of my intention in the execution of the work. Inclosed I have sent a copy of 
the title-page, and the proposals are now preparing 
for the press. In a few weeks I purpose to send 
them to your Excellency; and in the mean time

Dear Sir, .

Mr. Houdon would much sooner have had the honor of attending you, but for a spell of sickness 
which long gave us to despair of his recovery, and 
from which he is but recently recovered. He comes 
now for the purpose of lending the aid of his art to

it, being employed from all parts of Europe in whatever is capital. He has had a difficulty to withdraw 
himself from the Empress of Russia; a difficulty, 
however, w^iich arose from a desire to show her respect, but which never gave him a moment's hesitation about his present voyage, which he considers as 
promising the brightest chapter of his history. I 
have spoke of him as an artist only; but I can assure you also that, as a man, he is disinterested, generous, and candid, and panting after glory ; in every 
circumstance, meriting your good opinion. He will 
have need to see you much while he shall have the 
honor of being with you, which you can the more 
freely admit, as Lis eminence and merit give him 
admittance into genteel societies here. He will need 
an interpreter. I supposed you could procure some 
person from <a href='/results.php?city=alexandria' rel='city'>Alexandria</a>, who might be agreeable to 
yourself, to perform this office. He brings with him 
a subordinate workman or two, who, of course, will 
associate w4th their own class only. 
</p><p>
On receiving the favor of your letter of February 
25th, I communicated the plan for clearing the Potomac, with the act of Assembly, and an explanation 
of its probable advantages, to Mr. Brand, whose acquaintance and connection with the moneyed men 
here, enabled him best to try its success. He has 
done so ; but to no end. I inclose you his letter. I 
am pleased to hear, in the mean time, that the subscriptions were likely to be filled up at home. This 
is infinitely better, and will render the proceedings 
of the Companies much more harmonious. I place an 
immense importance to my own country on this channel of connection with the new Western States. I 
shall continue uneasy till I know that Virginia has 
assumed her ultimate boundary to the westward. The 
late example of the State of Franklin separated from 
North Carolina, increases my anxieties for Virginia. 
</p><p>
The confidence you are so good as to place in 
me, on the subject of the interest lately given you 
by Virginia, in the Potomac Company, is very flattering to me. But it is distressing, also, inasmuch 
as, to deserve it, it obliges me to give my whole 
opinion. My wishes to see you made perfectly easy, 
by receiving those just returns of gratitude from our 
country, to which you are entitled, would induce 
me to be contented with saying, what is a certain 
truth, that the world would be pleased with seeing 
them heaped on you, and would consider your receiving them as no derogation from your reputation. 
But I must own that the declining them will add to 
that reputation, as it will show that your motives 
have been pure and without alloy. This testimony, 
however, is not wanting either to those who know 
you or who do not. I must therefore repeat, that I 
think the receiving them will not, in the least, lessen 
the respect of the world, if, from any circumstances, 
they would be convenient to you. The candor of 
my communication will find its justification, I know, with you. 
</p><p>
A tolerable certainty of peace leaves little interesting in the way of intelligence. Holland and the 
Emperor will be quiet. If an}'- thing is brewing, it 
is between the latter and the Porte. Nothing in 
prospect, as yet, from England. We shall bring them, 
however, to decision, now that Mr. Adams is received 
there. I wish much to hear that the canal through 
the Dismal [Swamp] is resumed.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
When I review the scenes I passed through in the course of a revolution, which will always distinguish 
the present age, I reflect with great pleasure on those which took place when I was [honored] with your particular friendship and confidence. No man 
has preserved a more uniform esteem and respect for 
you than I have ; and if it is my fault that a correspondence once begun was not continued, it was more 
my misfortune, and the same cause which produced 
both, apologizes for the first, and in my mind has alleviated the last. I did fear giving you trouble and 
interruption, when I knew you was engaged in matters of great magnitude, importance, and difficulty. 
My ambition then gave place to the feelings of regard 
and friendship. Mrs. Washington's letter to Mrs. 
Warren gives me the pleasure of thinking I still possess your recollection, and encourages me to write to 
you, at a time when you have more leisure. 
</p><p>
The war has ended with great glory and advantage 
to our country ; and while I congratulate you and 
America on this event, I am sorry to have so many 
reasons to deplore that want of justice, public spirit, 
and good policy, which are necessary to make a proper improvement of them. Our finances are in a 
wretched situation, and public credit of course on a 
bad footing; and these may finally have a fatal effect 
on the Union, upon which every thing depends. I 
am fully convinced that the abilities of this country, 
properly exerted, are quite equal to the discharge of 
the present debt, and the provision for their future 
s.ecurity ; and I wish, exceedingly, to see some General measures adopted for those purposes. For my own 
part, I could be willing to live in a country, so amply provided with the necessaries and conveniences 
of life, as this is, with little or no foreign trade ; 
but commerce has become so necessary to the power, 
greatness, and reputation of every country, that it 
seems to claim our particular attention, at least in a 
degree subordinate to that of agriculture. And I do not see how it can be conducted, without being subject to some general direction; nor, in that case, can 
I conceive it can be cultivated to advantage, loaded 
and fettered with those illiberal duties and restrictions, 
calculated to raise a revenue, which nov/ in various 
degrees employ the several Legislatures, and distract 
the whole system. 
</p><p>
It is, notwithstanding, some consolation, that, however the politics of America are conducted, if not 
bad in the extreme, the nature of things, and the 
prevailing disposition for improvements, will make us 
a great and probably happy people. Your great plan 
for opening a large and extensive inland navigation 
in Virginia, will be to future generations a standing 
monument of the spirit and enterprise of the present 
age. And while they enjoy the blessings and advantages derived from it, they must recollect with gratitude those who contrived and executed it. After all, 
agriculture is the great basis upon which the whole 
fabric of greatness and happiness, however constructed 
and put together, must stand ; and it affords no small 
pleasure to see such a spirit of inquiry on that subject prevailing. A laudable example is seen in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. Some such measures are thought of here ; 
and, although I hear nothing of that particular kind 
from Virginia, I presume <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a> can exhibit 
many instances of improvement, beneficial to the 
country. 
</p><p>
I have always flattered myself with hopes of seeing you in the Massachusetts after the return of peace. 
May I still expect that pleasure ? Mrs. Warren joins 
me in respects and compliments to your lady and 
yourself 
</p><p>
I am. Sir, &c., &c.

James Warren.

Sir, 
</p><p>
The Court having thought proper to promote M. de 
Marbois to the lutendancy of Hispaniola, has, at the 
same time, intrusted me with the place he had the 
honor to occupy, near the United States of America. 
It is peculiarly flattering to me, in this circumstance, 
to have the advantage of a former acquaintance with 
your Excellency; and I take hold of the first opportunity to recall myself to your kind remembrance. 
</p><p>
On my return to France, I have been a witness of 
the anxiety, with which all orders of citizens expected your arrival there. The Court equally expressed 
the warmest desire to receive a man, who has excited 
the admiration of the present, and will deserve that 
of future, ages. Many personal friends you would 
have met with, in a country so closely united with 
your own, and which seems to be equally indebted 
to your exertions for the tranquillity and happiness 
it now enjoys. Amongst these, the Chevalier de la 
Luzerne is perhaps the most devoted to your Excellency. He enjoined me particularly to remember him 
to you, and to assure you that on his return to 
America, which will probably take place next spring, 
he will be extremely flattered to renew his former 
intimacy. If, in the mean while, I can be of any 
[use] to you at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, or in France, I beg of you 
to dispose of my feeble services, and to be persuaded 
that, in affording me such an opportunity, you confer 
upon me the most flattering favor.

Dear General, 
</p><p>
We have just returned to this place from an unsuccessful attempt to survey the western territory. 
Colonel Parker, who will deliver this, will be able to 
inform your Excellency of the reasons of our not succeeding agreeably to our wishes. I am greatly charmed with the country. It exceeds any I ever saw, 
and I know of nothing that will prevent me commencing one of the first adventures in that delightful country. I intend, on my return, to consult with 
General Putnam, and no doubt we shall fall upon 
some plan to engage a number of our friends to 
join in a scheme so interesting as that of settling in 
that garden of America. One thing that will induce 
me to settle in that country, is that your Excellency 
promises to honor us with a visit, which I shall set 
more by than the interest I possess in Massachusetts. 
</p><p>
I hope these will find your Excellency in possession of all the happiness human nature is capable of 
Colonel Sherman, Captain Martin, and the surveyors 
with us, desire their most dutiful regards to your 
Excellency. Please to present mine to your lady, 
and to Mr. Washington and his lady. 
</p><p>
Dear General, some of your friends may exceed 
me in expressions of regard, but believe me when I 
assure your Excellency that no one can exceed in 
affection,

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I received your favor of the 29th ultimo on Thursday. That by Colonel Lee had been previously delivered. Your letter for the Assembly was laid before 
them yesterday. I have reason to believe that it was 
received with every sentiment which could correspond 
with yours. Nothing passed, from which any conjecture could be formed as to the objects which would 
be most pleasing for the appropriation of the fund. 
The disposition is, I am persuaded, much stronger to 
acquiesce in your choice, whatever it may be, than to 
lead or anticipate it ; and I see no inconveniency in 
your taking time for a choice that will please yourself The letter was referred to a Committee, which 
will, no doubt, make such report as will give effect 
to your wishes. 
</p><p>
Our session commenced, very inauspiciously, with a 
contest for the Chair, which was followed by a rigid 
scrutiny into Mr. Harrison's election in his county. 
He gained the Chair by a majority of six votes, and 
retained his seat by a majority of still fewer. His 
residence was the point on which the latter question 
turned. Doctor Lee's election was questioned on a 
similar point, and was also established ; but it was 
held to be vitiated by his acceptance of a lucrative 
post under the United States. The House have engaged, with some alacrity, in the consideration of the 
Revised Code, prepared by Mr. Jefferson, Mr. Pendleton, and Mr. Wythe. The present temper promises 
an adoption of it, in substance. The greatest danger 
arises from its length, compared with the patience of 
the members. If it is persisted in, it must exclude 
several matters which are of moment ; but, I hope, 
only for the present Assembly. The pulse of the 
House of Delegates was felt on Thursday with regard 
to a general manumission, by a petition presented on 
that subject. It was rejected without dissent ; but 
not without an avowed patronage of its principles by 
sundry respectable members. A motion was made to 
throw it under the table, which was treated with as 
much indignation, on one side, as the petition itself 
was on the other. There are several petitions before 
the House against any step towards freeing the slaves, 
and even praying for a repeal of the law which licenses particular manumissions. 
</p><p>
The merchants of several of our towns have made 
representations on the distresses of our commerce, 
which have raised the question whether relief shall 
be attempted by a reference to Congress, or by measures within our own compass. On a pretty full discussion it was determined, by a large majority, that 
the power over trade ought to be vested in Congress, 
under certain qualifications. If the qualifications suggested, and no others, should be annexed, I think 
they will not be subversive of the principle, though 
they will, no doubt, lessen its utility. The Speaker, 
Mr. M. Smith, and Mr. Braxton, are the champions 
against Congress. Mr. Thurston and Mr. White have 
since come in; and, I fancy, I may set down both as 
auxiliaries. They are, however, not a little puzzled 
by the difficulty of substituting any practicable regulations within ourselves. Mr. Braxton proposed two, 
that did not much aid his side of the question. The 
first was, that all British vessels from the West Indies 
should be excluded from our ports ; the second, that 
no merchant should carry on trade here until he 
should have been a resident years. 
</p><p>
Unless some plan, freer from objection, can be devised for this State, its patrons will be reduced clearly to the dilemma of acceding to a general one, or 
leaving our trade under all its present embarrassments. There has been some little skirmishing, on 
the ground of public faith, which leads me to hope 
that its friends have less to fear than was surmised. 
The assize and port bills have not yet been awakened. The Senate will make a House to-day for the 
first time.

honor to be, dear Sir, &c.,

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been here too short a time, as yet, to have 
collected fully the politics of the session. In general, 
appearances are fivorable. On the question for a paper emission, the measure was this day rejected, in 
emphatical terms, by a majority of eighty-four against 
seventeen. The affair of the Mississippi is but imperfectly known. I find that its influence on the federal spirit will not be less than was apprehended. The 
western members will not be long silent on tbe subject. I inculcate a hope that the views of Congress 
may yet be changed, and that it would be rash to 
suffer the alarm to interfere with the policy of amending the Confederacy. The sense of the House has 
not yet been tried on the latter point. The report 
from the Deputies to <a href='/results.php?city=annapolis' rel='city'>Annapolis</a>, lies on the table ; 
and, I hope, will be called for, before the business of 
the Mississippi begins to ferment. Mr. Henry has 
signified his wish not to be reelected ; but will not 
be in the Assembly. The Attorney and R. H. Lee 
are in nomination for his succession. The former will 
probably be appointed, in which case the contest for 
that vacancy will lie between Colonel Jones and Mr. Marshall. The nominations for Congress are, as usual, 
numerous. There being no Senate yet, it is uncertain when any of these appointments will take place. 
With the sincerest affection and the highest esteem,

Sir, 
</p><p>
I did myself the honor, at the close of the season 
last year, to give your Excellency a hint with respect to our ill success. We have been in some measure more fortunate the last season, and have completed four ranges of townships. Four more are begun, some of which were not far proceeded on, by 
reason of certain information received of the hostile 
disposition of the Indians, in particular with respect 
to the Surveyors. But, by a kind hand of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, their schemes have been frustrated; and no 
special accident has happened to either of the Surveyors. We are now on our return to visit our wives 
and sweethearts. I still entertain my former enthusiastic notions with respect to this country ; and firmly believe that the beneficent Divine Being hath reserved this country as an asylum for the neglected 
and persecuted soldiers of the late American army, 
in particular those of the Eastern States. I am returning home with as full a determination to encourage a speedy settlement here, as though nothing had 
happened between us and the Indians. I hope I may 
not be instrumental of leading my friends to special 
danger or destruction. 
</p><p>
As I have but a few minutes to write, I beg leave 
to refer your Excellency to the bearer, William

Dear General,

Having received orders from my sovereign to repair immediately to Court, to give an account of my 
steward.ship, and receive his royal orders, I cannot quit this country without taldng the most affectionate 
leave of your Excellency, and expressing my gratitude for the friendship with which you have repaid 
the high veneration and sincere attachment which I 
have always entertained for your person and character. I could have wished it had been in my power 
to take your commands before my departure ; but it 
is so sudden, that I have not time to allow myself 
the satisfaction. It will be to me a heartfelt pleasure 
in giving an account to his Majesty of the distinguished character of America, to expatiate particularly on the private virtues of General Washington, and 
to delineate, to the best of Kings, the picture of the 
best of citizens. I am sure that this is the light in 
which you will please him best. Others have already 
taught him to admire your talents and public virtues; it will be my business to teach him to love 
your person. I leave this country with a heart full 
of affection for its inhabitants, and full of gratitude 
for the affection and friendship they have shown me. 
With this disposition, you may judge whether I shall 
let an opportunity escape of being useful to America. 
Allow me to repeat my wishes that you may, all 
your life, enjoy that happiness which you have ensured to thousands.

Present my best respects to your lady, and my

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Some little time before my arrival here, a quorum 
of the States was made up, and General St. Clair put 
in the Chair. We have at present nine States on the 
ground, but shall lose South Carolina to-day. Other 
States are daily expected. 
</p><p>
What business of moment may be done by the 
present or a fuller meeting, is uncertain. The objects 
now depending, and most immediately in prospect, 
are ; — First. The treaty of peace. The Secretary of 
Foreign Affairs has very ably reported a view of the 
infractions on both sides, his exposition of the contested articles, and the steps proper to be taken by 
Congress. I find, what I was not before apprised of, 
that more than one infraction on our part preceded 
even the violation on the other side, in the instance 
of the negroes. Some of the reasoning on the subject of the debts would be rather grating to Virginia. 
A full compliance with the treaty, according to judicial constructions, and as a ground for insisting on a 
reciprocal compliance, is the proposition in which the 
report terminates. Secondly. A recommendation of 
the proposed Convention in May. Congress have 
been much divided and embarrassed on the question, 
whether their taking an interest in the measure 
would impede or promote it. On one side, it has 
been urged that some of the backward States have 
scruples against acceding to it, without some constitutional sanction; on the other, that other States will 
consider any interference of Congress as proceeding 
from the same views which have hitherto excited their 
jealousies. 
</p><p>
A vote of the Legislature here, entered into 3'esterday, will give some relief in the case. They have 
instructed their Delegates in Congress to move for 
the recommendation in question. The vote was carried by a majority of one only in the Senate ; and 
there is room to suspect that the minority were 
actuated by a dislike to the substance, rather than 
by any objections against the form, of the business. 
A large majority in the other branch, a few days 
ago, put a definitive veto on the impost. It would 
seem as if the politics of this State are directed by 
individual interests and plans, which might be incommoded by the control of an efficient Federal Government. The four States north of it are still to 
make their decision on the subject of the Convention. 
</p><p>
I am told, by one of the Massachusetts Delegates, 
that the Legislature of that State, which is now sitting, will certainly accede, and appoint Deputies, if 
Congress declare their approbation of the measure. 
I have similar information that Connecticut will probably come in, though it is said that the interference 
of Congress will rather have a contrary tendency 
there. It is expected that South Carolina will not 
fail to adopt the plan, and that Georgia is equally 
well disposed. All the intermediate States, between 
the former and <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, have already appointed 
Deputies, except Maryland, which, it is said, means to 
do it, and has entered into some vote which declares 
as much. Nothing has yet been done by the new 
Congress with regard to the Mississippi. Our latest 
in{brmation from Massachusetts gives hopes that the 
meeting, or, as the Legislature there now style it, 
the rebellion, is nearly extinct. If the measures, however, on foot for disarming and disfranchising those 
concerned in it, should be carried into effect, a new 
crisis mav be brought on. 
</p><p>
I have not been here long enough to gather the 
general sentiments of leading characters touching our 
affairs and prospects. I am inclined to hope that 
they will gradually be concentred in the plan of a 
thorough reform of the existing system. Those who 
may lean towards a monarchical Government, and 
who, I suspect, are swnyed by very indigested ideas, 
will of course abandon an unattainable object, whenever a prospect opens of rendering the republican 
form competent to its purposes. Those who remain 
attached to the latter form, must soon perceive that 
it cannot be preserved at all under any modification 
which does not redress the ills experienced from our 
present establishments. Virginia is the only State 
which has made any provision for the late moderate 
but essential requisition of Congress; and her provision is a partial one only. 
</p><p>
This would have been of earlier date, but I have 
waited for more interesting subjects for it. I shall 
do myself the pleasure of repeating the liberty of 
dropping you a few lines as often as proper occasions arise ; on no other condition, however, than 
your waiving the trouble of regular answers or acknowledgments on your part.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Recollecting to have heard you mention a plan, 
formed by the Empress of Russia, for a comparative 
view of the aborigines of the new Continent, and of 
the north-eastern parts of the old, through the medium 
of their respective tongues, and that her wishes had 
been conveyed to you for your aid in obtaining the 
American vocabularies, I have availed myself of an 
opportunity, offered by the kindness of Mr. Hawkins, 
of taking a copy of such a sample of the Cherokee 
and Choctaw dialects, as his late commission to treat 
with them enabled him to obtain ; and do myself the 
honor now of inclosing it. I do not know how far 
the list of words made use of by Mr. Hawkins ma}'" 
correspond with the standard of the Empress, nor how 
far nations so remote as the Cherokees and Choctaws 
from the north-west shores of America, may fall within 
her scheme of comparison. I presume, however, that 
a great proportion, at least, of the words will answer, and that the laudable curiosity, which suggests 
investigations of this sort, will be pleased with every 
enlargement of the field for indulging it. Not finding 
it convenient to retain a copy of the inclosed, as I 
wished to do, for myself, I must ask the favor of 
your amanuensis to perform that task for me. 
</p><p>
The appointments for the Convention go on very 
successfully. Since the date of my last, Georgia, 
South Carolina, <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, Massachusetts, and New 
Hampshire, have come into the measure. Georgia and 
New Hampshire have constituted their Delegates in 
Congress their Representatives in the Convention. 
</p><p>
South Carolina has appointed Mr. S. Rutleclge, General Pinckney, Mr. Laurens, Major Butler, and Mr. Charles Pincknej, late a member of Congress. The 
Deputies of Massachusetts are Mr. Dana, Mr. King, 
Mr. Gorham, Mr. Gerry, Mr. Strong. I am told that 
a resolution of the Legislature of this State, which 
originated with their Senate, lays its Deputies under 
the fetter of not departing from the fifth of the present articles of Confederation. As this resolution passed before the recommendatory act of Congress was 
known, it is conjectured that it may be rescinded ; 
but its having passed at all, denotes a much greater 
prevalence of political jealousy in that quarter than 
had been imagined. The deputation of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
consists of Colonel Hamilton, Judge Yates and a Mr. Lansing. The two last are said to be pretty much 
linked to the anti-federal party here, and are likely 
of course to be a clog on their colleague. It is not 
doubted now, that Connecticut and Rhode Island will 
avoid the singularity of being unrepresented in the 
Convention. 
</p><p>
The thinness of Congress has been an obstacle to 
all the important business before them. At present, 
there are nine States on the ground ; but this number, though adequate to every object when unanimous, makes a very slow progress in business that 
requires seven States only ; and I see little prospect 
of the number being increased. 
</p><p>
By our latest and most authentic information from 
Massachusetts, it would seem that a calm has been 
restored by the expedition of General Lincoln. The 
precautions taking by the State, however, betray a 
great distrust of its continuance. Besides their act 
disqualifying the malcontents from voting in the election of members for the Legislature, &c., another has 
been passed for raising a corps of one thousand or 
fifteen hundred men, and appropriating the choicest 
revenues of the country to its support. It is said 
that at least half of the insurgents decline accepting 
the terms annexed to the amnesty; and that this defiance of the law against treason is countenanced, not 
only by the impunity with which they show themselves on public occasions, even with insolent badges 
of their character, but hy marks of popular favor, 
conferred on them in various instances, in the election to local offices. 
</p><p>
A proposition has been introduced and discussed 
in the Legislature of this State, for reliufjuishing its 
claim to Vermont, and urging the admission of it into 
the Confederacy, As far as I can learn, difficulties 
will arise only in settling the form, the substance of 
the measures being not disliked by any of the parties. It is wished, by those who are not interested 
in claims to lands within that district, to guard 
against any responsibility in the State for compensation. On the other side, it will at least be insisted 
that they shall not be barred of the privilege of carrying their claims before a federal Court, in case 
Vermont shall become a party to the Union. I think 
it probable, if she should not decline becoming such 
altogether, that she will make two conditions, if not 
more ; — First, that neither her boundaries nor the 
rights of her citizens shall be impeachable under the 
ninth article of Confederation ; secondly, that no share 
of the public debt, already contracted, shall be allotted 
to her. 
</p><p>
I have a letter from Colonel John Campbell, dated 
at Pittsburg, from which I gather that the people of 
that quarter are thrown into great agitation by the 
reported intention of Congress concerning the Mississippi, and that measures are on foot for uniting the 
minds of all the different settlements which have a 
common interest at stake. Should this policy take 
effect, I think there is much ground to apprehend 
that the ambition of individuals will quickly mix itself with the first impulses of resentment and interest j that; by degrees, the people may be led to 
set up for themselves ; that they will slide, like Vermont, insensibly into a communication and latent connection with their British neighbours, and, in pursuance of the same example, make such a disposition 
of the w^estern territory as will entice into it, most 
effectually, emigrants from all parts of the Union. If 
these apprehensions be not imaginary, they suggest 
many observations extremely interesting to Spain, as 
well as to the United States. 
</p><p>
I hear from <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, with much concern, that 
Mr. Henry has positively declined his mission to 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. Besides the loss of his services on that 
theatre, there is danger, I fear, that this step has proceeded from a wish to leave his conduct unfettered 
on another theatre, where the result of the Convention will receive its destiny from his omnipotence. 
With every sentiment of esteem and affection,

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The letter herewith inclosed was put into my hands 
yesterday by Mr. Crevecoeiir, who belongs to the consular establishment of France in this country. I add 
to it a pamphlet which Mr. Pinckney has submitted 
to the public, or rather, as he professes, to the perusal of his friends, and a printed sheet containing his 
ideas on a very delicate subject; too delicate, in my 
opinion, to have been properly confided to the press. 
He conceives that his precautions against any farther 
circulation of the piece than he himself authorizes, 
are so effectual as to justify the step. I wish he 
may not be disappointed. In communicating a copy 
to you, I fulfil his washes only. 
</p><p>
No decisive indications of the public mind, in the 
Northern and Middle States, can yet be collected. 
The reports continue to be rather favorable to the act 
of the Convention, from every quarter ; but its adversaries will naturally be latest in showing themselves. 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> is certainly friendly. An opposition is known 
to be in petto in Connecticut, but is said not to be 
much dreaded by the other side. Pihode Island will 
be divided on this subject, in the same manner as it 
has been on the question of paper money. The newspapers here have contained sundry publications animadverting on the proposed Constitution; and it is 
known that the Government party are hostile to it. 
There are, on the other side, so many able and weighty 
advocates, and the conduct of the Eastern States, if 
favorable, will add so much force to their arguments, 
that there is at least as much ground for hope as 
for apprehension. I do not learn that any opposition 
is likely to be made in New Jersey. The temper of 
Pennsylvania will be best known to you from the 
direct information which you cannot fail to receive 
through the newspapers and other channels. 
</p><p>
Congress have been of late employed chiefly in 
settling the requisition, and in making some arrangements for the western country. The latter consist 
of the appointment of a Governor and Secretary, and 
the allotment of a sum of money for Indian treaties, 
if they should be found necessary. The requisition, 
so far as it varies our fiscal system, makes the proportion of indents receivable, independently of specie, 
and those of different years indiscriminately receivable 
for any year, and does not, as heretofore, tie down 
the States to a particular mode of obtaining them. 
Mr. Adams has been permitted to return home after 
February next, and Mr. Jefferson's appointment continued for three years longer. With the most perfect 
esteem and most affectionate regard,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The mail of yesterday brought me your favor of 
the 22d instant. The communications from <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> 
give me as much pleasure, as they exceed my expectations. As I find, by a letter from a member of 
the Assembly, however, that Colonel Mason had not 
got down, and it appears that Mr. Henry is not at 
bottom a friend, I am not without fears that their 
combined influence and management may yet create 
difficulties. There is one consideration, which I think 
ought to have some weight in the case, over and 
above the intrinsic inducements to embrace the Constitution, and which I have suggested to some of my 
correspondents. There is at present a veiy strong probability that nine States, at least, will pretty speedily concur in establishing it. What will become of 
the tardy remainder ? They must be either left as 
outcasts from the Society, to shift for themselves, or 
be compelled to come in, or must come in of themselves when they will be allowed no credit for it. 
Can either of these situations be as eligible as a 
prompt and manly determination to support the Union, 
and share its common fortunes ? 
</p><p>
My last stated pretty fully the information which 
had arrived here from different quarters, concerning 
the proposed Constitution. I recollect nothing that is 
now to be added, flxrther than that the Assembly of 
Massachusetts, now sitting, certainly gives it a friendly reception. I inclose a <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> paper, by which it 
appears that Governor Hancock has ushered it to 
them in as propitious a manner as could have been 
required. 
</p><p>
Mr. P.'s character is, as you observe, well marked 
by the publications which I inclosed. His printing 
the secret paper at this time, could have no motive 
but the appetite for expected praise ; for the subject 
to which it relates has been dormant a considerable 
time, and seems likely to remain so. 
</p><p>
A foreign gentleman of merit, and who, besides 
this general title, brings me a letter which gives him 
a particular claim to my civilities, is very anxious to 
obtain a sketch of the Potomac, and the route from 
the highest navigable part of it to the western waters 
which are to be connected with the Potomac by the 
portage ; together with a sketch of the works which 
are going on, and a memorandum of the progress 
made in them. Knowing of no other channel through 
which I could enable myself to gratify this gentleman, I am seduced into the liberty of resorting to 
your kindness ; and of requesting that if you have 
such a draught by you, your amanuensis may be permitted to take a very rough copy of it for me. In 
making this request, I beseech you, Sir, to understand 
that I do it with not more confidence in your goodness, than with the sincerest desire that it may be 
disregarded, if it cannot be fulfilled with the most 
perfect convenience. With sentiments of the most 
perfect esteem and the most afiectionate regard,

</p><p>
Permit me, my dear Sir, to intrude upon your rural repose once more with a subject that, from the 
moment that I became acquainted with the United 
States, I have exerted myself with unabated zeal to 
establish, — a permanent and sincere amity between 
our two countries on the principles of mutual interest. 
No two nations in the world, in my opinion, apply 
so exactly to each other. On such solid basis I 
hoped to have founded a national connection which 
would have daily acquired strength from the experience of its advantages, and did not doubt but the 
object of my wishes would have been accomplished 
with facility. The generous conduct and views of my 
Royal Master shine brightly with the most sincere 
friendship ; and, had I met with a consonant temper 
in all the States, the great work would have long 
ago been completed, and our countries would have 
been now in the actual enjoyment of the comforts 
and advantages of a friendly intercourse. But the 
opposition of Virginia, expressed by the published 
instructions of the last Assembly to her Delegates in 
Congress, has, perhaps, obstructed the conclusion of 
the negotiation. 
</p><p>
These instructions, I doubt not, must have reached 
the Courts of Madrid and London. By the public 
prints from the last of those places, it is assured that 
one of their most able politicians has been ordered to 
the former; and I think we must take it for granted 
that he will indubitably avail himself of the abovementioned opposition and instructions. I leave to 
your superior penetration to judge of what the consequences may be, and whether something ought not 
to be done immediately; believing it, from my heart, 
to be highly essential to the true interest of the 
United States, before it is too late. 
</p><p>
I cannot refrain from making this candid communication to you, convinced that your constant attachment to the public good, will prompt you to take 
into consideration these truths, and that your knowledge of my conduct will induce you to attribute this 
confidence to my sincere desire to promote the harmony and interest of the two nations, and to the reluctance which I feel in the prospect of being obliged 
to abandon an object which has so long held the 
first place in my heart, and which I believe to be 
essential to the interest and prospects of our two 
countries. 
</p><p>
Give me leave to congratulate you, and to express 
my sincere joy, on the happy escape you made on a 
bridge in your way home. May the Almighty continue preserving you, for many years, for the good 
of this country and of mankind in general ! And 
permit me to conclude with my most humble respects 
to your worthy lady, and with unfeigned assurance 
that I have the honor to be.

With the highest consideration and respect, &c.,

Sir, 
</p><p>
Accounts having arrived, and being credited here, 
that the British fleet was out, and had been seen 
steering to the westward, and that a British squadron was cruising in the North Sea, I was advised 
by my friends not to embark in the French j^acket 
that sailed hence the 25th ultimo. I am sorry to 
have lost that opportunity, as those accounts are now 
contradicted. I shall embark to-morrow in an American ship, bound for Amsterdam, and have bargained 
to be landed in France. I shall go directly to Paris, 
and deliver the two packets you sent to my care 
immediately on my arrival, with two others from you, 
that have been since put into my hands, for Mr. Jefferson and the Marquis de Lafayette.

I am exceedingly sorry for the long detention of

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 5th instant found me in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, whither I had proceeded, under arrangements 
for proceeding to Virginia or returning to this place, 
as I might there decide. I did not acknowledge it 
in , because I had nothing to communicate, which you would not receive more fully and 
correctly from the Mr. INIorrises, who were setting 
out for Virginia. 
</p><p>
All my informations from <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> concur in representing the enthusiasm in favor of the new Constitution as subsiding, and giving place to a spirit 
of criticism. I was fearful of such an event, from 
the influence and cooperation of some of the adversaries. I do not learn, however, that the cause has 
lost its majority in the Legislature, and still less 
among the people at large. I have nothing to add 
to the information heretofore given concerning the 
progress of the Constitution in other States. jNIr. 
Gerry has presented his objections to the Legislature 
in a letter addressed to them, and signified his readiness, if desired, to give the particular reasons on 
which they were founded. The Legislature, it seems, 
decline the explanation, either from a supposition that 
they have nothing further to do in the business, having handed it over to the Convention, or from an 
unwillingness to countenance Mr. Gerry's conduct ; 
or from both these considerations. It is supposed 
that the promulgation of this letter will shake the 
confidence of some, and embolden the opposition of 
others, in that State ; but I cannot discover any 
ground for distrusting the prompt and decided concurrence of a large majority. 
</p><p>
I inclose herewith the seven first numbers of the 
Federalist, a paper addressed to the people of this 
State, They relate entirely to the importance of the 
Union. If the whole plan should he executed, it will 
present to the public a full discussion of the merits of 
the proposed Constitution, in all its relations. From 
the opinion I have formed of the views of a party 
in Virginia, I am inclined to think that the observations on the first branch of the subject may not be 
superfluous antidotes in that State, any more than in 
this. If you concur with me, perhaps the papers may 
be put into the hand of some of your confidential 
correspondents at <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, who would have them 
reprinted there. I will not conceal from you that I 
am likely to have such a degree of connection with 
the publication here, as to afford a restraint of delicacy from interesting myself directly in the republication elsewhere. You will recognize one of the pens 
concerned in the task. There are three in the whole. 
A fourth may possibly bear a part. 
</p><p>
The intelligence by the packet, as far as I have 
collected it, is contained in the Gazette of yesterday. 
Virginia is the only State represented as yet. When 
a Congress wdll be formed, is altogether uncertain. 
It is not very improbable, I think, that the interregnum may continue throughout the winter. With every 
sentiment of respect and attachment,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 9tli, directed to Mr. Lee and 
myself, and its inclosure, came to hand to-day very 
opportunely. The gentlemen of the Assembly purpose to rise next Saturday; and, preparatory to it, 
resolved, in the morning, to receive no new business 
after this day. This circumstance precluded all formality 3 and Mr. Lee being absent, I moved for leave 
to bring in a bill under the same title as the act 
passed in Virginia. Leave was granted, and I expect 
there will be no opposition in any stage of it. I 
think at present to make a small deviation, by giving the President and Directors their choice to prosecute in the County Courts, which will generally be 
speedier, or in the General Court. 
</p><p>
Our affairs are so embarrassed with a diversity of 
paper money and paper securities, a sparing imposition and an infamous collection and payment (or 
rather non-payment) of taxes, that Mr. Hartshorn's repeated applications to our Treasury have proved fruitless, nor can I say when there will be money in 
hand to answer the three hundred pounds sterling 
due. Some of our debts are so pressing, that a good 
many of us Delegates feel very uneasy; and I yet 
hope a serious attempt for an immediate provision for 
them, and that the Potomac demand may be included. The present circumstances with respect to the 
future seat of Congress, in my opinion, call for vigorous exertions to perfect the navigation of Potomac 
speedily; and it is truly mortifying to see so little 
prospect of being supplied with the essential means. 
Surely five or six hundred miles of inland navigation, 
added to the central situation and other advantages, 
would decide in favor of Potomac for the permanent 
seat of Congress. 
</p><p>
Colonel Fitzgerald wrote Mr. Lee and myself to 
mention the time we could meet at Shenandoah to 
inquire into complaints against Mr. Steward, in his 
absence. I could only write him that I would attend 
at any time that might be agreeable to you and the 
other gentlemen, after my return home, which will 
probably be the last of next week. I wish. Sir, your 
convenience to be consulted, and that it may be convenient and agreeable to you to make my house in 
your way. Very little notice of the time to meet 
will be sufficient for me, and I dare say for Mr. Lee. 
</p><p>
Late in the last session, I received your letter, 
relative to Mr. Wilson's application to our Assembly. 
It was next to impossible then to draw any attention 
to that, or to investigate any subject, in a j)roper 
manner. We had grown impatient in the extreme. 
On the most diligent and repeated searches since my 
receipt of your favor of the 22d of November, his 
papers cannot be found, though Mr. Digges, and some 
of the other members, have it on memory that, on 
reading in the House, the business was referred. My 
ovv^n diligence, and that of a gentleman or two besides, has been exerted to prevent the necessity of 
informing you that so little care is taken of our papers. 
</p><p>
The leaven of your State is working in ours. The 
scale of power, which I always suggested would be 
the most difficult to settle between the great and 
small States, as such, was in my opinion very properly adjusted. Any necessary guard for personal 
liberty is the common interest of all the citizens of 
America ; and if it is imagined that a defined power, 
which does not comprehend the interference with personal rights, needs negative declarations, I presume 
such may be added by the Federal Legislature with 
equal efficacy and more propriety than might have 
been done by the Convention. Strongly and long 
impressed with an idea that no Government can make 
a people happy, unless they very generally entertain 
an opinion that it is good in form and well administered, I am much disposed to give up a good deal 
in the form, the least essential part. But those who 
are clamorous, seem to me to be really more afraid 
of being restrained from doing what they ought not 
to do, and being compelled to do what they ought 
to do, than of being obliged to do what there is no 
moral obligation on them to do. I believe there is 
no American, of observation, reflection, and candor, 
but will acknowledge man unhappily needs more government than he imagines. I flatter myself that 
the plan recommended will be adopted in twelve of 
the thirteen States, without conditions, sine qua non. 
But, let the event be as it may, I shall think myself, with America in general, greatly indebted to the 
Convention ; and possibly we may confess it, when it 
may be too late to avail ourselves of their moderation and wisdom. You will pardon me, my good Sir, 
the effusions which I cannot restrain when on this 
subject; and believe me to be. 
</p><p>
With very great respect, &c.,

Thomas Johnson.

Bear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been favored, since my last, with yours of 
the 10th instant, with a copy of the Governor's letter 
to the Assembly. I do not know what impression 
the latter may make in Virginia. It is generally 
understood here that the arguments contained in it 
in favor of the Constitution are much stronger than 
the objections which prevented his assent. His arguments are forcible in all places, and with all persons. 
His objections are connected with his particular way 
of thinking on the subject, in which many of the 
adversaries to the Constitution do not concur. 
</p><p>
The information from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> by the mail, on the 
evening before last, has not removed our suspense. 
The following is an extract of a letter from Mr. King, 
dated on the 16th instant; — 
</p><p>
"We may have three hundred and sixty members 
in our Convention. Not more than three hundred and 
thirty have yet taken their seats. Immediately after 
the settlement of elections, the Convention resolved 
that they would consider and freely deliberate on 
each paragraph, without taking a question on any of 
them individually; and that, on the question whether 
they would ratify, each member should be at liberty 
to discuss the plan at large. This resolution seems 
to preclude the idea of amendments, and hitherto the 
measure has not been suggested. I however do not, 
from this circumstance, conclude that it may not hereafter occur. 
</p><p>
"The opponents of the Constitution moved that 
Mr. Gerry should be requested to take a seat in the 
Convention, to answer such inquiries as the Convention should make concerning facts which happened in 
the passing of the Constitution. Although this seems 
to be a very irregular proposal, yet, considering the 
jealousies which prevail with those who made it (who 
are certainly not the most enlightened part of the 
Convention), and the doubt of the issue, had it been 
made a trial of strength, several friends of the Constitution united with the opponents, and the resolution 
was agreed to, and JMr. Gerry has taken his seat. 
To-morrow, we are told, certain inquiries are to be 
moved for by the opposition, and that Mr. Gerry, 
under the idea of stating facts, is to state his reasons, 
&c. This will be opposed ; and we shall, on the division, be able to form some idea of our relative strength. 
From the men who are in favor of the Constitution, 
any reasonable explanation will be given ; and arguments really new, and in my judgment, most excellent, have been and will be produced in its support. 
But what will be its fate, I confess I am unable to 
discern. No question ever classed the people of this 
State in a more extraordinary manner, or with more 
apparent firmness." 
</p><p>
A Congress of seven States was made up on Monday. Mr. Cyrus Griffin has been placed in the Chair. 
This is the only step yet taken. I remain, with the 
highest respect and attachment, &c.,

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Another mail has arrived from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, without terminating the conflict between our hopes and fears. 
I have a letter from Mr. King of the 27th, which, 
after dilating somewhat on the ideas in his former 
letters, concludes with the following paragraph ; — 
</p><p>
"We have avoided every cjuestion, which would 
have shown the division of the House. Of consequence, we are not positive of the members on each 
side. By the last calculation we made on our side, 
we were doubtful whether we exceeded them, or they 
us, in numbers. They, however, say that they have 
a majority of eight or twelve against us. We by no 
means despair." 
</p><p>
Another letter of the same date, from another member, gives the following picture ; — 
</p><p>
" Never was there an Assembly in this State in 
possession of greater ability and information than the 
present Convention ; yet I am in doubt whether they 
will approve the Constitution. There are, unhappily, 
three parties opposed to it. First; all men who are 
in favor of paper money and tender laws. Those are 
more or less in every part of the State. Second ; 
all the late insurgents and their abettors. In the 
three great western counties they are very numerous. 
We have in the Convention eighteen or twenty who 
were actually in Shays's army. Third; a great majority of the members from the Province of Maine. 
Many of them and their constituents are only squatters upon other people's land, and they are afraid of 
being brought to account. They also think, though 
erroneously, that their favorite plan of being a separate State will be defeated. Add to these, the honest, 
doubting people, and they make a powerful host. 
The leaders of this party are a Mr. Widgery, Mr. Thomson, and Mr. Nason, ftom the Province of Maine ; 
a Dr. Taylor, from the county of Worcester, and Mr. Bishop, from the neighbourhood of Rhode Island. 
</p><p>
" To manage the cause against them, are the present and late Governor, three Judges of the Supreme 
Court, fifteen members of the Senate, twenty from 
among the most respectable of the Clergy, ten or 
twelve of the first characters at the Bar, Judges of 
Probate, High Sheriffs of counties, and many other 
respectable people, merchants, &c. ; Generals Heath, 
Lincoln, Brooks, and others of the late army. With 
all this ability in support of the cause, I am pretty 
well satisfied we shall lose the question, unless we 
can take off some of the opposition by amendments. 
I do not mean such as are to be made conditions of 
the ratification, but recommendatory only. Upon this 
plan I flatter myself we may possibly get a majority of twelve or fifteen, if not more." 
</p><p>
The Legislature of this State has voted a Convention on June 17th. I remain, &c.,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I am just favored with yours of the Tth instant, 
and will attend to your wishes as to the political essays in the press. 
</p><p>
I have given notice to my friends in Orange, that 
the county may command my services in the Convention, if it pleases. I can say, with great truth, 
however, that in this overture I sacrifice every private inclination to considerations not of a selfish nature. I foresee that the undertaking will involve me 
in very laborious and irksome discussions ; that public opposition to several very respectable characters, whose esteem and friendship I greatly prize, may 
unintentionally endanger the subsisting connection ; 
and that disagreeable misconstructions, of which samples have been already given, may be the fruit of 
those exertions which fidelity will impose. But I 
have made up my determination on the subject ; and, 
if I am informed that my presence at the election in 
the county be indispensable, shall submit to that condition also, though it is my particular wish to decline 
it, as well to avoid apparent solicitude on the occasion, as a journey of such length at a very unpleasant season. 
</p><p>
I had seen the extract of your letter to Colonel 
Carter, and had supposed, from the place where it 
first made its appearance, that its publication was the 
effect of the zeal of a correspondent. I cannot but 
think, on the whole, that it may have been of service, notwithstanding the scandalous misinterpretations 
of it which have been attempted. As it has evidently the air of a paragraph to a familiar friend, the 
omissions of an argumentative support of the opinion 
given, will appear to no candid reader unnatural or 
improper. 
</p><p>
We have no late information from Europe, except 
through the English papers, which represent the affairs of France as in the most ticklish state. The 
facts have every appearance of authenticity, and we 
wait with great impatience for the packet, which is 
daily expected. It can be little doubted that the 
patriots have been abandoned ; whether from impotency in France, misconduct in them, or from what other 
cause, is not altogether clear. The French apologists 
are visibly embarrassed by the dilemma of submitting 
to the appearance of either weakness, or the want of 
faith. They seem generally to allege, that their engagements being with the Republic, the nation could 
not 'oppose the regular authority of the country, by 
supporting a single Province, or perhaps a single party in it only. The validity of this excuse will depend much on the real connection between France 
and the patriots, and the assurances given as an encouragement to the latter. From the British King's 
speech, it would seem that France had avowed her 
purpose of supporting her Dutch friends, though it is 
possible her menaces to England might be carried further than her real promises to the patriots. All these 
circumstances, however, must have galled the pride 
of France ; and I have little doubt that a war will 
prove it, as soon as her condition will admit of it. 
Perhaps she may be the sooner forced into it on account of her being in a contrary situation, I hear 
nothing yet from the Convention of New Hampshire.

I remain, &c.,

Sir, 
</p><p>
The Convention of this State met the loth instant, 
to take into consideration the federal plan of Government. Contrary to the expectation of almost every 
thinking man, a small majority of (say^ four) persons 
appeared against the system. This was the most 
astonishing to every man of any information, as Massachusetts had accepted it, and this State in particular had every thing to gain, and nothing to lose, by 
the adoption of the Government; and almost every 
man of property and abilities, for it. However, this 
can be accounted for. Just at the moment that the 
choice for members for our Convention, in one of our 
principal counties, took place, a report was circulated 
by a few designing men, who wished for confusion, 
that the Massachusetts Convention, who had just met, 
were against the plan, and would certainly refuse it; 
that the liberties of the people were in danger, and 
the great men, as they call them, were forming a 
plan for themselves ; together with a thousand other 
absurdities, which frightened the people almost out of 
what little senses they had. 
</p><p>
This induced them to choose not only such men 
as were against the plan, but to instruct them positively against receiving it. The absurdity of such 
conduct, is too plain to observe upon. However, not 
withstanding the exertion of the opponents, both without doors and within, after spending ten days in debating on the plan, a number of those gentlemen 
who came from home with different sentiments, were 
convinced of their mistake, and only wished an opportunity to lay the matter before their constituents. 
This they mentioned to those in favor of the plan, 
who, seeing the difficulty which those men labored 
under, and the uncertainty of the vote, if the general question was then called for, agreed that I should 
move for an adjournment to some future day to take 
the final question. This w^as done, and carried. The 
Convention adjourned, to meet the od day of June 
next, though greatly opposed by those against the 
plan. 
</p><p>
That this State must and will receive it, I have 
but very little doubt, notwithstanding their late conduct, which, to be sure, is very mortifying, as we 
have every thing to expect from its adoption. 
I have the honor to be, &c. 
</p><p>
John Langdon.

Orange, 10 <a rel="month origin" value="4">April</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1788' rel="origin">1788</a>. 
</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Having seen a part only of the names returned for 
the Convention, and being unacquainted with the political characters of many of them, I am a very incompetent prophet of the fate of the Constitution. 
My hopes, however, are much encouraged by my present conjectures. Those who have more data for their 
calculations than I have, augur a flattering issue to 
the deliberations of June. I find that Colonel Nicholas, who is among the best judges, thinks, on the 
whole, that a majority in the Convention will be on 
the list of federalists ; but very properly takes into 
view the turn that may be given to the event by 
the weight of Kentucky, if thrown into the wrong 
scale, and by the proceedings of Maryland and South 
Carolina, if they should terminate in either a rejection or postponement of the question. 
</p><p>
The impression on Kentucky, like that on the rest 
of the State, was at first answerable to our wishes ; 
but, as elsewhere, the torch of discord has been thrown 
in, and has found the materials but too inflammable. 
I have written several letters, since my arrival, to 
correspondents in that district, with a view to counteract antifederal machinations. I have little expectation, however, that they will have much effect, unless 
the communications that may go from Mr. Brown, in 
Congress, should happen to breathe the same spirit ; 
and I am not without apprehensions that his mind 
may have taken an unlucky tincture from the difficulties thrown in the way of the separation of the 
district, as well as from some antecedent proceedings 
of Congress. I have taken the liberty of writing 
also to a friend in South Carolina, on the critical importance of a right decision there to a favorable one 
here. The inclosed letter, which I leave unsealed, 
will show you that I am doing the same with respect 
to Maryland. Will you be so good as to put a wafer 
in it, and to send it to the post-office for <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>, 
or to change the address to <a href='/results.php?city=annapolis' rel='city'>Annapolis</a>, if you should 
have reason to conclude that Mr. Carroll will be 
there ? I have written a similar letter to Dr. McHenry. The difference between even a postponement 
and adoption in Maryland, may, in the nice balance 
of parties here, possibly give a fatal advantage to 
that which opposes the Constitution. 
</p><p>
I have done nothing yet in preparing answers to 
the queries. As facts are to be ascertained, as well 
as opinions formed, delay will be of course counted 
upon. With every sentiment of respect and attachment, 
</p><p>
I remain, dear Sir, &c.,

</p><p>
My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
As I know you feel deeply interested in the fate 
of the proposed Constitution, considering its adoption 
or rejection as deciding npon the happiness and prosperity of your fellow-citizens, I shall take the lil)erty 
to give you an account of its present situation in this 
State, so far as I have been able to learn it from the. 
best information which I can obtain ; begging, at the 
same time, that you will not answer this, or any 
other letter which I may write to you before my return, unless something more particular (which I do 
not at present know of) should require it ; because I 
am so well acquainted with your numerous avocations, 
as to be sensible that you have not, especially at 
this busy season, an hour that could be conveniently 
spared. 
</p><p>
I was surprised to find, in conversing with some of 
the first characters here, that so little information respecting the Constitution had been diffused among 
the people of this State. There have been few or no 
original publications in the papers, and scarcely any 
republications. The valuable numbers of Piihlius are not known. The debates of the Pennsylvania and 
Massachusetts Conventions have been read but by few 
persons ; and many other pieces, which contained useful information, have never been heard of FaUus is 
now republishing in the papers of this town ; and as 
the papers under this signature are written with perspicuity and candor, I presume they will have a good 
effect. The enemies of the Constitution have been 
indefatigable in disseminating their opinions, personally, among the interior inhabitants of this State ; and, 
had they acted like good politicians, would effectually 
have prevented its adoption here. But, instead of 
alarming the fears of the people, by telling them that 
their immediate and individual interest would be affected by the adoption of the Constitution, they . acknowledged that this State would be more benefited 
thereby than any other in the Union ; but declared 
that, if the Constitution obtained, the rights and liberties of all American citizens would be destroyed, 
and that the people of this State, as a part of the 
community, would suffer in the general wreck. 
</p><p>
This apparent disinterestedness and patriotism was 
relished for some time, and was the means of producing so large and unexpected an opposition in the 
last Convention. But, since that period, the friends 
to the proposed system have been at some pains to 
counteract their opponents by personal information ; 
and their success, they say, is as great as they could 
wish. For the people, upon reflecting, and duly considering those characters who had stood forth as the 
champions of the general rights of America, were 
convinced that they had been imposed upon by a 
specious parade of patriotism, and thought it highly 
absurd to pretend that the inhabitants of other States 
were not as competent to the judging of what was 
injurious to their liberties as they were, and, as they 
have more to hope and less to fear from its obtaining than almost any other State, it would be doing 
injustice to themselves not to accept it. 
</p><p>
This is taken to be now the general sentiment 
which prevails; and I think the friends to the Constitution would not feel so secure of its adoption as 
they do (after the unexpected opposition which they 
met with last winter), unless they were possessed of 
some certain information to ground their faith upon. 
They now only appear to be mortified, that New 
Hampshire will not make the ninth State, as it is 
probable South Carolina and Virginia will adopt it 
before them, and coming in at the tenth hour, will 
rather have the appearance of submitting to, than accepting of it. The only method which can be devised to save api)earances, is to adopt it before the ratification can reach them from Virginia. This they expect to do, as it is thought the Convention will not 
be many days in session. 
</p><p>
You will be so obliging as to tender my best respects to Mrs. Washington 5 and believe me to be, 
with sentiments of the highest respect and warmest 
</p><p>
attachment, my dear Sir, &c.,

</p><p>
My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to inform you, that the Constitution was yesterday adopted by the Convention 
of this State, after a session of four days. The number in favor of the adoption was fifty-seven ; against 
it, forty-six. The majority, though small, is very respectable, as it is pretty well ascertained, that at 
least three fourths of the property, and a larger proportion of the abilities in the State, are friendly to 
the proposed system. The opposition here, as has 
generally been the case, was composed of men who 
were involved in debt, and of consequence would be 
averse to any Government which was likely to abolish their tender laws, and cut off every hope of accomplishing their favorite plan of introducing a paper 
currency. The behaviour of the minority, except a 
few, was however candid and conciliatory ; and the 
event was peculiarly pleasing to every inhabitant of 
this town and its vicinity. 
</p><p>
The independent companies of horse and the militia 
will assemble to-morrow to conduct his Excellency, 
President Langdon, into town; but, whether there will 
be any procession, as has been exhibited in other 
places on the occasion, I do not know, but think there 
will not. I take the liberty to inclose a copy of the 
amendments recommended by this Convention. They 
were drawn up more with a view of softening and 
conciliating the adoption to some who were moderate 
in their opposition, than from an expectation that 
they would ever be ingrafted into the Constitution. 
</p><p>
I hope to be at <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a> some time in the 
latter part of July, or first of August. My inclination would lead me there sooner, was that alone to 
be consulted; but there are several matters to be 
settled relative to my father's estate, which require 
my attention, and which will detain me in this part 
of the Continent a few weeks longer than I expected. 
You will be so obliging as to give my best respects 
to Mrs. Washington ; and be assured that I am, my 
dear Sir, 
With the warmest affection and highest respect, &c.,

P. S. The Constitution was ratified on Saturday, 
at one o'clock, P. M. I am thus particular, as Virginia might have adopted it on the same day, and, in 
that case, the hour must be known, to determine 
which was the ninth State.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
We got through the Constitution by paragraphs 
to-day. To-morrow some proposition for closing the 
business will be made. On our side a ratification, 
involving a few declaratory truths, not affecting its 
validity, will be tendered. The opposition will "urge 
previous amendments. Their conversation to-day seemed to betray despair. Colonel Mason, in particular, 
talked in a style which no other sentiment could 
have produced. He held out the idea of civil convulsions, as the effects of obtruding the Government 
on the people. He was answered by several; and 
concluded with declaring his determination, for himself, to acquiesce in the event, whatever it might be. 
</p><p>
]Mr. H y endeavoured to gloss what had fallen 
</p><p>
from his friend, declared his aversion to the Constitution to be such that he could not take the oath; 
but that he would remain in peaceable submission to 
the result. We calculate on a majority, but a bare 
one. It is possible, nevertheless, that some adverse 
circumstance may happen.

<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, 26 <a rel="month origin" value="7">July</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1788' rel="origin">1788</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
- The strong attachment which I know you have always felt, and in a variety of instances demonstrated, 
for the State of Massachusetts, induces me to send 
you, what is here considered an interesting pamphlet, 
which, with great impartiality, states the rise, causes, 
and happy termination of the late most alarming insurrections in this Commonwealth. The author is a 
young lawyer, and Clerk to our lower House of Assembly. He had the best sources of information j 
and his little history carries the marks of intelligence 
and candor in every page of it. 
</p><p>
A suppressed rebellion always adds energy to the 
Government; and perliaps the late one in our State 
was a fortunate event. It is true that it cost some 
lives, and added eighty thousand pounds to our public debt. But its entire extinction has confirmed the 
Constitution, given security and stability to property, 
and most thoroughly tamed many turbulent spirits 
in all parts of the State. To universal discontent, the 
most violent party animosity, and a very alarming 
decline of industry and manufactures, have succeeded 
content, quiet and productive labor. 
The exports of our State exceeded the imports 
last year by two hundred and thirty thousand pounds 
and upwards. And we have now rose to be the third 
exporting State in the Confederacy. The town of 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> alone that year exported twelve hundred and 
thirteen thousand pounds. And it has been considered, in another point of view, as being still more 
beneficial, from aiding the erection of the great Federal Fabric, w^hich w^as so boldly conceived in the 
General Convention at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and which now, 
it is beyond a doubt, will be ratified by the people. 
</p><p>
But it is not, I confess, so much with a design of 
furnishing you, my dear Sir, with the complete information contained in the pamphlet, that I have taken the liberty of transmitting it, as it is from a desire of evidencing that respect and gratitude which 
I must ever personally feel for you. The early and 
particular favors I experienced from you, at a critical 
period of my life, and which continued during the 
time I was in the army, will never be forgot until I 
shall cease to consider you as the saviour of our 
country. That you may very long live to enjoy the 
honest fame, which was so arduously and nobly acquired, and which you so fully possess by the consent of all mankind, is the fervent wish of, dear Sir, 
Your most affectionate, humble servant, 
</p><p>
William Tudor.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been duly favored with yours of the 3d instant. The length of the interval, since my last, has 
proceeded from a daily expectation of being able to 
communicate the final arrangements for introducing 
the new Government. The place of meeting has 
undergone much discussion, as you conjectured, and 
still remains to be fixed. <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> was first 
named, and negatived by a voice from Delaware. 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> came forward next ; Lancaster was opposed to it, and failed. <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a> was next tried, and, 
to the surprise of every one, had seven votes. It 
was easy to see tliat that ground, had it been free 
from objection, was not maintainable. Accordingly, 
the next day New Y^ork was inserted in the place 
of it, with the aid of the vote of Rhode Island. 
Rhode Island has, however, refused to give a final 
vote in the business, and has actually retired from 
Congress. The question will now be resumed between <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
</p><p>
It was mucli to be wished that a fit place for a 
respectable outset to the Government could be found 
more central than either. The former is inadmissible, 
if any regard is to be had to the southern or western country. It is so with me, for another reason; 
that it tends to stop the final and permanent seat 
short of the Potomac, certainly, and probably in the 
State of New Jersey. I know this to be one of the 
views of the advocates for <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. The only 
chance the Potomac has, is to get things in such a 
train that a coalition may take place between the 
Southern and Eastern States on the subject ; and, still 
more, that the final seat may be undecided for two 
or three years, within which period the western and 
south-western population wall enter more into the estimate. Wherever Congress may be, the choice, if 
speedily made, will not be sufficiently influenced by 
that consideration. In this point of view, I am of 
opinion <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a> would have been unfriendly to the 
true object. It would have retained Congress but a 
moment (so many States being north of it, and dissatisfied with it), and would have produced a coalition 
among those States to a precipitate election of the 
permanent seat, and an intermediate removal to a 
more northern position. 
</p><p>
You will have seen the circular letter for the Convention of this State. It has a most pestilent tendency. If an early General Convention cannot be parried, it is seriously to be feared that the system, 
which has resisted so many direct attacks, may be 
at last successfully undermined by its enemies. It is 
now, perhaps, to be wished that PJiode Island may 
not accede till this new crisis of danger be over. 
Some think it would have been better if even New 
York had held out till the operation of the Government could have dissipated the fears which artifice 
had created, and the attemj)ts resulting from those 
fears and artifices. We hear nothing yet from North 
Carolina, more than comes by the way of Petersburg. 
With the highest respect and attachment, I remain, 
dear Sir,

Your affectionate servant,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I send you the inclosed paper chiefly for the sake 
of the edict which fixes on May, for the meeting of 
the States-General in France. Letters from Mr. Jefferson authenticate this document. They mention also 
the disgrace, as it is called, of the Marquis. The 
struggle at present in that kingdom, seems to be 
entirely between the monarchy and aristocracy, and 
the hopes of the people merely in the competition of 
their enemies for their favor. It is probable, however, 
that both the parties contain real friends to libert}^, 
who will make events subservient to their object. 
</p><p>
The Count de Moustier, and the Marchioness de 
Brelian, are to set out this clay for <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>. I 
take it for granted you are not only apprised of the 
intended visit, but of the time at which the guests 
may be expected. The State of Connecticut has 
made choice of Dr. Johnson and Mr. Ellsworth for 
its Senators, and have referred that of its Representatives to the people at large ; every individual citizen to vote for every Representative. 
</p><p>
I have not heretofore acknowledged your last fxvor, 
nothing material having turned up for some time, 
and the purpose of Colonel Covington to see you, on 
his way to Virginia, superseding all the ordinary 
communications through the epistolary channel. It 
gives me much pleasure to find, that both the opposition, at first, and finally, the accession, to the vote 
fixing <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> for the first meeting of the new 
Congress, have your approbation. My fears, that the 
measure would be made a handle of by the opposition, are confirmed, in some degree, by my late information from Virginia. Mr. Pendleton, the Chancellor, 
tells me he has already met taunts from that quarter 
on this specimen of eastern equity and impartiality. 
Whether much noise will be made, will depend on 
the policy Mr. Henry may find it convenient to adoptAs <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> is at the head of his party, he may 
be induced, by that circumstance, not to make irritating reflections ; though the fact is, the party in this 
State, which is with him, are supposed to be indifferent and even secretly averse to the residence of 
Congress here. This, however, may not be known to 
him. I am, dear Sir,

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 2d instant, with the letters attending it, never came to hand till last evening. I 
have good reason to believe, that the delay happened 
between <a href='/results.php?city=alexandria' rel='city'>Alexandria</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a>, rather than 
at or from the latter place. Mr. ]\Iaury pays particular attention to all letters which arrive there for me, 
and forwards them to Orange by opportunities, which 
are frequent and safe. I apprehend there will be no 
impropriety in committing a confidential letter to that 
channel. As an additional precaution, I will desire 
him to be particularly attentive to every letter which 
may have your name on it. 
</p><p>
I have heard from two only of the returns from 
the electoral districts, the one in favor of JNIr. Gilchrist, the other of General Stephen. He succeeded 
against Colonel Cabel by a majority of eighty-two 
votes. He owes his success to the coalition between 
the two parties in Spotsylvania. My situation is unfavorable for intelligence from the State at large, and 
therefore I can say little of the prospects as to the 
February election. I fear, from the vague accounts 
which circulate, that the federal candidates are too 
likely to stand in the way of one another. This is 
not the case, however, in my district. The field is 
left entirely to Monroe and myself. The event of 
our competition will probably depend on the part to 
be taken by two or three descriptions of people, 
whose decision is not known, if not yet to be ultimately formed. I have pursued my pretensions much 
farther than I premeditated; having not only made 
great use of epistolary means, but actually visited 
two counties, Culpepper and Louisa, and publicly contradicted the erroneous reports propagated against me. 
It has been very industriously inculcated, that I am 
dogmatically attached to the Constitution in every 
clause, syllable, and letter ; and therefore not a single 
amendment will be promoted by my vote, either from 
conviction or a spirit of accommodation. This is the 
report most likely to affect the election, and most 
difficult to be combated with success, within the limited period. There is a number of others, however, 
which are auxiliaries to it. With my respectful compliments to Mrs. Washington, and the others of your 
family, I remain, dear Sir,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
We arrived here yesterday evening, where we have 
met with Mr. Dawson, just from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. When 
he left it, eighteen Representatives and eight Senators 
had assembled. It is not certain, when the deficiencies 
will be made up. The most fixvorable conjectures 
postpone it to Monday sennight. The members attending are chiefly from the eastward. I do not learn 
that a single member, except Mr. White, is from a 
State south of Pennsylvania, unless, indeed, Dr. Tucker 
is to be included in the exception. The New Jersey Representatives are not yet announced. Mr. Clark, it is supposed, will be one, Mr. Cadwalader, 
My. Boudinot, and Mr. Schureman, are talked of as 
the others. 
</p><p>
I find that the comrflunication, made to you from Kentucky, corresponds with an official letter to Congress from Governor St. Clair, which speaks of the 
same emissary, and the same errand. Notice has 
been transmitted of the affair to the Executive of 
Congress, in order that regular steps may be taken, 
if sufficient ground be afforded, for apprehending the 
incendiary. The project of G. M n for establishing a colony beyond the Mississippi is also going on. 
It is the opinion of Mr. Brown, as explained to Mr. Griffin, that emigrations to the Spanish territory will 
be enticed from Kentucky, as rapidly as the allurements of the latter place have obtained them from 
the Atlantic States. All these circumstances point 
out the conduct, which the new Government ought 
to pursue, with regard to the western country and 
Spain. 
</p><p>
I dropped you a line from <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>, mentioning 
the unanimity of the electoral votes of South Carolina and Georgia, for a President, and the manner in 
which the secondary votes were disposed of 
</p><p>
I am, dear Sir, your truly affectionate, 
</p><p>
James Madison, Jr.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On our arrival here, we found that the number of 
Representatives on the spot had been stationary from 
the second day of the meeting. Mr. Page, Mr. Lee, 
and myself raised it to twenty-one ; and INIr. S. Griffin and Mr. Moore have been since added. The number of attending Senators continues at eight. When 
a quorum will be made up in either House, rests 
on vague conjecture, rather than on any precise information. It is not improbable, I think, that the 
present week will supply the deficiency in one, if 
not both of them. The States most convenient are 
among the defaulters. It will not be known, I am 
told, in this State, who the Representatives are, till 
some tiifie next month. The federal party calculate 
on an equal division of the sixj Mr. Laurence for 
the city district ; Mr. Floyd for the Long Island district ; and Mr. Benson for a third. 
</p><p>
In New Jersey the election has been conducted in 
a very singular manner. The law having fixed no 
time expressly for closing the polls, they have been 
kept open three or four weeks in some of the counties, by a rival jealousy between the eastern and 
western divisions of the State ; and it seems uncertain when they would have been closed, if the Governor had not interposed by fixing on a day for 
receiving the returns, and proclaiming the successful 
candidates. The day is past, but I have not heard 
the result. The western ticket, in favor of Schureman, Boudinotj Cadwalader, Sennickson (if this is the 
name), is supposed to have prevailed ; but an impeachment of the election, by the unsuccessful competitors, has been talked of Two of the Representatives from Massachusetts are also unknown to us. 
In one of the districts, it is supposed that a disaffected man has prevailed. 
</p><p>
A British packet has long been expected, and is 
not yet arrived. The state of foreign news remains 
of consequence little altered. The accounts of latest 
date, through other channels, show, that the progress 
in France towards a Constitutional establishment, is 
unchecked, and that a coalition between the King 
and the Commons, against the nobility and clergy, 
will direct the innovations. With respectful compliments to Mrs. Washington and the rest of the family, 
I am, dear Sir^

Truly and affectionately, your obedient servant,

FROM DAVID STUART. 
</p><p>
Abingdon, 1-1 <a rel="month origin" value="7">July</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1789' rel="origin">1789</a>. 
</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Being just returned from a journey to the lower 
parts of the State, I am much distressed to find your 
indisposition has been much more severe than appeared from the public papers. I hope I may now congratulate you on your perfect recovery. Though you 
were pleased, at your departure, to desire to hear from 
me occasionally, yet, knowing how much you are oppressed in this way, it was not my intention to increase 
your list of correspondents, unless business required 
it, or I had some information of the public opinion 
respecting the operations of the Government to communicate, which, if not useful or important, might be 
satisfactory. Both these motives concur in dictating 
the present address. 
</p><p>
Nothing could equal the ferment and disquietude 
occasioned by the proposition respecting titles. As it 
is believed to have originated from Mr. Adams and 
Mr. Lee, they are not only unpopular to an extreme, 
but highly odious. Neither, I am convinced, will ever 
get a vote from this State again. As I consider it 
very unfortunate for the Government, that a person 
in the second office should be so unpopular, I have 
been much concerned at the clamor and abuse against 
him. Perhaps I feel it more sensibly, from being reminded of my insignificant exertions for him as an 
elector. The opponents to the Government affect to 
smile at it, and consider it as a verification of their 
prophecies about the tendency of the Government. 
Mr. Henry's description of it, that "it squinted towards monarchy," is in every mouth, and has established him in the general opinion as a true prophet. 
</p><p>
It has given me much pleasure to hear every part 
of your conduct spoke of with high approbation, and 
particularly your dispensing with ceremony occasionally, and walking the streets ; while Adams is never 
seen but in his carriage and six/-' As trivial as this 
may appear, it appears to he more captivating to the 
generality, than matters of more importance. Indeed, 
I believe the great herd of mankind form their judgments of characters, more from such slight occurrences, 
than those of greater magnitude ; and perhaps they 
are right, as the heart is more immediately consulted 
with respect to the former, than the latter, and an 
error of judgment is more easily pardoned, than one 
of the heart. I find the Senate in general to be unpopular, and much censured for keeping their doors 
shut. Nor do they appear more fortunate for their 
disagreement with the lower House, on the subject 
of a discrimination. I can only say, that I think, 
from what I have been able to learn, it would be a 
measure highly grateful to every part of this State 
but the British merchants. But it may, possibly, be 
founded more in prejudice and resentment, than sound 
policy ; and if experience should prove it so, I know 
it would be readily forgot that it was a measure of 
their own ; and censure in abundance would follow. 
But without it, it is asked, what inducement can the 
British Court have to enter into any treaty at all 
with America, when her commerce is as much favored 
without one, as that of an}'' nation which has a treaty ? 
In. passing through York to the Eastern Shore, I 
was much concerned to understand, that the family of 
so virtuous and patriotic a man as General N. was left 
in so destitute a condition. His numerous creditors 
had just presented their claims, which, it seems, amount 
to the enormous sum of thirty-five thousand pounds. 
At the low rates at which property sells, it is thought little will be left for liis family, after the debts are 
paid. As I know yoii are better acquainted with the 
father's virtues, than myself, I hope you will think 
these a sufficient justification for my mentioning his 
son, Thomas, to you for some office. He has been 
well educated, and bred to the law, and been two or 
three years attending as a practitioner at the General Court. From the number of old competitors there, his 
profits from his profession are but small and insufficient. I expect that some place in your family would 
be agreeable. If you have no occasion for more, I 
should suppose that the office of clerk to the Secretary of Foreign Affairs would be one to which he is 
well fitted from his profession. It is a piece of justice due to the family, that I should observe, that I 
have mentioned the subject without any application 
or suggestion on their part, prompted alone by my 
feelings for the distress of the family, and my high 
respect for the virtues of the father. Mr. Page will 
be able to give you more information respecting the 
qualifications of the young man than I can, if you 
should think the reasons I have given deserve any 
attention. I must now confess my awkwardness on 
this subject, and appeal to the motives which influenced me for venturing to harass you on a subject, on 
which I know you were tired out, months before you 
left home. 
</p><p>
Mr. Claiborne informed me, some time ago, by Mr. Bassett, and lately himself, that he conceived he 
had a right to the land in King William, purchased 
by Mr. Custis's father from his uncle, and containing 
about twenty-five hundred acres. He conceives the 
lands to have been entailed, and wishes to know if 
you have any information respecting its being docked. 
I can discover no instrument of that sort among the 
papers. In the deed of conveyance to Mr. Custis, I 
observe that it was sold by a decree in Chancery of 
the Court of King William, to pay Mr. Claiborne's 
debts. This is a very encouraging circumstance to 
me, as I cannot suppose the Court would have taken 
such a step without the best opinions that it was not 
entailed. I likewise find, that Mr. Powers, an able 
lawyer of that time, as an executor, joins in the 
conveyance, as also Philip W. Claiborne, father of 
the present claimant. I can hardly think the former 
would have made himself liable, and the latter conveyed away his right, without the fullest conviction 
of there being some defect in the entail. I have informed Mr. Claiborne of these circumstances ; but he 
does not appear to think them of any weight. He 
tells me the lawyers he has consulted think it a 
good entail. I have consulted no one yet but Colonel Innes, who is of the same opinion with Mr. Powers. Though it is not probable you have any information, which the papers do not furnish, jet I could 
wish to know it certainly I am told, by Mr. Moor, 
that Claiborne's father used to talk much of his right, 
and of suing for it. You may have heard of this, 
and the reasons which prevented him. 
</p><p>
I shall have little to do the remainder of the year 
but attend the different courts. The weighty suit in 
Chancery with Robert Alexander will be determined 
in August, and with Colonel Bassett in September, at 
"<a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>. Mr. W. Dandridge informs me, it is 
necessary there should be a deed of conveyance from 
you to Mr. Custis's heir for the lands you purchased 
in King William. You will determine whether it be 
so or not, to prevent any claim from your heirs. 
Mr. I. Dandridge has informed me of an order for a 
considerable sum due from his father's estate to Mr. Custis's, which he has sent to you. When informed of 
its being complied with, I shall give him credit for it. 
I must now desire my best compliments to Mrs. 
Washington. Mrs. Stuart and the girls are well, and 
desire their love to each of you, and beg to congratulate you on your recovery. I am, &c.,

FROM SIR EDWARD NEWENILiM. 
</p><p>
10 <a rel="month origin" value="10">October</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1789' rel="origin">1789</a>. 
</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I "would not omit the first opportunity of expressing the additional olDligation your Excellency has conferred on me, by introducing me to that respectable 
character, Mrs. Montgomery. She forwarded jour letter by the post, as she is at Lord Ranelagh's, twelve 
miles from this. Early the next morning, lady Newenham and I paid our respects, and had the pleasure 
of meeting her. Anxious to enjoy her company, we 
pressed her to return, and spend a few days here. 
</p><p>
She returned the yisit on the following day, and 
has promised, on her return from visiting her late 
brave soldier's relations, to favor us with her company. I introduced her into my American room, 
which gave her much satisfaction, as she saw^ 3'our 
Excellency's, and the pictures of all the respectable 
characters in America. She remarked with pleasure 
the picture of one Arnold reversed, and his treason 
wrote under it. She viewed the bust of the venerable and great Franklin with sensible emotion. We 
had but a short time for conversation, as Lord Ranelagh was in a hurry to attend at the levee of the 
Lords Justices. Little did I expect to see the widow 
of that man, on whose death I publicly expressed my 
sentiments of the American war and his character, bv 
appearing in Parliament in full mourning, and attending levees in the same dress. At that period, othei"s 
were afraid to express their feelings ; but from that 
moment, the papers announcing what I did, public 
conversation became more free, and the merits of the 
attack and defence of liberty were properly canvassed. It was soon afterwards that I was Chair man of 
the first meeting that reprobated and stopped the 
plan of sending all the military of this Kingdom to 
America, and hiring Hessians and Hanoverians from 
the carcass butchers of Germany. 
</p><p>
I acquainted the Duke of Leinster, Lord Charlemont, &c. &c., of Mrs. Montgomery's arrival. They 
immediately wrote me word " that they would wait 
on her, and particularly so, on account of the great 
character that recommends her." These are the words 
of all the answers I have got. General Massy, with 
whom General Montgomery was well acquainted at 
the first siege of <a href='/results.php?city=quebec' rel='city'>Quebec</a>, has paid his respects to 
her, the very day I wrote to him. Lady Newenham 
will continue her attention. I sent the Duke of 
Leinster's and Lord Charlemont's letters to her. 
</p><p>
Every day brings accounts of the spirit of liberty 
spreading through Europe. Though nothing of that 
kind has as yet occurred in Sweden, I am inclined 
to think that, if the King is not very circumspect, 
the people will renovate the Constitution, and again 
recall their right of elections and privileges. There 
is much discontent in that country, and Russia is 
growing too ponderous and extensive for the sovereign of Petersburg to command so distant an empire. 
</p><p>
A number of the first men of character, rank, and 
fortune, in this country, have associated under the 
name of the WJiig Club ; and each member is pledged 
under his hand, to support certain popular measures. 
It will, I hope, increase to a proper degree of 
strength and consequence. Something of that kind is 
now wanting ; for the present administration is taking 
longer strides to despotism, than ever any former 
administration attempted. Even North and Bute 
never ventured to insult this country, as our present 
Viceroy has presumed to do. He did not think himself very safe here ; therefore he left ns, and I helieve will not return again. Reports say that Weymouth (the foe of American freedom) is to succeed 
him. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to send your Excellency a few 
papers, hoping they may not he delayed, as they 
contain the truest accounts from France, though it 
may happen that you have received them before the 
arrival of this letter. There is a spirit arisen in the 
city of Dublin against the unconstitutional and expensive police (which is an absolute burden of twenty-one thousand pounds a year, instead of four thousand five hundred pounds, exclusive of the Ministerial 
patronage), as it adds two hundred and forty votes 
to their interest in the city, and near one hundred 
in this county. Their greatest efforts will be exerted 
at the ensuing election to carry one member for the 
city, and two for this county ; in the latter case, 
they have got (as they have done these twenty-one 
years) the other two candidates to join against me. 
However, I hope to succeed ; though I never spent 
in mono}'', meat, drink, or promises, the value of one 
shilling, on the contests for twenty-one years, except 
the poll-clerks, one lawyer, and advertisements. I 
never have an election dinner. I laid down this rule 
on my first entrance into public life, and have never 
altered my plan. Nor do I ever solicit any voter a 
second time. 
</p><p>
This season has been the wettest, most stormy, 
and irregular, which has happened here these fifteen 
years. Between the blasts, rains, and lightning, all 
our fruit was destroyed, our corn damaged; but we 
have still enough for our own consumption ; hay in 
greater plenty than has been known for seven years. 
That will prevent the great rise (with abundance of 
potatoes) of other articles. With the warmest sentiments of respect for your Excellency, and an unalterable attachment to the liberties of America, I remain, dear Sir, your most faithful and 
Most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
Edward Newenham. 
</p><p>
P. S. Lady Newenham joins me in best regards to Mrs. Washington.

</p><p>
Orange, 20 <a rel="month origin" value="11">November</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1789' rel="origin">1789</a>. 
</p><p>
DiLiR Sir, 
</p><p>
It was my purpose to have dropped you a few 
lines from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, but I was too much indisposed during my detention there to avail myself of 
that pleasure. Since my arrival here, I have till now 
been without a fit conveyance to the post-office. 
</p><p>
You will recollect the contents of a letter shown 
you from Mr. Innes to Mr. Brown. Whilst I was in 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, I was informed by the latter, who was 
detained there as well as myself by indisposition, that 
he had received later accounts, though not from the 
same correspondent, that the Spaniards have finally 
put an entire stop to the trade of our citizens down 
the river. The encouragements to such as settle 
under their own Government are continued. 
</p><p>
A day or two after I got to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, I fell in 
with ISIr. Morris. He broke the subject of the residence of Congress, and made observations which betrayed his dislike of the upshot of the business at 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and his desire to keep alive the southern project of an arrangement with Pennsylvania. I 
reminded him of the conduct of his State, and intimated that the fjuestion would probably sleep for 
some time in consequence of it. His answer implied 
that Congress must not continue at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>; and 
that, if he should be freed from his engagements 
with the Eastern States, by their refusal to take up 
the bill, and pass it as it went to the Senate, he 
should renounce all confidence in that quarter, and 
speak seriously to the Southern States, I told him 
they must be spoken to very seriously, after what 
had passed, if Pennsylvania expected them to listen 
to her ; that, indeed, there was probably an end to 
further intercourse on the subject. He signified that, 
if he should speak, it would be in earnest, and he 
believed no one would pretend that his conduct would 
justify the least distrust of his going through with 
his undertakings; adding, however, that he was determined, and accordingly gave me, as he had given 
others, notice that he should call up the postponed 
bill as soon as Congress should be reassembled. 
</p><p>
I observed to him that, if it was desirable to have 
the matter revived, we could not wish to have it in 
a form more likely to defeat itself It was unparliamentary and highly inconvenient, and would therefore be opposed by all candid friends to his object, 
as an improper precedent, as well as by those who 
were opposed to the object itself; and, if he should 
succeed in the Senate, the irregularity of the proceeding would justify the other House in withholding 
the signature of its speaker; so that the bill would 
never go up to the President. He acknowledged 
that the bill could not be got through, unless it had 
a majority in both Houses, on its merits. Why then, 
I asked, not take it up anew ? He said he meant to 
bring the gentlemen who had postponed the bill to 
the point ; acknowledged that he distrusted them, 
but held his engagements binding on him, until this 
final experiment should be made on the respect they 
meant to pay to theirs. 
</p><p>
I do not think it difficult to augur, from this conversation, the views which will govern Pennsylvania 
at the next session. Conversations held by Grayson, 
both with Morris and others in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and left 
by him in a letter to me, coincide with what I have 
stated. An attempt will first be made to alarm New 
York and the Eastern States into the plan postponed, 
by holding out the Potomac and <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> as the 
alternative ; and, if the attempt should not succeed, 
the alternative will then be held out to the southern 
members. On the other hand. <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and the 
Eastern States will enforce their policy of delay, by 
threatening the Southern States, as heretofore, with 
Germantown, or <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, or at least Susquehanna, 
and will, no doubt, carry the threat into execution if 
they can, rather than suffer an arrangement to take 
place between Pennsylvania and the Southern States. 
</p><p>
I hear nothing certain from the Assembly. It is 
said that an attempt of Mr. H. to revive the project 
of commutables, has been defeated ; that the amendments have been taken up, and are likely to be put 
off to the next session, the present House hayingbeen elected prior to the promulgation of them. This 
reason would have more force if the amendments did 
not so much correspond, as far as they go, with the 
propositions of the State Convention, which were before the public long before the last election. At any 
rate, the Assembly might pass a vote of approbation 
along with the postponement, and assign the reason 
of referring the ratification to their successors. It is 
probable that the scruple has arisen with the disaffected party. If it be construed by the public into a latent hope of some contingent opportunity for prosecuting the war against the General Government, I 
am of opinion the experiment will recoil on the 
authors of it. As far as I can gather, the great 
bulk of the late opponents are entirely at rest, and 
more likely to censure a further opposition to the 
Government, as now administered, than the Government itself One of the principal leaders of the Baptists lately sent me word that the amendments had 
entirely satisfied the disaffected of his sect, and that 
it would appear in their subsequent conduct. 
</p><p>
I ought not to conclude without some apology for 
so slovenly a letter. I put off writing it till an 
opportunity should present itself, not knowing but 
something from time to time might turn up that 
would make it less unworthy of your perusal ; and 
it has so happened that the opportunity barely gives 
me time for this hasty scrawl. With the most perfect esteem and affectionate attachment, I remain, 
dear Sir,

Orange, 5 <a rel="month origin" value="12">December</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1789' rel="origin">1789</a>. 
</p><p>
Dear Sm, 
</p><p>
Since my last I have been furnished with the inclosed copy of the letter from the Senators of this 
State to its Legislature. It is well calculated to keep 
alive the disaffection to the Government ; and is, accordingly, applied to that use by the violent partisans. I understand the letter was written by the 
first subscriber of it, as, indeed, is pretty evident 
from the style and strain of it. The other, it is said, 
subscribed it with reluctance. I am less surprised 
that this should have been the case, than that he 
should have subscribed at all. 
</p><p>
My last information from <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> is contained 
in the following extract from a letter of the 28th of 
"November, from an intelligent member of the House 
of Delegates. " The revenue bill, which proposes a 
reduction of the public taxes one fourth below the 
last year's amount, is with the Senate. Whilst this 
business was before the House of Delegates, a proposition was made to receive tobacco and hemp as commutables, which was negatived ; the House determining still to confine the collection to specie and specie warrants. Two or three petitions have been presented, which asked a general suspension of executions for twelve months ; they were read, but denied 
a reference. The Assembly have passed an act for 
altering the time of choosing Representatives to Congress, which is now fixed to be on the third Monday 
in September, suspending the powers of the Representative until the February after his election. This 
change was made, to suit the time of the annual 
meeting of Congress. The fate of the amendments, 
proposed by Congress to the General Government, is 
still in suspense. In a Committee of the Whole 
House, the first ten were acceded to with little opposition ; for, on a question taken On each separately, 
there was scarcely a dissenting voice. On the two 
last, a debate of some length took place, which ended 
in rejection. Mr. E. Randolph, who advocated all the 
others, stood, in this contest, in the front of opposition. His principal objection was pointed against the 
word '^retained" in the eleventh proposed amendment; 
and his argument, if I understood it, was applied in 
this manner; — that, as the rights declared in the 
first ten of the proposed amendments were not all 
that a free people would require the exercise of, and 
that, as there was no criterion by which it could be 
determined whether any other particular right was 
retained or not, it would be more safe and more consistent with the spirit of the first and seventeenth' 
amendments, proposed by Virginia, that this reservation against constructive power should operate rather 
as a provision against extending the powers of Congress by their own authority, than a protection to 
rights reducible to no definitive certainty. 
</p><p>
"But others, among whom I am one, see not the force 
of the distinction ; for, by preventing an extension of 
power in that body from which danger is apprehended, 
safety will be insured, if its powers be not too extensive already ; and so, by protecting the rights of the 
people and of the States, an improper extension of 
power will be prevented, and safety made equally certain. If the House should agree to the resolution for 
rejecting the two last, I am of opinion that it will 
bring the whole into hazard again, as some, who have 
been decided friends to the ten first, think it would 
be unwise to adopt them without the eleventh and 
twelfth. Whatever mav be the fate of the amendments submitted by Congress, it is probable that an 
application for further amendments will be made by 
this Assembly; for the opposition to the Federal Constitution is, in my opinion, reduced to a single point, 
the power of direct taxation. Those who wish the 
change are desirous of repeating the application ; 
whilst those who wish it not, are indifferent on the 
subject, supposing that Congress will not propose a 
change which would take from them a power so necessary for the accomplishment of those objects which 
are confided to their care. 
"Messrs. Joseph Jones and Spencer Roane are 
appointed Judges of the General Court, to fill the 
vacancies occasioned by the death of Mr. Gary, and 
the removal of Mr. Mercer to the Court of Appeals." 
The difficulty started against the amendments is 
really unlucky ; and the more to be regretted, as it 
springs from a friend to the Constitution. It is a 
still greater cause of regret, if the distinction be, as 
it appears to me, altogether fanciful. If a line can 
be drawn between the powers granted and the rights 
retained, it would seem to be the same thing, wdiether 
the latter be secured by declaring that they shall 
not be abridged, or that the former shall not be 
extended. If no line can be drawn, a declaration, in 
either form, would amount to nothing. If the distinction were just, it does not seem to be of sufficient 
importance to justify the risk of losing the amendments, of furnishing a handle to the disaffected, and 
of arming North Carolina with a pretext, if she be 
disposed, to prolong her exile from the Union. With 
every sentiment of respect and attachment, I am, 
dear Sir,

Chesterfield, 15 <a rel="month origin" value="12">December</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1789' rel="origin">1789</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received at this place the honor of your 
letters of October the 13th and November the 30th, 
and am truly flattered by your nomination of me to 
the very dignified office of Secretary of State ; for 
which permit me here to return you my humble 
thanks. Could any circumstance seduce me to overlook the disproportion between its duties and my talents, it would be the encouragement of your choice. 
But when I contemplate the extent of that office, embracing, as it does, the principal mass of domestic administration, together with the foreign, I cannot be 
insensible of my inequality to it; and I should enter 
on it with gloomy forebodings from the criticisms and 
censures of a public, just indeed in their intentions, 
but sometimes misinformed and misled, and always 
too respectable to be neglected. I cannot but foresee 
the possibility that this may end disagreeably for me, 
who, having no motive to public service but the public satisfaction, would certainly retire the moment 
that satisfaction should appear to languish. 
</p><p>
On the other hand, I feel a degree of familiarity 
with the duties of my present office, as far at least 
as I am capable of understanding its duties. The 
ground I have already passed over, enables me to see 
my way into that which is before me. The change of government, too, taking place in the country where 
it is exercised, seems to open a possibility of procuring from the new rulers some new advantages in 
commerce, which may he agreeable to our countrymen. So that as far as my fears, my hopes, or my 
inclination might enter into this question, I confess 
they would not lead me to prefer a change. 
</p><p>
But it is not for an individual to choose his post. 
You are to marshal us as may best be for the public good j and it is only in the case of its being indifferent to you, that I would avail myself of the option you have so kindly offered in your letter. If 
you think it better to transfer me to another post, 
my inclination must be no obstacle ; nor shall it be, 
if there is any desire to suppress the office I now 
hold, or to reduce its grade. In either of these cases, 
be so good only as to signify to me, by another line, 
your ultimate wish, and I shall conform to it cordially. If it should be to remain at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, my 
chief comfort will be to work under your eye, my 
only shelter the authority of your name, and the 
wisdom of measures to be dictated by you and implicitly executed by me. Whatever you may be 
pleased to decide, I do not see that the matters w^hich 
have called me hither, will permit me to shorten the 
stay I originally asked; that is to say, to set out on 
my journey northward till the month of March. As 
early as possible in that month, I shall have the 
honor of paying my respects to you in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
In the mean time, I have that of tendering you the 
homage of those sentiments of respectful attachment^ 
with which I am. Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
Thomas Jefferson.

Amsterdam, 20 <a rel="month origin" value="12">December</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1789' rel="origin">1789</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I avail myself of the departure of the <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> 
packet, Captain Earle, to transmit to your Excellency 
a letter I received for you on lea^dng Russia, in 
August last, from my friend, the Count de Segur, 
Minister of France at St. Petersburg. That gentleman and myself have frequently conversed on subjects that regard America ; and the most pleasing reflection of all has been, the happy establishment of 
the new Constitution, and that you are so deservedly 
placed at the head of the Government by the unanimous voice of America. Your name alone, Sir, has 
established in Europe a confidence, that was, for some 
time before, entirely wanting in American concerns ; 
and I am assured that the happy effects of your Administration are still more sensibly felt throughout 
the United States. This is more glorious for you 
than all the laurels that your sword so nobly won in 
support of the rights of human nature. In war, your 
fame is immortal as the hero of liberty. In peace, 
you are her patron and the firmest supporter of her 
rights. Your greatest admirers, and even your best 
friends, have now but one wish left for you, — that 
you may long enjoy health and your present happiness. 
</p><p>
I send by this occasion, to Mr. Charles Thomson 
and to Mr. John Adams, sundry documents from the 
Count de Segur, on my subject. I presume that 
those pieces will be communicated to your Excellency. They explain, in some degree, my reasons for 
leaving Russia, and the danger to which I was exposed by the dark intrigues and mean subterfuges of 
Asiatic jealousy and malice. 
Mr. Jefterson can inform you respecting my mission to the Court of Denmark. I was received and 
treated there with marked politeness ; and, if the fine 
words I received are true, the business will soon be 
settled. I own, however, that I should have stronger 
hopes, if America had created a respectable marine ; 
for that argument would give weight to every transaction with Europe. 
</p><p>
I acquitted myself of the commission with which 
you honored me when last in America, by delivering 
your letters with my own hand, at Paris, to the persons to whom they were addressed. I am. Sir, with 
great respect, esteem, and attachment, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most devoted and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
Paul Jones. 
</p><p>
N. B. In case your Excellency should have any 
orders to send me, I think it my duty to subjoin my 
address, tinder cover, " To Messrs. N. & J. Van Staphorst and Hubbard, Amsterdam."

<a href='/results.php?city=plymouth' rel='city'>Plymouth</a>, 1 Maj, <a href='/results.php?year=1790' rel="origin">1790</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
Ambitious to avoid both the style and the sentiment of common dedications, more frequently the incense of adulation than the result of truth, I only 
ask the illustrious Washington to permit a lady of 
his acquaintance to introduce to the public, under his 
patronage, a small volumef written as the amusement 
of solitude, at a period when every active member 
of society was engaged either in the field or the 
Cabinet, to resist the strong hand of foreign domination. 
</p><p>
The approbation of one who has united all hearts 
in the field of conquest, in the lap of peace, and at 
the head of the Government of the United States, 
must for a time give countenance to a writer who, 
claiming the honor of private friendship, hopes for this indulgence. But it must be a bold adventurer 
in the paths of literature, who dreams of fame in any 
cleaTee commensurate with the duration of laurels 
reaped by a hero, who has led the armies of America to glory, victory, and independence. 
</p><p>
This may perhaps, be an improper place to make 
many observations on a revolution, that may eventually shake the proud systems of European despotism. Yet you, Sir, who have borne such a distinguished and honorable part in the great conflict, till 
the nations, wearied with slaughter, listened to the 
voice of nature and <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, and gave truce to 
the miseries of man, — will permit me to observe that, 
connected by consanguinity or friendship with many 
of the principal characters who asserted and defended the rights of an injured country, the mind has 
been naturally led to contemplate the magnitude both 
of the causes and the consequences of a convulsion, 
that has been felt from the eastern borders of the 
Atlantic to the western wilds. 
</p><p>
Feeling much for the distresses of America in the 
dark days of her affliction, a faithful record has been 
kept of the most material transactions through a period that has engaged the attention both of the philosopher and the politician ; and if life is spared, a 
just trait of the most distinguished characters, either 
for valor, virtue, or patriotism, or for perfidy, intrigue, 
inconsistency, or ingratitude, shall be faithfully transmitted to posterity, by one who unites in the general wish that you. Sir, may continue to preside in 
the midst of your brethren, until nature asks the 
aid of retirement and repose, to tranquillize the last 
stages of human life. I am, respected Sir, with every 
sentiment of esteem and friendship, the President's 
Most obedient and very humble servant,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
The desire which I have had to multiply the portrait, which Madame de Brehan has made of you, has 
deprived her of the original for five months, which 
has remained, during that time, in the hands of the 
engraver. Our citizens, of all denominations, are, at 
this day, more or less taken off from their habitual 
occupations ; and their functions, civil or military, absorb the greater part of their time, employed in trying to establish liberty between despotism, which has 
been overturned, and licentiousness, which is eager 
to replace it. 
</p><p>
Accept, with goodness, I pray Sir, the homage 
which I have the honor to make, in the accompanj^ing proofs. Madame de Brehan will profit of the 
first certain opportunity which presents, to address to 
Madame Washington the medallion intended for her. 
In the mean time, she will make a copy of the original for herself 
</p><p>
The country, in which I dwell at this moment, 
ought no longer to be considered as that which I 
knew before I went to America. If excesses procure 
but rarely the happiness which they hold out, the 
virtuous and prudent part of the French nation ought 
to tremble. " Without proper men to govern, the best 
laws are a mere dead letter," said a sage to me, a 
short time before my departure from the United 
States. Who, more than we, ought at this day to be 
convinced of it ? The kingdom of France has been 
deeply wounded, and the remedies employed in its 
cure may prove fatal. I fear that many of those 
employed in restoring us, are not sincere, or sufficiently enlightened. There are, among the principals, men 
of whom I have suspended my judgment till now. 
We cannot sound their intentions ; actions wear, frequently, different aspects. Time indicates what ought 
to fix opinion. 
</p><p>
I experience a solace of the chagrins, caused by 
the situation of my own country, in learning the state 
of yours. Sir, which has the happiness of being guided by a Chief capable of giving life to the laws. 
No one more sincerely and feelingly interests himself 
than I do, in the successes of the United States, and, 
particularly, in yours. I avow, frankly, that I cannot 
conceive the possibility of maintaining the prosperity 
of a great empire without great means, and, consequently, without great force in the execution. It was 
not necessary, to be convinced of this, that I should, 
within two years, become a witness of two revolutions in opposite senses ; — in seeing, on one side, a 
great Executive power created ; on the other, one altogether established, overturned, and which he, who 
was clothed with it, offered of himself to regulate by 
the usage of wise laws. The want of this great and 
indispensable resource holds us, at this day, in an 
anarchy, which cannot cease but by the establishment 
of this legal resource, and for which I cannot see a 
substitute, notwithstanding the endeavours of ambitious and metaphysical men. I am, with respect. Sir,

</p><p>
General, 
The letter with which your Excellency has honored me, ot the 29th of August hist, and which accompanied a copy of that excellent work, the "History 
of the Insurrection in Massachusetts," is a new favor, 
which I appreciate in all its extent; happy if, with 
the aid of your indulgence, I may be able to justify 
the good opinion which you have of my zeal and 
eternal devotion to the American cause. 
</p><p>
With regard to Mr. Morris, the bearer of the abovementioned letter, I have seen but few men so well 
instructed in the interests of his country, and in 
those of Europe. I regret much not to have had his 
acquaintance, but in the moment when I was settingout for France. Some friends have undertaken to 
supply my place, and to offer to the worthy American 
all their zeal and attachment. I have employed myself, since I have been in Paris, in translating the 
History of the Insurrection. I shall be ready in a 
couple of months, and I will hasten to send to your 
Excellency a copy of the translation, to which I shall 
give every attention to render it with fidelity. 
</p><p>
You know. General, the fatal consequences of 
the invasion of the Prussian troops in Holland, and 
the abandonment in which France has been forced to 
leave us at that epoch. I have shared, in some sort, 
the fate of the friends of the country, by the confidence which the Government then reposed in me. Impatient to emancipate myself from the yoke under 
which the Hollanders bent, I determined to come to 
reside in Paris ; in fine, to live more free, and to 
trace more nearly the effects of the French Revolution in regard to us, since we can only hope for safety 
from their succour. The Marquis de Lafayette, the 
worthy emulant and friend of your Excellency, covers 
himself with glory in France ; and if the guardian 
genius of France preserves him to them, he will enjoy the sweet satisfaction of having done that for his 
fellow-citizens, which your Excellency has clone for 
America. I have the honor sometimes to see this 
young herO; and I should desire much to make my 
zeal and my services agreeable to him; hut, little accustomed to ask places for myself, and maladroit in 
soliciting, I have energy only for others. Perhaps jM. 
Lafayette will give me some department, when he 
knows that, without renouncing the interests of Holland, I may be of some utility in France. Our Dutch 
refugees desire, and interest themselves in it. 
</p><p>
I propose publishing my memoirs relative to thenegotiation with which I have been charged in Prussia, in which will be developed all the secret causes, 
which have served as the basis of the odious policy 
of England, Prussia, and the House of Orange. This 
work will proscribe me from Holland, while the present system subsists ; but I would rather fulfil my 
task by a new sacrifice, than maintain any longer a 
silence from which my fellow-citizens can draw no 
advantage. I recommend myself. General, to the continuance of your precious esteem. I refer to the 
desires and motives, in my last letters; and I have 
the honor to say, with the most profound veneration, 
I am. General,

[Without date. Received in <a rel="month origin" value="6">June</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1790' rel="origin">1790</a>.] 
</p><p>
I avail myself of the opportunity afforded me by 
my friend Count Andriani, of conveying to you an 
Ode, which Count Alfieri, the author of it, desired me 
long ago to convey to you. The rambling, and of 
course unsettled condition, I have been in since my 
return to Europe, has entirely put it out of my power 
to comply sooner with Count Alfieri's request; and 
this unpleasant condition, added to an apprehension 
of being troublesome, has likewise deprived me of the 
satisfaction of joining my most sincere congratulations 
with those of my fellow-citizens, on the auspicious 
event which has placed you, the object of our veneration, love, confidence, and gratitude, at the helm of 
our Government. That you may long, Sir, live to 
make our country prosper, is, I can assure you, the 
most ardent wish, not only of us Americans, but of 
all those Europeans also, who, sensible of the value 
of liberty, know how much indebted they are to the 
example, which the glorious cause j^ou have so nobly 
defended, has given to the world, for the rapid and 
successful strides that are now making in a considerable part of Europe, towards the attainment of that 
invaluable blessing. 
There is not a more popular man in France, than 
our galkint Marquis, your pupil ; nor indeed can popularity be more justly merited. His actions are 
directed by the purest views, and his glory consists 
in doing good to mankind. May his labors, therefore, 
be crowned with success ! Count Andriani is a nobleman from Milan, highly distinguished by every valuable endowment, and deserving of the honor of being 
presented to you. As he is thoroughly acquainted 
with the affairs of Europe, I have nothing further to 
say at present, than to offer my most respectful compliments to Mrs. Washington, and subscribe myself 
with the greatest respect. Sir, your most obliged, and 
Most obedient, humble servant,

FROM THOMAS JEFFERSON, SECRETARY OF STATE 
</p><p>
28 <a rel="month origin" value="8">August</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1790' rel="origin">1790</a>. 
</p><p>
I am SO deeply impressed with the magnitude of 
the dangers which will attend our Government, if 
Louisiana and the Floridas be added to the British 
empire, that, in my opinion, we ought to make ourselves parties in the general war expected to take 
place, should this be the only means of preventing 
the calamity. But I think we should defer this step 
as long as possible ; because war is full of chances, 
which may relieve us from the necessity of interfering ; and if necessary, still the later we interfere, 
the better we shall be prepared. 
</p><p>
It is often, indeed, more easy to prevent the capture of a place than to retake it. Should it be so 
in the case in question, the difference between the two operations of preventing and retaking, will not 
be so costly as two, three, or four years more of war. So that I am for preserving neutrality as long, 
and entering into the war as late, as possible. 
</p><p>
If this be the best course, it decides, in a good 
degree, what should be our conduct, if the British 
ask leave to march troops through our territory, or 
march them without leave. It is well enough agreed, 
in the law of nations, that for a neutral power to 
give or refuse permission to the troops of either belligerent party to pass through their territory, is no 
breach of neutrality, provided the same refusal or 
permission be extended to the other party. If we 
give leave of passage, then, to the British troops, 
Spain will have no just cause of complaint against 
us, provided we extend the same leave to her, when 
demanded. If we refuse (as indeed we have a right 
to do), and the troops should pass notwithstanding, 
of which there can be little doubt, we shall stand 
committed. For either we must enter immediately into 
the war, or pocket an acknowledged insult in the 
face of the world ; and one insult pocketed, soon produces another. 
</p><p>
There is, indeed, a middle course, which I should 
be inclined to prefer ; that is, to avoid giving any 
answer. They will proceed notwithstanding ; but, to 
do this under our silence, will admit of palliation, and 
produce apologies from military necessity, and w^ill 
leave us free to pass it over without dishonor, or to 
make it a handle of quarrel hereafter, if w^e should 
have use for it as such. But, if we are obliged to 
give an answer, I think the occasion not such as 
should induce us to hazard that answer which might 
commit us to the war at so early a stage of it ; and 
therefore, that 'the passage should be permitted. 
If they should pass without having asked leave, I 
should be for expressing our dissatisfaction to the 
British Court, and keeping alive an altercation on 
the subject, till events should decide whether it is 
most expedient to accept their apologies, or profit 
of the aggression as a cause of war.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been again to see Mr. Barclay on the subject of Ms mission; and, to hasten him, I communicated to him the draught of his instructions, and he 
made an observation which may render a small change 
expedient. You know it had been concluded that 
he should go without any defined character, in order 
to save expense. He observed that, if his character 
was undefined, they would consider him as an Ambassador, and expect proportional liberalities ; and he 
thought it best to fix his character to that of Consul, 
which was the lowest that could be employed. Thinking there is weight in his opinion, I have the honor 
to inclose you a blank commission for him as Consul, 
and another letter to the Emperor, no otherwise different from that you signed, but as having a clause 
of credence in it. If you approve of this change, 
you will be so good as to sign these papers and return them ; otherwise the letter before signed will 
still suffice. 
</p><p>
I inclose you a Massachusetts paper, whereby you 
will see that some acts of force have taken place on 
our eastern boundary. Probably that State will send 
us authentic information of them. The want of an 
accurate map of the Bay of Passamaquoddy renders 
it difficult to form a satisfactory opinion on the point 
in contest. I write to-day to Rufus Putnam to send 
me his survey, referred to in his letter. There is a 
report that some acts of force have taken place on 
the northern boundary of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and are now 
under consideration of the Government of that State. 
</p><p>
The impossibility of bringing the Court of London 
to an adjustment of any difference whatever, renders 
our situation perplexing. Should any applications from the States, or their citizens, be so urgent as to 
require something to be said before your return, my 
opinion would be, that they should be desired to 
make no new settlements on our part, nor suffer any 
to be made on the part of the British within the 
disputed territory ; and if any attempts should be 
made to remove them from the settlements already 
made, that they are to repel force by force, and ask 
aid of the neighbouring militia to do this, and no 
more. I see no other safe way of forcing the British Government to come forward themselves and demand an amicable settlement. If this idea meets 
your approbation, it may prevent a misconstruction 
by the British of what may happen, should I have 
this idea suggested in a proper manner to Colonel Beckwith. 
</p><p>
The experiments, which have been tried, of distilling sea-water with Isaac's mixture, and also without 
it, have been rather in favor of the distillation without any mixture. 
</p><p>
A bill was yesterday ordered to be brought into 
the House of Representatives here for granting a 
sum of money for building a Federal Hall, House 
for the President, &c. 
</p><p>
You knew of Mr. Robert Morris's purchase of Gorham and Phelps of one million, three hundred thousand acres of land of the State of Massachusetts, at 
five pence an acre. It is said that he has sold one 
million, two hundred thousand of these in Europe, 
through the agency of Mr. Franklin, who, it seems, 
went on this business conjointly with that of printing 
of his grandfather's works. Mr. Morris, under the 
name of Ogden, and perhaps in partnership with him, 
has bought the residue of the lands held in the same 
country by Massachusetts, for . The Indian title of the former purchase has been extinguished 
by Gorham, but that of the latter is not ; perhaps it 
cannot be. In that case, a similarity of interest will 
produce an alliance with the Yazoo Companies. Perhaps a sale may be made in Europe to purchasers 
ignorant of the Indian right. 
</p><p>
I shall be happy to hear that no accident has 
happened to you in the bad roads you have passed, 
and that you are better prepared for those to come 
by lowering the hang of your carriage, and exchanging the coachman for two postilions ; circumstances 
which, I confess to you, appeared to me essential for 
your safety, for which no one on earth more sincerely 
prays, both from public and private regard, than he 
who has the honor to be,

Berlin, 2G <a rel="month origin" value="4">April</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1791' rel="origin">1791</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I received but yesterday, the letter with which 
you honored me on the 6th of November last. Its 
date recalled to my mind the place where I had the 
satisfaction of paying my first homage to you. That 
interesting period of my life will always be recollected with the same sensibility. 
</p><p>
The country life, which you know. Sir, how to 
render as useful to your citizens by your example, as 
agreeable to yourself, is well worthy of engaging as 
much of your time as you can give it. I have learnt, 
with very great satisfaction, the influence which it 
has had on your health. It is there that the relaxation of the mind, and the exercise of the body, dispel those evils which are occasioned by the restraint 
of living in a city, and which are peculiarly unfavorable to those, who are constantly occupied in the 
painful cares of Government. 
</p><p>
The success, which attends your cares, Sir, in the 
administration of the United States, is a flattering recompense for those labors which you have so long 
devoted to your country. So well am I convinced of 
the wisdom and virtue of the American Congress, 
that I never fail to present it as a model for my fellow-citizens. If you have ever read the preface, 
placed at the beginning of a translation which I 
solicited, of the American Laws, digested by order 
of Congress in <a href='/results.php?year=1789'>1789</a>, you would there have seen 
my opinion. I am the author of those reflections, 
which I have developed on more than one occasion. 
Minds which incline to extremes in my country, are 
not yet disposed to receive them. Instead of the 
energy, which results from a public force well organized, we see that violence reign, which results from 
a force placed without its centre. The end has been 
missed. I, however, love to flatter myself that it will 
return. They have exaggerated the evils which they 
suffered, and have employed, in consequence thereof, 
remedies excessively violent, and in no manner suited 
to the disorder which they had to handle. I hope 
those who are firm, have a desire to retrace their 
steps, which requires more courage and talents than 
to go straight forward. Any sacrifice, even that of 
self-love, ought to be accounted as nothing, by a good 
citizen; and if they claim that Kings should make 
an avowal of their errors, why should simple citizens 
claim to persevere in theirs? 
</p><p>
I did not attach myself to any party during my 
stay in France. I flattered no idol of the moment, 
because I had never flattered any heretofore. I love 
my country with ardor. For a long time, I have devoted myself to lier. I lamented the abuse of the 
former Government ; I lament that they have not 
made the one which follows it better. I wait until 
they renounce those chimeras, and descend from the 
regions of perfection, which do not belong to the human condition. I confine myself to fulfilling, in my 
sphere, the duties which are allotted me. Our nation 
deserves to be happy. The crime of leading her 
away from happiness is great, in proportion as it is 
easy to conduct her to it. The tissue of a false 
glory, enthusiasm for the perfection of government, 
cupidity, vengeance, and hatred, are not good ingredients for forming the chiefs of a Revolution. It was 
good perhaps to demolish; but it is rare that a demolition is suitable when the passions dispel the judgment. I have seen you. Sir, grieve at a Henry. How 
many Henrys have we in France ! 
</p><p>
In whatever situation I may be, I shall not cease 
to prove the lively interest which I take in the prosperity of the United States ; and I shall always regard it as a mark of good fortune, to have been in 
a situation to admire you, and to give testimonies of 
the veneration which is due to your virtues and to 
your eminent qualities.

I am, with respect, Sir, &c..

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
In my last letter from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, I mentioned 
that Mr. Madison and myself were about to take a 
trip up the North River, as far as circumstances 
should permit. The levelness of the roads led us 
quite on to Lake George, where, taking boat, we 
went through that, and about twenty-five miles into 
Lake Champlain. Returning then to <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>, we 
concluded to cross over through Vermont to Connecticut River, and go down that instead of the North 
River, which we had already seen ; and we are so far 
on that route. Li the course of our journey we have 
had opportunities of visiting Stillwater, <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>, 
Forts William Henry and George, <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, Crown 
Point, and the scene of General Stark's victory. 
</p><p>
I have availed myself of such opportunities as occurred, to inquire into the grounds of the report that 
something disagreeable had taken place in the vicinities of the British posts. It seems to have been the 
following incident. They had held a small post at a 
block-house on the North Hero, an island on the Vermont side of Lake Champlain, and something further 
south than their principal post at the Point-au-Fer. 
The Maria, hitherto stationed at the latter for custom-house purposes, was sent to the block-house, and 
there exercised her usual visits on boats passing to 
and from Canada. This, being an exercise of power 
further within our jurisdiction, became the subject of 
notice and clamor with our citizens in that quarter. 
The vessel has been since recalled to the Point-auFer; and, being unfit for service, a new one is to be 
built to perform her functions. This she has usually 
done at the Point-au-Fer with a good deal of rigor, 
bringing all vessels to at that place, and sometimes 
under such circumstances of wind and weather as to 
have occasioned the loss of two vessels and cargoes. 
These circumstances produce strong sensations in that 
quarter, and not friendly to the character of our Government. The establishment of a custom-house at 
Alburg, nearly opposite to Point-au-Fer, has given 
the British considerable alarm. A groundless story 
of two hundred Americans, seen in arms near Pointau-Fer, has been the cause, or the pretext, of their 
reenforcing that place a few days ago with a company of men from St. John's. It is said here, they 
have called in their guard from the block-house ; but 
the information is not direct enough to command 
entire belief. 
</p><p>
On inquiring into the dispositions in Canada, on 
the subject of the projected form of Government 
there, we learn that they are divided into two parties ; the English, who desire something like an English 
Constitution, but so modelled as to oblige the French 
to choose a certain proportion of English Representatives ; and the French, who wish a continuance of the 
French laws, moderated by some ingraftments from 
the English Code. The Judge of their Common 
Pleas heads the former party ; and Smith, the Chief 
Justice, secretly guides the latter. 
</p><p>
We encounter the Green Mountains to-morrow, with 
cavalry in part disabled, so as to render our prospects a little uncertain. I presume, however, I shall 
be in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> in a fortnight. I have the honor 
to be, with sentiments of the most perfect respect 
and attachment. Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and most humble servant,

</p><p>
Pbiladelphia, 7 <a rel="month origin" value="11">November</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1791' rel="origin">1791</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have duly considered the letter you were pleased 
to refer to me, of the 18th of August, from his Excellency Governor Pinckney, to yourself, together with 
the draught of one proposed to be written by hiin to 
the Governor of Florida, claiming the redelivery of 
certain fugitives from justice, who have been received 
in that country. The inconveniences of such a receptacle for debtors and malefactors, in the neighbourhood of the Southern States, are obvious and 
great ; and I wish the remedy were as certain and 
short as the letter seems to suppose. 
</p><p>
The delivery of fugitives from one country to another, as practised by several nations, is in consequence of Conventions settled between them, defining 
precisely the cases wherein such deliveries shall take 
place. I know that such CtDnventions exist between 
France and Spain, France and Sardinia, France and 
Germany, France and the Netherlands, between the 
several sovereigns constituting the Germanic body, 
and, I believe, very generally between the coterminous states on the Continent of Europe. England 
has no such Convention with any nation, and their 
laws have given no power to their Executive to surrender fugitives of any description. They are accord
voL. IV. 33 
ingiy constantly refused ; and hence England has been 
the asylum of the Paolis, the La Mottes, the Calonnes, in short, of the most attrocious offenders as 
well as the most innocent victims, who have been 
able to get there. 
</p><p>
The laws of the United States, like those of England, receive every fugitive, and no authority has 
been given to our Executives to deliver them up. 
In the case of Longchamp, a subject of France, a 
formal demand was made by the Minister of France, 
and was refused. He had, indeed, committed an offence within the United States ; but he was not demanded as a criminal, but as a subject. 
</p><p>
The French Government has shown great anxiety 
to have such a Convention with the United States 
as might authorize them to demand their subjects 
coming here. They got a clause in the Consular 
Convention, signed by Dr. Franklin and the Count 
de Vergennes, giving their Consuls a right to take 
and send back Captains of vessels, mariners, and j!?«ssengers. Congress saw the extent of the word passengers, and refused to ratify the Convention. A new 
one was therefore formed, omitting that word. In 
fact, however desirable it be that the perpetrators of 
crimes, acknowledged to be such by all mankind, 
should be delivered up to punishment, yet it is extremely difficult to draw the line between those and 
acts rendered criminal by tyrannical laws only. Hence 
the first step always is a Convention defining the 
cases where a surrender shall take place. 
</p><p>
If, then, the United States could not deliver up to 
Governor Quesada, a fugitive from the laws of his 
Government, we cannot claim, as a right, the delivery 
of fugitives from us ; and it is worthy consideration, 
whether the demand proposed to be made in Governor Pinckney's letter, should it be complied with 
by the other party, might not commit us disagreeably, perhaps dishonorably, in the event. For I do not 
think we can take for granted, that the Legislature 
of the United States will establish a Convention for 
the mutual delivery of fugitives ; and, without a 
reasonable certainty that they will, I think we ought 
not to give Governor Quesada any grounds to expect that, in a similar case, we would redeliver fugitives from his Government. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c. 
</p><p>
Thomas Jeffekson.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
By the House of Representatives of Pennsylvania, 
I am empowered to " digest into proper order and 
form, the laws of that Commonwealth," and "report 
such alterations, additions, and improvements, as the 
principles and forms of the Constitution may require." 
In this work I have made some progress; during 
which it has occurred to me, that a similar work, 
with regard to the laws of the United States, might, 
with propriety, accompany that in which I am engaged. 
</p><p>
To you it is unnecessary to make any general remarks concerning the immense importance of a good 
code of municipal law. There are two circumstances 
which induce me to think that, to the United States, 
this subject is peculiarly interesting. 
</p><p>
1. Their Government is newlv formed and ors-anized. A good system of legislation introduced into it 
now, will have a salutary, a decisive, and a permanent 
influence upon its future fortunes and character. Good 
principles, at least principles congenial to those of 
the Constitution, should be laid betimes, as the foundation of subsequent regulations. 
</p><p>
2. It is of much moment, that those principles be 
established and ascertained, in complete and correct 
theory, before they are called forth into practical 
operation. The most intricate and the most delicate 
questions in our national jurisprudence will arise, in 
running the line between the authority of the National Government and that of the several States. A 
controversy, which happens between two individuals, 
is considered and determined with coolness and impartiality, like a question of law. A controvers}^, 
happening between the United States and any particular State in the Union, will be viewed and agitated 
with bias and passion, like a question of politics. For 
this reason, the principles and rules, on which it 
must be determined, should be clearly and explicitly 
known before it arises. 
</p><p>
To the happy achievement of such a revolution as 
that of the United States, the foregoing observations 
are applicable with a force uncommonly striking and 
powerful. I have intimated my opinion that a digest 
of the laws of the United States might, with propriety, accompany that of the laws of Pennsylvania. 
This opinion is grounded on the following reasons. 
</p><p>
1. In the latter digest, the difficult and delicate 
line of authority, which I have mentioned, must be 
run ; and the country lying on the side of the Commonwealth, must be explored and delineated. Can 
there be a fitter occasion for exploring and delineating the country, which lies on the side of the United 
States ? To explore and delineate the country on 
both sides is, perhaps, the best mode of discovering 
and ascertaining with accuracy the different directions 
which this line ought to take. From one employed 
to do the business on both sides, impartiality, as well 
as accuracy, might be reasonably expected. 
</p><p>
2. There is a peculiar propriety in running the 
line between the Government of the United States 
and that .of Pennsylvania. Since the establishment 
of the Constitution of the United States, that of 
Pennsylvania has been made. With an express and 
avowed reference to the Constitution of the United 
States, that of Pennsylvania has been sedulously 
framed. It is probable, therefore, that the directions 
which the line above mentioned ought to take, may 
be traced with a satisfactory degree of clearness, as 
well as of precision; and that neither vacancies nor 
interferences will be found, between the limits of the 
two jurisdictions. For it is material to observe, that 
both jurisdictions together compose, or ought to compose, only one uniform and comprehensive system of 
Government and laws. 
</p><p>
In what follows, I must speak concerning myself 
I shall speak with freedom and with candor. I speak 
to a friend, as well as to a judge. If you think that, 
at a proper time, it ought to be recommended by 
you to the National Legislature, or the two Houses 
which compose it, to authorize one to prepare for 
their consideration, such a digest as I have mentioned. 
I declare my willingness, nay, my desire, to undertake it. I know that I am unequal to the task ; I 
know that, in performing it, I should not be able to 
attain even that degree of excellence, of which I myself can form an idea. 
</p><p>
My offer proceeds from the following considerations. 
In the formation of both Constitutions, that of the 
United States, and that of Pennsylvania, I took a 
faithful and an assiduous part. So far, therefore, as 
my abilities can reach, I may be supposed to know 
their principles and their connection, and the various 
elations and dependencies, which their principles and 
connection ought to produce in the different parts of 
Legislation. In the study and in the practice, too, 
of law and systematic politics, I have been engaged 
for a time considerably long, and on a scale considerably extensive. I am already employed in executing one part of the great plan. If I can command 
a tolerable share of success in that part, I can command an equal share in the other also. Na}^, I believe that both parts can be executed together, better 
than either part can be executed separately. Permit 
me farther to suggest, that my deficiencies in point 
of abilities would, in some degree, be compensated by 
the ardor of my inclination to acquit myself as well 
as possible in a trust so honorable and so important. 
This ardor, believe me, would be greatly increased, 
as well as gratified, by executing this important and 
honorable trust under your auspices, and during your 
administration ; from which every thing connected 
with them will receive and reflect a lustre. 
</p><p>
With sentiments of the most perfect esteem and 
attachment, I have the honor to be, Sir, &c., 
</p><p>
James Wilson.

<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city origin'>Philadelphia</a> 4 <a rel="month origin" value="2">February</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1792' rel="origin">1792</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
The late appointment of a Minister Resident to 
the Hague has brought under consideration the condition of Mr. Dumas, and the question whether he is 
or is not at present in the service of the United 
States. 
</p><p>
Mr. Dumas, very early in the war, was employed, 
first by Dr. Franklin, afterwards by Mr. Adams, to 
transact the affairs of the United States in Holland. 
Congress never passed any express vote of confirmation, but they opened a direct correspondence with 
Mr. Dumas ; sent him orders to be executed ; confirmed and augmented his salary; made that augmentation retrospective ; directed him to take up his 
residence in their Hotel at the Hague; and passed 
such other votes, from time to time, as established 
him, de facto, their Agent at the Hague. 
</p><p>
On the change, on the organization of our Government in <a href='/results.php?year=1789'>1789</a>, no commission nor new appointment 
took place with respect to him, though it did in most 
other cases ; yet the correspondence with him from 
the Office of Foreign Affairs has heen continued, and 
he has regularly received his salary. A doubt has 
been suggested, whether this be legal. I have myself no doubt but that it is legal. I consider the 
source of authority with us to be the nation. Their 
will, declared through its proper organ, is valid till 
revoked by their will, declared through its proper organ also. Between <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a> and <a href='/results.php?year=1789'>1789</a> the proper organ 
for pronouncing their will, whether Legislative or Executive, was a Congress formed in a j)articular manner. Since <a href='/results.php?year=1789'>1789</a> it is a Congress, formed in a different manner, for laws, and a President, elected in a 
particular way, for making appointments and doing 
other Executive acts. The laws and appointments of 
the ancient Congress were as valid and permanent in 
their nature as the laws of the new Congress, or appointments of the new Executive ; these laws and 
appointments, in both cases, deriving equally their 
source from the will of the nation. And when a question arises whether any particular law or appointment 
is still in force, we are to examine, not whether it 
was pronounced by the ancient or present organ, but 
whether it has been at any time revoked by the authority of the nation, expressed by the organ competent at the time. 
</p><p>
The nation, by the act of their Federal Convention, 
established some new principles, and some new organization of the Government. This was a valid declaration of their will, and, ijyso facto, revoked some 
laws before passed, and discontinued some offices and 
officers before appointed. Wherever, by this instrument, an old office was superseded by a new one, a 
new appointment became necessary; but where the 
new Constitution did not demolish an office, either 
expressly or virtually, nor the President remove the 
officer, both the office and officer remained. This was 
the case with several. In many of them, indeed, an 
excess of caution dictated the superaddition of a new 
appointment; but where there was no such superaddition, as in the instance of Mr. Dumas, both the 
office and officer still remained ; for the will of the 
nation, validly pronounced by the proper organ of 
the day, had constituted him their Agent, and that 
will has not, through any of its successive organs, 
revoked his appointment. I think, therefore, there is 
no room to doubt its continuance, and that the receipt of salary by him has been lawful. 
</p><p>
However, I would not wish to take on myself alone 
the decision of a question so important, whether considered in a legal or Constitutional view; and therefore submit to you. Sir, whether it is not a proper 
question whereon to take the opinion of the Attorney General. 
</p><p>
Another question then arises; ought Mr. Dumas to 
be discontinued ? I am of opinion, he ought not. 
First, not at this time ; because Mr. Short's mission 
to Madrid will occasion an immediate vacancy at the 
Hague again ; and because, by the time that will be 
over, his appointment at the Hague must be discontinued altogether, unless Congress should enlarge the 
foreign fund. Secondly, not at any time ; because 
when, after the peace, Mr. Dumas's agency became 
of less importance. Congress, under various views of 
his sacrifices and services, manifested that their continuance of him was in consideration of these, and of 
his advanced years and infirm state, which render it 
impossible for him to launch into a new line of gaining a livelihood ; and they thought the continuance 
of a moderate competence to him for moderate services was more honorable to the United States than 
to abandon him, in the face of Europe, after and under such circumstances. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with sentiments of the 
most profound respect and attachment, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
Thomas Jefferson.

, 7 <a rel="month origin" value="2">February</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1792' rel="origin">1792</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
An account, presented to me by Mr. John B. Cutting, for expenditures incurred by him in liberating 
the seamen of the United States in British ports, during the impressments which took place under that 
Government in the year <a href='/results.php?year=1790'>1790</a>, obliges me to recall 
some former transactions to your mind. 
</p><p>
You will be pleased to recollect the numerous instances of complaint or information to us, about that 
time, of the violence committed on our seafaring 
citizens in British ports by their pressgangs and officers ; and that, not having even a Consul there at 
that time, it was thought fortunate that a private 
citizen, who happened to be on the spot, stepped forward for their protection ; that it was obvious that 
these exertions on his part must be attended with 
expense, and that a particular demand of fifty pounds 
sterling for this purpose, coming incidentally to my 
knowledge, it was immediately remitted to Mr. Cutting, with, a request to account for it in convenient 
time. He now presents an account of all his expenditures in this business, which I have the honor 
to communicate herewith. 
</p><p>
According to this, the oppression extends to a 
much greater number of our citizens, and their relief is more costly, than had been contemplated. It 
will be necessary to lay the account before the Legislature, because the expenditures being of a description which had not occurred before, no appropriation heretofore made would authorize payment at 
the Treasury; because, too, the nature of the transactions may, in some instances, require justly that the 
ordinary rules of evidence, which the Auditor is bound 
to apply in ordinary cases, should suffer relaxations, 
which he probably will not think himself authorized 
to admit, without the orders of the Legislature. 
</p><p>
The practice in Great Britain of impressing seamen, 
whenever war is apprehended, will fall more heavily 
on ours than on those of any other foreign nation, 
on account of the sameness of language. Our Minister at that Court, therefore, will, on these occasions, 
be under the necessity of interfering for their protection in a way which will call for expense. It is desirable that these expenses should be reduced to 
certain rules, as far as the nature of the case will 
admit ; and the sooner they are so reduced, the better. 
This may be done, however, on surer grounds, after 
the Government of Great Britain shall have entered 
with us into those arrangements on this particular 
subject, which the seriousness of the case calls for on 
our part, and its difficulty may admit on theirs. This 
done, it will be desirable that legislative rules be 
framed, which may equally guide and justify the proceedings of our Minister; or other agent at that Court, 
and at the same time extend to our seafaring citizens 
the protection of which they have so much need. 
</p><p>
Mr. Cutting; being on the spot, will himself furnish 
the explanations and documents of his case, either to 
the Legislature, or a Committee of it, or to the Auditor, as he shall be required. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c.,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
In a letter from <a href='/results.php?city=monticello' rel='city'>Monticello</a>, I took the liberty of 
saying that, as soon as I should return here, where 
my letter-books were, I would take the liberty of 
troubling you with the perusal of such parts of my 
correspondence from France, as would show my genuine sentiments of the new Constitution, When I arrived in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, the 5th instant, I found that 
many of my letters had been already put into the 
papers, by the gentlemen possessed of the originals, 
as I presume ; for not a word of it had ever been 
communicated to me, and the copies I had retained 
were under a lock, of which I had the key. 
</p><p>
These publications are genuine, and render it unnecessary to give you any further trouble, than to 
see extracts from two or three other letters, which 
have not been published, and the genuine letter 
for the payment of the French debt. Pardon my 
adding this to so many troubles as you have. I 
think it necessary you should know my real opinions, 
that you may know liow to make use of me ; and it 
is essential to my tranquillity not to be misknown 
to you. I hope it is the last time I shall feel a necessity of asking your attention to a disagreeable 
subject; being, with sincere wishes for your tranquillity and happiness, and with perfect respect, &c.,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have duly considered the translation of the letter of December 27th, from M. de la Forest, stating that 
the French Consuls here have a right to receive their salaries at Paris ; that, under the present circumstances, they cannot dispose of their bills ; and desirins: that our Government will take them as a remittance in part of the moneys we have to pay to 
France. No doubt he proposes to let us have them 
on such terms as may insure us against loss either 
from the course of exchange of cash for cash at 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, Amsterdam, and Paris, or from the difference between cash and assignats at Paris, in which 
latter form they will probably be paid. 
</p><p>
I do not observe any objection from the Treasury, 
that this channel of remittance would be out of their 
ordinary line, and inadmissible on that account. Taking it, therefore, on the ground merely of an advance unauthorized by the French Government, I 
think the bills may be taken. We have every reason to believe the money is due to them, and none 
to doubt it will be paid, every creditor being authorized to draw on his debtor. They will be paid indeed 
in assignats, at the nominal value only ; but it is previously understood that these will procure cash on 
the spot, of the real value we shall have paid for 
them. The risk, if any, is certainly very small, and 
such as it would be expedient in us to encounter in 
order to oblige these gentlemen. I think it of real 
value, to produce favorable dispositions in the agents 
of foreign nations here. Cordiality among nations depends very much on the representations of their 
agents mutually ; and - cordiality, once established, is 
of immense value, even counted in money, from the 
favors it produces in commerce, and the good understanding it preserves in matters merely political.

</p><p>
6 <a rel="month origin" value="6">June</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1793' rel="origin">1793</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I cannot but think, that, to decline the proposition 
of Mr. Genet on the subject of our debt, without assigning any reasons at all, would have a very dry 
and unpleasant aspect indeed. We are then to examine what are our good reasons for the refusal, 
which of them may be spoken out^ and which may not. 
</p><p>
1. Want of confidence in the continuance of the 
present form of Government, and consequently that 
advances to them might commit us with their successors. This cannot be spoken out. 
</p><p>
2. Since they propose to take the debt in produce, 
it would be better for us that it should be done in 
moderate masses yearly, than all in one year. This 
cannot be professed. 
</p><p>
3. When M. de Calonne was Minister of Finance, 
a Dutch company proposed to buy up the whole of 
our debt, by dividing it into sections, or shares. I 
think M. Claviere, now ]\Iinister of Finance, was their 
agent. It was observed to M. de Calonne, that to 
create such a mass of American paper, divide it into 
shares, and let them deluge the market, would depreciate them, the rest of our paper, and our credit 
in general ; that the credit of a nation was a delicate and important thing, and should not be risked 
on such an operation. M. de Calonne, sensible of the 
injury of the operation to us, declined it. 
</p><p>
In May, <a href='/results.php?year=1791'>1791</a>, there came, through Mr. Otto, a 
similar proposition from Schweizer, Jeanneret and Co. 
We had a representation on the subject from Mr. Short, urging this same reason strongly. It was referred to the Secretary of the Treasury, who, in a 
letter to yourself, assigned the reasons against it; and 
these were communicated to Mr. Otto, w^ho acquiesced 
in them. This objection, then, having been sufficient 
to decline the proposition twice before, and having 
been urged to the two preceding forms of Government (the ancient, and that of <a href='/results.php?year=1791'>1791</a>), will not be 
considered by them as founded in objections to the 
present form. 
</p><p>
4. The law allows the whole debt to be paid only 
on condition it can be done on terms advantageous to 
the United States. The Minister foresees this objection; and thinks he answers it by observing the advantage which the payment in produce will occasion. 
It would be easy to show that this was not the sort 
of advantage the Legislature meant, but a loiver rate 
of interest. 
</p><p>
5. I cannot but suppose, that the Secretary of the 
Treasury, much more familiar than I am with the 
money operations of the Treasury, would, on examination, be able to derive practical objections from 
them. We pay to France but five per cent. The 
people of this country would never subscribe their 
money for less than six. If, to remedy this, obligations at less than five per cent, were offered and accepted by Mr. Genet, he must part with them immediately at a considerable discount, to indemnify the 
loss of the one per cent. ; and at a still greater discount to bring them down to par with our present 
six per cent. ; so that the operation would be equally 
disgraceful to us, and losing to them, &c. 
</p><p>
I think it very material, myself, to keep alive the 
friendly sentiments of that country, as far as can be 
done without risking war, or double payment. If the 
instalments, falling due this year, can be advanced, 
without incurring those dangers, I should be for doing it. 
</p><p>
We now see, by the declaration of the Prince of 
Saxe-Coburg, on the part of Austria and Prussia, that 
the ultimate point they desire is, to restore the Constitution of <a href='/results.php?year=1791'>1791</a>. Were this even to be done before 
the pay-days of this year, there is no doubt, in my 
mind, but that that Government (as republican as the 
present, except in the form of its Executive) would 
confirm an advance so moderate in sum and time. I 
am sure the nation of France would never suffer their 
Government to go to war with us for such a bagatelle, 
and the more surely if that bagatelle shall have been 
granted by us so as to please, and not to displease 
the nation; so as to keep their affections engaged on 
our side. So that I should have no fear in advancing the instalment of this year, at epochs convenient 
to the Treasury; but, at any rate, should be for assigning reasons for not changing the form of the debt. 
</p><p>
These thoughts are very hastily thrown on paper, 
as will be but too evident.

I have the honor to be, &c.,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
From your humane character, you will doubtless 
permit me to introduce to you. Sir, the bearer of this 
letter, Mr. Laurent, a native of Hamburg, but of 
Prussian descent, who goes to America on commercial 
business, in order to recommend him to your protection, and to request you to favor him with your counsel and directions. It appears that he is a young 
man of good character, of good behaviour, well informed, and likely to succeed. 
</p><p>
I have always admired your great virtues and qualities, your disinterested patriotism, your unshaken 
courage and simplicity of manners; qualifications, by 
which jou surpass men, the most celebrated of antiquity. 
</p><p>
My name will not be unknown, nor altogether indifferent, to you. I presided thirty years in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, under the great and happy 
King Frederic II. Under his auspices, I alone made 
the celebrated peace of Hubertsburg, of Warsaw, of 
Teschen, of the Germanic Union ; and, under the present King, that of Reichenbach. I had even the satisfaction of approving, as Minister of the Cabinet, 
the treaty of amity and commerce concluded between 
the King of Prussia and the United States of America, on the 10th of September, <a href='/results.php?year=1785'>1785</a>, in which you 
have doubtless had the principal part, and by which 
the two parties agreed, in the twenty-third article, 
to act hostilely, in case of war, only against those 
who should be found armed, and not to interrupt 
merchants, or give letters of marque against merchant 
vessels. I acknowledge that I have felt the greatest 
pleasure on seeing that your nation had looked upon 
King Frederic II. as a worthy philosopher, by making a proposition of this kind to him, in order to 
give the example to other nations ; and for the same 
reason, I readily accepted it ; nor should I have neglected endeavouring to establish a direct commerce 
betw^een Prussia and the United States of America, 
if I had not been forced, by the intrigues of my enemies, to retire, in the month of July, <a href='/results.php?year=1791'>1791</a>, from the 
department of Foreign Affairs, and from our Cabinet 
(which till then I had directed, wdth as much probity 
and disinterestedness as success), not to be obliged 
to abandon the ancient and true system of a King of 
Prussia, by which the deceased and present King, 
notwithstanding the mediocrity of their monarchy, 
have nearly been masters of the equilibrium of all 
Europe. 
I have not, however, entirely quitted the Ministry, 
but am now in the General Council of State, and 
have confined myself to the direction of the Academy 
of Science ; to the culture of the national silk, which 
I have pushed to a certain point ; to the writing of 
a history of Frederic II., my friend and constant 
companion, who, during the last six weeks, kept me 
alone near him ; and, in a word, by cultivating the 
land (as Curius and Cincinnatus) at Brientz, about a 
mile from Berlin, which I have also pushed to a 
high degree of cultivation by very simple means. 
You may see sketches of all this, in some small impressions, which I have given to Mr. Laurent, which 
are in fact, for the greatest part, in German, but 
which 3'ou will find no difficulty in having translated 
in a country which is inhabited by so many Germans. 
</p><p>
I request you not to suppose that vanity has dictated all this ; but that it is of much consequence to 
me, to assure myself the suffrage of a great man, 
who has immortalized himself by creating a happy 
republic, with all the principles of which I pique 
myself in sympathizing, although I was born in a 
monarchical State, which is supposed to be despotic. 
</p><p>
I wish you and your republic a constant prosperity, 
and all the happiness possible, to the termination of 
your days; and I shall never cease to be, with the 
highest esteem. Sir, 
</p><p>
Your sincere friend and admirer,

Dear and respected Sir, 
</p><p>
General Pickens will do me the honor to deliver 
you this. He is a gentleman of great worth and integrity, and is well acquainted with the situation of 
these Southern States, particularly the Indian affairs. 
He and I have had some conversation respecting 
them. We agree that nothing else can be done, than 
that an expedition, composed of the militia of the 
three Southern States, should be immediately undertaken, and that four or five thousand men be raised 
and marched into their country. That number can 
be raised by the 1st of October, which will be a very 
good time to take the field. 
</p><p>
I know of no man who is so proper to conduct 
this business as General Pickens. He is well known 
and respected in these Southern States, and well acquainted with the Indian warfare. I humbly suggest, 
should you agree with us in opinion that an expedition is necessary against the Creek nation of Indians, 
that a special commission be given to General Pickens 
for that purpose, to prevent the other Generals from 
having any dispute with him. This expedition will 
be but one expense, and may terminate in three 
months after they take the field, and will establish' 
a firm and lasting peace with the Indians.

I have the honor, &c.,

</p><p>
St Neot's, Huntingdonshire, 17 <a rel="month origin" value="8">August</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1793' rel="origin">1793</a>. 
</p><p>
My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The renewed choice of your Excellency to the Presidentship, was what I expected ; and I was much 
pleased when, looking over the Gazette of the United 
States, it appeared that the vote of every elector was 
in vour favor. When the war commenced between 
Great Britain and France, I was repeatedly asked, 
What part will the Americans take ? I always answered, I apprehend they will observe a strict neutrality; for peace and trade with the whole world is 
the interest of the United States. The arrival of 
your proclamation confirmed my opinion. But I suspect that the Court of St. James will not admit of 
your acting upon the principle of neutral vessels 
making neutral property, with an exception of warlike articles. You will, undoubtedly, maintain the principle, should prudence prevent entering upon hostilities to support it; but, by firmly maintaining the 
principle, instead of making the smallest concessions, 
you will vindicate your future conduct upon the occasion, whenever the opportunity offers of your supporting it by force, without any considerable hazard 
to yourselves. This, however, has not influenced me 
to trouble you with the present letter ; but something 
of more consequence to the United States. 
</p><p>
There is a prevailing idea in Great Britain, if not 
in other parts of Europe, that, whenever you are removed, the Federal Union will be dissolved, the States 
will separate, and disorder succeed; for that the 
American Government cannot, in its own nature, be 
lasting. The confusions in France, and the eccentric 
publications in the United States, tend to strengthen 
the idea. I am fullv convinced, from what I have 
read in the manuscripts you possess, that nothing 
will give you greater satisfaction than being the 
means of disappointing such expectations. Some conjecture, that when you have been removed from these 
lower regions (may it be to the regions of perpetual 
bliss), for a few years the States will quarrel about 
who shall be President, and thereby produce a separation. I am fully convinced that one, if not more, 
of the first persons of the United States, is of opinion 
that, in time, an hereditary President must be chosen, 
to prevent the dangerous contests that periodical 
elections will produce, similar to what has happened 
repeatedly in choosing Polish sovereigns. An hereditary President will become, most probably, in a series 
of years, but another name for an hereditary monarch ; 
and the whole spirit of government be changed into 
European, Asiatic, or African, whatever may be its 
bodily shape. Allow me, then, to ask your opinion, 
■whether the following plan might not, if brought into 
execution, be preventive of such a deplorable event. 
</p><p>
Let an alteration be made in that part of the Federal Constitution, that relates to the choice of President. Let it be agreed, by the United States, that, 
after your decease or declining the Presidentship, 
the President shall be chosen, alternately, from each 
State (in the same form as now) for four years, the 
population of each State to determine the rotation, 
from the highest to the lowest, the first and the last; 
the population to be settled as soon as possible, and 
then the order for each State's furnishing a President, 
be declared. When every State has enjoyed the privilege, before the last in rotation has completed its 
term of four years, let the population of the States be 
taken afresh, and a new orderly list be formed, as 
the variations produced by sixty years and more may 
require. Though Virginia has furnished a President 
once and again, before such alteration in the choice 
of a President, her right to the order of the rotation 
not to be vacated. I cannot be absolutely certain, 
but I conceive that it was at length agreed, by the 
former Congress, that the President should be chosen 
in rotation from the respective States, or a State that 
had not before furnished one. 
</p><p>
Whether we may judge alike upon this delicate 
and important subject, I know not; but I am convinced that your Excellency will give me credit for 
my attachment to the welfare of the United States, 
and will deem it respectful that I have not communicated these thoughts to any other correspondent, and 
have intrusted it with you to digest, and ripen, and 
bring forward the plan, if honored with your approbation, in your own way and time. I am too much 
attached to American liberty and the United States, to fail in praying for their continued and increasing 
prosperity. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Gordon joins me in wishing your Excellency, 
and your lady, the best of Divine blessings through 
the remainder of life, and an infinitely better life 
hereafter, through the merits of our Lord and Saviour 
Jesus Christ. 
</p><p>
I deplore the situation of our friend Lafayette, but 
can obtain no news of him, other than of his General imprisonment. May he be supported through the 
trial, and at length be restored to the public and his 
friends ! 
</p><p>
I remain, &c., 
</p><p>
William Gordon. 
</p><p>
P. S. If what the newspaper, which arrived yesterday, mentioned, should be true, that Mr. Hamilton 
had written to all the American ports to admit French 
prizes, but not prizes taken by the powers at war 
with France, and there is a settled determination on 
the part of the Americans to fulfil the articles of the 
treaty with them in <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>, wherein special privileges 
are granted them beyond those who are their enemies, — however desirous you may be of observing a 
neutrality in other respects, I divine, from the hauteur 
of the British Ministry, that prudence will require 
your getting ready for a rupture, that you may have 
the chance of preventing it. May heaven forbid such 
a rupture ! Should it take place, I can pray for my 
friends, though I can no longer correspond with them.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
Removed to the humble vale of rural life, it was 
but recently that the " Memoirs of the Life of Charles 
Lee " fell under my observation ; and, as I once announced a design of publishing a work nearly similar 
in title, though far different in contents, I am compelled, by the most unfeigned respect to your character, as well as justice to myself, to address you on 
the subject, presuming upon the liberality and candor 
I have formerly experienced from you, that you will 
give due credit to my assertions, when I utterly disclaim, as I now solemnly do, all share or concern in 
the printed "Memoirs" that have been so improperly 
ushered [via London) to the public eye. 
</p><p>
The editor, while I was absent, clandestinely took 
the manuscripts of General Lee from my house, and, 
urged by his necessities and avarice, hath, without 
judgment to discriminate, compiled and sent abroad 
a heterogeneous collection of letters, essays, and fragments, even private letters, written to and by distinguished characters, at periods of friendship and confidence, which ought, and I am persuaded was the wish 
of the writers, to have been buried in oblivion. 
</p><p>
When I contemplated the publication of the Memoirs of the late General Lee, my design was to publish certain literary and military papers, with such 
epistolary writings as would, I judged, by interesting 
the public, at once promote my own interest as a 
printer, and enhance the fame of a departed friend, 
who, it must be allowed, inherited from nature a rare 
and brilliant genius, and possessed a cultivated understanding. It was, indeed, foreign to my design to 
introduce an essay, a letter, or a sentiment, that 
would wound the feelings, or excite the disapprobation, of a single worthy person, or cast the least 
blemish upon the reputation of General Lee, by sporting with his lively sallies, and unguarded (because 
confidential) communications, or even to give currency to a single line, that "dying, he would wish 
to blot" 
</p><p>
Sensible, Sir, of the great importance (particularly 
at this juncture) of your avocations, I shall not presume longer to ol3trucle on your time, having, I hope, 
been sufficiently explicit to exculpate myself from an 
imputation of disrespect to a character, for whom, 
with applauding millions, I feelingly accord my humble, though sincere, tribute of grateful veneration.

Frederick County, 21 <a rel="month origin" value="6">June</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1794' rel="origin">1794</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
That there is existing at Kentucky a powerful 
faction for placing that country under the protection 
of the British Government, and separating from the 
Union of the States, the most recent intelligence 
seems to evince, as well private epistolary as other. 
And further, that this contagion is not confined to a 
few obscure individuals, but widely diffused through 
the leading characters of that community, is much to 
be apprehended, and not without some suspicion of 
its having penetrated our very camp. 
</p><p>
For some days I have been balancing, whether to 
say thus much to your Excellency, not as a fact, 
but from information probable and highly worthy of 
inquiry into ; and have delayed it, lest I might be 
impertinent. But it is a circumstance which may 
lead to consequences so full of importance, that, whether it be true or ill-founded, or whether notice on 
the subject already has come to your hands, the occasion, I trust, is such a one as will plead, if not 
my justification, at least an excuse with your Excellency. My sole motive is a simple and honest one, 
the safety of our country. 
</p><p>
Notwithstanding the professions of the British and 
Spaniards, the intelligent part of the frontiers, who 
are friends to Government, are still not without suspicions of their designs, and of their connections by 
the Lakes and Mississippi. May I take, therefore, 
permission to add, that, in case of invasion or other 
sudden emergency, no man with us could collect with 
promptitude, in this quarter, so good and useful a 
body of effective soldiery, as our old General Morgan ; as, from Potomac to South Carolina, the applications to him for services, in expectation of a war, 
have of late been exceedingly numerous ? I have the 
honor to be. Sir, your most

5 <a rel="month origin" value="7">July</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1794' rel="origin">1794</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have paid attention to the note of the 30th ultimo, with which you have honored me ; and, although 
my first impressions w'ere in favor of the measure 
suggested, yet a further consideration of it has excited doubts of its expediency. 
</p><p>
Mr. Jay's instructions were to sound the Ministers 
of Denmark and Sweden, with a view of learning the 
disposition of their respective Courts to support the 
right of neutral navigation. The object of this seems 
to have been to ascertain how far we might depend 
upon their concurrence and aid, if it should become 
necessary for us to protect, by force of arms, that 
freedom of navigation which the universal law of nations permits to neutral powers. In order to secure 
their cooperation, and induce them to coincide with 
our views, it might have been necessary for the 
United States to have entered into strict engagements, and made a common cause with them, however inexpedient it might have been for this country 
to involve herself, in connections of this nature, with 
the European powers. But this necessity cannot now 
arise. We know the determination of Sweden and 
Denmark. If circumstances shall demand it, America 
may cooperate with them, without any formal Convention, and, at the same time, he at liberty to adopt 
such measures as future exigencies may require. 
</p><p>
It is probable that, before any instructions could 
reach Europe, the British Court will either have recognized the rights of neutral navigation, or that 
reprisals will have issued, and war be commenced. 
In the first case, the general principle will no doubt 
extend itself to us ; or, if a partial arrangement takes 
place between Great Britain and those two northern 
powers, we cannot expect any cooperation from them. 
On the contrary, if war should take place in consequence of the determination of those powers to make 
reprisals, it will then be competent to the United 
States to cooperate in that war, without embarrassing 
themselves with any formal engagements. How far 
the Executive could constitutionally engage, that the 
United States should take part in a war actually begun, may be doubtful ; and, as the event of Mr. Jay's 
negotiation cannot be known long before the meeting 
of Congress, the subject (if a war should have taken 
place) would perhaps come more properly before that 
body, in whom the right of declaring war is vested. 
</p><p>
Mr. Pinckney has intimated, that there is a disposition in the British Court to make a real, if not an 
avowed, discrimination between the navigation of the 
United States and that of the northern European 
powers. If this should be actually made, it will be 
a question of much delicacy, how far this country 
ought to interfere, the decision of which the President, 
perhaps, ought not to delegate to any person whatsoever. 
</p><p>
Upon the whole, I incline to think that the measure proposed is not expedient at present; but it is 
not without some hesitation that I form this opinion. 
I have the honor to he, &c.,

</p><p>
\. Sir, 
</p><p>
You will see, by a return made to the War Office 
of the troops left under my command for winter defence, their strength and situation. The business of 
recruiting was put off too late ; had it been put in 
practice a week sooner, we could have engaged the 
number of men called for, without difficulty. When 
I was informed of the deficiency, I intended to have 
made up the number wanting in this country, but 
have been so very busy, trying to cover ourselves 
from the inclemency of the approaching season, that 
I have not made the experiment; and am afraid, 
when we do, that the pay will be an obstacle ; and 
the clothing is not a sufficient inducement, as the 
people here don't like to wear that kind of clothing. 
</p><p>
I have some officers out trying to recruit at this 
time, but have had no report from them. Any number of cavalry could be raised here; but my own 
opinion is, that a great many men will be unnecessary for this service, as the alarm that these people 
have experienced is so great, that they will never 
forget it so far as to fly in the face of the law again. 
I am dealing very gently with them, and am becoming very popular, for which I am very happy; as it 
has been my opinion, from the first of this business, 
that we ought to make these people our friends, if 
we could do so without lessening the dignity of Government, which, in my opinion, ought to be supported at any risk. Several of the outlyers have 
come in within a few days, and delivered themselves 
to me. I have let them go on parole, with orders to 
come to me when called for. I expect this kind of 
treatment will bring in the whole, except Madford, 
the tinker, and one or two others. The names of 
those that have delivered themselves to me, are as 
follows; — Arthur Gardner; George Parker; Ebenezer 
Golohan, who broke out of jail at Pittsburg ; John 
Colecraft, who broke away from the guard coming up 
the river; and John Mitchell, who robbed the mail. 
Those characters I will deliver, when and where I am 
directed; convinced, as I am, that they won't go off 
And I think I shall have the people of this country 
in better order than their fellow-citizens in and about 
<a href='/results.php?city=carlisle' rel='city'>Carlisle</a>, &c., which will give pleasure. 
</p><p>
Some of the people in this country, but their number very inconsiderable, seem to be obstinate, and 
hesitate very much about taking the oath to Government, alleging that they have already taken an oath 
to Government, which, they say, they have not violated, and will not take another; that, if compelled 
to do it, they will not think it binding upon them. 
I wish to know what is to be done with characters 
of this description. 
</p><p>
I will thank you for the outlines of the conduct 
that you would wish me to pursue in future. John 
Colecraft, who gave himself up to me, is the Old 
Tinker himself, and not he that broke from the guard 
coming up the river. Benjamin Parkeson and Dan 
Ilambleton will be in to-morrow ; at least they have 
so informed me.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
You were formerly deliberating on the purpose to 
which you should apply the shares in the Potomac 
and James River Companies, presented you by our 
Assembly; and you did me the honor of asking me 
to think on the subject. As well as I remember, 
some academical institution was thought to offer the 
best application of the money Should you have 
finally decided in favor of this, a circumstance has 
taken place which would render the present moment 
the most advantageous to carry it into execution, by 
giving to it, in the outset, such an eclat, and such 
solid advantages, as would insure a very general concourse to it of the youths from all our States, and 
probably from the other parts of America which are 
free enough to adopt it. 
</p><p>
The revolution, which has taken place at Geneva, 
has demolished the College of that place, which was 
in a great measure supported by the former Government. The Colleges of Geneva and Edinburgh were 
considered as the two eyes of Europe, in matters of 
science, insomuch that no other pretended to any rivalship with either. Edinburgh has been the most 
famous in medicine, during the life of Cullen ; but 
Geneva most so in the other branches of science, and 
much the most resorted to from the Continent of 
Europe, because the French language was that which 
was used. M. D'lvernois, a Genevan, and man of 
science, known as the author of a history of that republic, has proposed the transplanting that College, 
in a body, to America. He has written to me on 
the subject, as he has also done to Mr. Adams, as 
he was formerly known to us both, giving us the 
details of his views for effecting it. Probably these 
have been communicated to you by Mr. Adams, as 
D'lvernois desired should be done. But, lest they 
should not have been communicated, I will take the 
liberty of doing it. His plan, I think, would go to 
about ten or twelve Professorships. He names to me 
the following Professors, as likely, if not certain, to 
embrace the plan. 
</p><p>
Mouchon, the present President, who wrote the analytical table for the Encyclopedists, which sufficiently 
proves his comprehensive science. 
</p><p>
Pictet, known from his admeasurement of a degree, 
and other works, Professor of natural philosophy. 
</p><p>
His brother, said by M. D'lvernois to be also great. 
</p><p>
Senebier, author of Commentaries on Spallanzani, 
and of other works in natural philosophy and meteorology ; also, the translator of the Greek Tragedians. 
</p><p>
Bertrand and L'Houllier, both mathematicians, and 
said to be inferior to nobody in that line, except La 
Grange, who is without an equal. 
</p><p>
Prevost, highly spoken of by D'lvernois. 
</p><p>
De Saussure and his son, formerly a Professor, but 
who left the college to have more leisure to pursue 
his geological researches into the Alps, by which work 
he is very advafitageously known. 
</p><p>
Most of these are said to speak our language well. 
Of these persons, the names of Mouchon, Pictet, De 
Saussure, and Senebier, are well known to me, as 
standing foremost among the literati of Europe. Secrecy having been necessary, this plan had, as yet, 
been concerted only with Pictet, his brother, and 
Prevost, who knew, however, from circumstances, that 
the others would join them ; and I think it very 
possible, that the revolution in France may have put 
it in our power to associate La Grange with them, 
whose modest and diffident character will probably 
have kept him in the rear of the revolutionary principles, which have been the ground on which the revolutionists of Geneva have discarded their Professors. 
Most of these are men having families, and therefore, 
M. D'lvernois observes, they cannot come over but 
on sure grounds. He proposes a revenue of fifteen 
thousand dollars for the whole institution; and, supposing lands could be appropriated to this object, he 
says that an hundred Genevan families can readily 
be found, "who will purchase, and settle on the lands, 
and deposit for them the capital, of which fifteen 
thousand dollars would be the interest. In this revenue he means to comprehend a College of languages, preparatory to the principal one of sciences ; 
and also a third College, for the gratuitous teaching 
of the poor, reading and writing. 
</p><p>
It could not be expected that any propositions from 
strangers, unacquainted with our means and our wants, 
could jump at once into a perfect accommodation with 
these. But those presented to us would serve to 
treat on, and are capable of modifications reconcilable, perhaps, to the views of both parties. 
</p><p>
1. We can well dispense with his second and third 
Colleges, the last being too partial for an extensive 
country, and the second sufficiently, and better, provided for already, by our public and private grammar schools. I should conjecture that this would reduce one third of his demand of revenue, and that 
ten thousand dollars would then, probably, answer 
their remaining views, which are the only important 
ones to us. 
</p><p>
2, We are not to count on raising the money from 
lands, and, consequently, we must give up the proposal of the colony of Genevan farmers. But the 
wealth of Geneva, in money, being notorious, and the 
class of monied men being that which the new Government are trying to get rid of, it is probable that 
a capital sum could be borrowed, on the credit of the 
funds under consideration, sufficient to meet the first 
expenses of the transportation and establishment, and 
to supply, also, the deficiency of revenue, till the 
profits of the shares shall become sufficiently superior 
to the annual support of the College, to repay the 
sums borrowed. 
3. The composition of the Academy cannot be settled, then. It must be adapted to our circumstances, 
and can, therefore, only be fixed between them and 
persons here acquainted with those circumstances, and 
conferring for the purpose after their arrival here. 
For a country so marked for agriculture as ours, I 
should think no Professorship so important as one 
not mentioned by them, a Professor of Agriculture, 
who, before the students should leave College, should 
carry them through a course of lectures on the principles and practice of agriculture ; and that this Professor should come from no country but England. 
Indeed, I should mark Young as the man to be obtained. These, however, are modifications to be left 
till their arrival here. 
</p><p>
M. D'lvernois observes, that the Professors keep 
themselves disengaged till the ensuing spring, attending an answer. As he had desired his proposition to 
be made to our Legislature, I accordingly got a member to sound as many of his brethren on the subject 
as he could, desiring, if he found it would be desperate, that he would not commit the honor either of 
that body or of the College of GencA^a, by forcing an 
open act of rejection. I received his information only 
a fortnight ago, that the thing was evidently impracticable. I immediately forwarded that information to 
D'lvernois, not giving him an idea that there was 
any other resource. Thinking, however, that if you 
should conclude to apply the revenues of the canal 
shares to any institution of this kind, so fortunate an 
outset could never again be obtained, I have supposed it my duty, both to you and them, to submit 
the circumstances to your consideration. 
</p><p>
A question would arise as to the place of the establishment. As far as I can learn, it is thought just 
that the State, which gives the revenue, should be 
most considered in the uses to which it is appropriated. But I suppose that their expectations would 
be satisfied by a location within their limits, and that 
this might be so far from the Federal City as moral 
considerations would recommend, and yet near enough 
to it to be viewed as an appendage of that, and that 
the splendor of the two objects would reflect usefully 
on each other. 
</p><p>
Circumstances have already consumed much of the 
time allowed us. Should you think the proposition 
can be brought at all within your views, your determination, as soon as more important occupations will 
admit of it^ would require to be conveyed as early 
as possible to M. D'lvernois, now in London, lest my 
last letter should throw the parties into other engagements. I will not trespass on your time and attention, by adding to this lengthy letter any thing further than assurances of the high esteem and regard, 
with which

Camp, McFarley's, 9 <a rel="month origin" value="4">April</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1795' rel="origin">1795</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I was honored with your letter of the 27th ultimo, 
and for the hints it contains I return you my thanks. 
Your approbation of my conduct, and that of the 
army under my command, affords me peculiar satisfaction, which is heightened by the coincidence of 
opinion between us relative to the intention for which 
an army was stationed in this country. 
</p><p>
To impress upon the army a due respect for the 
laws, and urge the necessity of an uninterrupted harmony existing between them and the citizens, was 
my first care, and what I have uniformly practised. 
To promote this good understanding I found rather 
an arduous task, owing, not so much to a licentiousness in the troops, as to an unaccommodating disposition in the people, which I find but too prevalent 
among a great part of this community. In my absence, while attending the election in Berkley and 
Frederick, some little bickering took place, and some 
suits were brought by certain individuals against a 
part of the army ; the cause of which, in my opinion, 
was trifling in itself, and such as reflects highly on 
those who instituted them. 
</p><p>
Mr. B., I am well informed, was the person who 
advised, nay, urged, those suits to be brought. This 
man I consider as a bad member of society, and who 
will, I fear, do all in liis power to foment disturbances in this country. It is a flattering consideration, 
however, notwithstanding these things, that I have it 
in my power to observe, that affairs in general are 
in a promising train. It shall be my endeavour to 
settle all disputes as amicably as possible. I have, 
since my return to camp, terminated some, and the 
others are in a fair way. I will use every precaution 
to prevent such misunderstandings taking place in 
future. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c.,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have the honor and the pleasure to inclose to you 
a copy of the dissent of a number of the citizens of 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, to the doings of the town, at their late meeting relative to the treaty with Britain ; and also a 
copy of the proceedings of the <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> Chamber of 
Commerce, upon the same subject. 
</p><p>
The instrument of dissent was designed only to collect the sentiments of the merchants and traders, provisionally, not for the purpose of attempting to influence or interfere with the measures of Government. 
But, having been represented in the public newspapers and other ways, as approving the resolutions of 
the town at that meeting, the merchants and others, 
whose names are thereto subscribed, deem it expedient now to transmit to you. Sir, that instrument, with 
their names, together with the resolutions of the 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</p><p>
From these documents they presume it will most 
fully appear, that the general disposition of the merchants of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> is not to reprobate, but to approve 
of the decision of the Executive of the Union, upon 
that important subject, as wise and prudent, in the present critical state of affairs. With the greatest 
respect; I have the honor to be, Sir,

Eiclimond, 6 <a rel="month origin" value="12">December</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1795' rel="origin">1795</a>. 
</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On the 20th ultimo, I did myself the honor to 
communicate to you the result of a proposition in 
the lower House of Assembly here, approving the 
vote of the two Senators from this State agjainst the 
treaty ; and, at the same time, took pleasure in mentioning the decorum observed during the debate respecting yourself and the ratifying Senators. On the 
next day, however, the active persons of the party, 
presuming on the decided turn which they supposed 
had been fixed in favor of their views, unveiled themselves, and carried, in the House, some points very 
extraordinary indeed, manifesting disrespect towards 
you. It is highly probable you may have seen the 
proceedings in the public papers. 
</p><p>
The result of these proceedings, together with the 
original vote of approbation, went to the Senate ; the 
approving vote was there concurred in, with an immaterial amendment ; but a very decided discountenance was put on the other proceeding, by an amendment totally reversing its aspect. By this time it 
was observed, that many in the lower House had become dissatisfied with their former conduct, and, when 
the amendment came down, the zealots of anarchy 
were backward to act on it, while the friends of 
order were satisfied to let it remain for further effects 
of reflection. On the 4th instant, the amendment of 
the Senate was taken up and carried by a majority 
of seventy-eight against sixty-two ; and I believe that 
on the same question now, the majority would be 
much greater The fever has raged, come to its crisis, 
and is abating. 
</p><p>
As evidence that the temper of the people at large 
is not such as our members in Congress will probably exhibit an appearance of, references may be had 
to the consequences of insidious attempts to get signed, through the country, some seditious petitions, which 
were sent in vast numbers from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. These 
petitions were at first patronized with great zeal, by 
many of our distinguished anarchists ; but, from the 
best intelligence I can get, I am satisfied that very 
few copies will be sent to Congress fully signed. 
After a very short time they were viewed with contempt, in most places. I think this information is 
correct. A short time will show how far it is so, as 
it is not to be doubted that all the copies will be 
laid before Congress, which are but tolerably signed. 
</p><p>
It will be no new intelligence to you to be informed, that several of our members of Congress have 
been the most active in endeavours to dissatisfy the 
people with the treaty, and other measures of administration, which have saved us from war, foreign dependence, and domestic wretchedness. My hope is 
that, from the other States in the Union, better dispositions will be met on that floor, where the great 
republican principle is perhaps to be put to trial ; for, 
if it really turns out that, in any one of the branches 
of Government, resentment against one nation, or 
love for another, is to supersede a calm consideration 
of our own interests and happiness, a dependence, utterly inconsistent with freedom, must be the result. 
Let it once be ascertained that the people of the 
United States are incapable of self-government, and 
where else can it be tried again ? I trust and believe 
they will preserve the sacred principle. I have the 
honor to be, with great affection, dear Sir,

Your obedient servant,

Edward Carrington.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
In Bache's Aurora, of the 9th instant, which came 
here by the last post, a paper appears, which, having 
been confided, as I presume, to but few hands, makes 
it truly wonderful how it should have got there. I 
cannot be satisfied, as to my own part, till I relieve 
my mind by declaring (and I attest every thing sacred and honorable to the declaration), that it has got 
there neither through me nor the paper confided to 
me. This has never been from under my own lock 
and key, or out of my own hands. No mortal ever 
knew, from me, that these questions had been proposed. Perhaps I ought to except one person, who 
possesses all my confidence, as he has possessed yours. 
I do not remember, indeed, that I communicated it 
even to him. But, as I was in the habit of unlimited 
trust and counsel with him, it is possible I may have 
read it to him — no more ; for the quire, of which it 
makes a part, was never in any hand but my own, 
nor was a word ever copied or taken down from it 
by any body. I take on myself, without fear, any 
divulgation on his part. We both know him incapable of it. 
</p><p>
From myself, then, or my paper, this publication 
has never been derived. I have formerly mentioned 
to you, that, from a very early period of my life, I 
had laid it down as a rule of conduct, never to write 
a word for the public papers. From this I have 
never departed, in a single instance ; and on a late 
occasion, when all the world seemed to be writing, 
besides a rigid adherence to my own rule, I can say, 
with truth, that not a line for the press was ever 
communicated to me by any other, except a single 
petition, referred for my correction; which I did not 
correct, however, though the contrary, as I have 
heard, was said in a public place, by one person 
through error; through malice, by another. I learn 
that this last has thought it worth his while to try 
to sow tares between you and me, by representing me as still engaged in the bustle of politics, and in 
turbulence and intrigue against the Government. I 
never believed, for a momentj that this could make 
any imjDression on you, or that your knowledge of 
me would not overweigh the slander of an intriguer, 
dirtily employed in sifting the conversations of my 
table, where alone he could hear of me : and seekinoto atone for his sins against you by sins against 
another, who had never done him any other injury 
than that of declining his confidences. 
</p><p>
Political conversations I really dislike, and therefore avoid, where I can, without affectation. But, when 
urged by others, I have never conceived that having 
been in public life requires me to belie my sentiments, or even to conceal them. When I am led by 
conversation to express them, I do it with the same 
independence here, which I have practised every 
where, and which is inseparable from my nature. 
But enough of this miserable tergiversator, who ought, 
indeed, either to have been of more truth, or less 
trusted by his country. 
</p><p>
While on the subject of papers, permit me to 
ask one from you. You remember the difference of 
opinion between Hamilton and Knox, on the one 
part, and myself on the other, on the subject of 
firing on the Little Sarah, and that we had exchanged opinions and reasons in writing. On your arrival 
in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, I delivered you a copy of my reasons, in the presence of Colonel Hamilton. On our 
withdrawing, he told me he had been so much engaged that he had not been able to prepare a copy 
of his and General Knox's for you; and that, if 1 
would send you the one he had given me, he would 
replace it in a few daj'-s. I immediately sent it to 
you, wishing you should see both sides of the subject together. I often after applied to both the 
gentlemen, hut could never obtain another copy. I 
have often thought of asking this one, or a copy of 
it, back from you, but have not before written on 
subjects of this kind to you. Though I do not know 
that it will ever be of the least importance to me, 
yet one loves to possess arms, though they hope 
never to have occasion for them. They possess my 
paper, in my own handwriting. It is just, I should 
possess theirs. The only thing amiss is, that they 
should have left me to seek a return of the paper, or 
a copy of it, from you. 
</p><p>
I put away this disgusting dish of old fragments, 
and talk to you of my pease and clover. As to the 
latter article, I have great encouragement from the 
friendlv nature of our soil. I think I have had, both 
the last and present year, as good clover from common grounds, which had brought several crops of 
wheat and corn, without ever having been manured, 
as I ever saw on the lots around <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. I 
verily believe, that a field of thirty-four acres, sowed 
on wheat, April was a twelvemonth, has given me a 
ton to the acre, at its first cutting, this spring. The 
stalks, extended, measured three and a half feet long 
very commonly. Another field, a year older, and 
which yielded as well last year, has sensibly fallen 
off" this year. My exhausted fields bring a clover not 
high enough for hay ; but I hope to make seed from 
it. Such as these, however, I shall hereafter put into 
pease, in the broadcast, proposing that one of my sowings of wheat shall be after two years of clover, and 
the other after two years of pease. I am trying the 
white boiling pea of Europe (the <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> pea) this 
year, till I can get the hog pea of England, which 
is the most productive of all. 
</p><p>
But the true "winter-vetch is what we want extremely. I have tried this year the Caroline drill. 
It is absolutely perfect. Nothing can be more simple, 
or perform its office more perfectly for a single row. 
I shall try to make one to sow four rows at a time 
of wheat or pease, at twelve inches distance. I have 
one of the Scotch threshing-machines nearly finished. 
It is copied exactly from a model of one Mr. Pinckney sent me, only that I have put the whole works, 
except the horse-wheel, into a single frame, movable 
from one field to another on the two axles of a wagon. It will be ready in time for the harvest which 
is coming on, which will give it a full trial. Our 
wheat and rye are generally fine, and the prices 
talked of bid fair to indemnify us for the poor crops 
of the two last years. 
</p><p>
I take the liberty of putting under your cover a 
letter to the son of the Marquis de Lafayette, not 
exactly knowing where to direct to him. With very 
affectionate compliments to Mrs. Washington, I have 
the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem and 
respect, dear Sir,

and I hope this motive will make you forgive the

</p><p>
I have received, hy an indirect way, some news of 
his unfortunate father.^ His health is better, but his 
captivity does not soften at all, and his wife cannot 
obtain any thing from the Emperor. The passions, 
which weaken and wear themselves out here, begin to 
let more than one influential person feel, that it should 
be shameful to make peace without obtaining from 
the Court of Vienna the liberation of the Frenchmen 
arrested for the cause of liberty. But this happy disposition is not as yet sufficiently general or pronounced. 
All that I desire is, that it would be the wisdom, and 
interest of the American Government, which would 
determine the French Government to that measure. I 
know that my friend would doubly enjoy his liberty, 
if he owed it to you ; and it appears to me that the 
moment is arrived, when the advice that I speak of, 
could be given to the Directory without compromising 
the Minister who would be intrusted with the commission. J

FROM EGBERT FULTON. 
</p><p>
London, 5 <a rel="month origin" value="2">February</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1797' rel="origin">1797</a>. 
</p><p>
Last evening Mr. King presented me with your letter, acquainting me of the receipt of my publication on Small Canals, which I hope you will soon 
have time to peruse in a tranquil retirement from 
the busy operations of a public life. Therefore, looking forward to that period, when the whole force of 
your mind will act upon the internal improvement 
of our country, by promoting agriculture and manufactures, I have little doubt but easy conveyance, the 
great agent to other improvements, will have its due 
weight, and meet your patronage. 
</p><p>
For the mode of giving easy communication to 
every part of the American States, I beg leave to 
draw your particular attention to the last chapter, on 
creative canals ; and the expanded mind will trace 
down the time when they w^ill penetrate into every 
district, carrying with them the means of facilitating 
manual labor and rendering it productive. But how 
to raise a sum in the different States, has been my 
greatest difficulty. I first considered them as national works. But, perhaps, an incorporated company of 
subscribers, who should be bound to apply half, or a 
part, of their profits to extension, would be the best 
mode ; as it would then be their interest to promote 
the work, and guard their emoluments. 
</p><p>
That such a work would answer to subscribers, appears from such information as I have collected relative to the carriage from the neighbourhood of Lancaster to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. To me it appears, that a 
canal on the small scale might have been made 
to Lancaster for one hundred and twenty thousand 
pounds ; and that the carriage, at twenty shillings 
per ton, would pay fourteen thousand per annum, of 
which, seven thousand to subscribers, and seven thousand to extension. By this means, in about ten 
years, they would touch the Susquehanna, and the 
trade would then so much increase as to produce 
thirty thousand per annum, of which, fifteen thousand 
to subscribers, the remainder to extension ; continuing thus, till, in about twenty years, the canal would 
run into Lake Erie, jdelding a produce of one hundred thousand per annum, or fifty thousand pounds 
to subscribers, which is forty per cent. Hence the 
inducement to subscribe to such undertakings. 
</p><p>
Proceeding in this manner, I find that, in about 
sixty or seventy years, Pennsylvania would have 
nine thousand three hundred and sixty miles of canal, equal to bringing water-carriage within the easy 
reach of every house ; nor would any house be more 
than ten or fourteen miles from a canal. By this 
time the whole carriage of the country would come 
on water, even to passengers; and, following the present rate of carriage on the Lancaster road, it appears that the tolls would amount to four million per 
year ; yet no one would pay more than twenty-one 
shillings and threepence per ton, whatever might be 
the distance conveyed ; the whole would also be a 
canal in which there is an equal facility of conveyance each way. Having made this calculation to 
show that the creative system would be productive 
of great emolument to subscribers, it is only further 
to be observed, that if each State was to commence 
a creative system, it would fill the whole country, 
and, in less than a century, bring water-carriage within the easy cartage of every acre of the American States; conveying the surplus labors of one hundred 
millions of men. 
</p><p>
Hence, seeing that, hy sj^stem, this must be the 
result, I feel anxious that the public mind may be 
awakened to their true interest ; and, instead of directing turnpike roads towards the interior country, 
or expending large sums in river navigations, which 
must ever be precarious and bad, I could wish to see 
the labor and funds applied to such a system as 
would penetrate the interior country, and bind the 
whole in the bonds of social intercourse. 
</p><p>
The importance of this subject, I hope, will plead 
my excuse for troubling you with so long a letter; 
and in expectation of being favored with your thoughts 
on the system, and mode of carrying it into effect, 
</p><p>
I remain, &c., 
</p><p>
Robert Fulton.
