Sir, 
</p><p>
My feelings as a private friend, and the very great 
personal regard for your Excellency with which I 
have been penetrated ever since I had the honor of 
an acquaintance with you, would by no means allow 
me to see you retiring from your important employments without paying you my particular attentions. 
But when, as a public man, warmly attached to the 
interest of my country, I consider the nature of those 
services which you have rendered to that country; 
when I recollect the cares you have sustained, the 
fatigues you have endured, and the dangers you have 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> confronted, for the public safety ; when I call to mind 
the many instances in which your abilities, your prudence, your fortitude and patience, have been superior 
to the severest trials ; and when I now see the great 
object of all so completely obtained in the establishment of the independence and peace of the United 
States; â€” my heart is too full to forbear to congratulate your Excellency in the most respectful and affectionate manner, upon an issue so happy to them, and 
so glorious to yourself 
</p><p>
To all your services, as Commander-in-chief of an 
army that has, in a manner astonishing to the whole 
world, efficaciously supported the freedom of America, 
you have constantly added, and particularly in your 
late circular letter to the States, the result of your 
uncommon wisdom and experience as a statesman, to 
assist us in improving, to the happiest purposes, the 
advantages gained by our arms. 
</p><p>
After such services, which consecrate your name 
to all posterity, with what home-felt satisfaction must 
your future days be blest ! Heaven crown them with 
every favor ! May you long live, my dear General, 
and long have the joy to see the increasing splendor 
and prosperity of a rising nation, aided by your 
counsels, and defended by your sword! Indulge me 
the pleasure to believe that I have a place in your 
recollection, and still honor and make me happy in 
your friendship. I have the honor to be, with the 
most perfect sentiments of regard and esteem, dear 
General, your 
</p><p>
Most obedient and very faithful, humble servant,

Sir, 
</p><p>
Having received information that you intended to 
honor this State with a visit, and wishing personally 
to show you every mark of attention which the most 
sincere friendship can induce, I beg the favor of your 
making my house the place of your residence while 
you shall remain in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. I could wish that the 
accommodations were better suited to a gentleman of 
your respectability; but you may be assured that 
nothing on my part shall be wanting to render them 
as agreeable as possible. 
</p><p>
As Governor of the Commonwealth, I feel it to be 
my duty to receive your visit with such tokens of 
respect as may answer the expectations of my constituents, and may in some measure express the high 
sentiments of respect they feel towards you. I have 
therefore issued orders for proper escorts to attend 
you ; and Colonel Hall, Deputy Adjutant-General, will 
wait upon you at Worcester, and will inform you of 
the disposition I have made of the troops at <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>, under the command of General Brooks, and 
request that you would be so obliging as to pass 
that way to the town, where you will receive such 
other tokens of respect from the people, as will serve 
further to evince how gratefully they recollect your 
exertions for their liberties, and their confidence in 
you as President of the United States of America. 
</p><p>
The gentlemen of the Council will receive you at 
<a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>, and attend you to town. I should be 
obliged to you, on the return of this express, to let 
me know when you propose to be in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and as 
near as you can the time of the day. I have the 
honor to be, with every sentiment of esteem and respect. Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
Your letter, by the return express, I had the honor 
to receive, at three o'clock, this morning. It would 
have given me pleasure, had a residence at my house 
met with your approbation. 
</p><p>
I observe you had proposed taking an early dinner 
at <a href='/results.php?city=watertown' rel='city'>Watertown</a>, and proceeding to <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>, and from 
thence to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, on Saturday afternoon. I beg leave, 
if it should not interfere with your determination, or 
prove inconvenient, to request that you would so far 
vary your former intention, as to arrive in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> by 
one o'clock. In case this request should meet your 
approbation, I beg the favor that you, with the gentlemen of your suite, would honor me with your 
company at dinner on Saturday en famiUe, at any 
hour that the circumstances of the day will admit. 
</p><p>
I shall esteem it an honor, if you will favor me 
with a few lines, by the return express, with your 
determination on the subject. I have the honor to 
be, with every sentiment of esteem and respect. Sir, 
</p><p>
Your very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">John Hancock</a>.
