SIR, 
</p><p>
It is with the highest pleasure I comply with the 
order of Congress, in conveying to you the inclosed 
resolve, expressing the thanks of that body to you 
for the wise and well-concerted attack upon the enemy, near Germantown, on the 4th instant, and also 
to the officers and soldiers for their brave exertions 
on that occasion; and I must request you will communicate to them the distinguished mark of the approbation of their country. 
</p><p>
It is indeed true, that the best designs and boldest efforts may sometimes fail of success, through 
unforeseen incidents, yet is it a source of satisfaction 
to reflect, in such instances, that every thing has 
been done to insure success, that human wisdom 
could devise. Something must still be left to fortune. 
It is not in mortals to command success. But permit 
me to say, Sir, you have done more on this occasion ; 
you have deserved it. 
</p><p>
Wishing, with the utmost sincerity, that your great 
and virtuous exertions in the cause of freedom and 
your country may be crowned with victory, I have 
the honor to be, with perfect esteem and respect. Sir, 
Your most obedient, and very humble servant, 
</p><p>

SIR, 
</p><p>
The absolute necessity of cutting off all supplies 
and intelligence from the enemy, in and near the 
city of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and thereby preventing any 
intercourse between them and the disaffected in the 
State of Pennsylvania and elsewhere, has induced 
the Congress to adopt the inclosed resolves, in hopes, 
if possible, to put an effectual stop to a practice so 
extremely dangerous to the cause of America. They 
have, for this end, authorized you to sentence, by 
court-martial, any person convicted of either of the 
above-mentioned offense, or of acting as a guide or pilot, to suffer death, or such other punishment 
as may be thought adequate, provided he is taken 
within thirty miles of any town in Pennsylvania, Jersey, or Delaware, that is in possession of the enemy. 
They have also recommended to the good people of 
this and the other States to be vigilant in apprehending and securing all such persons as may be 
caught in the violation of the inclosed resolves, to 
which I beg leave to refer your attention. 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 5th instant was duly received, 
and immediately laid before Congress. I have the 
honor to be, with the greatest respect, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant,

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I have nothing in charge from Congress, at this 
time, but to transmit the inclosed resolves, and to re 
quest your attention to them. 
</p><p>
The information that the enemy have, at different 
times, compelled our troops, who are prisoners with 
them, to labor, and that a number are at this time 
actually engaged in throwing up some works at and 
near Kensington, is of such a nature that Congress 
think it incumbent on them to inquire into the truth 
of it. They have, therefore, directed that a flag be 
immediately despatched to General Howe, to know 
whether there is any foundation for the report; and 
I am to request you will send a flag for this purpose 
as soon as you conveniently can. M. Le Balme having desired leave of Congress to resign his commission as Inspector of the cavalry, they have accordingly complied with his request. I have the honor 
to be, with the utmost respect, Sir, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
It is now above two years since I have had the 
honor of presiding in Congress ; and I should esteem 
myself happy to have it in my power to render further service to my country in that department ; but 
the decline of health, occasioned by so long and unremitting an application to the duties of my office, 
both in Congress and out of Congress, joined to the 
situation of my own private affairs, has, at length, 
taught me to think of retiring for two or three months ; and I have determined to take my leave 
the ensuing week, and set out immediately for <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> after this express returns. 
</p><p>
As the Congress will doubtless proceed to appoint a successor in my stead, on him, therefore, will devolve the business of the chair. It will fall within 
the line of his duty to keep up that connection and 
correspondence with you, which has heretofore been 
mine; and I sincerely hope he may do it, as well as 
discharge every other duty incident to the office, 
with more advantage than I have done. Upon the 
review, however, of the intercourse that has subsisted 
between us, I cannot avoid saying, that I feel a 
great degree of pleasure in having, to the utmost of 
my power, endeavoured to execute the business committed to my care, and in a particular manner with 
regard to the army under your command. I flatter 
myself my conduct, in this instance, will meet with 
your approbation. The politeness and attention I have 
ever experienced from you, in the course of our correspondence, will always be a source of the most pleasing satisfaction to me. 
</p><p>
As it is probable I shall meet with some difficulty 
in crossing the North River, and shall run a considerable risk in passing through some Tory towns 
on the east side, I must ask the favor of you to 
give me authority to order a few light-horse from 
thence, to escort me through that part of the country. I apprehend I may safely go from hence to the 
North River, though I should be happy in having 
your opinion, and as to the best route. 
</p><p>
On my arrival in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, I shall think myself happy to be favored with any commands from you; and 
should any thing of a public nature occur, I will do 
myself the honor of letting you hear from me. 
</p><p>
With the most sincere wishes that you may soon 
triumph over the enemies of America, and meet with 
every public and private prosperity, and with the ut 
most respect, I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I was duly honored with your favor of the 22d. 
and am much obliged by the expressions of politeness 
and friendship which it contains. A few months re 
laxation will, I hope, restore my health and constitution, and enable me still to contribute my feeble 
efforts, in some mode or other, to the advancement of 
the cause of freedom in America, If I should not 
return to Congress, it will be the height of my inclination, as it will also be in my power, to render 
some service to the general interest in my own native 
country. 
</p><p>
As I propose setting out on Monday, and shall go 
through <a href='/results.php?city=Bethlehem' rel='city'>Bethlehem</a>, I must request that the escort of 
horse you so politely offered to attend me, may meet 
me there. Should I reach <a href='/results.php?city=Bethlehem' rel='city'>Bethlehem</a> before them, I 
shall wait their arrival. In the present critical state 
of our affairs, I believe I should decline setting out 
for a few days ; but, having wrote to Mrs. Hancock 
to meet me at some distance from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, I am 
under a necessity of beginning my journey on Monday morning. I am, dear Sir, with great esteem and 
regard, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President.
