SIR, 
</p><p>
Your letters, Numbers Four and Five, and two other 
letters not numbered, with the inclosures, have been 
duly received and laid before the Congress. 
</p><p>
As there are sundry matters contained in your 
letters, which are of great importance, and on which 
the Congress;, before they come to a final determination, are desirous to have the advantage of your experience and knowledge, they have appointed three 
of their members, namely, Mr. Lynch, <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel=''>Dr. Franklin</a>, 
and Mr. Harrison, to wait on you, and confer with 
you and the Governors of Connecticut and Rhode 
Island, the Council of Massachusetts Bay, and the 
President of the Convention of New Hampshire, to 
whom I have wrote on the subject, by order of Congress, and such other persons as to the said Commit 
tee shall seem proper, touching the most effectual 
method of continuing, supporting, and regulating a 
Continental Army. They will set out as soon as 
possible, and expect to be with you by the 12th of 
next month. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with the greatest esteem, 
Sir, &c.,

SIR, 
</p><p>
The Congress having this day received certain intelligence of the sailing of two north-country -built 
brigs, of no force, from England, on the 11th of 
August last, loaded with six thousand stand of arms, 
and a very large quantity of powder and other stores 
for Quebec, without convoy; and as it is of great 
importance, if possible, to intercept them, I am ordered by the Congress to give you this information, 
and to desire you immediately to apply to the Council of Massachusetts Bay for two armed vessels in 
their service, and despatch the same, with a sufficient number of people, stores, and particularly a number of oars, in order, if possible, to intercept said 
brigs and their cargoes, and secure the same for 
the use of the Continent. It is also their desire, 
that you give orders to the commanders of the vessels you send on this service, to seize and take any 
other transports, laden with ammunition, clothing, or 
other stores, for the use of the Ministerial Army or 
Navy in America, which they may meet with, and 
secure them in the most convenient places for the 
purpose above mentioned; that you give the commander or commanders such instructions as are necessary, and also proper encouragement to the marines 
and seamen that shall be sent on this enterprise ; 
that the instructions you shall give be delivered to 
the commander or commanders, sealed up, with orders 
not to open the same until out of sight of land, on 
account of secrecy. 
</p><p>
If the vessels in the service of the Massachusetts Bay can be readily obtained, you are to employ 
them, and others, if you should think more necessary, to effect the purposes aforesaid if they can 
not, you will employ such as can be soonest fitted 
out. At the same time I am directed to inform you, 
that the Rhode Island and Connecticut vessels of 
force, if possible, will be sent directly after, to the 
assistance of those you send out ; for which purpose 
I write, by order of Congress, to those governments, 
by this conveyance. 
</p><p>
For the encouragement of the men employed in 
this service, I am to inform you that the Congress 
have determined that^ on this occasion, the master, 
officers, and seamen, shall be entitled to one half of 
the value of the prizes by them taken, the wages 
they receive from their respective Colonies notwithstanding. It is farther resolved, that the ships or 
vessels of war, employed in this service, are to be 
on the Continental risk and pay during their being 
thus employed. 
</p><p>
For further intelligence I must refer you to the 
inclosed, which I have not time to copy, as I am 
ordered immediately to despatch the express. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President. 
</p><p>
P. S. The inclosed please to order to be delivered to the Council of Massachusetts Bay.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 28th of November, by Captain 
Blewer, being received, was immediately laid before 
Congress. 
</p><p>
By my letter of the 2d instant, which I hope you will in due time receive, you will perceive the Congress have, in a great measure, prevented your wishes, 
having written to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and given orders to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a> to supply you with, and to forward, 
with all possible expedition, what cannon can be 
spared. They have also directed <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a> to 
make diligent search for lead ; and, retaining so much 
as may be wanted there, to send the remainder to 
your camp. However, it is hoped the gentlemen you 
have sent will expedite that business. 
</p><p>
By order of Congress, I forward a commission for <a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='colleague'>Mr. Knox</a>, who is appointed Colonel of the Regiment 
of Artillery. The Congress also have relieved your 
difficulties with respect to the two battalions of Marines, having ordered that the raising them out of 
the army be suspended. It is the desire of Congress 
that such a body of forces may be raised ; but their 
meaning is, that it be in addition to the army voted; 
and they expect you will think of proper persons to 
command that corps, and give orders for enlisting 
them wherever they may be found. 
</p><p>
The Congress are sensibly affected with your situation, and regret the backwardness of the troops to 
re enlist. In addition to what I had the honor of 
transmitting you the 2d instant, they have desired 
me to inclose you a copy of a resolution passed yesterday, and to write to the Council of Massachusetts 
Bay, the Convention of New Hampshire, and the 
Governors of Rhode Island and Connecticut, acquainting  them with the present state of the army, and in 
closing copies of the resolutions of this Congress 
relative to your being empowered to call forth the 
militia of those Governments on any emergency, and 
requesting those Colonies to exert themselves in defence of our common liberties, by affording you all 
the aid in their power, and to comply with your request for the assistance of the militia, whenever you 
may find it necessary to call for it. 
The gentlemen with the money set out to-day. I 
hope the arrival of this will relieve some of your 
difficulties; and that the payment of the arrears, and 
the month's advance, which you arc empowered to 
offer, will induce many to reenlist, who seem not to 
be actuated by nobler motives. 
</p><p>
By letters, received yesterday, we learn that <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>Colonel Arnold</a>, after a fatiguing march, had reached Canada, where he was well received by the inhabitants 
that, on the 14th of November, he had reached Point 
Levi, and was preparing to pass the river that night; 
that, notwithstanding his being deserted by Colonel 
Enos, he had great hopes of gaining possession of 
Quebec, as both the English and Canadian inhabitants 
were well affected to our cause ; that Carleton, with 
the ships under his command, was stopped in his 
passage down the river by a fort in our possession, 
at the mouth of the Sorel, and some row-galleys ; and 
that <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague'>General Montgomery</a> was preparing to attack 
him from Montreal. But of these matters you will 
doubtless be more fully informed by an express, which 
we understand was despatched to you from <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c.,

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Your letters of the 30th of November, and of the 4th, 7th, and 11th of December, being duly received, 
were laid before Congress. To prevent the ill consequences that might ensue from the backwardness of 
the men, in the present service, to reenlist, the Congress, as I informed you in my last, have written to 
the Governors of Connecticut and Rhode Island, the Council of Massachusetts Bay, and the President of 
the Convention of New Hampshire. In consequence of which letters, they have strong hopes and confidence that measures will be taken to complete your 
army. As to the article of butter, the Congress, desirous to obviate whatever may have a " tendency to 
give the soldiery room for complaint," have instructed me to inform you, that the same may be continued until further order. 
</p><p>
The Congress receive, with great satisfaction, your congratulations on the success of Captain Manly. By the inclosed resolves, you will perceive their determination on the captures already made, as well as those which may be made hereafter. It is expected the several Colonies will erect Courts of Admiralty, 
and that the Judges in those courts will regulate their decisions by the law of nations, except where it is relaxed by the inclosed resolutions. 
</p><p>
I am further directed to inform you, that the Congress approve your taking such of the articles, found 
on board the <a href='/results.php?city=concord' rel='city'>Concord</a>, as are necessary for the army. The necessity of the case will, they apprehend, justify the measure, even though the vessel upon trial 
should, contrary to their expectation, be acquitted. 
</p><p>
I am authorized to inform you, that it is the pleasure of Congress that Mr. Mifflin, the Quartermaster-General, hold the rank of Colonel in the Army of 
the United Colonies, and that you establish his rank accordingly. 
</p><p>
I must beg leave to refer you to the inclosed resolutions of Congress for your future proceedings, 
which I am directed to transmit to you. You will 
notice the last resolution relative to an attack upon 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. This passed, after a most serious debate, in 
a Committee of the whole House, and the execution 
was referred to you ; and may God crown your attempt with success. I most heartily wish it, though 
individually I may be the greatest sufferer. 
</p><p>
I have paid Mr. Fessenden, the express, in full for 
his three journeys as express to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, deducting  only sixty dollars, which he says you ordered 
him ; so that there will be no pay due to him for 
services performed heretofore, only for his expenses 
now from this place to you. If this adjustment be 
not right, please to inform me. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with sincere sentiments of 
esteem, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President. 
</p><p>
P. S. Fessenden being indisposed, I have sent a 
special express, as Congress were anxious their resolves 
should reach you as quick as possible. 
</p>

<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city origin'>Philadelphia</a>, <a rel="day origin" value="16">16</a> <a rel="month origin" value="1">January</a>, <a href="/results.php?year=1776" rel="origin">1776</a>. 
</p><p>
Your letters of the 25th and 31st of December, 
and 4th of January, have been duly received, and 
laid before Congress. 
</p><p>
By the inclosed resolutions, you will perceive that 
the Congress, in providing for the defence of Canada, 
have directed that two battalions should be raised 
out of the troops now serving there. This they did 
in testimony of their approbation of the services of 
those brave men, apprehending, at the same time, 
that it would be both agreeable to the officers and 
men to have the honor of defending a country, which 
their valor had rescued from slavery. And the congress have a firm confidence, that <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague'>General Montgomery</a>, who has a warm and just sense of their merit 
and services, will cheerfully embrace the present opportunity to continue and promote the officers of that 
corps, and, as far as in his power, to reward with 
office and command, in those battalions, such volunteers and others as have distinguished themselves. 
</p><p>
The Committee, to whom your letters were referred, 
this day brought in a partial report; on which the 
Congress came to certain resolutions, which you will 
see in the inclosed extracts. I am just to acquaint 
you, that it is expected, when the Paymaster draws 
any bills, he will observe to make them payable some 
few days after sight. The Committee have desired 
leave to sit again, which is granted. As soon as 
they have completed their report, and the Congress 
have come to a determination thereon, I shall do my 
self the pleasure of transmitting it to you. The 
money last voted, is now ready ; and the persons 
who have the charge of conveying it will, I expect, 
set out with it to-morrow. 
</p><p>
I .have the pleasure to inform you, that the committee have purchased the saltpetre, and have agreed 
with the owners of mills to manufacture it into powder. One of the mills, it is expected, will make 
near a ton a week, and another near half a ton. I 
hope you will soon receive the powder ordered to he 
purchased at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. There were, as we are in 
formed, eight tons in the same vessel imported for 
that Colony. 
</p><p>
The public papers will inform you, that Lord Dun-more has endeavoured to exercise the same barbarity 
against the defenceless town of Norfolk, as was exercised against Falinouth. By these repeated instances 
of inhumanity, so contrary to the rules of war, and so 
long exploded by all civilized nations, it would seem 
as if the rancorous Ministry, despairing of their measures to conquer and enslave, had determined to glut 
their revenge with destruction and devastation. For 
my part, I shall not be surprised to hear, that in their 
frenzy of rage, and to effect their dark purposes, 
they have proceeded to murder, under forms of law, 
those prisoners whom the tools of their vengeance 
have chanced to take, and whom, with officious zeal, 
they have sent to England. 
</p><p>
As it is now apparent that our enemies mean to 
exert their whole force against us next summer, the 
Congress are taking measures for putting the middle 
and southern Colonies in a posture of defence. We 
shall doubtless suffer much in this great struggle ; 
but I trust no losses or sufferings will induce us to 
desert the defence of our liberty; and that, cost what 
it may, we will persevere, with unremitting vigor, to 
maintain that inestimable jewel which we received 
from our ancestors, and transmit the same, with unsullied lustre, to our posterity. 
</p><p>
January 18. The Committee, to whom your letter 
of the 31st of December was referred, desire to be 
informed whether the companies stationed at Chelsea and Maiden are regimented ; and whether, if 
those at Hingham, Weymouth, and <a href='/results.php?city=braintree' rel='city'>Braintree</a>, were withdrawn, it would be necessary to replace them out of the Continental Army. 
</p><p>
Since writing the above, we have received a letter 
from Messrs. Philip Livingston, Alsop, and Lewis, by 
which we find, to our mortification, that we were 
misinformed with regard to the large quantity of 
powder arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and that there were 
only four hundred and sixty-two quarter casks, which 
were imported for the use of that Colony, and of 
which a great part is distributed among several 
Counties. 
</p><p>
Before this comes to hand, you will doubtless receive an account of the disagreeable news from Quebec, on which I sincerely condole with you. The 
express arrived here last evening. To-day I expect the Congress will take it into consideration. The result of their deliberations you will have in my 
next letter. I am, &c.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
In my former letter, I mentioned the disagreeable 
news received from Canada. The Congress have taken 
that matter into consideration; and, having examined 
Mr. Antill, and duly deliberated on the situation of 
our affairs in that quarter, they have come to sundry 
resolutions, which I have the honor to inclose. 
</p><p>
I would just observe, that, by Mr. Antill's examination, it appears our loss is greater than what is set 
forth in the despatches he brought, a copy of which was transmitted to you. Almost the whole of <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a>'s gallant detachment are taken prisoners, 
having, after four hours resistance, been obliged to surrender at discretion. However, we have the satis faction to hear the prisoners are treated with humanity. 
</p><p>
The Congress are anxious, as Avell from motives of 
policy as of justice and humanity, to repair our 
losses in that quarter, and, if possible, to gain possession of Quebec, and drive our enemies out of that 
country before they can be reinforced in the spring. 
An active, able General is wanted to take the command there, arid if such an one can be spared from 
the service at <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>, it is their desire you should 
send him. 
</p><p>
The battalion from Pennsylvania, and that from 
New Jersey, will set forward the beginning of next 
week. 
</p><p>
As it is of great importance, as well for the security and relief of our friends as for confirming the 
wavering, that speedy succours should arrive, I am 
directed to request you to detach, from the camp at 
<a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>, one battalion, if the service there will 
permit you to spare one, with orders to march, with 
the greatest expedition possible, to Canada. If this 
cannot be complied with, you will use your utmost 
endeavours in stimulating the Governor of Connecticut and the Convention of New Hampshire, to whom 
I write by this opportunity, to forward, with the utmost despatch, the very first companies that can be 
raised in those Colonies. You can easily conceive 
what effect the arrival of even one company will 
have on the minds of our friends, especially when 
they shall be satisfied it will soon be followed by 
more. 
</p><p>
The Colony of South Carolina has been so fortunate as to oblige Lord William Campbell, with the 
vessels of war, to quit their harbour. Being earnestly 
desirous of providing for their defence, they have resolved to fit out some armed vessels, but not having 
seamen among themselves, they have despatched Captain Cochran to the northward, to enlist a number of 
seamen for the service of that Colony. Lest the 
offers he was empowered to make might prejudice 
the service, the Congress have chalked out a plan 
for him to go by, as you will see in the inclosed 
extracts, and I am directed to desire you will please 
to forward this service. 
</p><p>
Yesterday Dr. J. Smith, who made his escape from 
Frederick, was brought to this town. He was taken 
at the Little Meadows, on his way to Detroit, and 
had with him letters from Connolly to the commanding  officer there. 
</p><p>
I hinted to you, in my former letter, that the congress were taking measures for the defence of the 
Middle and Southern Colonies. For this purpose. over and above those destined for Canada, they have 
ordered four battalions to be raised in the Colony of 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, two in New Jersey, four in Pennsylvania, 
one in the Counties on Delaware, six in Virginia, 
three in North Carolina, three in South Carolina, and 
one in Georgia, each to consist of seven hundred and 
twenty-eight men, including officers, making in the 
whole, with those for Canada, thirty-four battalions. 
I have the honor to be, &c.

SIR, 
</p><p>
The Congress have received your letter of the 19th 
instant, and highly commend your prudence and zeal 
in applying to the Governments of New Hampshire, 
Massachusetts Bay, and Connecticut, to raise forces 
for the service of Canada at this exigency. They 
have fond hopes, by the zeal and alacrity of those 
Colonies, troops will be forwarded with such expedition as will not only succour our friends, but in some 
measure retrieve our loss, and put us in possession of Quebec, before our enemies can receive reinforcements. 
</p><p>
The Congress have agreed to add the Massachusetts regiment to the forces they at first destined for Canada. This is the more necessary, as it is now uncertain whether two battalions, as was expected, can be 
raised out of the troops in that country. But they do not, by this, mean to weaken your army. They have, therefore, ordered that the three regiments you 
applied for from Massachusetts Bay, New Hampshire, and Connecticut, shall be exclusive of the thirteen wanted for the army at <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>. 
</p><p>
By the latest advices from England, it appears that 
Administration are determined to exert themselves, and 
to send a considerable force against us next spring, 
though at the same time they pretend to say, that 
they will offer terms of accommodation, and mean 
only by their armament to enforce their terms. 
</p><p>
It behooves us, therefore, to be ready to receive 
them; for, should an accommodation take place, the 
terms will be severe or favorable in proportion to 
our ability to resist, 
</p><p>
The Congress highly approve your sending General Lee to the assistance of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, as a measure 
judicious and necessary, and have also appointed 
three of their body to repair to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and confer with General Lee and the Committee of Safety 
of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, on the subject of putting that Colony 
in a posture of defence. 
</p><p>
General Prescott arrived here last Thursday, and is 
this day ordered into close confinement in the jail 
of this city. 
</p><p>
I must beg leave to refer you to the inclosed resolutions. I send, by this express, commissions for the 
Massachusetts battalion, and the money ordered to 
the Assembly. I have the honor to be, with the 
greatest esteem, Sir,

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Since my last, I have had the honor of receiving your letters of the 24th and 30th of January, 9th, 14th, 18th, 21st, and 26th of February, which were 
communicated to Congress. On the settlements and adjustments of accounts, the Congress have not yet come to any determination ; nor have they yet had 
time to contrive expedients for remedying the inconveniences mentioned in that of the 9th, which is referred to, and will be taken up, in a Committee of the Whole. 
</p><p>
The Congress highly approve your care and attention in stopping Lord Drummond's letter, and entirely concur with you in sentiment with regard to 
his Lordship's officious and unwarrantable zeal. 
</p><p>
The situation of the Middle and Southern Colonies hath engaged the attention of Congress. These are divided into two departments ; the Middle, comprehending <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland, under the command of a Major-General and two Brigadier-Generals; the Southern, 
comprehending Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia, under the command of a Major-General and four Brigadier-Generals. As there is reason to 
think that the force of our enemies will be directed against the Colonies in the Southern Department, Major-General Lee is appointed to that command. 
The Brigadier-Generals are, John Armstrong, William Thompson, Andrew Lewis, James Moore, Esq., Lord Stirling, and Robert Howe, Esq. 
</p><p>
Of these gentlemen, General Armstrong is directed 
to repair to South Carolina; General Lewis and General Howe to Virginia ; General Moore to North Carolina; and General Thompson and Lord Stirling to 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. And, that our affairs in Canada may be 
under the direction of an able officer, and <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>'s health not permitting him to go thither, 
or, if he could, as his presence is so necessary in 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, the Congress have promoted Brigadier-General Thomas to the rank of a Major-General, and 
directed him to repair to Canada, and take the command of the Continental forces in that quarter. I 
have accordingly inclosed him his commission, and 
am to desire you will give him orders to repair, with 
all expedition, to his post. To enable him to exe 
cute the purposes Congress have in view in Canada, they have ordered twelve battering cannon to be sent from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and have forwarded ten tons of powder. 
</p><p>
Of this article, we have lately received several sup 
plies, and have, some time ago, ordered five tons and 
a half to be sent to you; which, if you have not 
already received, will, I hope, soon reach you. The 
Congress have also ordered ten tons more of powder 
to be sent to you, which will set out to-morrow or 
next day. Besides this, in the beginning of last 
month they ordered ten tons of saltpetre to be sent 
to Mr. Wisncr's powder-mill, in the Colony of New 
York; and, on the 12th of the same month, ten tons 
to Mr. Livingston's mill, in the same Colony; and 
ten tons to the Council of Massachusetts, with a desire to have it manufactured into gunpowder with all 
possible expedition, and sent to you for the use of 
the army under your command. Besides this, I have 
the pleasure to inform you, that the powder-mills in 
this Colony are employed, and more mills are building , which will be employed ; so that I have strong 
hopes we shall soon have a plentiful supply of that 
necessary article. 
</p><p>
With regard to arms, I am afraid W T C shall, for a 
time, be under some difficulty. The importation is 
now more precarious and dangerous. To remedy this, 
a Committee is appointed to contract for the making 
arms ; and, as there is a great number of gunsmiths 
in this and the neighbouring Colonies, I flatter my 
self we shall soon be able to provide ourselves without 
risk or danger. But W T C must, like other States engaged in the like glorious struggle, contend with difficulties. By perseverance, and the blessing of 
God, I trust, if we continue to deserve freedom, we shall be enabled to overcome them. To that Being, in whose hands is the fate of nations, I recommend 
you and the army under your command. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with every sentiment of 
esteem,

SIR, 
</p><p>
I had the honor of receiving, yesterday, yours of 
the 19th, containing the agreeable information of the 
Ministerial troops having abandoned <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. The 
partial victory we have obtained over them, in that 
quarter, I hope will turn out a happy presage of a 
more general one. Whatever place may be the object of their destination, it must certainly give a sincere pleasure to every friend of this country, to see 
the most diligent preparations everywhere making to 
receive them. What may be their views, it is in 
deed impossible to tell with any degree of exactness. 
We have all the reason, however, from the rage of 
disappointment and revenge, to expect the worst. 
Nor have I any doubt that, as far as their power 
extends, they will inflict every species of calamity 
upon us. The same <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> that has baffled their 
attempt against the Province of Massachusetts Bay 
will, I trust, defeat the deep-laid scheme they are 
now meditating against some other part of our country. 
</p><p>
The intelligence that our army had got possession 
of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, you will readily suppose gave me heart 
felt pleasure. I beg/ Sir, you will he pleased to accept my warmest thanks for the attention you have 
showed to my property in that town. I have only 
to request that Captain Cazneau will continue to 
look after it, and take care that it be no ways destroyed or damaged. 
</p><p>
This success of our arms naturally calls on me to 
congratulate you, Sir, to whose wisdom and conduct 
it has been owing. Permit me to add, that, if a 
constant discharge of the most important duties, and 
the fame attending thereon, can afford genuine satis 
faction, the pleasure you feel must be the most rational and exalted. 
</p><p>
I have it in charge from Congress to direct, that 
you send an account of the troops in your camp, 
who are deficient in arms, to the several Assemblies 
or Conventions of the Colonies to which those men 
belong, and request them to send a sufficient number of arms for the men coining from the respective 
Colonies ; and that, if arms cannot be procured, such 
as have not arms be dismissed the service. 
</p><p>
The Congress being of opinion, that the reduction 
of Quebec and the general security of the Province 
of Canada, are objects of great concern, I am commanded to direct that you detach four battalions 
into Canada from the army under your command, as 
soon as you shall be of opinion, that the safety of 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and the Eastern service will permit. 
</p><p>
Your several letters are at this time under the 
consideration of a Committee. As soon as any determination is made thereon, I will immediately for 
ward it to you. I have the honor to be, with the 
greatest esteem, Sir, your most obedient and very 
humble servant,

SIR, 
</p><p>
As I imagine this will meet you on the road to 
this place, I waive making any mention of public 
matters, except that it is the wish of Congress you 
would, if consistent with the good of the service, 
order one battalion from. <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to be posted at 
Aniboy, in the Jerseys, agreeably to the inclosed resolve. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a> arrived this morning; soon after 
which I was honored with your favor by post, which 
I laid before Congress; and, as they expect you so 
soon here, I imagine they will defer consulting <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a>, and wait your arrival. 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 20th instant I received this 
morning, and cannot help expressing the very great 
pleasure it would afford both Mrs. Hancock and my 
self to have the happiness of accommodating you 
during your stay in this city. As the house I live 
in is large and roomy, it will be entirely in your 
power to live in that manner you should wish. 
Mrs. <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> may be as retired as she pleases 
while under inoculation, and Mrs. Hancock will esteem it an honor to have Mrs. <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> inoculated in her house ; and, as I am informed Mr. Randolph has not any lady about his house to take the 
necessary care of Mrs. <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>, I flatter myself 
she will be as well attended in my family. In 
short, Sir, I must take the freedom to repeat my 
wish, that you would be pleased to condescend to 
dwell under my roof. I assure you, Sir, I will do 
all in my power to render your stay agreeable, and 
my house shall be entirely at your disposal. I must, 
however, submit this to your determination, and only 
add that you will peculiarly gratify Mrs. Hancock and 
myself in affording me an opportunity of convincing 
you of this truth, that I am, with every sentiment 
of regard for you and your connections, and with 
much esteem, dear Sir, your faithful and most obedient and humble servant,

SIR, 
</p><p>
I am honored with your letters of the 7th, 8th, 
and 9th instant. The two first I have read in congress. We have been two days in a Committee of 
the Whole, deliberating on three capital matters, the 
most important in their nature of any that have yet 
been before us, and have sat till seven o clock in the 
evening, each day. That not being finished, I judge 
best to return the express. I shall press Congress as 
soon as possible to determine upon the several matters you wish to be ascertained, and immediately 
transmit you the result. 
</p><p>
The Congress have agreed to settle the mode of 
paying the troops in the Eastern Department this 
morning, and to proceed to the appointment of a 
Deputy Paymaster-General. 
</p><p>
The particular mode of establishing expresses is 
now under the consideration of a Committee, and as 
soon as agreed, you shall know the issue. 
</p><p>
Although Congress have not acted upon your queries respecting the Indians, yet I will venture to give my opinion that Congress intended the resolution of May 25th should be general, and extend to 
the several departments ; and that the resolution of 
the 3d of June goes only to the number which the 
General shall be empowered to employ in Canada. 
But I hope soon to give you a full answer to all 
your queries ; and in future I will exert myself in 
Congress, that your applications may be considered 
as soon as received, and keep you punctually and 
regularly informed of the result. 
</p><p>
Inclosed you have a resolve, whereby you will see 
that all the troops in the Middle Department are put 
upon the same pay, six and two thirds dollars, as the 
troops in the Eastern Department. 
</p><p>
I have sent you four bundles of commissions, and 
will forward you more by next opportunity. 
</p><p>
The inclosed, from Mrs. <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>, I wish safe 
to hand. I have the pleasure to acquaint you she is 
in fine spirits, and proposes paying you a visit next 
week. I sent her your letter by the express; and 
when you write, if you will please to put the letter 
under my cover, I will immediately deliver it. I 
have the honor to be, with every sentiment that respect and esteem inspire,

SIR, 
</p><p>
You will see, from the inclosed resolves, which I do 
myself the pleasure of forwarding, in obedience to 
the commands of Congress, that they have bent their 
whole attention to our affairs in Canada, and have 
adopted such measures, as, in their opinion, are calculated to place them on a better and more reputable footing for the future. 
</p><p>
The most unfortunate death of General Thomas 
having made a vacancy in that department, and the 
service requiring an officer of experience and distinction, the Congress have thought proper to appoint 
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a> to succeed him. And I am to request 
you will send him into that Province, to take the 
command of the forces there, as soon as possible; and 
that you direct him to view Point-au-Fer, and to 
order a fortress to be erected there, if he shall think 
proper. 
</p><p>
My opinion on the resolve of the 25th May was 
well founded ; Congress having since determined, as 
you will find by a resolve herewith transmitted, that 
you are to employ the Indians wherever you think 
their services will contribute most to the public good. 
</p><p>
I shall write to the Colonies of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, New 
Jersey, and Connecticut, to request them to author 
ize you to call on their militia, if necessary. My 
time will not permit me to do it now, as the post 
will set out directly, and the inclosed resolves were 
not passed till late yesterday evening. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
The Congress, having the greatest reason to believe there has been very gross misconduct in the management of our affairs in Canada, have come to 
a resolution to have a general inquiry made into the behaviour of the officers employed on that expedition. 
The honor of the United Colonies, and a regard for 
the public good, call loudly for such an inquiry to 
be set on foot. I am, therefore, directed to request, 
after having made the inquiry agreeably to the in-closed resolve, you will transmit the result, together 
with the proofs, to Congress/ 1 
</p><p>
The opinion that an officer cannot be tried by a 
court-martial after his resignation, for offences while 
he held a commission, so dangerous to the service, 
and particularly destructive in our army, where the 
short enlistment of the troops might furnish temptation to crimes from the prospect of impunity, has 
been this day reprobated by Congress. 
</p><p>
I have written to the Convention of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> on 
the subject of the inclosed resolve respecting another 
regiment to be raised in that Colony. The terms on 
which the commissions are to be granted are extremely well calculated to excite the officers to exert 
themselves to fill up their companies. 
</p><p>
I have likewise written to the respective Colonies, 
and have sent copies of the inclosed resolve recommending to them to provide clothes for the troops of 
their Colonies. These, or such articles of them as 
you shall want, the Congress have empowered you 
to draw for on the Assemblies and Conventions, from 
time to time, as you shall judge necessary. I have represented to them that it is totally impossible that 
the American army should ever be on a respectable 
footing, or that they should render such essential services to their country as we expect and desire, unless the United Colonies will, on their part, take care 
that they are well appointed and equipped with every 
thing necessary for an army. 
</p><p>
General "Wooster, it is the order of Congress, should 
be permitted to return to his family. 
</p><p>
I have delivered Mr. Visscher his commission as 
Lieutenant-Colonel in the regiment commanded by 
Colonel Nicholson, and directed him to wait on you, 
upon his arrival at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
</p><p>
Apprehending that such of the resolves of Congress 
as respect the conduct of the army, are executed in 
consequence of orders issued by you, I have omitted 
sending to <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a> such as respect him,, 
concluding that the directions would go from you ; 
but if it will be any way a relief to you, I will continue to forward them. I have the honor to be, with 
much esteem, Sir, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 21st instant, by Mr. Bennett, 
with the inclosure, was duly received and laid before 
Congress, as you will perceive by the inclosed resolves, to which I beg leave to request your attention. 
</p><p>
Although the Commissioners have undoubtedly mistaken the intention of Congress, yet the terms in 
which the resolve is conceived, namely, " That the 
General be empowered to employ in Canada a number of Indians, not exceeding two thousand," may, at 
first view, seem to confine their employment to the 
limits of that Province, and to give a latitude of construction as to the place in which they are to be 
raised; and in this sense they must have been under 
stood by <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a> and the other Commissioners. I am, how r ever, to request you will give 
orders to have a stop put to raising the Mohegan 
and Stockbridge Indians, as soon as possible. I shall 
write <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Governor Trumbull</a> to the same purpose. 
The conduct of the Quartermaster-General, in detaining the tents sent from this place to Massachusetts Bay, is a stretch of office which, though it may 
he well meant, is certainly a very extraordinary one. 
You will, therefore, be pleased to order them to he 
delivered up, and forwarded to the Massachusetts Bay 
as soon as possible. 
</p><p>
The other resolves, herewith transmitted, calculated 
to suppress insurrections and to promote good order 
and obedience to laws in the United Colonies, are so 
full and explicit that I need not enlarge. It is sufficient to observe, that internal convulsions do always 
extremely weaken the force and springs of Government, and must necessarily render its operations 
against foreign enemies less vigorous and decisive.
</p><p>
Application having been made to Congress with regard to victualling the Flying Camp, I am directed to request you will inform them what is the cost of a ration, as furnished by the Commissary-General. 
</p><p>
The several matters in your letters are before a Committee. The proposal respecting a troop of horse is liked; and as soon as the Committee bring in their 
report, and it is considered, you shall be made acquainted with the result. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient and very humble servant,

</p><p>
The Congress, for some time past, have had their 
attention occupied by one of the most interesting and 
important subjects, that could possibly come before 
them or any other assembly of men. 
</p><p>
Although it is not possible to foresee the consequences of human actions, yet it is, nevertheless, a 
duty we owe ourselves and posterity, in all our pub 
lic councils, to decide in the best manner we are 
able, and to leave the event to that Being who controls both causes and events, to bring about his own determinations. 
</p><p>
Impressed with this sentiment, and at the same time 
fully convinced that our affairs may take a more favorable turn, the Congress have judged it necessary 
to dissolve the connection between Great Britain and 
the American Colonies, and to declare them free and 
independent States, as you will perceive by the in 
closed DECLARATION, which I am directed by Congress 
to transmit to you, and to request you will have it 
proclaimed at the head of the army in the way you 
shall think most proper.
</p><p>
Agreeably to the request of Congress, the Committee of Safety of this Colony have forwarded to you 
ten thousand flints, and the Hints at Rhode Island are ordered to be sent to you immediately. 
</p><p>
It is with great pleasure I inform you, that the militia of this Colony, of Delaware Government, and 
Maryland, are, and will be every day in motion, to form the Flying Camp, and that all the militia of 
this Colony will soon be in the Jerseys, ready to receive such orders as you shall please to give them. 
</p><p>
I have written to <a href='/results.php?tla=nic' rel='colleague'>Governor Cooke</a>, to engage immediately, and send forward as fast as possible, fifty 
ship-carpenters to <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>, for the purpose of building vessels on the Lakes. Fifty have already gone from hence on that business. 
</p><p>
The Congress having directed the arms, taken on board the Scotch transports, to be sent to you. I have 
written to the agents in Rhode Island and Massachusetts Bay, to forward them immediately. 
</p><p>
The inclosed copy of a letter from Mr. Green, I am directed to forward, by Congress, with a request that you will order such parts of the stores, therein 
mentioned, to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, as you shall judge proper.

SIR, 
</p><p>
I am to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the 10th instant, and to acquaint you that it is now under the consideration of Congress. 
</p><p>
The inclosed resolves I do myself the honor to transmit, as necessary for your information. I have written to <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>, and the Commissioners 
for Indian Affairs, respecting the same. 
</p><p>
In obedience to the commands of Congress, I have inclosed von two copies of sundry resolves they have passed relative to the treatment of our prisoners by 
Captain Forster, in Canada. I am to request you will take the proper steps to send one of them to General Howe, and the other to <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>. 
I transmit, also, a third copy for your own use.
</p><p>
Should the United States of America give their sanction to the Jesuitical and villanous distinction which Captain Forster adopts to justify his conduct, 
there would be no end to butchering our prisoners. They have, therefore, very properly reprobated it ; and, in the genuine spirit of freedom, resolved, that 
such cruelty as shall be inflicted on prisoners in their possession, by savages or foreigners taken into pay by the King of Great Britain, shall be considered as 
done by his orders, and recourse be immediately had to retaliation. It is to be hoped their determination will have the desired effect, and that for the future, 
such barbarous scenes will never be acted under the eye and approbation of a British officer ; for there is the greatest reason to believe, that Captain Forster 
engaged the Indians to join him, on the express condition of giving up to them all such prisoners as might fall into his hands. His subsequent conduct, indeed, renders this conjecture more than probable. 
</p><p>
considerable time, and surrendered at last, but on absolute necessity ; on 
which consideration, and on which alone, it is resolved, that the said 
sponsion be ratified ; and that an equal number of captives from the 
enemy, of the same rank and condition, be restored to them, as stipulated by the said sponsion ; 
</p><p>
" That, previous to the delivery of the prisoners to be returned on our 
part, the British commander in Canada be required to deliver into our 
hands the authors, abettors, and perpetrators of the horrid murder committed on the prisoners, to suffer such punishment as their crime deserves ; and also, to make indemnification for the plunder at the Cedars, 
taken contrary to the faith of the capitulation ; and that, until such delivery and indemnification be made, the said prisoners be not delivered ; 
</p><p>
That if the enemy shall commit any further violences, by putting to death, torturing, or otherwise ill treating the prisoners retained by them, 
or any of the hostages put into their hands, recourse be had to retaliation, as the sole means of stopping the progress of human butchery ; 
and that, for that purpose, punishments of the same kind and degree be inflicted on an equal number of the captives from them in our possession, till they shall be taught to respect the violated rights of nations ; 
</p><p>
" That a copy of the above report and resolutions be transmitted to the Commander-in-chief of the Continental forces, to be by him sent 
to Generals Howe and Burgoyne." Journals of Congress, July 10th. I have the honor to be, with perfect esteem. Sir, your most obedient and very humble servant,

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I am. particularly instructed, by Congress, to answer that part of your letter of 29th ultimo, directed to the Board of War, which relates to the filling up 
vacancies in the army. The Congress are concerned to find, that an opinion is entertained that greater confidence has been placed in, and larger powers 
given to other commanders in that respect, than to yourself. 
</p><p>
They have, in no instance, except in the late appointment of <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a> to the command in Canada, parted with the power of filling up vacancies. 
The great confusion and many disorders prevalent 
in that army, and its distance, induced Congress to 
lodge such a power in that General, for the limited 
space of three months, and only during his continuance in Canada. Should Congress ever empower its 
Generals to fill up the vacancies in the army, they 
know of no one in whom they would so soon repose 
a trust of such importance as in yourself; but future 
Generals may make a bad use of it. The danger 
of the precedent, not any suspicion of their present 
Commander-in-chief, prompts them to retain a power 
that, by you, Sir, might be exercised with the greatest public advantage. 
</p><p>
I do myself the honor to inclose sundry resolves, 
and to request your attention to them. They relate 
principally, as you will perceive, to some new regulations with regard to Paymasters, Commissaries, and 
Quartermasters in the American army, and are intended to prevent confusion and disorder in those several departments. 
</p><p>
The Congress approve of your employing, in the service of the States, the Stockbridge Indians, if you think proper. 
</p><p>
The inclosed resolve, for taking into the pay of the States such of the seamen as may fall into our hands on board of prizes, will, I trust, be attended 
with the good effects Congress had in view when they passed it. 
</p><p>

SIR, 
</p><p>
I am to acknowledge the receipt of your several favors, to the 27th ultimo. Your letter of that date, 
containing the very agreeable intelligence of the success of the Continental arms under your command, 
was last night delivered to me by your Aid-de-camp, Colonel Baylor, together with the Hessian standard. 
I entertain the most pleasing expectation that our affairs will henceforth assume a better complexion. 
Your account of the behaviour and spirit of the troops, gave the highest satisfaction to Congress; and manifests a disposition which may prove the fore 
runner of future success. 
</p><p>
Considering the unfavorable temper of the men, broken by fatigue and ill fortune, the happy event 
of the expedition appears the more extraordinary. But troops properly inspired, and animated by a just 
confidence in their leader, will often exceed expectation, or the limits of probability. As it is entirely to your wisdom and conduct the United States are 
indebted for the late success of their arms, the pleasure you must naturally feel on the occasion will be pure and unmixed. May you still proceed in the 
same manner to acquire that glory, which, by your disinterested and magnanimous behaviour, you so highly merit. 
</p><p>
I inclose to you a copy of resolves transmitted to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>, relative to the Northern Department, and also sundry other resolves relative to your 
own immediate department, which are all the congress have come into since I wrote you last. I have fonvarded to all the States copies of the resolves, 
vesting you with the powers which I had the pleasure of transmitting in my last, accompanied with letters explaining the reasons on which Congress acted in that particular. 
</p><p>
From the inclosed resolve, you will perceive congress have determined, that a horse, properly caparisoned, be presented to your Aid-de-camp, Colonel Baylor, and to recommend it to you to promote him 
to be a Colonel of a regiment of Light Horse. As 
the Congress have been pleased to intrust me with the execution of this resolve, I must beg you will 
do me the favor to give directions to the Quarter 
master, or other proper person, to purchase as hand 
some a horse, for this purpose, as can be found. The 
reason of my making this application, is an information I had received, that some Light Horse were 
taken at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, and are to be publicly sold for 
the benefit of the soldiery. Should this be the case, 
I must further ask the favor of you to give direction. at the same time to purchase one or two for 
my own use. The money shall be immediately remitted, whatever it may be. I should be glad to 
know what kind of horse furniture you think the 
most proper, as I would, by all means, wish to procure the best; but, without your advice and assistance, I am apprehensive I shall not succeed. If the 
horses are to be had, be pleased to order them to 
be sent to me, and every expense shall be paid 
arising thereon. 
</p><p>
This recommendation of Colonel Baylor, I doubt 
not, will meet with your approbation, and that, on 
his return from Virginia, you will give him a commission, with such pay as you shall think suitable 
and adequate. 
</p><p>
Wishing you, very sincerely, the compliments of 
the season, I have the honor to be, with every sentiment of esteem and regard, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President. 
</p><p>
P. S. I shall send you the letter-books by the 
first safe hand. By this opportunity, I send you four 
bundles, containing two hundred commissions ; the rest 
shall immediately follow.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
The inclosed resolves, which I have the honor of 
transmitting, call for your immediate attention ; and I 
am to request you will take measures in pursuance 
thereof, as soon as possible. General Lee's situation 
seems to be extremely dangerous and critical, and 
from General Howe's behaviour to him, it is highly 
probable he will be brought to a trial for desertion. 
General Lee, it is said by Mr. Eustace, his Aid-de 
camp, having addressed tAvo letters to General Howe, 
received them both back again, unopened, and inclosed under a cover directed to Lieutenant- Colonel Lee. 
I hope the flag, which Congress ordered to be sent 
to make inquiry into the manner in which he was 
treated, has been despatched, and a remonstrance, in 
consequence of it, should the information you have 
received of his treatment have rendered that step 
necessary. 
</p><p>
You will please to propose an exchange of the six 
Hessian field-officers for him; and at the same time 
make inquiry whether the report which Congress have 
heard of Mrs. Stockton's being confined in a common 
jail by the enemy, has any truth in it or not. 
</p><p>
By a letter, which Congress yesterday received from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague'>Mr. Morris</a>, we are informed that <a href='/results.php?tla=jhc' rel='colleague'>General Cadwalader</a>, 
with the troops under him, had joined your army; 
that the enemy were at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>; that the two armies 
were divided only by a creek; and that a general 
engagement was hourly expected. In the mean time 
Congress are infinitely anxious to hear the event, 
and humbly hope that victory has declared in favor of those whose sacred cause should inspire them with 
ardor, on every solemn appeal to that Being who 
hateth all injustice, tyranny, and oppression. I have 
the honor to be, with every sentiment of respect, Sir, 
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President. 
</p><p>
P. S. If the desire of Congress to procure General 
Lee's exchange cannot be effected, and the enemy, 
preferring the gratification of revenge to the civility 
they owe their Hessian auxiliaries, determine to keep 
or to abuse him, it will be very agreeable to Congress 
that their determination, with the inclosed resolve, be 
made known to the Hessians as fully as possible. 
To secure General Lee as effectually as may be from 
personal insult and injury, Congress have come to the 
present resolution; which you, Sir, are desired to convey to General Howe, with all convenient despatch. 
It will be very agreeable to Congress, that the Hes 
sian field-officer intended to be exchanged for Colonel 
Ethan Allen, be sent to notify it to General Howe, 
taking his parole to return in a fixed time, if Colonel 
Allen is not returned in his place. It will fall with 
in the wish of Congress, if Colonel Rahl, or one of 
the Hessian officers, should be also sent with the flag 
proposing the exchange of General Lee ; but the propriety of it is submitted to you. 
</p><p>
We have had an imperfect account of the engagement at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, and anxiously wait for further particulars. It was in hopes of receiving them that I 
detained the express till this morning.

SIR, 
</p><p>
From the resolves, which I have the honor of 
transmitting herewith, you will perceive the measures 
Congress have taken to reenforce your army at this 
juncture. 
</p><p>
I have wrote to the Convention of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to 
place a proper guard of militia at the passes in the 
Highlands, in case you should think proper to call 
to your assistance the troops under <a href='/results.php?tla=wih' rel='colleague'>General Heath</a>, 
which will be highly agreeable to Congress. 
</p><p>
I have likewise wrote to the Governor of New Jer 
sey, and to the Council of Safety of Pennsylvania, 
to call forth their militia at this important crisis. It 
is indeed devoutly to be wished, and is the earnest 
desire of Congress, that the army under your command may be made, not only strong enough to confine the enemy within their present quarters, and 
prevent them from getting supplies from the country, but totally subdue them before they can be further reenforced. You will, therefore, be pleased to 
write to the Colonels, or other commanding officers 
of the regiments that are raising in the New Eng 
land States, as well as those of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and New 
Jersey, and order them immediately to march the 
troops under their command, in the most expeditious 
manner, to head-quarters. Similar letters will be 
written by the Board of War to the commanding 
officers in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia. I beg leave to refer your attention to the 
whole of the inclosed resolves. 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 20th instant came to hand the 
24th, and was immediately laid before Congress. I 
have the honor to be, with sentiments of the great 
est esteem and respect, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President. 
</p><p>
P. S. In consequence of your letters, and one 
from <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague'>Mr. Morris</a>, Congress have suspended their remove to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> for a few days.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to transmit to you sundry resolves of Congress, of a very important nature, to 
which I beg leave to solicit your attention. 
</p><p>
The Congress, having had your letters of the 1st 
and 6th instant under consideration, have come to 
the inclosed resolve on the subject, by which you 
perceive they decline making any alteration in the 
resolve of the 6th of January, and that it was not 
their intention that Colonel Campbell should experience any other hardship than such confinement as 
is necessary to his security for the end they had in 
view when they passed that resolve. 
</p><p>
The obvious distinction made by General Howe, in 
his treatment of General Lee, who is notoriously committed to the custody of the provost, and denied his 
parole, while our other officers are admitted to it, 
was the ground on which Congress proceeded when 
they passed that resolve, the intention of which was 
to show that, in proportion as severities against him 
were increased, the same treatment should be exercised on six field-officers. 
</p><p>
The principle of retaliation was early adopted by 
the States of America, and, if adhered to, will be 
the most likely way to prevent our enemies from 
making distinctions, which have no other foundation 
but the gratification of their revenge; General Lee 
having an undoubted right to every indulgence that 
our other officers, prisoners among them, may receive. 
</p><p>
I have wrote to the Governor and Council of Virginia, and likewise to Colonel Stephen, on the subject of the inclosed resolves. 
</p><p>
The Congress have endeavoured to put a stop to 
foreigners coming over to America to enter the service, not only by directing the Committee of Secret 
Correspondence to write to the agents abroad to Discourage them from such views, but by declaring that 
they shall not be employed unless they are well acquainted with our language. 
</p><p>
Your several favors of the 20th, 23d, and 28th of 
February, and 1st and Gth of March, have been duly 
received and laid before Congress. I am also this 
minute honored with your favor of the 14th, which 
shall be laid before Congress as soon as possible. I 
have the honor to be, with sentiments of the great 
est esteem. Sir, 
</p><p>

SIR, 
</p><p>
I have the honor of transmitting such resolves of 
Congress as have passed since my last, which are 
either relative to your department, or necessary for 
your information. The Congress have authorized you 
to proceed in the exchange of prisoners, agreeably to 
the cartel at present existing, or such other regulation. as you may think proper to make in the matter, provided the enemy will relax in their treatment 
of General Lee, and acknowledge him. to be a prisoner of Avar, and as such entitled to be exchanged. 
</p><p>
I congratulate you on the arrival of a vessel at 
this port, from France, with eleven thousand stand of 
arms in good order, and, I am informed, fit for immediate use. She has brought likewise fifteen hundred gun-locks, and a large quantity of flints. Six 
thousand eight hundred of the arms are public property. The balance, which belong to individuals, the 
Congress have empowered the Secret Committee to 
purchase immediately. I have wrote to <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a> 
to repair to <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, agreeably to the inclosed resolve. 
</p><p>
Colonel Clinton was yesterday appointed a Brigadier-General, in consequence of a very warm recommendation from the Convention of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. As 
lie is an officer of established good character, and is 
now engaged in obstructing the river, his station at 
the Highlands will be more convenient, and highly 
agreeable to the Convention of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
</p><p>
Your favor, by <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>, was duly received, 
and a Committee appointed to confer with him, the 
result of which shall be immediately transmitted. I 
have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem 
and respect, Sir, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
The inclosed resolves of Congress, which I have 
the honor of transmitting, will naturally claim your 
attention, from their great importance. The regulation. relative to the payment of the troops and the 
department of the Paymaster-General will, I hope, be 
the means of introducing order and regularity into 
that part of the army, where, it must be confessed, 
they were extremely wanted. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a> having laid before Congress the proceedings and sentence of a Court-Martial on a certain James Molesworth, who was accused and found 
guilty of being a spy, they immediately approved the 
same. He has since suffered the punishment due to 
his crime. From his repeated confession, it appears 
that Mr. Galloway was extremely active in engaging 
him to undertake this infamous business, and was 
the person employed to make the bargain with him. 
He says, indeed, Lord Howe was present; but, from 
the description he gave of his person, it is supposed 
he must be mistaken. 
</p><p>
The Congress have directed <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a> to take 
General Fermoy with him to <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, and such 
other French officers as he may think proper. <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel=''>General St. Clair</a>, being ordered to <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, but previously 
to repair to this city to await the further order of 
Congress, you will please to direct him to repair here 
accordingly, as soon as possible. I have the honor to 
be, with the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir,

Yesterday evening, the Congress completed the business of the Medical Department, and on so large 
and liberal an establishment that we may rationally 
expect the most beneficial effects will flow from it. 
Every encouragement is given to gentlemen of skill 
and reputation in that art to enter into our army ; 
and a variety of regulations adopted to carry the 
plan more effectually into execution. As I have the 
honor of inclosing the resolves on this subject, I beg 
leave to refer your attention to them. 
</p><p>
It is with particular pleasure I transmit the resolution of Congress directing monuments to be erected 
to the memory of Major-General Warren and Brigadier-General Mercer. Every mark of distinction shown 
to those illustrious men, who offer up their lives and 
liberty for the happiness of mankind, reflects the 
highest honor upon those who pay the tribute, and, 
by holding up to others the prospects of fame and 
immortality, will animate them to tread in the same 
path. I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect and esteem,

<a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='colleague'>General Mifflin</a> having applied to Congress, in consequence of your letter to him, he has their permission to repair immediately to head-quarters, agreeably 
to his own desire. I have made him acquainted with 
this determination of Congress. 
</p><p>
In order that you may be enabled to meet General Howe upon his own ground, who has long since 
offered rewards to induce the soldiers of the American army to desert, the Congress have authorized 
you to fix on such rewards or sum of money as you 
may judge proper, to encourage deserters from the 
enemy, both horse and foot. You will, therefore, be 
pleased to carry this resolve into execution in such 
way as you may think most expedient, and best

You will perceive, from the inclosed resolves, the

as lies in their power, on our enemies, should they 
think proper to send any of their prisoners to Great 
Britain, or to any other part of the British King's 
dominions beyond sea. This resolution you will please 
to convey to General Howe, as soon as possible, as 
it is of the utmost importance. 
</p><p>
If the sixteen additional battalions are not all provided with commanding officers, the Congress, in consequence of a letter from Governor Caswell (an Extract of which I inclose to you), have recommended 
Colonel Abraham Shepherd to the command of one of 
the said battalions, and doubt not you will honor him 
with the appointment. I beg leave to request your

Your favor of the 23d, containing the agreeable 
intelligence that the enemy had retreated from 
Brunswick, I had the honor of receiving yesterday 
afternoon, and shall this morning, with the greatest pleasure, lay it before Congress. Give me leave to 
congratulate you very sincerely upon this event; as 
it must be principally ascribed to the prudence and 
wisdom of your operations, which had so embarrassed 
the enemy as to reduce them to the necessity of 
acting in the manner they have done. Should they 
be compelled finally to abandon the Jerseys, which I 
Hatter myself will be the case, it will be the most 
explicit declaration to the whole world, that the conquest of America is not only a very distant, but an 
unattainable object. We have seen them, after pene 
trating some miles into our country, precipitately 
driven back, and in a moment obliged to evacuate 
towns, after keeping possession of them only a few 
months. 
</p><p>
I do myself the honor to inclose you the resolves

The complaints of the want of men to the north 
ward are so great and urgent, that Congress, with a 
view of affording them some assistance, have come to 
the inclosed resolve ; by which you will perceive it 
is their desire that five hundred riflemen, under the 
command of an active officer, should be immediately 
sent into that department, to oppose the incursions of 
the Indians. 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 16th instant, I was last night

SIR, 
</p><p>
Your several favors to the 30th ultimo, inclusive, I 
have had the honor of receiving, in the order of their 
dates. 
</p><p>
From the inclosed resolves, you will perceive that 
the Congress have appointed a committee to collect 
and arrange the evidence relative to the evacuation 
of <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, which will be afterwards transmitted 
to you, that a court-martial may be thereupon instituted for the trial of the General Officers who were 
in the Northern Department when the evacuation took 
place. 
</p><p>
The great demand for arms to equip the militia, 
who are called into service, has induced the Congress 
to pass the inclosed resolve, directing that a number 
of workmen, conversant in the business of repairing 
firelocks, should be immediately detached from the 
militia, to be employed in repairing the arms in this 
city, there being between two and three thousand 
that in a short time may be rendered fit for use. 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to congratulate you on our 
further success in the Northern Department, in raising 
the siege of Fort Schuyler. The enemy, on the approach of <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a>, fled with the utmost precipitation, leaving behind them their tents, ammunition, provision, &c. As I forward herewith several 
letters for you from that quarter, which I make no 
doubt contain an account of the matter, I beg leave 
to refer you to them for further particulars. I have 
the honor to be, with the greatest respect, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, and very humble servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
You will perceive, from the inclosed resolves, that 
Congress, desirous of reenforcing the army at this 
critical period, have recommended to the States of 
Pennsylvania and New Jersey to order out immediately a considerable part of their militia; and I have 
no doubt of their compliance. 
</p><p>
I have wrote to Governor Livingston on the subject, and informed him that, should he think proper 
to appoint General Dickinson to the command of the 
three thousand requested from that State, it will be 
extremely agreeable to Congress. That gentleman 
has, I understand, signified his readiness to act when 
ever called upon; and, as he possesses the confidence 
of the militia, and has talents equal to the task, I 
am persuaded the appointment will give general satisfaction. 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 3d instant, and likewise of yesterday by the hands of <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel=''>General St. Clair</a>, I have been 
duly honored with. The latter I shall lay before 
Congress this morning. I have the honor to be, with 
the greatest respect, Sir, 
</p><p>

SIR, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to transmit, at this time, copies 
of the several letters from General Livingston and 
General Ducoudray to Congress. As Governor Livingston seems apprehensive of an irruption from the 
enemy on Staten Island, and says they are collecting 
there for this purpose, the Congress have directed 
<a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a> to hold in readiness fifteen hundred 
men, under the command of a Brigadier, to cross the 
North River when you may think proper to order it. 
A copy of the resolve I shall immediately forward 
to <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a>. 
</p><p>
The inclosed letter, from Monsieur Ducoudray, contains a proposal of forming a camp between Wilmington and <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, the propriety of which the 
Congress have referred entirely to you. Colonel Harrison's favor of the 7th instant was duly received. I 
beg leave to request your attention to the inclosures ; 
and have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, 
Sir, 
</p><p>

SIR, 
</p><p>
I am this moment favored with yours, by the express. I am sorry for the unfortunate issue of 
the day; but from the troops keeping up their spirits, I flatter myself it will still be in our power to retrieve the loss of yesterday. 
</p><p>
I have thought proper, in consequence of the intelligence received this morning, to call the Congress 
together at six o clock. I have the honor to be, with the utmost respect, Sir, 
</p><p>

SIR, 
</p><p>
Since my departure from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, I have to 
acknowledge the receipt of your favors to the 23d 
instant. I met the Congress on Saturday last, at 
Lancaster, and, upon consultation, it was judged most 
prudent to adjourn to this place, where we now are, 
and where we can prosecute business without interruption, and where your despatches will meet us. 
</p><p>
I have just now received, by <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a>'s 
Aid-de-camp, <a href='/results.php?tla=rot' rel='colleague'>Major Troup</a>, sundry letters, copies of 
which I have the honor to inclose to you, by which 
it appears that our affairs in the Northern Department wear a favorable aspect, and I hope soon to 
transmit you an account of an issue to the contest 
in that quarter. 
</p><p>
I wish soon to receive the most pleasing accounts 
from you. We are in daily expectation of agreeable 
tidings, and that General Howe is totally reduced. 
</p><p>
I beg leave to refer you to the inclosed papers; 
and am, with the utmost respect and esteem, Sir, 
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
SIR 
</p><p>
I am to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of 
the 19th of April, inclosing several papers; all which 
were immediately laid before Congress. 
</p><p>
The important intelligence they contain makes it 
necessary that the most vigorous measures should 
be adopted, as well to defend our troops against the 
Canadians themselves, as to insure success to the Expedition. The Congress being determined on the reduction of Quebec, and the security of that country, 
for reasons too obvious to be mentioned, have left 
nothing undone which can any ways contribute to 
that end. Whatever may be the causes of the late 
insurrection, good policy requires, that while we endeavour to prevent every thing of the kind for the future, we should also make provision in case it should 
happen. Accordingly Congress have come into sundry 
resolutions calculated to quiet the minds of the Canadians, and to remove the sources of their uneasiness 
and discontent. They have likewise ordered six more 
battalions to be sent into Canada from the army at 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, as you will see by the inclosed resolve. 
Whether any further additional forces will be wanted 
there, is a matter of some uncertainty with Congress. 
Should you, from your knowledge of facts, the state 
of Canada, the possibility that General Howe will 
attempt to relieve General Carleton, and, comparing 
all circumstances together, be of opinion that an additional force is still necessary, you will please to signify it to Congress, and at the same time inform 
them whether, in that case, such additional force can 
be spared from the army now at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
</p><p>
I transmit, herewith, sundry resolves of Congress for your direction; and have the honor to be, Sir, your 
</p><p>
Most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President. 
</p><p>
P. S. The inclosed letter for Commodore Hopkins, I leave unsealed for your perusal only ; after which I 
beg of you the favor to seal and forward it by Fessenden, or a fresh express. I have paid Mr. Fessenden twelve dollars, which you will please to note on settlement with him.
