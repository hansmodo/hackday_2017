DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Since I did myself the honor to write to your Excellency from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, nothing very material occurred 
until yesterday, when I received the inclosed letters. 
The accounts contained in that marked Number One are 
truly alarming, in the present defenceless state of the 
counties of Tryon and <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, and especially as the 
assistance I can afford them either of men or money is 
next to nothing ; the few troops at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, &c., 
being at too great a distance, and not more than sufficient to guard the posts they occupy. I should have 
been at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> this day, had not the information from Tryon county arrived, which may make my 
presence there absolutely necessary, if it should be 
confirmed. I therefore propose remaining here until 
to-morrow, when I hope to be further informed. 
</p><p>
I wish I may be able to proceed to <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, 
as I am very much wanted there, the greatest confusion having taken place in the controversy between 
the officers claiming the command in that quarter. 
Some have taken the liberty to disband troops, others 
refused to serve unless this or that particular person 
commanded. The sloop is left without either captain 
or pilot, both of which are dismissed or come away; 
much provision wasted or embezzled,, and on the 7th 
instant only one barrel of flour at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>. I 
shall have an Augean stable to clean there. 
</p><p>
I do myself the honor to inclose a return of the 
forces in this colony. It is doubtless imperfect, as 
I have been under a necessity of forming it out of 
the returns which were evidently so. I hope soon to 
send you a more complete one. 
</p><p>
Be assured, my General, that I shall use my best 
endeavours to establish order and discipline in the 
troops under my command. I wish I could add, that I 
had a prospect of much success in that way. It is extremely difficult to introduce a proper subordination 
amongst a people where so little distinction is kept up. 
</p><p>
Our accounts of the disposition of the Canadians and 
Canada Indians continue to be favorable, though the 
intelligence is nothing very authentic. I am your 
Excellency's 
</p><p>
Obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I do myself the honor to inform your Excellency of my arrival at this place early this morning- and, 
as a person is just going to <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>, I sit down to give you the little information I have procured. 
</p><p>
A Canadian, who twelve days ago left St. John s, advises me that General Carleton has about four 
hundred men at that place ; that he has thrown up a strong intrenchment, covered with chevaux-dc-frise; 
picketed the ditch, and secured it with an abatis; 
that he has an advanced post of fifty men, intrenched a league on this side ; that there are many Indians 
in Canada; but believes neither they, nor the Canadians, will join him; the latter he is sure will not, unless compelled by force. 
</p><p>
You will expect that I should say something about 
this place and the troops here. Not one earthly thing 
for offence or defence has been done ; the commanding 
officer has no orders, he only came to reinforce the garrison, 
and he expected the General. But this, my dear General, 
as well as what follows in this paragraph, I pray may 
be entre nous, for reasons I need not suggest, About 
ten, last night, I arrived at the landing-place at the 
north end of Lake George ; a post occupied by a Captain and one hundred men. A sentinel, on being 
informed I was in the boat, quitted his post to go 
and awaken the guard, consisting of three men, in which he had no success. I walked up and came to 
another, a sergeant's guard. Here the sentinel challenged, but suffered me to come up to him, the whole 
guard, like the first, in the soundest sleep. With a 
penknife only I could have cut off both guards, and 
then have set fire to the block-house, destroyed the 
stores and starved the people here. At this post I 
have pointedly recommended vigilance and care, as 
all the stores from Fort George must necessarily be 
landed there. But I hope to get the better of this 
inattention. The officers and men are all good-looking  people, and decent in their deportment, and I 
really believe will make good soldiers as soon as I 
can get the better of this nonchalance of theirs. 
Bravery, I believe, they are far from wanting. As 
soon as I am a little settled, I shall do myself the 
honor to send you a return of my strength both on 
land and water. 
</p><p>
I inclose to your Excellency a copy of a letter 
from Colonel Johnson, with a copy of an examination of a person lately from Canada, contradictory 
of the accounts I gave you in my last from <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>. You will perceive that he is gone to Canada. 
I hope Carleton, if he should be able to procure a 
body of Indians, will not be in a hurry to pay us 
a visit. I wish to be a little more decently prepared to receive him; in doing which be assured I 
shall lose no time. 
</p><p>
I have no way of sending you any letters, with 
a probable hope of their coming to hand, unless by 
express, or by the circuitous route of <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>; by 
which only I can expect to be favored with a line 
from you. 
</p><p>
Generals Lee and Gates share with you in my 
warmest wishes. I shall devote the first hour I can 
call my own to do myself the honor to write them. 
I am, most sincerely, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Obedient and humble servant,

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Since my last I have been most assiduously employed in preparing materials for building boats to convey me across the Lake. The progress has hitherto been slow, 
as with few hands I had all the timber to cut, mills to repair, to saw the plank, and my draught-cattle extremely weak for want of feed, the drought having 
scorched up every kind of herbage. I have now one boat on the stocks, which I hope will carry near three 
hundred men ; another is putting up to-day. Provisions of the bread kind are scarce with me, and therefore I have not dared to order up a thousand men 
that are at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, lest we should starve here. 
</p><p>
I have had no intelligence from Canada since my last to you. Major Brown has been gone nine days, and I expect him back, if all is well, by Saturday next 
</p><p>
2 August. 
</p><p>
I have not had a return from <a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'>General Wooster</a></a> since my arrival. I am therefore under the necessity of making you a return of the troops here only. 
</p><p>
I inclose your Excellency copies of two affidavits 
made by persons from Canada. I have transmit 
ted other copies to the Congress. 
</p><p>
I am extremely anxious to hear from your part 
of the world. Reports prevail that a body of troops 
have left <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and are gone to Canada. If so, I 
fear we shall not be able to penetrate into Canada, 
or even attack St. John's with success, though at 
all events I am ordered to go there. I am 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient 
</p><p>
and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=pjs" rel="me">PHILIP SCHUYLER</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I wish I could make you a regular return 
even of the troops at this place and Crown Point, but I 
have not yet got these people to be regular in any 
thing, and therefore beg you to dispense with the 
following statement. 
</p><p>
Fit for duty, one colonel, three majors, nine captains, one captain-lieutenant, twenty-one subalterns, 
thirty-four sergeants, eighteen drums and fifes, ninety-three rank and file, one chaplain, two adjutants, 
one quarter-master, one surgeon, and two mates. 
Sick, one lieutenant, four sergeants, two drums, 
one hundred and three rank and file.

</p><p>
I thank you, my dear General, for your very kind 
and polite letter of the 28th ultimo, which I just had 
the honor to receive.
</p><p>
Immediately on my arrival here, I issued such orders 
respecting the provisions and stores, (which I found 
had been most scandalously embezzled or misapplied,) 
as I hoped would effectually have brought matters 
into a right train ; but it is the misfortune of the 
people here, that they do not know how to obey, 
although they should be willing. 
</p><p>
I have therefore directed the Deputy Commissary-General to send up a person, (whom I named and 
knew to be equal to the business,) to examine the 
Commissaries at the several posts on the communication, and to give them such directions as will, I 
hope, introduce regularity in future. Mr. John N. Bleeker is now employed in that essential business. 
</p><p>
With respect to the returns of the army, you will 
see, by the last letter I had the honor to write you, 
that I have had no success in getting them properly 
made, although I have drawn and given them forms, 
which I thought so clear that no possibility of mistaking them remained. 
</p><p>
I foresaw, my dear Sir, that you would have a 
Herculean labor, in order to introduce that proper 
spirit of discipline and subordination, which is the 
very soul of an army ; and I felt for you with the 
utmost sensibility, as I well knew the variety of 
difficulties you would have to encounter, and which 
must necessarily be extremely painful and disgusting  to you, accustomed to order and regularity. I 
can easily conceive, that my difficulties are only a 
faint semblance of yours. Yes, my General, I will 
strive to copy your bright example, and patiently 
and steadily persevere in that line, which only can 
promise the wished-for reformation. 
</p><p>
Since my last I have had a verbal confirmation, by 
one of my scouts, of the intelligence contained in the affidavits which I sent you. I am prepared, with the 
utmost diligence, to obey my orders and move against 
the enemy, unless your Excellency or Congress should 
direct otherwise. In the course of a few days I expect 
to receive the ultimate determination. Whatever it 
may be, I shall try to execute it in such a manner as 
will best promote the just cause in which we are engaged. 
</p><p>
Not a man from this Colony has yet joined me, 
except those I returned to you, and who were raised 
and paid by the Committee of <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>. Nor have I 
yet received those necessary supplies, which I begged 
the <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> Provincial Congress to send me as 
long ago as the 3d of last month, and which the 
Continental Congress had desired them to do. 
</p><p>
The troops here are destitute of tents. They are 
crowded in vile barracks, which, with the natural 
inattention of the soldiery to cleanliness, has already been productive of disease, and numbers are 
daily rendered unfit for duty. 
</p><p>
I am so unfortunate as not to have one carriage for 
field artillery, so that if I am ordered to attack St. 
John s, and am able to get down the Sorel River, I 
shall labor under vast difficulty to bring up the can 
non through a very swampy country. They will be 
few, indeed, as I shall have less than a ton of powder, when the troops are completed to twenty-four rounds a man. 
</p><p>
Congress has appointed Commissioners for Indian 
Affairs. As one of them, I have ordered messengers to be sent into their country, to invite them 
to a conference at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>. I have also requested 
the Caghnawagas to meet me at this place. The 
whole family of the late Sir William Johnson have 
held a line of conduct, that evinces the most inimical 
sentiments to the American cause. Sir John John 
son has had four hundred men, partly Scotch High 
landers, in arms, to protect a scoundrel sheriff, who 
had repeatedly insulted the good inhabitants of that 
country, which at length they retaliated. The inhabitants have, however, drove off the sheriff, and 
made the knight promise he would interfere no further. I should not have hesitated one moment to 
have secured him and his adherents, had I not been 
apprehensive of evil consequences from the Indians. 
I therefore thought it most prudent to advise Congress of the whole matter. 
</p><p>
Although, Sir, I am much in want of men, and 
would wish to have the three New Hampshire companies, mentioned in the copy of your letter of the 
27th ultimo; yet they are so happily posted, either 
to awe the Missisque and St. Francois Indians, or to 
march to the relief of the inhabitants of this Colony, living to the westward of where these troops are 
now posted, on what are commonly called the New 
Hampshire Grants, that in case of an attack from the 
savages I have mentioned, who, if any, are most our 
enemies, I could wish them to remain under orders 
there for that purpose. 
</p><p>
I am extremely happy to learn that you are so well supplied with provisions. I have now a tolerable stock of flour, but very little pork. Fat cattle 
are, however, coming up, so that I do not apprehend we shall suffer in that article. 
</p><p>
My best wishes attend <a href='/results.php?tla=jor' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=jor' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Reed</a></a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='colleague met'>Major Mifflin</a></a>. I am, most respectfully, your Excellency's obedient

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's favors of the 15th and 20th in 
stant were delivered me last night 
</p><p>
I left <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> on Thursday, the 17th instant, 
and hoped to have returned in four days ; but, on 
my arrival at <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>, I received information, that a 
large body of Indians of the Six Nations were to be 
here on Tuesday last, and that my presence Avas indispensably necessary. I therefore attended, and on 
Wednesday the congratulatory ceremony was performed, and on Friday the treaty, agreeably to their 
request, was opened by them, by giving an answer 
to the messages that had been sent them by the 
Committee of this place. In this speech they anticipated part of what we had in charge to deliver them. 
Being (as we conceived) apprehensive that we should 
request them to take up arms in our cause, they explicitly declared, that, as it was a family quarrel, 
they would not interfere, but remain neuter, and hoped we would not desire more of them. 
</p><p>
We have not got above half through what we are directed to say to them, and, although 1 hardly know 
how to leave them, yet such is the nature of the intelligence contained in the papers, which I do myself 
the honor to inclose to your Excellency, I consider myself under the necessity of leaving the Indian business to my colleagues, and repairing immediately to the army. 
</p><p>
That Governor Carleton and his agents are exerting themselves to procure the savages to act against 
us,, I have reason to believe from the various accounts which I have received, but I do not believe 
he will have any success with the Canada tribes, 
though I make no doubt that he is joined by some 
of the more remote Indians, who, I believe, will assist him as scouts from St. John s. I should, there 
fore, not hesitate one moment to employ any Indians 
that might be willing to join us. 
</p><p>
I thank your Excellency for the honor you have 
done me in communicating to me your plan for an 
expedition into Canada. The inclosed information of 
fires, which corroborates not only the information of 
Major Brown (that contained in the two affidavits), 
but every other we have had, leaves not a trace of 
doubt on my mind, as to the propriety of going into 
Canada, and to do it has been my determined resolution (unless prevented by my superiors), for some 
time; and I have, accordingly, since my arrival here, 
requested <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a> to get every thing in 
the best readiness he could, for that I would move 
immediately, weak and ill-appointed as we were; 
and I learn with pleasure, that he has, since the receipt of Griffin's information, ordered the cannon to 
be embarked, and he will probably be off from <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> so soon, that I shall only be able to join him 
at Crown Point. Such being my intentions, and such 
the ideas I have formed of the necessity of penetrating  into Canada without delay, your Excellency will, 
easily believe that I felt happy to learn your intentions, and only wished that the thought had struck 
you sooner. The force I shall carry is far short of 
what I could wish. I believe it will not exceed 
seventeen hundred men, and this will be a body in 
sufficient to attempt Quebec with, after leaving the necessary detachments, (at St. John s, Chamblee, and 
Montreal, should we succeed and cany those places,) which would be respectable to keep an open and free communication with Crown Point, &c. 
</p><p>
Having now given your Excellency the time, force, 
and latest intelligence I have had, together with my 
opinion of the sentiments of the Canadians, I proceed 
to inform you of the enemy's strength, as far as I 
have been able to learn it; three hundred and fifty 
or four hundred at St. John s; one hundred and fifty 
or two hundred at Chamblee ; about fifty at Montreal; and one company at Quebec. These are regular troops, besides between three hundred and five 
hundred Indians, Scotchmen, and some few Canadians 
with Colonel Johnson at La Chine. Of this party the 
Indians that are at St. John's are a part. Whether 
any ships of war are at Quebec, I cannot say. As 
none have been mentioned to me, I am rather inclined to believe there are none. Should the detachment of your body penetrate into Canada, and we 
meet with success/ Quebec must inevitably fall into 
our hands. Should we meet with a repulse, which 
can only happen from foul play in the Canadians, I 
shall have an opportunity to inform your party of it, 
that they may carry into execution any orders you 
may give, in case such an unfortunate event should 
arise. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will be pleased to be particular 
in your orders to the officer that may command the 
detachment, that there may be no clashing, should 
we join. 
</p><p>
I shall leave orders at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> to forward all the lead that can be spared. 
</p><p>
Excuse these scraps of paper. Necessity obliges me to use them, having no other fit to write on. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to make my compliments to the gentlemen of your suite. <a href='/results.php?tla=jor' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=jor' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Reed</a></a> will be so good 
as to excuse my not answering his letter, as I really cannot find time. I am, dear Sir, with the most respectful sentiments, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's obedient humble servant,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I arrived here last night, and immediately received 
orders for sending you the lead (my former ones 
not having- come to hand). It will leave Crown 
Point this afternoon, and be forwarded without loss 
of time to you. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a> leaves Crown Point to-day, 
with twelve hundred men and four twelve-pounders. 
I follow him this evening, and have ordered the 
whole strength I can spare to join me at Isle aux Noix without delay. When they arrive there, which 
I hope will be in five days, I shall then be near 
two thousand strong. I am still of opinion that the 
Canadians and Indians will be friendly to us, unless 
[for] the imprudence of a Captain Baker, who, without 
my leave, went upon a scout, and, contrary to the 
most pointed and express orders, seeing some people 
in a boat that belonged to us, attempted to fire on 
them, but, his gun missing, he was instantly shot 
through the head and expired. His party consisted 
of five men, and the other of an equal number, one 
of which, an Indian, was only seen to paddle away. 
</p><p>
I will neither detain your Excellency, nor waste 
my time (which is precious) in giving you a detail 
of the many wants I labor under. I hope they will 
serve for an evening chat at some future day. 
</p><p>
You would have cause to blame me for not sending  a return of the forces under my command, but I 
cannot get one that may in the least be depended 
upon. I know the reason, but so critical is my 
situation, that I sacrifice every thing to the grand 
object. I have sent on only six ; but I have 
</p><p>
promised not to complain. Adieu, my dear General. 
I am, with the most respectful sentiments,

the papers, of which a copy is inclosed.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
The day after I did myself the honor to write your Excellency from <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, I set out for this place and arrived here on the 30th ultimo, much 
indisposed with a bilious fever. Next day I followed <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a>, whom I overtook on the 4th instant at the Isle-la-Motte, he having "been 
detained by adverse winds and rainy weather. On 
that day we moved on to Isle-aux-Noix, twelve miles 
south of St. John s. On the 5th I drew a Declaration, (but was so ill that it is not such as I could 
wish, a copy of which you have inclosed,) which I 
sent into Canada by Major Brown and Mr. Allen; 
and as we judged that going to St. John s, weak as 
we were, (our numbers not exceeding one thousand, 
and the little artillery we had not come up,) might 
have a good effect on the Canadians and encou 
rage them to join us, we resolved upon the measure, 
and landed our baggage and provisions, except for 
four days, and early on the 6th embarked, and, with 
out any obstructions, proceeded towards St. John s. 
When we arrived in sight of it, and at the distance 
of about two miles, the enemy began to cannonade, 
but did us no damage. We approached half a mile 
nearer and then landeH without opposition, in a close, 
deep swamp, which extended to very near the fort. 
Here we formed, and marched in the best order 
we could towards the fort, to reconnoitre. Major 
Hobby, of Waterbury s, with a detachment flanked 
the left wing, and was something advanced before 
the main body, when he was attacked, in crossing a 
deep muddy brook, by a party of Indians, from 
whom he received a heavy fire; but our men pushing  on, they soon gave way and left us the ground. 
In the rencounter we had a sergeant, a corporal, 
and three privates killed, and one missing ; eight privates wounded, three of whom died the ensuing 
night; Major Hobby shot through the thigh, Captain 
Mead through the shoulder, and Lieutenant Brown in the hand. These gentlemen are all out of danger. Night coming on, and the swamp being almost 
impassable, we drew our men together, and east up a 
small intrenchment to defend ourselves in case of an 
attack in the night. In the evening a gentleman, 
Mr. (whose name I can only mention to your Excellency, not having even ventured it to the Congress, and therefore beg you to erase the scored part of the letter after persual,) came to me and 
| gave me the following account; "That there were 
no regular troops in Canada, but the twenty-sixth 
regiment; that all these, except fifty at Montreal, 
were at St. John's and Chamblee ; that there were 
then at St. John's about one hundred Indians, and 
that there was a considerable body with Colonel 
Johnson; that the fortifications were complete and 
strong, and plentifully furnished with cannon; that 
the vessel was launched, and had one mast in and 
the other ready to raise; that she would be ready 
to sail in three or four days, and is to carry six 
teen guns; that he does not believe that our army 
will be joined by one Canadian; that they wish 
to be neuter on the occasion, but if we should 
penetrate into Canada, it would not displease them, 
provided their persons and properties were safe, and 
w r e paid them in gold and silver for what we had ; 
that in the situation we were in he judged it 
would be imprudent to attack St. John s, and advised us to send some parties amongst the inhabit 
ants, and the remainder of the army to retire to 
the Isle-aux-Noix, from whence we might have an 
intercourse with Laprairie. He told me that in 
the afternoon's engagement five Indians were killed 
and four badly wounded, besides several others the 
condition of whose wounds he did not know, and Captain Tyce, of Johnstown, who was "badly wounded in the belly." 
</p><p>
On the 7th, in the morning, (having "been undisturbed through the night excepting by a few shells, 
which did no other damage than slightly wounding  Lieutenant Mills,) I called a council of war 
of all the field officers present, to whom I communicated the information I had received, and in 
close a copy of their opinion, which, being perfectly consonant to my own, I immediately ordered the troops to embark, and we retired. 
</p><p>
On my return to Isle-aux-Noix I immediately 
began to fortify the place, and to throw a boom 
across the channel, until my artillery should come 
up. On the 9th I received a letter from Canada, 
without signature, but which I knew to be writ 
ten by Mr. James Livingston (copy inclosed). As 
I had through other channels a collaboration of 
the intelligence contained in the former part of his 
letter, I resolved, as I had not yet iny artillery, 
to detach five hundred men into Canada, and gave 
orders on the 9th for their embarkation on the 10th, 
with an additional number of about three hundred, 
to cover their landing and bring back the boats. 
(Copy of my instructions to the commanding officer 
inclosed.) 
</p><p>
For the event of this intended expedition, see the paper which was drawn and delivered me by 
one of the party, and, from what I can learn, is just. 
</p><p>
This body returned on Monday, the 11th. On 
Tuesday, the 12th, I found I had upwards of six 
hundred sick, Waterbury's regiment being reduced 
to less than five hundred. <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a> (for 
I was too ill to leave my bed) perceived, however, with pleasure, that the men were unable to 
bear the reproach of their late unbecoming behaviour ; and, taking advantage of this happy return 
to a sense of their duty, on the 13th I issued the orders contained in the paper Number Six. The 14th proved rainy, and retarded the embarkation of the cannon. On this day Colonel Allen 
arrived and made the report, Number Seven; and I 
found myself so much better that I had hopes of 
moving with the army, but by ten at night my 
disorder reattacked me with double violence, and 
every fair prospect of a speedy recovery vanished. 
Great part of the 15th rainy, the embarkation 
much retarded by it. On the same day I received 
the letter of which Number Eight is a copy. On 
the 16th I was put into a covered boat, and left 
Isle-aux-Noix ; and as it rained part of the day, I 
do not suppose that <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a> could 
move until the 17th, which proved fair. 
</p><p>
The mode of the intended attack on St. John s, 
as judged best both by <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a> and 
myself was as follows; to land as near the fort 
as we did the first time we went down ; the two 
row-galleys carrying a twelve-pounder each, and well 
manned; the sloop and schooner and ten bateaux 
with picked men, to lay in the river, ready to 
attack the enemy's schooner (which is complete and 
carries sixteen guns) in case she should attempt 
to destroy our boats, or get to the southward of 
them, and thereby effectually cut off all communication between this place and the army. After 
this naval arrangement (which will take three hundred and fifty men), five hundred men to be sent 
as a corps of observation to intercept any succours 
between St. John's and Chamblee, and to keep as 
near the former as possible; two hundred men at 
the proposed landing to cover the boats and secure 
a retreat for the men in the vessels and boats, 
should the enemy's vessel [intercept them] ; the remainder of the army to invest the place, make the 
approaches, and erect the batteries. 
</p><p>
You will perceive, by Number Five, that some of 
the enemy's boats fired on our people. Captain 
Douglas, who commands one of our armed boats, 
pointed and fired a twelve-pounder, loaded with ball 
and grape-shot, at them, and we have accounts that 
about thirty of the unfriendly Canadians were killed 
or drowned. In the first engagement, on the 7th, 
we killed them six Indians, two Caghnawagas, as 
many Mohawks, (Daniel, and Williani, a bastard 
son of Sir William Johnson s,) one Connasadago, 
and one Huron; and w j e are informed, by a Caghnawaga and Huron whom I left at Isle-aux-Noix, 
that not an Indian remained at St. John s, and 
which I believe to be true. Four deputies, who 
were sent by the Six Nations, and left Isle-aux-Noix 
on the 10th, to request the Canadian Indians to remain neuter, were not returned when I left Isle-aux-Noix. I have taken the liberty to desire General 
Montgomery to make a present, in the name of the 
Congress, to the Canadian Indians, if he should 
think it necessary. 
</p><p>
Since the affair of the 10th, the army at Isle-aux-Noix, which then consisted of thirteen hundred and 
ninety-four effectives, all ranks included, has been 
reinforced by Captain Livingston's company of New 
Yorkers, nearly complete; on the 16th, by Colonel 
Warner, whom I met, an hour after my departure 
with one hundred and seventy Green Mountain Boys 
(being the first that have appeared of that boasted corps) ; he left this with about fifty more, "but they 
mutinied, and the remainder are at Crown Point. 
Captain Allen's company, of the same corps, arrived 
here last night, every man of which was raised in 
Connecticut. About one hundred men of Colonel 
Bedel's, from New Hampshire, (his corps was to 
have been up a fortnight before, the remainder, one 
hundred and fifty of that body, were yet to come) 
joined, the 16th, at night; and I suppose the artillery company, under Captain Lamb, will join them 
to-day. These last were indispensably necessary, as 
we had none that knew r any thing of the matter; so 
that the whole reinforcement consists of about four 
hundred. Yesterday I sent off sixty of Easton s, and 
one hundred and forty more are just embarking; 
this is the whole of that corps. About one hundred 
and twenty-five, of the first <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> battalion, will 
embark early to-morrow, together with the company 
of Green Mountain Boys, consisting of about seventy. 
</p><p>
Two hundred and sixty, of the third <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> battalion, remain here, which I will forward on as 
soon as I can procure craft, which is building slowly, as most of the carpenters are gone home sick. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letter, of the 8th instant, I received yesterday. I am happy to learn that the 
troops under the command of <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Arnold</a></a> were to march so soon. I hope our people will commit 
no depredations in Canada; all possible care will be taken of it; but yet I have many fears on that 
score, as they stole thirty-two sheep at Isle-aux-Noix, contrary to the most pointed orders. 
</p><p>
Be assured, Sir, that I shall not fail of giving you 
the most early intelligence of every occurrence worthy your attention. 
</p><p>
I find myself much better, as the fever has left 
me, and hope soon to return where I ought and 
wish to be, unless a "barbarous relapse should dash 
this cup of hope from my lips. 
</p><p>
The number of sick is incredible, and I have 
very little assistance to afford them. I wish I could 
make you a return of the army under my command; but I cannot get one; a great deal of foul 
play is carrying on. 
</p><p>
I am indebted to General Lee and <a href='/results.php?tla=jor' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=jor' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Reed</a></a> 
for a letter, but I am too feeble to write. Be 
pleased to assure them of my respect, and be so 
good as to make my compliments acceptable to all 
the gentlemen of your suite. I am, dear Sir, your 
Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and most

Humble servant,

SIR, 
</p><p>
I did myself the honor to address you in a long 
letter of the 20th, which I hope will come safe to 
hand. 
</p><p>
The day before yesterday I was favored with a 
letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a> (copy of which in 
closed), on the contents of which, and on the report 
of the Indian deputies, I do myself the pleasure to 
congratulate your Excellency. I have made some 
explanatory notes on <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a>'s letter, 
which I conceived might be necessary for you. I 
made a short speech to the Indian deputies, gave 
them a present, and they left me in high good humor, 
and with a very good opinion of our army. 
</p><p>
The vexation of spirit under which I labor, that a 
barbarous complication of disorders should prevent me 
from reaping those laurels for which I have unweariedly wrought, since I was honored with this command ; the anxiety I have suffered since my arrival 
here, lest the army should starve, occasioned by a 
scandalous want of subordination and inattention to 
my orders, in some of the officers that I left to command at the different posts ; the vast variety of 
disagreeable and vexatious incidents, that almost every 
hour arise in some department or other, not only 
retard my cure, but have put me considerably back 
for some days past. If Job had been a General in 
my situation, his memory had not been so famous for 
patience. But the glorious end we have in view, 
and which I have confident hope will be attained, 
will atone for all. 
</p><p>
I have discharged, or ordered to be discharged, 
every man that was so ill as to be rendered unfit for 
further service during this campaign, and that was 
able to return to the place of his abode. Those that 
were not, I have sent to the hospital. The former 
already amount to seven hundred and twenty-six, as 
per the inclosed return. 
</p><p>
My best wishes attend your Excellency and the 
gentlemen with you. I am, dear Sir, with the most 
sincere esteem, 
</p><p>
Your very obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I did myself the honor to write your Excellency 
on the 26th ultimo, which I sent by the way of 
<a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>. On the 4th instant I received the originals 
of the inclosed, except that marked Number Two, 
which came to hand yesterday. It chagrins me much, 
that I have not more frequent opportunities of ad 
dressing myself to you. 
</p><p>
I am extremely apprehensive that a want of powder will be fatal to our operations. I have sent Express to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, but have not yet learnt whether I shall be supplied or not. 
</p><p>
The army is now supplied with provisions to the 30th instant, but all the pork that is to be had is 
gone ; and although we have a sufficiency of fat cattle, I fear we shall want salt. 
</p><p>
I inclose your Excellency a return of the discharged men from this army. Exclusive of this, one 
hundred and fifty, at least, occupy the general hospital at Fort George, and I fear as many more are ready to enter it. 
</p><p>
I begin to gather strength ; my fever has left me, 
and I hope soon to be able to join the army. <a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'>General Wooster</a></a>'s regiment, I suppose, will be this even ing at Fort George ; they will be pushed off immediately on their arrival here. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to make my best respects to General 
Lee, <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a>, and the gentlemen of your suite. 
I hope we shall all meet at a merry Christmas. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear General; my best wishes attend 
you through life, happy if I can have an opportunity 
of evincing how sincerely I am, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
At two, this afternoon, an express from General 
Montgomery arrived at this place. Copy of his 
letter, with copies of the papers it inclosed, I do 
myself the honor to transmit your Excellency by express. The irresistible force of necessity having 
drove us to arms, success cannot be attended without 
pleasure ; and, therefore, I congratulate your Excellency on the good account these papers contain. 
The reduction of Chamblee will, in all probability, be followed by that of St. John s, especially as <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a> has now a supply of powder, of which 
he stood in such need, that a very few days more would have expended his all. 
</p><p>
I wrote your Excellency that I should not .send 
on <a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'>General Wooster</a></a> ; but, as his regiment refused to 
go without him, I was obliged to suffer him to go. 
But, lest any detriment should accrue to the service, 
I thought it proper to write him a letter, of which I 
inclose a copy, as also a copy of his answer. 
</p><p>
I am in hopes that the next accounts I receive 
will announce the arrival of <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Arnold</a></a> (whose 
success seems now certain), and the reduction of St. 
John s. I have requested <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a> to 
send me an express, as soon as he receives any 
certain intelligence from <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Arnold</a></a>. As I can 
easily conceive that your Excellency's anxiety must 
be extreme, I shall forward what intelligence I receive by express. The great dread I was in, lest we 
should suffer for provisions, induced me to have all 
brought up that could be got; and it was very lucky, 
as the late heavy rains have carried away almost all 
the bridges between Fort George and <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, and 
rendered the roads impassable, in which state they 
will continue at least a week hence. 
</p><p>
I am, dear Sir, with the best wishes for your health, 
your happiness, and prosperity, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient humble servant,

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's favor of the 26th ultimo I had 
the honor to receive on the 3d instant. 
</p><p>
I have long since signified to Congress the necessity of a delegation from them to this place ; and in 
their last to me, of the 12th ultimo, they (unfortunately for me) say that it did not appear necessary 
then. I took the liberty to lament, that they were not in sentiment with me on the subject, and to add 
that I thought it absolutely necessary that one should be sent, so that I hope soon to see some of the gentlemen here. A variety of regulations are necessary 
to be made in this quarter; a task to which I feel 
myself greatly inadequate, but which, if I had even 
judgment enough to arrange with propriety, the shattered condition of my constitution is such, that matters so momentous as these should not be left to so 
precarious an event as that of my being able to sup 
port the fatigue ; for <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a>, though 
endowed with shining abilities, will have his time 
so totally engrossed with other matters, that he will 
not be able to attend to these. 
</p><p>
Should success crown our endeavours at St. John s, 
of which there seems to be little doubt, the entire 
reduction of Canada will, in all probability, be the 
consequence; an event which will open new scenes. 
An army to be formed and properly disposed of in 
that quarter - y provisions, ammunition, and every necessary to be procured for it; preparations to be made for the next campaign; proper places to be 
determined on, and fortifications to be erected, to 
defend that Province against any attacks that may 
be made on it in the ensuing year ; small craft to 
be constructed here, that a reenforcement may be 
speedily sent into Canada, in case it should be 
found necessary to support what troops may be stationed there ; galleys, carrying heavy artillery, to 
prevent vessels of force from coming up the St. 
Lawrence ; a mode of government to be adopted in 
a country, where all will be anarchy and confusion 
without it; and probably a variety of other interesting regulations to take place, that do not just now occur to me. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will do me the justice to believe that I feel, in the most sensible manner, the favorable opinion you are pleased to entertain of 
me ; and I am confident <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a> will not be less affected on what you observe of him. I do myself the pleasure, this day, to write that 
gentleman, and shall convey to him your best wishes and respects. 
</p><p>
The vast benefit that would result from a successful conclusion of the campaign in this quarter, 
has been so deeply impressed upon me, that I have often regretted that the operations were not commenced at an earlier period, and, when commenced, 
that so much tardiness prevailed in sending up the necessary stores and troops. That you, my dear General, should feel an anxiety to induce you to ask 
those questions, which you have done in so polite and friendly a manner, is what I can easily suppose. 
</p><p>
The difficulties, under which <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a> has labored, have been in the extreme, and which he 
most pathetically laments in a letter to me of the 13th ultimo, an extract of which I do myself the 
honor to inclose your Excellency, together with the 
opinion of a Council of War held on that day, and 
which I forgot to transmit you in the hurry with 
which I sent off my last. And in his letter of the 
23d ultimo he says ; " Our reinforcements not yet 
arrived ; at this instant I have not in my camp 
above seven hundred and fifty men, and I wish much 
to send a strong detachment to the Island of Montreal " ; a manoeuvre which would have taken place sooner, had it been in his power, or been prudent to 
have gone into ; neither of which I think it was, and 
shall beg leave to make the following observations in 
support of this opinion. 
</p><p>
At no period, until this, has it appeared to me 
that it would have been prudent to have passed St. 
John s, although a sufficient force could have been 
left for forming a blockade ; for [it would have been 
hazardous] previous to the reduction of Chamblee, and 
the success of our troops in repulsing the attack of 
Monsieur Regouville, who was sent from Montreal 
with two hundred and forty men, and expected to 
be joined by the inhabitants of three of the most 
populous parishes on the south side of the St. Lawrence, in which he was disappointed to a man, and 
which has in some measure evinced the temper of the 
Canadians towards us, and given us better assurances 
than any we have had of their friendly disposition, 
for until then their real sentiments were problematical ; and about this time, too, we sunk their best 
armed vessel, so that we can now spare more men for 
an attack upon Montreal, which, if not prevented by 
other obstacles, was <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a>'s intention, 
as soon as the reenforcement above alluded to should 
arrive, which took place on the 26th or 27th, and 
consisted of <a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'>General Wooster</a></a> s, of three hundred and 
thirty-five, and Major Tuthill, of Colonel Holmes s, 
with two hundred and twenty-five, officers of both 
included. In the numbers, however, he will be Disappointed, as <a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'>General Wooster</a></a> had returned four 
hundred and eighty-four effectives from <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, but 
discharged ninety-nine between this and <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, and 
left fifty-one sick here ; and the others, too, fell greatly 
short of what I expected 
</p><p>
If a blockade had been formed before the above-mentioned events took place, it must have been sufficiently strong, not only to have guarded against the 
danger of a sortie, but to have prevented the enemy's armed vessels, which greatly surpassed ours in 
strength, from getting to the southward of us, and 
thereby effectually cutting off every possibility of retreat ; which, if they had been able to accomplish, 
the Canadians, I do firmly believe, would immediately 
have joined Mr. Carleton. But if a sufficient body 
had been left, that to -make the attempt on Montreal 
would have been too weak for such a service ; and 
if they had met with a repulse, the Canadians, in 
that case, would not have hesitated one moment to 
have acted against us, (as Colonel Allen, in his report to me, observes,) and all our hopes in Canada 
would have been at an end. But another difficulty 
presented itself, and which I do not know how the 
detachment which <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a> proposed to 
send, or has sent, will even now surmount, the want 
of craft to convey a body of troops, sufficient to promise success, to the Island of Montreal, across the 
St. Lawrence, (which is deep, rapid, and wide,) as 
no craft can pass the fort at St. John's to go down 
the Sorel; which obstacles would be immediately removed on the reduction of that fortress, which I hope has taken place by this time, and then I shall have 
the fullest confidence that our labors will be at an end in this quarter, except from what difficulties may arise 
from the intemperate desire our people have to return to their habitations; my fears on which account I have expressed to Congress. 
</p><p>
If we had passed it wholly, and could have got to and succeeded against Montreal, St. John's would undoubtedly have fallen. But what a vast risk ! No less than that of the loss of the whole Army, the command of Lake Champlain, <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, and Crown 
Point ; for no retreat could possibly have taken place ; the dependence on the Canadians uncertain. And if they had found us incapable of passing to Montreal 
for want of boats, or of retreating on the same ac count, it is certain we should have found them opposed to us. 
</p><p>
In this view of things, I hope it will be thought that either attempt would have been injudicious. 
</p><p>
I do myself the honor to inclose you sundry Extracts of my letters to Congress, with extracts of 
their answers, by which your Excellency will perceive that I have hinted at several things, which I 
conceived claimed the attention of Congress. I in 
close you, also, a list of the officers made prisoners 
at St. John s. The return of the non-commissioned 
officers and privates is either mislaid or by mistake 
inclosed to <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Governor Trumbull</a></a>. 
</p><p>
Be so good as to assure the gentlemen of your 
family that they have my best wishes. I have the 
honor to be your Excellency's

MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The evening before <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a> landed on 
the Island of Montreal, Mr. Carleton embarked his 
garrison on board of some vessels and small craft, and 
made two attempts to pass our batteries, near the 
mouth of Sorel, but was drove back by Colonel Eas-ton, who has behaved with bravery and much alertness. On the 19th, Mr. Carleton, disguised en Canadian, and accompanied by six peasants, found means to 
make his escape. Brigadier-General Prescott surrendered next day by capitulation. What terms General 
Montgomery has given him, I do not know, as he 
was so hurried, in preparing to move immediately to 
Quebec, that he could not find time to send them. 
Prescott and the officers arrived here at four to-day. 
I have just received a return of the officers, men, 
vessels, and stores taken, which I do myself the honor 
to inclose. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's favor, of the 16th of November, I 
received two days ago. I believe some cannon and 
mortars may be spared ; but none, except what I have 
sent across Lake George, can be got down until that 
or this lake freezes over. I have a very fine thir-teen-inch mortar here, and I will make a push to get 
her over the Lake. But where will you get shells ? 
We have none here. 
</p><p>
Mr. Livingston, Mr. Langdon, and Mr. Paine, arrived 
here at seven this evening. The season was so far 
advanced that I could not wait the orders of congress upon sundry matters, which appeared to me 
absolutely necessary to be carried into immediate execution. I am, however, happy to find, that every 
measure I have pursued corresponds with the instructions given to the Committee. 
</p><p>
I am informed that Prescott has used poor Walker and Allen with a shameful brutality. Of this I 
shall acquaint <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Governor Trumbull</a></a>, to whose Colony 
I shall send him. 
</p><p>
I believe our army in Canada consists of about one 
thousand and nine hundred men, including Colonel 
Arnold's corps. I have suggested to Congress, that 
I thought it necessary that they should be completed 
to three thousand, in the course of the winter, that 
they may be ready, early in the spring, to put Quebec (of which I make no doubt we shall possess our 
selves) into a proper state of defence, to prevent the 
enemy from regaining that important place. I have 
added, that I thought it necessary that preparation 
should be made here to throw in a reenforcement 
early in the spring, if they should be wanted. 
</p><p>
I expect to leave this in a few days for <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>. 
I am, Sir, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
I do not hesitate a moment to answer my dear 
General's question in the affirmative, by declaring 
that now or never is the time for every virtuous 
American to exert himself in the cause of liberty 
and his country ; and that it is become a duty cheer 
fully to sacrifice the sweets of domestic felicity, to 
attain the honest, and glorious end America has in 
view; and I can, with a good conscience, declare, 
that I have devoted myself to the service of my 
country, in the firmest resolution to sink or swim 
with it, unanxious how I quit the stage of life, provided that I leave to my posterity the happy reflection that their ancestor was an honest American. 
</p><p>
Here, my dear Sir, you will ask, why then do you 
wish to retire from a public office ? Not because I 
am deterred by any difficulties I have experienced, 
or any that might hereafter present themselves ; for I 
have had repeated experience, in the course of life, 
that what the greater part of mankind deem impossibilities exist only in idea, and are surmountable by 
a steady perseverance ; but, because I think I should 
prejudice my country by continuing any longer in 
this command. The favorable opinion that you are 
pleased to entertain of me, obliges me to an explanation, which I shall give you in confidence. I have 
already informed you of the disagreeable situation I 
have been in during the campaign, but I would 
waive that, were it not that it has chiefly arisen 
from prejudice and jealousy; for I could point out 
particular persons of rank in the Army, who have 
frequently declared that the General commanding in 
this quarter ought to be of the Colony from whence 
the majority of the troops came. But it is not from 
opinions or principles of individuals that I have drawn 
the following conclusion, that troops from the Colony 
of Connecticut will not bear with a General from an 
other Colony. It is from the daily and common conversation of all ranks of people from that Colony, 
both in and out of the army; and I assure you, that 
I sincerely lament that a people of so much public 
virtue should be actuated by such an unbecoming 
jealousy, founded on such a narrow principle, a principle extremely unfriendly to our righteous cause, as 
it tends to alienate the affections of numbers in this 
Colony, in spite of the most favorable constructions 
that prudent men, and real Americans amongst us, 
attempt to put upon it. And, although I frankly 
avow that I feel a resentment, yet I shall continue to sacrifice it to a nobler object, the weal of that 
country in which I have drawn the breath of life, 
resolved ever to seek, with unwearied assiduity, for 
opportunities to fulfil my duty to it. 
</p><p>
I shall to-morrow write to <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a> to collect the evidence in support of the charge against Prescott, and entreat him to be very particular. As 
the prisoners taken on board the vessels in the St. Lawrence are not yet passed, it is probable that I may, by their means, be able to furnish your Excellency with some accounts of the usage Allen received. 
</p><p>
Since the receipt of your Excellency s, of the 18th, Major Rogers is come to this town. I sent to him, and, amongst a variety of passes, he produced a late 
one from the Committee of New Hampshire, to pass unmolested to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, for which place he sets out to-day. I believe there is no truth in the intelligence sent by Mr. Wheelock ; for I find, upon inquiry, that Rogers arrived -at this place after St. John's was invested, and that he went from hence to New 
England. I shall, however, make further inquiries. I shall forward the account against Captain Morgan to <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Arnold</a></a> by next post. 
</p><p>
You will perceive, by the inclosed, that the junction of <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Arnold</a></a> has 
taken place ; but their force is so small, and the weather has been so severe, that I fear they have not been able to possess themselves of Quebec. Should 
an attempt have been made to storm it, and have proved fruitless, and accidents have happened to Montgomery and Arnold, I tremble lest Canada should be 
lost. If I could procure any men, I would send them to Canada immediately; but I know not where to get any. Even <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> and Fort George are 
by this time, I fear, left to the care of the Commissary of Provisions and Conductor of Artillery. The 
officers, to whom I had issued warrants to raise four 
companies, meet with no success. 
</p><p>
The first of the cannon arrived here on Wednesday, and the whole is on its way, but detained by 
the weakness of the ice in Hudson's River, occasioned by the uncommon mildness of the weather for several days past. One frosty night, if not deferred too 
long, will, however, put every thing in order, and I hope you will soon have the pleasure of seeing all at <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>. 
</p><p>
To-morrow thirteen of the Caghnawaga tribe, under the care of Major Wales, will set out for <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a> on a visit. 
</p><p>
Your letter to General Howe gave me great pleasure, and his answer must convince mankind of your 
superiority. His affectation is trifling, and unbecoming a gentleman. His letter, I believe, will be eventually a censure on General Carleton. 
</p><p>
I shall immediately forward to your Excellency 
what clothing can be spared from here ; great part 
of it is not yet made up. 
</p><p>
Sunday, January 7/7?. Yesterday a frost came on, 
and this morning I had the satisfaction to see the 
first division of sleds, with cannon, cross the river. 
Should there be snow all the way to <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>, they 
will probably arrive there about this day week. 
</p><p>
A Mr. Gamble, who was made prisoner with Brigadier Prescott, and who was a Deputy-Quartermaster-General in Canada, has entreated me to intercede 
with your Excellency to get him exchanged. He urges that he must be ruined unless he can get back 
to Canada. Although I by no means wish to prejudice an individual, yet I do not think it prudent 
that he should go to Quebec, unless it is in our possession. When that happens, I can see no inconveniency in exchanging him, or permitting him to go, 
and shall esteem it as a favor if he can then procure your leave, and if you can get him exchanged, that he may riot lose his office. lie writes to General 
Lee on the subject. I have expressly informed him that I did not think he could be permitted to go to Quebec until after its reduction. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to accept the compliments of the season, and my best wishes. I have the honor to be, 
with unfeigned esteem, your Excellency's most obedient, and 
</p><p>
Most humble servant,

I wish I had no occasion to send my dear General this melancholy account. My amiable friend, the gallant Montgomery, is no more ; the brave Arnold is 
wounded; and we have met with a severe check in an unsuccessful attempt on Quebec. May Heaven be graciously pleased that the misfortune may terminate 
here ! I tremble for our people in Canada ; and no thing, my dear Sir, seems left to prevent the most fatal consequences, but an immediate reinforcement 
that is nowhere to be had but from you; and the only route, that which I have pointed out in my letter to Congress, copy of which you have inclosed. 
Nor do I think that a less number than I have mentioned will suffice. Should your Excellency think proper to send the troops, you will please to let me 
know it by express, that I may send provisions to Onion River.
</p><p>
Congress has wrote to me on the subject of my request to retire. Our affairs are much worse than when I made the request. This is motive sufficient 
for me to continue to serve my country in any way I can be thought most serviceable; but my utmost can be but little, weak and indisposed as I am. The 
clothing is gone to <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>.

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Yesterday I had the honor to receive your favor 
of the 3d instant, by Bennet, who overtook me on 
my way to this place. All is in readiness to move, 
as soon as the Lakes open, which, I hope, will be in 
a day or two. General Thomas is here, six companies of Burrell's regiment from Connecticut, two 
companies of the First Pennsylvania Battalion, and 
three of the New Jersey. The remainder of these 
corps arc gone on, whereof two companies are about 
forty-five miles below Crown Point; the rest have 
reached Canada, We have also here two companies 
of Van Schaick s, of this Colony; and five companies 
of the Second Pennsylvania Battalion are at Fort 
Edward, waiting for the Lake to open, as I have no 
quarters for them at this place. The remainder of 
Van Schaick's are not yet raised; and two companies 
of the First Pennsylvania Battalion are on their way 
from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
</p><p>
I should be extremely happy, my dear General, to 
pay my devoirs to you at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>; but I do not 
see a possibility of quitting this quarter, without risking  all in Canada. Unless some other general officer 
should relieve me, I shall, therefore, presume to remain, unless I receive your further orders. 
</p><p>
Four o clock, P. M. This moment the post from 
Canada is arrived. I inclose you copies of all the 
papers I received. The intelligence they afford is so 
alarming., that I beg leave to repeat my wish that a 
considerable body of troops should be immediately 
sent up. 
</p><p>
I have stopped the courier at this place, and he 
goes back immediately to advise our friends in Canada, that the troops now here will soon be in 
Canada; and I have presumed to add, that they will 
be followed by three or four thousand more. This 
intelligence will keep up their spirits, and intimidate 
our enemies. 
</p><p>
I have, heretofore, observed to your Excellency, 
that I had never received a return of the army in 
Canada. I am, on that account, still incapable of let 
ting you know the strength of our army there. I am 
equally in the dark with respect to the arrangement 
made in officering the two regiments that were to 
be raised out of the troops that wintered there. 
</p><p>
The provisions at these posts are very trifling. 
None of what General Lee has contracted for is 
come to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>; and, unless a speedy supply is sent 
up, our troops in Canada must suffer. I have written 
on this subject to General Thompson before I left 
<a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>; and although I make not the least doubt 
but that he will forward it, if he can, yet I beg 
leave to mention it, lest he should forget to mention 
it on the arrival of his superior officer at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
</p><p>
I am seized with a copious scorbutic eruption, 
which I have frequently experienced, and imagined 
it threw off some other more disagreeable disorder. 
I believe it will not confine me, or prevent me from 
doing my duty. I am, dear General, most sincerely, 
Your obedient, humble servant,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
The letter, which I had the honor to write you 
y ester day, I delivered to <a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'>General Wooster</a></a>, who sailed 
this day. 
</p><p>
I have, within this half hour, received a letter from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>General Arnold</a></a>, of which the inclosed is a copy. I 
fear the next will announce the evacuation of Canada by our troops, probably with loss, as I fear that 
not a sufficient attention has been paid to a recommendation of mine, to bring all the bateaux, that 
could possibly be spared from Sorel, to St. John s. I 
shall immediately despatch an express to Fort George 
to send bateaux to St. John's ; but, after all, the 
number will be very small, for want of men to navigate them. I suppose one hundred and twenty, at 
least, are at Lake George. 
</p><p>
I am not under the least apprehension that the 
enemy will be able to cross Lake Champlain, provided that our army is able to retreat into that Lake, 
that ammunition is speedily sent up, and a further 
supply of pork forwarded, without delay, to this 
place. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will perceive that <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>General Arnold</a></a> 
informs me, that the enemy have the frames, &c., for 
gondolas on board. We should therefore build a 
number of these vessels, with all possible despatch; 
one is now on the stocks, but we want people that 
understand the construction of them. I have some 
time ago begged Congress to send one, express; let 
me entreat that some more capable persons may be 
sent up, and twenty shipwrights with them. 
As I fear the saw-mills will not be able to saw a 
sufficient number of plank, I wish to have a dozen 
of whipsaws and files sent up with all possible despatch. 
</p><p>
I shall order all the bateaux that do not go to 
St. John's out of Lake George, to <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, that 
they may be ready, at that place, to be sent to 
Skenesborough, to convey the militia,, should they be 
sent up. I am, with every respectful sentiment, your 
Excellency's

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
About an hour ago <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>General Arnold</a></a>, who is arrived 
here from Canada, sent me a letter from General 
Sullivan, inclosing one from <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>General Arnold</a></a> to him, 
another from Colonel Ilazen, and a third from Lieu 
tenant-Colonel Antill, copies of all which I do myself 
the honor to inclose. The grief I feel on the evacuation of Canada by our troops, is greatly alleviated by the little loss sustained in the retreat, and the 
hope I have, that we shall maintain a superiority on 
the Lakes. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will observe that <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a></a> 
intimates that further than the Isle-aux-Noix he could 
not retreat, without your Excellency's or my orders, 
previous to which he observes, that the Council of 
War were unanimous for coming to Crown Point. I 
do not hesitate to say, that I wish he had retreated. 
at least as far south as Point-au-Fer, or Isle-la-Motte, as I am afraid that the enemy will throw 
themselves between him and the broad part of Lake 
Champlain, and render it extremely difficult, if not 
impossible, to send on a supply of provisions, as 
they can with light cannon and even wall-pieces command the waters from shore to shore in most places, 
for six miles south of Isle-aux-Noix, and in many even 
with musketry. 
</p><p>
Did not the danger of remaining there, especially 
with an army broken and spiritless, and who wish so 
much to come further south, that the officers, as <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>General Arnold</a></a> informs me, have already, in a body, 
entreated him to come away, appear to me too great 
to admit of the delay of waiting your Excellency's 
orders, I should not send mine for a further retreat, 
until your pleasure could be known ; but I trust I 
shall be justified in doing it, and yet I believe the 
order will meet the army on this side of Isle-aux-Noix. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to order up six anchors and cables for the gondolas that are constructing, of the size of what is called the small anchor and cable of an <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> sloop. 
</p><p>
I shall immediately write to Governor Trunibull to provide fifty ship-carpenters, if he can, and send for a like number to the Massachusetts Bay. 
</p><p>
If any Dutch mill-saws can be procured at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, be pleased to order up four dozen, with six dozen of files for them. 
</p><p>
Having learned that <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a> is upon his way up, I have ordered a boat down to meet him. I am, dear General, with every sentiment of esteem and respect, your Excellency's

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
On Friday evening I received a line from <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a></a>, a copy whereof I have the honor to inclose. By the contents your Excellency will perceive, that 
we have reasons to believe his next will announce his arrival at Crow r n Point. 
</p><p>
Yesterday morning <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a> introduced a Mr. 
Avery to me, who applied to me for money to carry 
on the Commissary-General's department here. I asked if Mr. Livingston was superseded, and begged to 
see how he (Avery) was authorized to act here. He 
showed me a commission from <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Mr. Trumbull</a></a>, the 
Commissary-General, with instructions annexed, appointing him Deputy-Commissary in Canada, and the 
instructions were correspondent to such appointment. 
I told him his commission did not, by any means, 
supersede Mr. Livingston s, and until that was done, 
I must consider Mr. Livingston as the Deputy-Commissary-General here, and that all warrants for money to carry on that department here must he drawn 
in his favor, unless <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Mr. Trumbull</a></a> himself was present. 
</p><p>
He assured me that it was <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Mr. Trumbull</a></a>'s intention that he (Avery) should have the sole management, and that Mr. Livingston was only to be considered as a contractor. I sent for Mr. Livingston, 
who produced a letter of the 25th instant from Mr. 
Trumbull, directly contradictory to what Mr. Avery 
had asserted ; upon which he declared that <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Mr. Trumbull</a></a> had informed him, that Congress had given him full 
power to make any arrangement he thought proper, 
and displace whom he pleased, and that it was his 
intention, by giving him (Avery) that commission, to 
supersede Mr. Livingston. To which Mr. Livingston 
answered, that, although <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Mr. Trumbull</a></a> had 110 power 
to remove him unless authorized so to do by congress, as he held his commission immediately from 
that body, yet, if <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Mr. Trumbull</a></a> had expressed any 
such intention, he would immediately resign, and he 
would put the question to <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Mr. Trumbull</a></a>. I observed 
to Mr. Avery that nothing in his commission, or the 
instructions annexed, authorized him to say what 
he did; that <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Mr. Trumbull</a></a>'s letter to Mr. Livingston 
flatly contradicted it; that if he remained with the 
army, provided it was not in Canada, he must be 
subordinate to Mr. Livingston, and obey his orders, 
which he chose not to do, and is now going down. 
</p><p>
I advised him to remain until the affair was deter 
mined, and candidly told him that I should try to keep Mr. Livingston in the employment if he chose 
it, because, admitting that their abilities and integrity 
were perfectly equal, Mr . Livingston's conduct had 
met my approbation, and that his great family connections in this county had enabled him to carry on 
the service, when others could not have done it, of 
which I gave instances. <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a> was present, 
and acquiesced in the propriety of what I observed. 
I was, therefore, greatly surprised to be informed, 
that he should tell Mr. Avery that he had nothing 
to say here, but that as soon as he came to the army he would employ him. I say I was greatly surprised, because <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a> knew that the army 
was no longer in Canada, and because I did not 
know that he then claimed a right to control my 
orders with respect to the army, even if it should be 
at Crown Point ; nor could I imagine he thought so, 
as your Excellency's instructions to him gave, as I 
conceive, not the least color for it. Your last letter 
to me holds up a contrary idea, and so does every 
resolution of Congress hitherto transmitted to me ; 
but that <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a> conceived, and still does, that 
the army is immediately under his command, I had, 
a very few hours after, the most convincing proof of, 
as your Excellency will observe from the inclosed 
paper, which I hastily drew up immediately after the 
discourse, and which I desired <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a> to read, 
that no misunderstanding might arise for want of recollecting what had been said, and which he acknowledges contains the substance of what passed between us. 
</p><p>
By your Excellency's instructions to <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a>, 
he is empowered to appoint a Quartermaster-General 
in Canada. I observed, this morning, that I believed 
it was founded on a supposition that Colonel Camp-bell was then about quitting Canada, for that I could 
not imagine that an officer being "ordered to congress to settle his accounts" deprived him of his employments ; that Colonel Campbell was originally appointed to this department/ and that Canada now 
being made a separate one, and the command of it 
given to <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a>, he could., under the powers 
he had, appoint whom he pleased to act there; but 
that, . unfortunately for us, the evacuation of that 
country by our troops had taken place, and that I 
must and should consider Colonel Campbell as the 
Deputy Quartermaster-General on this side of Canada. 
</p><p>
If Congress intended that <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a> should 
command the Northern army, wherever it may be, 
as he assures me they did, it ought to have been 
signified to me, and I should then have immediately 
resigned the command to him ; but until such intention is properly conveyed to me, I never can. I 
must, therefore, entreat your Excellency to lay this 
letter before Congress, that they may clearly and Explicitly signify their intentions, to avert the dangers 
and evils that may arise from a disputed command; 
for, after what <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a> has said, the line must 
be clearly drawn, as I shall, until then, stand upon 
punctilios with <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a>, that I would otherwise 
with pleasure waive ; but that the service may not 
be retarded, nor suffer the least from a difference of 
opinion between <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a> and me, I have deter 
mined to remain here, although I had, before this 
affair came to light, mentioned to him my intentions 
of going up with him. 
</p><p>
As both <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a> and myself mean to be 
candid, and wish to have the matter settled without 
any of that chicane which would disgrace us as officers and men, we have agreed to speak plain, and 
to show each other what we have written to you 
upon the occasion ; and he has accordingly read the 
whole of what I have above said. . 
</p><p>
Since writing the above, <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a> has shown me the resolutions of Congress of the 17th ultimo, which confirm me in the opinion I have entertained, 
that he was only to command the army in Canada, and that I had no control upon him when there.
</p><p>
Your Excellency may be assured of my best exertions to prevent the enemy from penetrating into these Colonies. <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a> is in sentiment with 
me on the mode ; that of increasing our naval strength, and fortifying some advantageous spot on the east side of Lake Champlain, either opposite to 
<a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, or between that and Crown Point. 
</p><p>
Part of the militia from this Colony is marched up ; none of the others are yet moved. Their tardiness will greatly distress us, as we have much, very much, to do, and few men to do it with. 
</p><p>
The cannon sent by <a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='colleague'>Colonel Knox</a></a> arrived yesterday; and, although the Indians have deferred the treaty to the middle of this month, yet I have thought it advisable to take post at Fort Stanwix ; 
and all the stores are moving from here to-day, and will, I hope, leave Schenectady on Wednesday morning. The Commissioners of Indian Affairs have prepared a message to the Six Nations, giving the reasons why we take post at Fort Stanwix. This will, however, not be sent until every thing is so far advanced that there may be no danger in coimnimbating to them my intentions. 
</p><p>
Should the enemy advance, and we be under the 
necessity of calling forth the militia nearest to us, 
we shall be at a loss for ball and buckshot. I wish, 
therefore, to have twenty-five rounds a-piece for ten 
thousand men sent up the soonest possible, if it can 
anywhere be procured, with a proportionate quantity 
of cartridge-paper, and two tons of oakum. 
</p><p>
If any cutlasses, stinkpots, and handgrenades can 
be got, I beg they may also be sent for the use of 
our armed vessels. 
</p><p>
One hundred thousand of the dollars brought up 
by <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a> are ordered to the army; better 
than half of the other are already expended, nor 
will any be left in two or three days. 
</p><p>
Mr. Duane informed me, and gave me leave to 
make use of his name, that the five hundred thou 
sand voted by Congress the 22d of May for this department, were actually charged, and he fears that 
they may have met with some accident on the way up. 
</p><p>
I have ordered the silver to be kept in chests, except about three thousand pounds, which we borrowed here, and must now be repaid. 
</p><p>
Four o clock, P. M. I am this moment favored with your Excellency's letter of the 27th ultimo, in closing a copy of a resolution of Congress of the 
24th. I have immediately an opportunity of forwarding copies thereof to <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Governor Trumbull</a></a> and Mr. Edwards. The latter has already received one month's 
advance wages for the Stockbridge company, which, 
I suppose, is by this time paid to them, as he in 
formed me that they were to be here on Wednesday 
or Thursday next. I am afraid it will give great 
umbrage, if they are immediately discharged; but, as 
the order is positive, I dare not presume to defer 
complying with it. I shall, however, request Mr. Ed 
wards to do it in a manner that will give the least 
offence. 
</p><p>
I wish Colonel Francis and Colonel Wolcott were 
immediately ordered up to attend the conference at 
the <a href='/results.php?city=german flats' rel='city'>German Flats</a> on the 15th instant, as I propose 
going to Crown Point to-morrow, having, upon further 
consultation with <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>General Arnold</a></a> 
since writing the foregoing, determined upon it; and 
this journey may detain me so long as to prevent 
my attendance, in which case there will be only two 
Commissioners present. 
</p><p>
I am, dear General, most respectfully, your obedient, humble servant,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
At half after ten, this morning, I received a letter 
from <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a>, copy whereof I inclose your Excellency. 
</p><p>
As it is most probable the enemy are attempting 
to cross the Lake, I have therefore thought it necessary to apply to the neighbouring counties of the New 
England States, and those of Ulster and Duchess in 
this, to order their militia to march up. As soon 
as they arrive, I shall either move with what part 
may go to the northward, or with those to the west 
ward, as may be most necessary. This can, however, 
only be determined by farther intelligence from <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a> and Colonel Dayton, which I momently 
expect to receive. 
</p><p>
The cartridge-paper arrived here on the 2d instant, was sent forward on the 3d, and arrived at Fort 
George on the 5th, at night, and was probably for 
warded from thence on the 6th. 
</p><p>
I am informed that the army is in the greatest 
distress for medicines. As every misfortune and want 
they labor under is imputed to me, so is this. I am 
heartily tired of abuse, and was in hopes that congress would have ordered an inquiry into my conduct. I requested it, most earnestly, on the 16th of 
last month, but have not yet been honored with an 
answer. I will no longer suffer the public odium, 
since I have it most amply in my power to justify 
myself, and shall therefore resign my commission as 
soon as I return from <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, or Try on county. 
Of this I shall advise Congress, that orders may be 
given for a General Officer to reside in this place, 
without which the service will suffer. But, in doing 
this, I shall never forget the duty I owe to my country ; and if I can, by advice or any other means, promote the weal of it, none will do it with more ala 
crity. I am, dear Sir, with every sentiment of esteem 
and respect, your Excellency's

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I do myself the honor to inclose your Excellency 
a letter to Congress, under flying seal. The variety 
of affairs, which claim my attention, does not permit 
me time to communicate to your Excellency and 
Congress, separately, such information as it may be 
necessary both should know. You will, therefore, 
please to excuse the mode I take. 
</p><p>
Our numbers are so few to the northward, and we 
have so little prospect of their increasing, that should 
a disaster befall us at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, Ave should have 
very few troops indeed to oppose them. If the enemy should make an attempt to penetrate into the 
country, I shall probably be under the necessity of 
calling for assistance from <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>. Perhaps your 
Excellency may think proper to lodge an order with 
the commanding officer to comply with my requisition, 
if I should make one, ascertaining the number you 
may think proper to spare. Be assured that I shall 
not ask any aid, as long as there is a possibility of 
doing without. 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 11th of May, to <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a>, 
was this day delivered to me by Brigadier-General 
Learned. The clothing for Colonel Shepherd's regiment, if at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, will be immediately sent 
down. I am, dear Sir, with the sincerest esteem,

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I did myself the honor to address you from Sara 
toga on the 14th instant. On the next day, Ams-bury and Adams (mentioned in <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague met'>General St. Clair</a>'s 
letter, copy whereof I transmitted to Congress by 
letter under cover to your Excellency) arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>. What passed between us, and what information he gave, is noted in paper Number One. Number Two is the letter which was inclosed between 
the bottoms of the canteen. 
</p><p>
If the information which Amsbury gives is to be 
relied upon, as I think it is, we shall soon be air 
tacked at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> ; and although I think the 
force now there may be sufficient to hold that import 
ant post, yet I have no troops to oppose either Sir 
John Johnson, if he should penetrate to the Mohawk 
River, or any to prevent the communication between 
this and Fort George from being cut off; nor have I 
force, if these should not be attempted by the enemy, 
to march to the relief of <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>. In this situation, I am under the necessity of applying to your 
Excellency for a reenforcement. 
</p><p>
From the time I left <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> till my return to 
that place, nothing, comparatively speaking, has been 
done towards throwing into <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> a stock of 
provisions of the meat kind ; and of the little that is 
left there, I fear to learn that a very considerable 
part is damaged ; and what is equally bad, if not 
worse, is, that we have very little hopes of a supply 
of fresh meat. A week or two may remedy the 
latter, but it may then be too late to convey a quantity to <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>. If, therefore, any salted pork 
or beef can be spared from <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>, or elsewhere, 
I wish it may be ordered up, without the least delay. 
</p><p>
Should your Excellency order me a re enforcement, 
permit me to suggest, that, if there are no vessels 
at <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> or <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a> to transport the troops to 
<a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, it may be proper, by express, to direct the 
commanding officer at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> to send down from 
thence a sufficient number of sloops. 
</p><p>
Such is the inattention, in this department, that 
not less than a thousand barrels of flour are now 
lying at this post, and only five wagons employed to 
carry it to Fort George, the distance of fifteen miles. 
</p><p>
Permit me to beg that your Excellency will communicate the contents of this despatch to Congress, 
as I cannot find time to do myself the honor to 
write to them. 
</p><p>
I shall (consulting with the General Officers at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>) try to send an answer to Mr. Levius's 
letter, as from <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a></a>, in which I shall 
leave him to suppose (what I do not by any means 
believe) that <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a></a> has entered into his 
views. Your Excellency will please to mention my 
intention to <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a></a>, and to assure him that 
my only view is to serve the public. I am, dear

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's favor of the 20th instant I had 
the honor to receive at <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>, in the evening of 
the 26th. I am this moment favored with a letter of the 
25th instant from <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague met'>General St. Clair</a>, copy whereof I 
herewith transmit. Should an accident happen to the 
garrison of <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, and <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'><a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a></a> make 
a push to gain the south part of the Lake, I know of 
no obstacle to prevent him. Comparatively speaking, 
I have not a man to oppose him; the whole number 
at the different posts at and on this side of the Lake, 
including the garrisons of Fort George and Skenes-borou^h, not exceeding seven hundred men, and these I cannot draw away from their several stations, 
in every one of which they are already much too 
weak. It is therefore highly necessary that a strong 
reenforcement should, without delay, be sent me. If 
the sloops are not yet sent to bring the troops your 
Excellency has ordered to be kept in readiness at 
<a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>, I shall push them off without delay. 
</p><p>
As it is not probable that we shall in time be 
supplied with field-pieces from the eastward, I must 
entreat that the reinforcements may bring some up 
with them. 
</p><p>
I have this moment also received a letter from Mr. 
Deane, the Indian Interpreter, an extract whereof I 
inclose to you. As the information tallies exactly with 
what I had before, it leads me to conclude that an 
irruption will be made from the [westward]. 
</p><p>
I shall apply for the aid of the militia of this and 
the neighbouring States, but I fear it will not be very 
powerful, as many must be necessarily left at home. 
</p><p>
I have received a letter from the Commissary-General, which I think neither so temperate or decent as it should be. I shall take the first leisure 
hour to transmit you a copy, with my answer, in which, I believe, it will be evinced from authentic 
returns, that the scarcity of provisions in this department is, in a great measure, if not altogether, to be 
imputed to a want of attention in the persons whose duty it was to supply this department. I am, dear 
Sir, with great regard and esteem, Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=pjs" rel="me">PHILIP SCHUYLER</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I have sent an express to <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a></a> 
to hasten on the troops your Excellency had ordered 
to be in readiness for this quarter. 
</p><p>
Since writing the above I have received another letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague met'>General St. Clair</a>, a copy whereof is in 
closed. I am in pain about Fort George, but have no troops to throw in, and some time will necessarily 
elapse before the militia can be got to march.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Soon after I had despatched the letter, which I did 
myself the honor to address to your Excellency from 
Stillwater, I met with Lieutenant-Colonel Hay, deputy Quartermaster-General, who was at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>. 
lie informs me, that on Saturday it had been agreed 
upon to retreat from <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> and Mount Independence ; that between two and three o clock on 
Sunday morning, <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague met'>General St. Clair</a>, with the rest of 
the General Officers, and the army, marched out of 
the lines at Mount Independence ; that Colonel Long, 
with about six hundred men, embarked on board our 
few vessels, and in. bateaux; that, just before they 
arrived at Skenesborough, they were overtaken by 
the enemy's vessels and gunboats, and were obliged 
to abandon the vessels, in which we lost all our am 
munition. Indeed, Colonel Hay assures me that not 
one earthly thing has been saved. 
</p><p>
The troops under Colonel Long arc arrived at Fort 
Ann. Where <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague met'>General St. Clair</a> is, with the main 
body, I have not yet learnt. Colonel Hay imagined 
he would come by the way of Skenesborough. If so, 
he will fall in with the enemy, who have taken possession there. Captain Dantignac, who is just arrived here, confirms Colonel Hay's account, except 
as to <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague met'>General St. Clair</a>, who he understood was to 
march to Number Four. This is not likely. I have 
despatched an officer to meet <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague met'>General St. Clair</a>, and 
requested that he should march, by the shortest route, 
to Fort Edward. As I have related the above from 
memory, I may have omitted some, and misapprehended other circumstances/ 1 
</p><p>
It is impossible to say what post we shall take. It depends on the route the enemy mean to pursue. 
My prospect of preventing them from penetrating, is not much. They have an army flushed with victory, 
plentifully provided with provisions, cannon, and every 
warlike store. Our army, if it should once more collect, is weak in numbers, dispirited, naked, in a manner, destitute of provisions, without camp equipage, 
with little ammunition, and not a single piece of cannon. In this situation, it is of the most urgent necessity, that your Excellency should afford me a 
very respectable reinforcement, besides that now coming up under Brigadier-General Nixon ; for it will be impossible for me to keep the militia together any 
time in a country very thinly inhabited, in which they cannot find shelter, and must lie out exposed to the weather. 
</p><p>
As the Continental troops have lost every thing, 
your Excellency will please to order up to me, the 
soonest possible, tents for four thousand men, five 
hundred camp kettles, a quantity of fixed musket 
ammunition, cartridge-paper, twelve pieces heavy can 
non, with travelling carriages, sixteen field-pieces, and 
a considerable quantity of ammunition for them ; a 
competent number of artillerymen, in addition to 
Major Stevens's corps, so as to be sufficient to man 
age the artillery; all the implements necessary to 
the artillery, horses, harness, and drivers; about six 
hundred intrenching tools, sorted, excluding pickaxes, 
of which we have a considerable number. Please 
also to send me a good engineer or two. I am, dear 
Sir, with great respect and esteem,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Since I wrote you from <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>, I have not been 
able to learn what is become of <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague met'>General St. Clair</a> 
and the enemy. The army followed the troops that 
came to Skenesborough as far as Fort Ann, where 
they were yesterday repulsed ; notwithstanding which, 
Colonel Long, contrary to my express orders, evacuated that post, I am here, at the head of a handful of men, not above fifteen hundred, without provisions, little ammunition, not above five rounds to 
a man, having neither ball, nor lead to make any; 
the country in the deepest consternation ; no carriages to move the stores from Fort George, which I 
expect every moment to learn is attacked. And 
what adds to my distress, is, that a report prevails 
that I had given orders for the evacuation of <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, whereas not the most distant hint of such an 
intention can be drawn from any of my letters to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague met'>General St. Clair</a>, or any other person whatever. 
I am informed, from undoubted authority, that the 
garrison was reenforced with twelve hundred men at 
least two days before the evacuation, and that eighty 
head of cattle had got in, and a number of sheep. 
What could induce the General Officers to a step 
that has ruined our affairs in this quarter, God only 
knows. 
</p><p>
By the information of some of the prisoners I 
learn, that the enemy have already a brigade on the 
w r ay from Skenesborough to this place. General Nixon's is not yet come up ; but, if it does, we shall 
still be too weak to make any capital opposition. I 
will, however, throw as many obstructions in the enemy's route as possible. A party is parading to fell 
trees across the road between this and Fort Ann, to 
take up all the bridges, drive off all the cattle, and 
bring away the carriages. 
</p><p>
I inclose your Excellency a proclamation of <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'><a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a></a>, which he has caused to be industriously 
spread through the country, and, I fear, will be at 
tended with the most evil consequences to us. I am, 
dear Sir,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
On the 12th instant <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague met'>General St. Clair</a> arrived here. 
As he fell in with Hudson's River about twelve 
miles below this, I ordered the troops to halt at Fort 
Miller, having no kind of shelter for them at any 
other place, and not even a sufficiency of boards at 
that. What the number is that have arrived I have 
not yet been able to learn, as the greatest confusion 
imaginable prevails here. <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague met'>General St. Clair</a> supposes 
about fifteen hundred. Nor can I say what militia 
are in this quarter. I do not, however, suppose that 
our whole strength, in this department, exceeds four 
thousand five hundred men. 
</p><p>
Colonel Warner, with the remains of his regiment, 
I have ordered to remain on what are commonly 
called the New Hampshire Grants, together with the 
militia from that part of this State. He has direction. to drive off all the cattle and carriages; but 
whether he will be able to effect it is a doubt, as I 
am informed a very great proportion of the inhabit 
ants are taking protections from <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'><a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a></a>, as 
most of those in this quarter are also willing to do. 
</p><p>
Two regiments of the militia from, the State of the 
Massachusetts, under the command of Learned and 
Wells, who were sent up to supply, in part, the deficiencies of the other regiments from that State, are, 
to a man, gone home. 
</p><p>
General Nixon arrived the night before last, with 
his brigade. From the slowness with which they 
moved from <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> to this, being four days marching  forty-six miles, I was led to conclude that they were a formidable body; but to my great mortification, I find the whole to consist of five hundred 
and seventy-five, rank and file, fit for duty, and eleven sick. Several of these are negroes, and many 
of them young, small, and feeble boys. Desertion 
prevails, and disease gains ground ; nor is it to be 
wondered at, for we have neither tents, houses, barns, 
boards, or any shelter, except a little brush. Every 
rain that falls, and we have it in great abundance 
almost every day, wets the men to the skin. We 
are, besides, in great want of every kind of necessaries, provisions excepted. Camp-kettles we have so 
few, that we cannot afford above one to twenty men. 
Although we have near fifteen tons of powder, yet 
we have so little lead, that I could not give each 
man above fifteen rounds; and although I have saved 
about thirty pieces of light artillery, yet I have not 
a single carriage for them, so that my whole train 
of artillery consists of two iron field-pieces, which General Nixon brought up with his brigade. 
</p><p>
I have, indeed, written to Springfield for the can 
non which were there ; but the answer I got was, that 
they were all ordered another way. I have also 
written for a variety of articles to that place and to 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> ; not that I expect any thing will be sent me, 
but that I may stand justified, for I have never yet 
been able to get much of any thing from thence. 
In this situation I have only to look up to your Excellency for relief ; and permit me to entreat you to 
send a reenforcement of troops, and such a supply 
of artillery, ammunition, and every other necessary, 
except provisions and powder, as an army ought to 
have, if it can possibly be spared. 
</p><p>
An express has passed through the country from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'><a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a></a> to General Howe. The latter will, probably, on receipt thereof, immediately move up Hudson's River. 
</p><p>
I inclose your Excellency copy of the proceedings 
of a Council of General Officers, held at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, 
a copy of which I beg you will transmit to congress, and be so good as to mention that I have not 
time to do myself the honor to write them. It contains the principles on which the evacuation of that 
fortress took place. 
</p><p>
If the enemy will permit us to pass unmolested, 
three days longer, to Fort George, I shall be able to 
bring away all the stores from thence, and then draw 
off the few troops we have there. 
</p><p>
Yesterday, accompanied by the General Officers and 
engineers, I examined the country, and found a very 
defensible spot about four miles below this, to which 
place we are this day moving part of the army, and 
our stores. I propose remaining here until Fort 
George is abandoned, and as much longer as the 
enemy will permit me. 
</p><p>
General Nixon, with his brigade, supported by 
about six hundred militia, is advanced to Fort Ann, 
to fell trees into Wood Creek, and into the road 
from Fort Ann to this place. I have also stationed 
a body of militia about five miles on this side of 
Fort George, to cover the retreat of the garrison 
now at that place. 
</p><p>
We are informed that part of the enemy are still 
at Skenesborough, and that a body is coming by the 
way of Lake George. I hope it will not be very 
soon. Adieu, my dear Sir; and believe me, unfeignedly, and with great respect, 
</p><p>

DEAR, SIR, 
</p><p>
I am honored with your favor of the 24th instant, 
which I received half an hour ago, having just arrived 
from Moses Creek, where I keep my quarters. 
</p><p>
So far from the militia that are with me increasing , they are daily diminishing, and I am very confident that in ten days, if the enemy should not Disturb us, we shall not have five hundred left ; and although I have entreated this and the Eastern States 
to send up a reenforcement of them, yet I doubt much 
if any will come up, especially from the Eastern 
States, where the spirit of malevolence knows no 
bounds, and I am considered as a traitor. 
</p><p>
I believe your Excellency has spared me all the 
troops you prudently could, but we are still too weak 
in this quarter, especially as sickness decreases us 
with great rapidity. Our men living entirely upon 
fresh meat occasions much disease. Salt meat we 
have none of, nor is any to be got in this quarter. 
If it can be spared from any post below, I wish a 
quantity may be ordered up. 
</p><p>
I have informed you that, on the 26th, an advanced picket was attacked near Fort Edward. Last night 
a body of regular troops appeared at that place, how 
ever not in such force but that they suffered our 
men, about one hundred and fifty in number, to come 
off unmolested. I believe their main body will be 
down in a few days. We are preparing to receive 
them in the best manner we can. 
</p><p>
I shall be happy to see <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a></a>. He may 
possibly be able to do something with the New T England militia. 
</p><p>
I do not think it would be prudent, at present, to 
send <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>General Arnold</a></a> to Fort Schuyler. I will try to 
send another General Officer to that place. I am, dear 
Sir, with great regard and esteem,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
By the unanimous advice of all the General Officers, I have moved the army to this place. We propose to fortify our camp, in hopes that re-enforcements will enable us to keep our ground, and prevent the enemy from penetrating further into the 
country. But if I should be asked from whence I 
expect reinforcements, I should be at a loss for an 
answer, not having heard a word from the Massachusetts on my repeated applications ; nor am I certain 
that Connecticut will afford us any succour. Our 
Continental force is daily decreasing by desertion, 
sickness, and loss in skirmishes with the enemy ; and 
not a man of the militia, now with me, will remain 
above one week longer. And whilst our force is diminishing, that of the enemy augments by a constant 
acquisition of Tories ; but if we, by any means, could 
be put in a situation of attacking the enemy, and 
giving them a repulse, their retreat would be so 
extremely difficult that, in all probability, they would 
lose the greater part of their army. I am, dear 
General, most respectfully, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to congratulate your Excellency 
on a signal victory gained by General Stark over a 
detachment of about fifteen hundred of the enemy 
near Bennington, on the 16th instant, an account 
whereof I have this moment received in a letter from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a></a>, of which the following is a copy. 
</p><p>
"Bennington, August 18th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1777" rel="origin">1777</a>. Dear General, 
the late signal success of a body of about two thou 
sand troops, mostly militia, under the command of 
Brigadier-General Stark, in this part of the country, 
on the 16th instant, over a party of about fifteen 
hundred of the enemy, who came out with a manifest design to possess themselves of this town, as 
will appear by the inclosed, is an event happy and 
important. Our troops behaved in a very brave and 
heroic manner. They pushed the enemy from one 
work to another, thrown up on advantageous ground, 
and from different posts, with spirit and fortitude, 
until they gained a complete victory over them. 
</p><p>
" The following is the best list I have been able 
to obtain of the prisoners, their killed and wounded, 
namely : One Lieutenant-Colonel, one Major, five Captains, twelve Lieutenants, four Ensigns, two Cornets, 
one Judge-Advocate, one Baron, two Canadian officers, 
and three Surgeons, thirty-seven British soldiers, three 
hundred and ninety-eight Hessians, thirty-eight Canadians, and one hundred and fifty-one Tories taken. 
The number of wounded fallen into our hands, Exclusive of the above, is about eighty. The number of their slain has not yet been ascertained, as they 
fought on the retreat for several miles in a wood, 
hut supposed to he about two hundred. Their artillery, which consisted of four brass field-pieces, with a 
considerable quantity of baggage, likewise fell into 
our hands. We have heard nothing of Burgoyne, or 
his army, for these two days past. The prisoners 
have been sent into the State of Massachusetts Bay, 
except the Tories. Shall wait your direction respecting  them, as most of them belong to the State of 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. We have now about two thousand at or 
near this place. 
</p><p>
" I am, dear General, with regard and esteem, 
"Your very humble servant, 
</p><p>
" BENJAMIN LINCOLN." 
</p><p>
"N. B. We had about twenty or thirty killed in 
the action, and perhaps fifty wounded." 
</p><p>
I also inclose copy of <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'><a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>'s</a> orders to Lieutenant-Colonel Baum, which were transmitted to me with the above. 
</p><p>
I have great hopes that we shall soon have the satisfaction of learning, that <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>General Arnold</a></a> has raised the siege of Fort Schuyler. <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a>, I am
