Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I embrace the opportunity which is offered me by 
Colonel Hughes to acknowledge the receipt of your 
Excellency's favor of the 10th instant, and most sincerely sympathize with you on the embarrassments 
which the disagreeable event in Jersey will occasion you. It is an awful lesson to the States ; and if it 
would produce a serious attention to their situation; 
if it would induce to greater exertions, and hence relieve you from the variety of difficulties which their 
torpor has occasioned you if it would evince the necessity of parting with so much of their sovereignty, 
respectively, as would enable the governing power to 
draw forth the strength and resources of the country, â€” the event would be happy to America. But, if 
only alarmed for the moment, and no adequate means 
are pursued for the future subsistence and pay of 
the army, our cause is lost, unless another system of 
 government is adopted. 
</p><p>
Impressed with the necessity of lodging competent 
powers somewhere, to prosecute the war with vigor, 
and finding a disposition in the Legislature to second 
my views, I have moved, in Senate, to request of the 
Eastern States to join in a Convention, to be held at 
an early day, for the purpose of settling and adjusting every difference which may exist with respect to 
boundaries ; to form a perpetual league of incorporation, subservient, however, to the common interest of 
all the States ; to invite others to accede to it ; to 
create a new State in this quarter, on conditions to 
be stipulated in such Convention ; to appreciate the 
most effectual means for prosecuting the war with 
vigor; to devise a fund for the redemption of the 
common debts ; to form a permanent and uniform 
system for drawing out the resources of the country, 
that we may not be incessantly exposed to the many 
evils incident on temporary expedients ; and, lastly, 
to invest Congress with powers so extensive as to 
oblige each State to do its duty. 
</p><p>
This motion is not yet decided upon ; but I believe it will not meet with much, if any, opposition 
ill either House. Mrs. Schuyler joins me in best 
wishes to you, Mrs. Washington, and the family. I 
am, dear Sir, your 
</p><p>
Most obedient and affectionate humble servant, 
</p><p>

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's obliging favor of the 23d of last 
month I had the pleasure to receive on the 31st following. It was exceedingly mortifying to me, that 
the Senate was so thin of members when your lady 
honored us with a visit, that my attendance could 
not be dispensed with, even for a day. I was, consequently, deprived of affording that attention which 
inclination, esteem, and the most friendly feelings, 
impelled me to. She saw my embarrassments, and, 
with a good nature and complaisance which at once 
charmed and captivated, made every allowance. 
</p><p>
The motives which led Congress to postpone filling 
the War department have leaked out, and been communicated to me. <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> was in nomination; 
but his friends, reflecting that the impropriety of appointing him before he had exculpated himself from 
the imputation of misconduct in his command, would 
be too glaring an abuse of power, deferred it, in 
hopes that, by an acquittal, the public confidence will 
be restored to him. But surely the gentlemen who 
intend him the office, neither consult his reputation 
nor the public interest. Not the former, because his 
inability to discharge it will certainly draw disgrace 
on him ; nor that of the latter, for, if even he was 
competent, he ought to be precluded, as the inveterate enmity which he bears to you, and which will 
influence him the more for being groundless, will lead 
him, without hesitation, to reject or thwart the most 
salutary measures you may propose. Gracious God! 
How much it is to be lamented that rulers, charged with the affairs of an empire, will sacrifice the best 
interests of their constituents to little, narrow-minded 
prejudices, and local politics, favorable only to their 
unworthy sycophants ! That they will close their eyes 
to the evident advantages which would result from 
choosing men to fill the great offices of the State, 
who have a mutual confidence in each other, and will 
give mutual support to every measure calculated to 
promote the public weal. The man in question, I 
fear, will also embarrass the Financier ; for he has not 
the least idea of public economy in his composition, 
nor do I believe that they entertain much esteem for 
each other. 
</p><p>
I most sincerely lament that a plan so judiciously 
formed as that you mention in conj&dence, should be 
defeated by those who would have reaped so much 
credit from the success which would, in all human 
probability, have ensued, and the glory of having 
rendered so essential a service to the allied powers.'' 
My heart realizes your feelings on the occasion, and 
cordially sympathizes with yours. You have the 
weakness of some, and the wickedness of others, to 
encounter; obstacles and embarrassments to surmount, 
which blunderers, with one object, and without system, daily create, as well as those vvdiich unavoidable 
accidents and events, which none can foresee, occasion. But I trust the day is rapidly advancing, when 
an astonished world will know what it would be improper to communicate now, and feel what they ought, 
an increase of gratitude, that best affection of the 
human heart. 
</p><p>
May your next despatches from the southern quarter relieve you from the disagreeable situation 
which the torture of doubt and suspense occasions, 
and announce some capital advantage over the enemy. Mrs. Schuyler and my daughter join me in affectionate regards to you and your lady. Be pleased 
to make my compliments acceptable to Colonel Harrison, and the other gentlemen of your family. I 
am, vith great esteem and regard, 
</p><p>
And most affectionately, &c., 
</p><p>

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Agreeably to your Excellency's order in August 
last, <a href='/results.php?tla=jac' rel='colleague'>Brigadier-General Clinton</a> left me a guard of one 
sergeant, one corporal, and eleven privates, chiefly 
aged and infirm men. He has lately ordered these 
to he reduced to a corporal's guard. It is now a 
notorious fact, that three parties have been expressly 
sent from Canada to take or put me to death. Captain Brownson, lately returned from Canada, a Mr. Shephard, of Tryon county, a Mr- Mott of <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>, and others who have made communications to 
the Commissioners for detecting conspiracies, all agree, 
that the British are determined to get me into their 
possession. The imprudence of the Commissioners for 
detecting conspiracies, to whom, in order to save a 
person employed by me, I was under the necessity 
of communicating some secret matters, which have 
been divulged, has rendered the enemy's inveteracy 
still greater ; and I am persuaded that, even with my 
former guard, I shall run some risk both in person 
and property, and that, without such a one, I must 
remove myself and family to a place of greater security. I have, therefore, to entreat your Excellency 
the favor of an order to <a href='/results.php?tla=jac' rel='colleague'>General Clinton</a>, to recomplete the guard, as he left it in August last. 
</p><p>
Yesterday, I received advice that the people on 
the Grants had generally assembled in town meetings, had declared their apprehensions that a criminal 
intercourse prevailed between some of their people 
and the British, and determined on an examination 
of the conduct of the suspected persons; and had, by 
a great majority of the towns, voted that a relinquishment should be made of their late extended 
claim, both on the east and west. The latter part of 
this intelligence is this moment confirmed to me, in 
such a manner that I have not a doubt remaining of 
its truth; and I have reason to believe that the former part is not without foundation. With every wish, 
which affection and esteem can inspire, 
</p><p>
I am, my dear Sir, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
