SIR, 
</p><p>
In the letter, which I had the honor to address 
your Excellency on the 15th ultimo, from <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>, 
I proposed personally to have explained myself to 
Congress on the subject of the appointment of the 
21st of January last. But reflecting that, notwithstanding the entire confidence I entertain in the honor 
and candor of every individual member of Congress, 
it is nevertheless possible, that, through want of perspicuity in expressing myself, or misapprehension in 
others, what I may verbally deliver on the subject 
may be unintentionally construed, or repeated, in a 
manner widely different from my intentions, this 
consideration indus me to convey my determination 
in writing. 
Every reflection. Sir, I have made, since the receipt of your Excellency's letter of the 24th January 
last, on the appointment mentioned in it, has con 
firmed the conclusion I very early drew, that I could 
not, consistently with my honor and reputation, accept of any employment under Congress, in a station 
either less honorable or less important than that which 
I once had the honor to hold; and, when the circumstances which led to my quitting the army shall re 
cur to Congress, I trust they will acquiesce in the 
propriety of this determination on my part. 
</p><p>
I do not mean, Sir, to convey the most distant 
idea, that I solicit a restoration to the rank and 
place I held in the army ; for, although it is true 
that I quitted it with reluctance, and that I have 
often since lamented that I was drove to the necessity of doing it, yet the delicacy I entertain with respect to the feelings of others, who might possibly 
conceive themselves injured by a perfect restoration 
of my rank, added to other considerations, have induced me to lay aside every wish for an appointment. But, Sir, as I am incapable of withholding 
any services my country may deem me capable of 
rendering ; as a reform in the civil departments of the 
army is of the highest necessity, and as Congress 
have thought proper to apply to me for my aid on 
the occasion, permit me to tender them an offer of 
my services, as a member of their House, on a Committee to consult with the Commander-in-chief, and 
the Heads of the several civil departments of the 
army, and to adopt such measures as will have a 
probable tendency to complete the great object of the 
resolutions of the 21st January. As a member of 
such a Committee, I should esteem it my duty to 
visit every part of the Continent, for the purpose of 
introducing good order and a proper economy, and 
should deem myself fully rewarded for every possible 
exertion, in the success of the business, and in the 
approbation of Congress. I am, &c.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I arrived on Sunday, but did not take my seat in 
Congress until this morning, as I deemed it prudent 
previously to address them on the subject of their 
appointment of the 21st January, which I did by 
letter ; a copy whereof I have the honor to inclose 
for your Excellency's perusal. I believe there is a 
determination not to accept of any services I may be 
able to render them, in the line in which I have offered them. Many here affect not to see the propriety of the distinction I have drawn ; but I shall 
be satisfied if the candid and ingenuous, who are not 
always a majority, in or out of doors, shall discover 
that it is not one without a difference. 
</p><p>
The measure I proposed to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>General Greene</a>, the 
moment before I parted with him, I learnt, on my 
arrival, had already been decided upon as unnecessary, and I was confidentially advised that it would 
be in vain to urge it. I must, therefore, forbear, 
however strongly impressed with its importance. 
</p><p>
I do not advise you of the intelligence from Carolina, as <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a> will probably be more full 
on the subject than I can be. The Minister has a 
letter from an agent, in which he informs the former, 
that part of the British were destined pour Ics Antilles. 
</p><p>
I believe it will be necessary for <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>General Greene</a> to address Congress very pointedly on the subject of 
the wagoners, as I find a disposition in many to 
have them drawn from the army. The reasons why 
they should not, if even the army would after all be 
sufficiently in force, will be obvious to him, and I 
wish him to adduce them fully, to corroborate what 
I shall deliver on the subject before his letter arrives. 
</p><p>
Our finances are completely deranged. A Committee 
of the Whole have had them under consideration, for 
some time before my arrival. They have been on 
the business to-day, without making any progress. It 
seems a paradox, that the whole should be more in 
competent than a part; but I am so perfectly persuaded of it, that I shall strive to get it referred to a few. I have thrown together my ideas on the subject. How they will be accepted I must leave to 
time; though I believe some good would result, if 
they were adopted. 
</p><p>
Be so good as to entreat your lady to accept of 
my best respects ; and to believe that I am most sincerely, with those sentiments of affection and esteem, 
which afford an ingenuous mind the most sensible of 
all satisfactions, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
MY DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
On the 3d instant I was favored with your Excellency's letter of the 30th ultimo. I have, for ten 
days successively, deferred writing, in hopes that I 
should have been able, at last, to have advised you 
that public business was closely attended to in this 
quarter, and that we had adopted measures to disencumber us from that variety of embarrassment we 
experience ; but, alas ! we have made little or no advances. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='colleague met'>Mifflin</a>, Pickering, Jones, and General Sherman, 
have furnished the first part of a voluminous system 
for the Quarter-master's department. The second part 
is to direct the Commissary-General of Issues in the 
discharge of his duty; and the third will point at 
the regulations for the Hospital. I do not mention 
the Purchasing department, because that is to be abolished ; the States are to do all. As General Sher 
man roundly asserts, that system will strike off four-thousand officers from the civil departments. As it is, 
replete with absurdity, it will pass into a law, unless 
it should be thought proper to confer with the Commander-in-chief on the subject. There has been some 
wicked work, respecting a certain appointment, which 
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>General Greene</a> will advise you of verbally. 
</p><p>
The gentleman I have last mentioned addressed 
Congress, in a letter of the 3d instant, wishing for 
their sense on his general conduct in the Quarter 
master's department. A resolution was proposed, that 
Congress had full confidence in his integrity and 
ability, and requesting his future exertions. This 
brought on much debate ; amendments were moved, 
and the House got into heats, and an adjournment 
was deemed necessary to give the members time to 
cool. A member, more zealous for the General's reputation than prudent, observed, that he was an officer in whom the Commander-in-chief had the highest 
confidence; that he was the first of all the subordinate Generals in point of military knowledge and 
ability ; that, in case of an accident happening to 
General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>, he would be the properest per 
son to command the army; and that General Washing 
ton thought so too. Another observed, that he had a 
very high opinion of <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>General Greene's</a> military abilities ; that he believed the General had too ; but that 
he believed no person on earth was authorized to say 
as much as the words, above scored, implied. I mention this, that your Excellency may guard against 
any misapprehensions which this may occasion with 
your officers. <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>General Greene</a> will inform you who 
delivered the imprudent speech. 
</p><p>
Yesterday your letter of the 2d was read. There 
appeared a disposition in many to leave the whole 
business, which was the subject of it, to your discretion. Great part of the morning was spent on the 
subject before the resolution took place, which will 
be transmitted by the President. 
</p><p>
Some days since, I moved for a Committee to prepare a letter to the States, to call on them for exertions more competent to the great object we have in 
view. After some altercation, a Committee was appointed. Ellsworth, Muhlenberg, and Schuyler composed it. They prepared the letter, and reported but 
some gentlemen were averse at the decisive plainness 
with which we intended Congress should address the 
States ; whilst others contended that we should speak 
still more pointedly. After a whole day's debate, the 
letter was recommitted. 
</p><p>
I have entreated <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>General Greene</a> to remain a day 
or two longer in town, that I may be able to advise 
with him on the measures necessary to be pursued 
to prevent the ill consequences of his being driven 
to the necessity of a resignation, which, I conceive, 
would at any time be an event to be much lamented, but, in the present conjuncture, ruinous. 
</p><p>
Pray entreat Mrs. <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> to accept of my respects, and the gentlemen of the family those wishes 
which my esteem for them indus. I am, dear Sir, 
with perfect esteem, and the sincerest affection, 
Your Excellency's obedient servant, 
</p><p>

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Colonel Warner is on the Grants, with a small body of Continental troops and some militia, and expects to be reinforced in a 
day or two by General Stark, with a body of militia from New 
Hampshire. 
</p><p>
You will please to repair to Manchester, the place where the 
troops above mentioned are collected and collecting, and take the 
command of the whole. As <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a> is advancing 
towards us, and as a movement of a body of troops from the 
Grants towards Skenesborough will doubtless much embarrass 
him, and will certainly oblige him to have a considerable force 
at that place, you will move towards it, if the troops you should 
find there, or those that may join, are in such numbers as that 
you can do it without risking too much. 
</p><p>
You will please to advise me, from time to time, of your situation and force, that I may be enabled to direct your future 
operations, according to what information I may get of the enemy's intentions. It is impossible to be more explicit in the present state of affairs. Events may arise, to which these orders 
could not possibly apply; you will, therefore, consider them as 
merely discretionary, and exercise your own judgment as contingencies may arise. 
</p><p>
I am, dear Sir, with great esteem and regard, 
</p><p>
