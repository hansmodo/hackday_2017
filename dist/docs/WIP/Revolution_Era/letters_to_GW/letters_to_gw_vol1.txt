G September, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775">1775</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have it in command to transmit to you the 
thanks of the Convention of Virginia for the faithful 
discharge of the important trust reposed in you, as 
one of their Delegates to the Continental Congress. 
Your appointment to an office of much consequence 
to America, and incompatible with your attendance 
on this duty, was the only reason that could have 
induced them not to call you to the Convention. 
Your brother Delegates were unanimous in their acknowledgments ; and you will believe it gives me the 
greatest satisfaction to convey to you the sentiments of your countrymen, and at the same time to give 
you every testimony of my approbation and esteem. 
</p><p>
The Convention appointed Mr. Henry Colt Commander-in-Chief of the army of observation to be raised, which is to consist of one thousand men, to 
be divided into two regiments. Mr. William Woodford commands the second. The Lieutenant-Colonels are Christian and Scott. Besides these, the Colony being 
divided into sixteen districts, each district is to be trained and disciplined, and to be paid during the time of training, and while in actual service. Mr. 
Henry is excluded from the Congress, the Convention having resolved that an officer commanding in the military shall not be a member of the Congress, Convention, or Committee of Safety. Mr. Pendleton and Mr. Bland both resigned, and in their room Colonel Nelson, Mr. Wythe, and Colonel Frank Lee, are appointed delegates to the Congress. 
</p><p>
I am much obliged to you for your letters. That relating to the action of the men-of-war and transports did not come to hand till the account had been in Virginia some time. 
</p><p>
I shall be much obliged to you to remember me to Edmund. 
</p><p>
I am your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
PEYTON RANDOLPH. 
</p><p>
 Francis Lightfoot Lee.

<a href='/results.php?city=braintree' rel='city'>Braintree</a>, 31 October, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775">1775</a>. 
</p><p>
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 
</p><p>
My worthy and dear friend, Dr. Franklin, the Honorable Mr. Bowdoin, Dr. Winthrop, and Dr. Cooper, were the last week so kind as to honor me with 
a friendly visit, The conversation naturally turned upon the savage cruelty we are daily suffering 
from the unrelenting vengeance of a tyrannical Government. In the course of it, the stopping up 
the harbour of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, as one salutary measure, was thought well worthy the attention of our State pilots; and upon my saying I had once, if not 
more than once, hinted the scheme to your Excellency, they desired me to communicate my sentiments to you once more, in writing, especially as 
I had lately received a letter from the Honorable John Adams, Esquire, in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, in answer to one of mine, which seemed to throw new light 
upon the subject. This, Sir, I beg may be a sufficient apology for transmitting to you the following extracts of those letters, with what has further 
occurred to my mind since they were wrote. In my letter I thus write. 
</p><p>
"In my former letter I said, the harbour might 
be blocked up, and both seamen and soldiers made 
prisoners at discretion; which seems to you in 
credible. Please to read, at your leisure, the following explanation. There are but two channels 
through which ships of burden can safely pass to 
and from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. One of them runs between the 
west head of Long Island and the Moon (so called), 
and is about a mile across. This is too shallow 
for any ship of war above twenty guns. The other 
is called the ship-channel, and runs between the 
east head of Long Island and the south point of 
Deer Island, and is something better than a mile, 
from side to side. This, the only channel through 
which capital ships can pass, leads, outward bound, 
through the Narrows between Gallop's Island and Lovell's Island, where the channel is not wider 
than the length of a fifty-gun ship. In the opening  between Gallop's Island and George's Island is 
Nantasket Road, where one frigate is always stationed, to guard the Narrows from being stopped up. Upon these facts I thus reason; 
</p><p>
"The Moon Island communicates, at low water, with 
Squantum Neck, almost dry-shod. A defensible fort, 
therefore, may be so placed upon Squantum as to 
cover the retreat not only from the Moon, but from 
Squantum to the main. One upon the east head of 
the Moon, and another on the west head of Long 
Island, secure that passage, and cover the retreat 
from the latter to the former. Another upon the 
summit, in the middle of Long Island, covers the 
shore on both sides, so as that no force can land 
without being greatly annoyed, if not entirely prevented. Another strong fort, with heavy cannon, at 
the east head of Long Island, would command not 
only the ship-channel that runs by it, but the Nar 
rows and Nantasket Road, so that no ship could remain there with safety ; and consequently we might, 
by sinking hulks in the Narrows, prevent any ship 
of force from going out or coming in. If the pas 
sage through the Narrows is not stopped, I am sensible that a ship, with a fresh gale of wind and 
flood tide, which is rapid between Long Island and 
Deer Island, might run through without any great 
hazard ; but, after the east head of Long Island is 
fortified, I can foresee nothing to hinder the Narrows 
being reduced to such a depth of water as that no 
vessel of force can pass through there. 
</p><p>
" This being effected, as I said above, both seamen 
and soldiers, if they do not escape by a timely 
flight, must become prisoners at discretion. I have 
been told there is, in one of the late English Magazines, an accurate draught of the harbour, which, 
upon examination, will enable you to determine, 
with precision, the bearings and distances from 
island to island, and the depth of water between 
them; and, consequently, whether such a scheme is 
practicable or not." 
</p><p>
Mr. Adams, in answer, writes thus : 
</p><p>
"I am much obliged by your kind explanation of 
your opinion, that the harbour might be blocked up. 
I must confess, although I was born so near it, I 
never understood before the course of the channel, 
and the situation of the harbour, so well. I have 
carefully compared your description of Squantum, 
the Moon, Long Island, Gallop's Island, Lovell's 
Island, and George s, the Narrows, and Nantasket 
Road, with A Plan of the Town and Chart of the 
Harbour of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, exhibiting a view of the Islands, 
Castle Fort, and Entrances into the said Harbour, 
which was published in London last February. This 
plan I knew to be inaccurate in some particulars, 
and the chart may be so in others; but, by the 
best judgment I can make, upon comparing your 
facts with the chart, and considering the depths of 
water marked on this chart, I think it extremely 
probable, with you, that nothing but powder and 
cannon are wanting to effect the important purposes you mention, that of making soldiers and sailors prisoners at discretion. 
</p><p>
"Dr. Franklin's row-galleys are in great forwardness. seven of them are completely manned, armed, 
&c. I went down the river the other day, with all 
of them. I have as much confidence in them as you 
have. But the people here have made machines, to 
be sunk in the channel of Delaware River. Three 
rows of them are placed in the river, with large timbers, barbed with iron. They are frames of timber, 
sunk with stone ; machines very proper for our channel in the Narrows." 
</p><p>
 " I had wrote largely to Mr. Adams upon the subject, but have not 
copied it, for fear of being tedious." 
Dr. Franklin says they may bo made in the form 
of a chevaux-de-frise, and used to great advantage. 
</p><p>
I have wrote to Mr. Adams for a model of the 
machines he mentions, with explicit directions how 
to sink and secure them from being weighed or destroyed by the enemy's ships. For my own part, 
since I have read what my friend has wrote, I am 
more than ever convinced of the practicability of not-only securing the harbour, but relieving the town of 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, by making the present possessors of it our 
prisoners, and that without shedding much more human blood, provided we can once possess and fortify Long Island. 
</p><p>
I doubt not your Excellency will readily agree with 
me, that these are become objects of much greater 
importance, since the destruction of Falmouth demon 
strates the malicious resolution of our barbarously 
civilized enemies, to destroy all the rest of our maritime towns, if they can. 
</p><p>
If your Excellency, should think the above sentiments worthy of your attention, and, for maturing 
your judgment, conclude it necessary to take an ocular view of the harbour and islands, please to accept 
of my cordial invitation to refresh or repose yourself 
at my house, where my happiness will be in proportion to the freedom with which you receive the 
friendly salutations of 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
JOSIAH QuiNCY.

</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 13 November, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775">1775</a>. 
</p><p>
MY DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
In consequence of your favor by Colonel Reed, I applied to the Chief Justice, who tells me the Supreme 
Courts were lately held, and that it will be some time 
before their term will return ; that he knows of no 
capital suit now depending, and that it is very easy 
for Colonel Reed to manage matters so as not to let 
that prevent his return to you. I am sure Mr. Chew 
is so heartily disposed to oblige you, and to serve 
the cause, that nothing in his power shall be wanting. 
</p><p>
I fear, however, that you will be some time in want 
of your Secretary, as I did not find him in haste to 
return, when I mentioned to him what is just now 
related ; he, doubtless, has many private affairs to 
transact ; the loss must be greatly increased by Mi-Randolph's absence, who, I hear, came to town last 
night. 
</p><p>
I am happy to inform you, that Congress has 
agreed to every recommendation of the Commit tee, :;: 
and have gone beyond it, in allowing the additional 
pay to the officers. I rejoice at this, but can t think 
with patience, that the pitiful wretches, who stood 
cavilling with you, when entreated to serve the next 
campaign, should reap the benefit of this addition ; 
they will now be ready enough, but hope you will be able to refuse them with the contempt they deserve, and find better in their room. Could not some 
of the gentlemen at the camp enlist the New England men, who have been persuaded to leave you? Frazier told me he could ; it would be a capital point 
to convince the world, that it is not necessary to have bad officers of that country in order to raise men there. I can scarce bear their tyranny. 
</p><p>
I have a letter, from undoubted authority, that 
assures me that the destruction of the Parliamental 
army in America will certainly produce peace ; and 
by another, that the seizing Quebec will produce the 
same effect. I have no doubt America stands now 
indebted to her General for the one, and will, before 
the return of spring, for the other. Mistake me not; 
I have not altered my mind one jot since I left you. 
I mean not to anticipate your determinations, but 
only to approve your design to hover like an eagle 
over your prey, always ready to pounce it, when the 
proper time comes. I have not forgot your proposition relative to that city. I try to pave the way for 
it, and wait for the season as you do. 
</p><p>
No appearance of peace on the part of the enemy, 
unless produced by necessity ; every human feeling 
seems to have forsaken them ; fear and interest are 
only listened to. 
</p><p>
We hear seven tons of powder are arrived at Rhode 
Island, and as many at Portsmouth. I hope it is true, 
as it will possess us of advantageous grounds, and be 
gin the enemy's destruction. It is suspected, in Eng 
land, that Howe's army will give you the slip, and 
land at Long Island ; which God, in his infinite mercy, 
grant ! We wait with impatience to hear of the total 
reduction of Canada. 
</p><p>
Your Virginians, we hear, have drubbed Lord Dun-more, killed and took fifty men, and sunk one of his 
vessels ; may all such villains so perish ! 
A Mr. Richard Hare, brother to the porter brewer, 
sailed in the transport for Quebec. As you have or 
must take him, let me recommend him to your civilities while with you, and to send him to his friends here. 
</p><p>
The articles of war have all the amendments we 
reported. You will enforce them ; you will not now 
suffer your officers to sweep the parade with the skirts 
of their coats, or the bottoms of their trowsers ; to 
cheat or to mess with their men ; to skulk in battle, 
or sneak in quarters ; in short, being now paid, they 
must do their duty, and look, as well as act, like gentlemen. Do not bate them an ace, my dear General, 
but depend upon every support of your friends here. 
I have strove to keep two battalions now raising 
in the Jerseys, and one here, quite disengaged, that 
they may be ready on a call to join you, should those 
you have desert you. I have not been quite unsuccessful. The winter is our own ; <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> will not, during that season, be reenforced ; at least we have reason to think so. 
</p><p>
I want the return I desired from Gates exceedingly. Compliments to him, Lee, Putnam, Mifnin, c. 
</p><p>
It is so dark I can t read this letter over, or I would save you the trouble of deciphering it. Dear Sir, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
THOMAS LYNCH. 
</p><p>
P. S. Ought not that spirit of independence, and separation from all other authority, w-liich appeared in 
the case of Captain Dyer, to be abolished ? Will it be right to keep your heroes for w T ood-cutters ?

Medford, (Porter's Tavern), 14 December, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775">1775</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I sailed from Gravesend the 4th of June last, in a merchant ship, bound to <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>, in Maryland, 
which was, at the time I came away, the nighest passage I could get to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, where I waited 
on the gentlemen that compose the Continental Congress, in order to obtain their permit to settle my private affairs, being much encumbered with debts, 
chiefly contracted in the Province of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>; in which settlement my brother, Colonel James Rogers, who lives in the Province of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, about twenty 
miles west of Connecticut River, was deeply concerned, being bound for me in several sums of money, which made it necessary for me to visit him in my way 
home; and for that purpose came by the way of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> to my brother s, and from thence to Portsmouth, to my wife and family (a 
pleasure long wished for), having been six years in Europe. 
</p><p>
I have taken the earliest opportunity that would permit to come to this town (where I arrived this morning), in order to lay before your Excellency the 
passport I received at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, from the Committee of Safety there, a copy of which is transmitted at the bottom of this letter, together with the minutes 
made thereon by the Committees of Safety at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and New Hampshire. I do sincerely entreat your Excellency for a continuance of that permission 
for me to go unmolested where my private business may call me, as it will take some months from this time to settle with all my creditors. 
</p><p>
I have leave to retire on my half-pay, and never expect to be called into the service again. I love North America ; it is my native country, and that of 
my family, and I intend to spend the evening of my days in it, 
</p><p>
I should be glad to pay you my respects personally, but have thought it prudent to first write you 
this letter, and shall wait at this place for your Excellency's commands. I am, Sir, your Excellency's most obedient and 
</p><p>
Most humble servant,

ROBERT ROGERS.

FROM JAMES LYON. 
</p><p>
Macliias, 25 December, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775">1775</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
You doubtless remember to have seen an application from the Committee of Safety in this place, for leave to go against Nova Scotia, which might probably have been taken then with very little difficulty. 
But we were informed that such an expedition could 
not be carried on, at that time, with proper secrecy, 
and that there was imminent danger from the King's 
ships. The same difficulties may possibly lie in the 
way now r , if any troops are collected, and sent from 
any part near the head-quarters. I apprehend that 
secrecy is as necessary now as ever it was, and if 
only one proper person, at a suitable place, be ordered 
to conduct the whole affair, it will probably succeed. 
There have been many applications, I dare say, 
from many persons and places ; but were I to point 
out a suitable place, I should mention this, as it is 
near to Nova Scotia. I should be more at a loss for a 
proper person to conduct the enterprise. I know of 
fitter persons than myself in many respects, but they 
are strangers to the province and people. But I 
have dwelt there for years, and have a personal acquaintance with almost all the principal men, and know 
the country well. I should rejoice, therefore, in the 
appointment to this necessary business ; and if your 
Excellency, together with those only who must necessarily be acquainted with the appointment (for I 
choose none but they should know any thing of the 
matter), in your great wisdom, should see fit to 
appoint me, I will conduct the expedition with the 
utmost secrecy, and, Deo adjuvante, will add to the 
dominions of the Continental Congress another province, before our enemies are able to defend it. All 
I require is sufficient authority to collect as many 
troops as I see fit, in this eastern country, not Exceeding one thousand men, and vessels to convey 
them to the place of action, and blank commissions 
for the necessary officers of a thousand more, to be filled up as I shall find expedient in Nova Scotia, 
where the men are to be raised, put into the Continental pay, and left there to defend the country, 
when taken ; and farther, that a sufficient quantity 
of provisions, ammunition, arms, &c., be sent here, 
about the middle of March. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency may inquire as much about me as 
you please, of Benjamin Foster, Esq., Captain Stephen 
Smith, Captain O Brien, and Mr. Shannon ; for these 
gentlemen I should choose to have as companions, 
but do not choose that they, or any other persons living , should know any thing of the design, if this 
petition is granted, till it is time to embark, except 
those persons only who have authority to appoint. 
The above-mentioned gentlemen know nothing of this 
application. 
</p><p>
The reduction of Nova Scotia is a matter of great 
importance, and lies near my heart, on account of my 
many suffering friends in that province, and on account of the many advantages that would arise from 
it to this Colony, and to this place in particular. 
But should the Government appoint another person 
to conduct the expedition, I shall cordially acquiesce, 
and pray for his success, as I ever do, that God may 
smile on all the American arms, till all our enemies 
are subdued before us. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will not take amiss what my zeal 
for the honor and safety of my country constrained 
me to write. I am, most respectfully, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Very humble and obedient servant,

FROM JOHN ADAMS. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=watertown' rel='city'>Watertown</a>, 6 January, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
As your Excellency has asked my opinion of General Lee's plan, as explained in his letter of the 5th instant, I think it my duty to give it, although I am 
obliged to do it in more haste than I could wish. 
</p><p>
I suppose the only questions, which arise upon that letter, are, whether the plan is practicable ; whether it 
is expedient ; and whether it lies properly within your Excellency's authority, without further directions from Congress. 
</p><p>
Of the practicability of it, I am very ill qualified to judge ; but were I to hazard a conjecture, it would be that the enterprise would not be attended with 
much difficulty. The Connecticut people, who are very ready upon such occasions, in conjunction with the Friends of Liberty in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, I should think, 
might easily accomplish the work. 
</p><p>
That it is expedient, and even necessary to be 
done, by some authority or other, I believe will not 
be doubted by any friend of the American cause, who 
considers the vast importance of that City, Province, 
and the North River, which is in it, in the progress 
of this war, as it is the nexus of the northern and 
southern Colonies, as a kind of key to the whole 
continent, as it is a passage to Canada, to the Great 
Lakes, and to all the Indian nations. No effort to se 
cure it ought to be omitted. 
</p><p>
That it is within the limits of your Excellency's 
command, is, in my mind, perfectly clear. Your commission constitutes you commander of all the forces 
now raised, or to be raised, and of all others who 
shall voluntarily offer their service, and join the army 
for the defence of American liberty, and for repelling 
every hostile invasion thereof; and you are vested 
with full power and authority to act as you shall 
think for the good and welfare of the service. 
</p><p>
Now if upon Long Island there is a body of people, who have arms in their hands, and are intrenching themselves, professedly to oppose the American 
system of defence, who are supplying our enemies both of the army and navy, in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> and elsewhere, as I suppose is undoubtedly the fact, no man can 
hesitate to say that this is an hostile invasion of American liberty, as much as that now made in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. Nay, those people are guilty of the very invasion in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, as they are constantly aiding, abetting, comforting, and assisting the army there, and 
that in the most essential manner, by supplies of provisions. 
</p><p>
If in the city a body of tories are waiting only 
for a force to protect them, to declare themselves on 
the side of our enemies, it is high time that city was 
secured. The Jersey troops have already been ordered 
into that city by the Congress, and are there undoubtedly under your command, ready to assist in 
this service. That <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> is within your command, as much as the Massachusetts, cannot bear a 
question. Your Excellency's superiority in the command over the Generals in the Northern Department, 
as it is called, has been always carefully preserved 
in Congress, although the necessity of despatch has 
sometimes induced them to send instructions directly 
to them, instead of first sending them to your Excellency, which would have occasioned a circuit of many 
hundreds of miles, and have lost much time. 
</p><p>
Upon the whole, Sir, my opinion is, that General 
Lee's is a very useful proposal, and will answer many 
good ends. I am, with great respect, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
JOHN ADAMS.

FROM THOMAS LYNCH. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 16 January, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I am happy to be at last able to write you, that 
every thing you desired me to get done is accomplished, for the present. Our President assures me 
he has sent you the determination of Congress concerning the trial of captures. Courts of Admiralty 
have been appointed in the Colony for that purpose. 
Colonel Frye has been appointed Brigadier in your 
army (Mr. Arnold precedes him in that of Quebec) ; 
and I inclose copies of the resolutions for the direction of the postmaster, relative to letters of officers 
and soldiers in our service. 
</p><p>
The delays in procuring the money have given me 
much concern, being sensible of the injury occasioned 
thereby to the service ; but the calls for money, from 
every quarter, so far outrun the diligence of the signers, that my reiterated solicitations could get the sum 
no sooner. 
</p><p>
We have resolved to raise, exclusive of your army, 
in New Hampshire one battalion, in Connecticut one, 
in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> one, in Jersey three, in Pennsylvania five, in the Lower Counties one, in Virginia six, in 
North Carolina three, and South Carolina three, in Georgia one, and in Canada two, exclusive of Canadians. 
Besides these, I have no doubt <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> will have 
four more, and Maryland two, which, with the regiments of artillery, will be sixty-two or three battalions, and the expense not less than ten millions of 
dollars. How quick a transfer of property, from the 
rich to the poor, such an expenditure must produce, 
you are well able to judge. The prospect is far from 
receiving light; when it is considered how each Colony 
lavishes away its private treasure at the same time, 
or when we view the amazing and unaccountable supineness of all our Governments. Not a single individual, anywhere in a civil department, seems to consider himself as interested in public matters, unless 
he can get money by them. The idea of all the 
paper being mortgages on their private estates is to 
tally lost and forgotten. 
</p><p>
In this state of things I have, besides my dependence on the continuance of the favor of Heaven, trust 
in two supports alone; the one, on your vigorous Exertions ; the other, on the weakness of our enemies. 
Should they lose footing in America this winter, I 
should despise their thirty thousand Russians, scattered by storms, arriving, one transport after another, 
fatigued and debilitated by the fatal effects of a long 
voyage, without a spot to collect and recruit them 
selves for the field, and depending, for every necessary, on supplies from a country three thousand miles distant. 
</p><p>
Do not the speeches of the King and his Ministers hold very different language from those of the last 
year? America is no longer the abject, cowardly, 
and defenceless wretch she was then ; now his Lord 
ship, [who] would have despised [them], had they not 
bravely supported their rights, seems to approve their 
vigorous support of them, and offers the terms of 
1763. A gentleman, well known to Maryland, Lord Drummond, just from England, assures me he will 
give much more; he tells me that he has had many 
conversations with Ministry on this subject, and showed me a paper, approved by each of them, and which 
he is sure will be supported in both Houses. The substance of it is, America to be declared free in point 
of taxation and internal police; Judges to be approved by the Judges of England, and commissioned during  good behaviour, upon stated and sufficient support 
being statedly assigned by the Colonies ; all charters 
to be held sacred ; that of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> restored ; Britain to 
regulate trade sub modo ; all duties, laid for the purpose of regulation, to be paid into the Colony Treasury where they arise, applicable to its uses by its 
own Legislature; in lieu of which America shall, by 
duties on such articles as will probably keep pace 
in consumption with the rise or declension of the 
Colony, laid by each Legislature by permanent act 
of Assembly, grant towards the general support of 
the empire, annual sums in proportion to five thou 
sand pounds sterling for this Colony. As this sum 
is little more than half of what did arise by duties 
heretofore paid in this place, I doubted his information. but was assured that Ministry wanted nothing 
but a show of revenue to hold up to Parliament, as

His Lordship came hither through Halifax, <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, 
and York, where, I fancy, he saw what induced him 
to hint, once or twice, at beginning with a suspension 
of arms, to which I turned a very deaf car, well 
knowing that the winter season is ours, and that 
much may be done by April next. I sincerely wish 
I had your sentiments on these heads. I shall propose them to the consideration of Congress, as soon 
as the most urgent affairs are over; I think they 
merit it. 
</p><p>
Congress has ordered you fifteen tons of gunpowder 
from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and we have saltpetre enough here 
to make eighty tons more, so that I hope we shall 
not soon want again ; larger quantities are every day 
expected. I beg you will make our compliments to 
your lady, and to the rest of your family, and all my 
friends.

P. S. We have just heard, from <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, that 
they have mounted on the batteries there above one 
hundred and sixty cannon, from twelve to forty-two 
pounders, and seventy more in different parts of the

gang are totally suppressed. He is come, but I have 
not yet seen him.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
My country having honored me with the command 
of the Continental battalion, ordered to be raised by 
the General Congress for the protection and defence 
of this Colony (though I fear too partial to my 
poor abilities), it becomes my duty to inform your 
Excellency of the state of our Province, as far as 
it concerns the service, as well as of the troops to 
be immediately under my command. 
</p><p>
Our Province has a front along the sea-coast of 
above one hundred miles, covered by a range of 
islands divided from each other by eight rivers from 
the main land, which makes as many good inlets 
and harbours, most of them capable of receiving any 
frigate, and, as some say, much larger ships. Our 
settlements extend back to the north-west above two 
hundred miles; in other parts, to the southward, not 
above ten, and very thinly inhabited. Indeed, this 
large space of land altogether has not more than 
three thousand men, chiefly in the back country, and 
many disaffected and doubtful in our cause, especially the men of the greatest property among us. 
Our slaves will be above fifteen thousand souls, 
mostly within twenty miles of the sea-coast, and 
make above thirty-five thousand tierces of rice annually, besides many other articles of provision, which, 
with our fine harbours, makes the security of this 
Colony, though weak in itself, of the utmost consequence to the whole Continent of America. And we 
have every reason to think our enemies intend to 
make it a place of general rendezvous and supplies. 
</p><p>
We are bounded south by the garrisoned Province 
of East Florida, who have now, as I am well in 
formed, five hundred regulars in St. Augustine, and 
one thousand more expected there daily from Eu 
rope. On the west of us is the Province of West 
Florida, the numerous nations of the Creek, Choctaw, and Cherokee Indians, besides lesser tribes, sup 
posed to have at least ten thousand gun-men, brave, 
intrepid, and eager for war, whom we shall have the 
utmost difficulty to keep at peace, as we want every 
article of their usual supply, and now furnished them 
in great plenty from the two Floridas. 
</p><p>
Our metropolis is situated in the north corner of the Province, upon a bluff or sand-hill thirty feet high or more above the water, and fifteen miles 
up the river <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> from the inlet of Tybee, where five ships of war, the Syren, the Scarborough, the Raven, the Tamar, and Cherokee, besides tenders, 
are now lying, and two large transports, having, it is said, above three hundred men on board, and expecting more daily; with what design, whether for 
this Colony only, or Carolina, or both together, we 
are not yet informed. Our Province has declared 
itself in a state of alarm, and resolved not to supply 
the men-of-war with provision, and ordered a draft 
of half the militia to the town of <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>, to oppose the landing of any troops. 
</p><p>
Our Provincial Congress, having accepted the battalion ordered for their protection and defence, chose 
the officers the 29th and 30th ultimo (a return of 
whom shall accompany this), and made them sign 
the inclosed test before their commissions were delivered ; and I have this day issued general orders for 
recruiting, which has been hitherto prevented by 
many obstacles in providing money for that and 
other necessary services, and I fear will yet be at 
tended with some difficulty. We expect very few in 
our own Province. That of South Carolina is said to 
be already drained of such people as will enlist by 
their Provincial regiments; besides, their bounty, subsistence, &c., is so much better than ours. Therefore, 
I expect we must have recourse, distant as it is, to 
North Carolina, with this additional disadvantage, that 
our currency passes in no other Colony but our own, 
and we have received very little Continental money 
yet. 
</p><p>
I have received no kind of orders or instructions from the General Congress, or your Excellency ; nor have I yet been able to obtain even a copy of the 
American Articles of War, which makes me at a loss how to act in many cases. Therefore I shall wish any orders or directions your Excellency will please to 
send me, to be as full and frequent as possible ; also to be informed how far we are under the control of the Provincial Congress, &c., of this or any other 
Province, when we are upon duty, and what rank we hold when acting with militia or Provincial troops. 
</p><p>
I shall take the liberty of appointing surgeons to the battalion, which are so indispensably necessary that I suppose the neglect of not naming any must 
be owing to our Delegates ; and also make Captain Colson's a rifle company, when raised, which I think 
will be useful, and hope will meet with your Excellency's approbation, and I doubt we shall be obliged to arm more with such guns, for want of others, which are very scarce. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be your Excellency s
</p><p>
Most obedient 
</p><p>
And most humble servant, 
</p><p>
LACHLAN MCINTOSH.

<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 3 March, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>. 
</p><p>
MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have not been favored with any thing from you 
since my two last; but that never makes any difference in my writing, as your claims of friendship and 
gratitude upon me are superior to all others. The 
Congress have made an appointment of Generals, as 
by the inclosed paper. Armstrong is ordered to South 
Carolina, Thompson to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. The others keep 
their present situations. General Lee's destination is 
changed to Virginia, from undoubted authority that 
it will be a principal scene of action. The Congress 
have acceded to the proposition respecting myself; so 
that unless some new event, unforeseen and very important, should happen, I shall be with you this sum 
mer. I must beg your indulgence till I can get 
my family into some convenient situation, and settle 
my affairs. In the mean time, I am forwarding your 
camp equipage, which I have extended, in many small 
particulars, beyond your order. 
</p><p>
Arnold is to be intrusted with the affairs of Canada, Wooster having either resigned, or been superseded, I know not which. Melchior is come from 
Quebec in twelve days, where he left our little army strengthened to fifteen hundred men, in good spirits, and still pleasing themselves with the hope of being 
masters of the town. I have not yet seen him, so 
that I can give you no further particulars; but I 
understand they are like to want battering cannon 
and mortars. No arrivals of powder or arms since 
my last, or any account of our fleet, though, from 
their present cruising ground, we hope they will fall 
in with Lord Cornwallis and the transports. 
</p><p>
Notwithstanding the act of Parliament for seizing 
our property, and a thousand other proofs of a bitter 
and irreconcilable spirit, there is a strange reluctance, 
in the minds of many, to cut the knot which ties us 
to Great Britain, particularly in this Colony and to the 
southward. Though no man of understanding expects 
any good from the Commissioners, yet they are for 
waiting to hear their proposals before they declare 
off. However, yesterday I was informed letters had 
been sent to France to know what encouragement 
we might expect from that quarter. Our coast is 
yet clear; it is a golden opportunity to make provision for the war, which, I hope, will not be lost. If 
the other Provinces had done any thing like this in 
the making of arms, this winter we should have been 
tolerably provided. We shall, by the 1st April, have 
made four thousand stands since last October, every 
part done here. We are casting cannon, and there 
is more saltpetre made than in all the Provinces put 
together. Six powder-mills are erecting in different 
parts. The two near this city deliver twenty-five hundred pounds per week, and are now in very good 
order. Many attempts have been made to get a 
bounty for the New England troops, but without 
effect. The Congress are resolved that you shall abandon the lines, and give up their country to be ravaged, if they will not defend it upon the same terms 
as those enlisted here (such as marched to Canada 
only excepted). 
</p><p>
The Assembly have it under consideration to raise 
two thousand men for the defence of this Province ; 
but I doubt its taking. Perhaps there may be half 
the number. I am told we can easily raise two or 
three more battalions, if we had arms, &c., for them. 
</p><p>
I do not think I shall bring any person with me 
when I come. Mr. Webb has long had an inclination 
to be in your family. If the post should be agree 
able to him, and he is agreeable to you, I believe I 
should prefer him to any other. The post is just 
going ; so that I have only time to add, that I am, 
my dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Yours, most affectionately, 
</p><p>
JOSEPH PtEED.

FROM COLONEL MCINTOSH. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>, Georgia, 8 March, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I did myself the honor to write to your Excellency 
the 16th ultimo, which, for want of conveyance, lies 
here still, as our Continental post is not well regulated, this length, yet. It is hardly worth troubling 
you with any report of our battalion, as I have heard 
from very few of our recruiting officers, and we have 
only between twenty and thirty men of them in 
town ; but the transactions here, since that time, 
may deserve some notice. The men-of-war at Tybee, 
though still giving out they had no hostile intentions 
against this Colony, were encouraging our slaves to 
desert to them, pilfering our sea islands for provisions ; and our Governor broke his parol of honor, 
and went privately, in the night, with his family, 
aboard the Scarborough, Captain Barclay, which gave 
us every reason to expect they meant to land at or 
near the town, destroy it, and carry off about twenty 
sail of shipping lying in the river, having, among 
other articles, near three thousand tierces of rice on 
board. 
</p><p>
Between three and four hundred of our own militia, and one hundred from South Carolina, were all 
that could be got to defend an open, straggling, defenceless, and deserted town, with numberless avenues 
leading to it, and those men under no control or 
command whatsoever ; and, to add to the anarchy 
and confusion we were in, our Council of Safety had 
not met for some time, having differed about the 
meaning of a resolve of the Continental Congress 
respecting the ships sailing the 1st of March. 
</p><p>
In this desperate state of affairs, 1 ventured to take 
the command of the militia, lest the Colony should 
be tamely given up, though, I must acknowledge, 
with some reluctance ; and, after examining very particularly, as I was unacquainted, around the town, I 
placed guards everywhere the enemy could land, and 
ambushes in the different roads leading to it, which 
made the duty very severe, and reduced our number 
in town greatly. In the mean time, the Cherokee, 
the two transports, the armed vessels and boats, came 
up the river within two and a half miles of town, 
near where we sunk a hulk in the channel of the 
river, and opposite to Brewton's plantation, where I 
placed a detachment of one hundred and fifty men, 
under command of Colonel Bullock, expecting they 
would attempt to land there. The enemy were 
parading with their boats for several days within 
gunshot of our sentinels, who, though they were 
ordered not to fire unless they were fired upon first, 
or they attempted to land, gave them several shot, 
but were not returned. 
</p><p>
Our Council of Safety were got together, and re solved the shipping should not sail, and ordered they should be unrigged. The evening of the 2d of March 
one of the transport ships (the schooner Hinchinbrook), and sloop St. John, of eight or ten guns each, with some boats, sailed in our sight up the 
North River, back of Hutchinson's Island, lying opposite to the town of <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>, but so far off that a 
little battery we had below the town, which played 
upon them, could do no damage to them. Expecting 
the enemy intended coming round Hutchinson's Island, 
and down the south side of it, to make their landing 
good at Yamacraw (a village three or four hundred 
yards above the town), I had three four-pounders 
carried there, a little battery erected in haste, and 
threw up intrenchnients, and withdrew part of the 
guard at Brewton s, without weakening too much, or 
withdrawing any of our ambushes on that side, lest 
it might be a feint to deceive us. 
</p><p>
About the middle of the same night, as we were 
afterwards informed, the Commodore, Barclay, and 
Majors Grant and Maitland, with about three hundred men, as it was said, landed on the back of 
Hutchinson's Island, with some howitzers and field-pieces, and, with the assistance and contrivance of all 
our own seafaring people, and many from the town, 
crossed the Island and hid themselves aboard of our 
merchant ships, which were previously hauled close 
to the Island, a little above our battery at Yamacraw, for that purpose. Early on Sunday, the 3d, 
the two armed vessels, intending to cover the enemy's landing, had come round the Island, and, coming 
down on the south side, were attacked by parties of 
riflers ordered for that purpose, and kept smartly engaged on both sides most of the day, until they lost 
the tide and got aground ; while two sailors (Americans), at the risk of their lives, stole ashore and informed me the enemy were hid on board our merchant-men, and had taken Joseph Rice prisoner, who 
was employed to unrig them that morning. 
</p><p>
To confirm this intelligence, Messrs. Demere and Roberts were ordered to go only alongside the vessels, and, without arms, to demand our fellow-citizen, 
Mr. Rice ; but, to our astonishment, they were also 
forced on board and kept, which convinced us our 
information was true ; and immediately our little battery of three guns began to play upon them, which 
they returned ; and was continued very smartly with 
ball, language, and small arms, from both sides for 
several hours. Our men were inflamed, particularly 
at our own people, who had treacherously joined the 
enemy against us, and were eager to board them ; 
but we had neither boats, sailors, or arms, proper for 
the attempt^ and the oars of the few boats we had 
were previously stolen away. The general cry then 
was, to set all the shipping on fire ; in attempting 
of which, many of our people showed great resolution 
and bravery ; but, unfortunately, the first ship set 
fire to (valued at twenty thousand pounds sterling), 
was so large that she grounded before she got up to 
the others. Afterwards a sloop was fired, which 
burned two others, while the rest were cutting away, 
amidst the shot of our rifles and langrage, and 
slipping higher up the river, out of our reach, with 
the last of the flood. In the mean time, many of 
the soldiers hastily landed on the Island, in great 
confusion, running in the marsh in a laughable man 
ner, for fear of our rifles, though far past their reach, 
until they got aboard a tier of ships higher up the 
river, and out of the reach of our guns, near the 
armed vessels. In this manner ten sail of our vessels 
went along with the enemy round the upper end of the Island (a channel never known before), with six 
teen hundred barrels of rice, with the utmost anxiety and fear. 
</p><p>
After being foiled in their scheme upon the town, 
the Commodore and Majors eagerly and repeatedly 
solicited a cessation of hostilities, for which they 
promised immediately to repair to Tybee, and not 
molest us again ; which was at length granted them, 
with seeming difficulty, though the truth was, we 
had no means of annoying them by water. The rest 
of the shipping we hauled close to the wharves, confined some of their Captains, for acting against us, 
with our Chief Justice and some Councillors, until 
they released our fellow-citizens, Demere, Roberts, 
and Rice, and sent them up from Tybee, where our 
enemies are all now gone. 
</p><p>
Whether they intend to try us again or not, I am 
not able to inform your Excellency. In this, I think, 
they rather lost than gained any reputation, and 
have done us great honor, by being the second province on the continent which they attacked, and 
were shamefully foiled. We had, in all our different 
engagements, but two white men and one Indian 
wounded slightly. They must have many both killed and wounded, though they acknowledge but six. 
Several were seen to fall. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, your Excellency's most 
obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
LACHLAN MCINTOSH. 
</p><p>
P. S. The ships of war have taken all the rice 
(sixteen hundred barrels) out of the merchant-men, 
that so treacherously went down with them, and put 
it aboard their two transport ships, without paying a 
farthing for it. They claim one eighth for "wresting 
them out of the hands of the rebels/ as the Commodore's certificate expresses it ; but I doubt they will 
keep the other seven eighths also.

FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL LORD STIRLING 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, 11 March, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>. 
</p><p>
MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
General Lee left this place on Thursday evening  last for <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, on his way for Virginia, 
where he is to command. This has thrown a heavy 
load on my shoulders, and very unexpectedly ; but I 
am likely soon to be relieved from it, as I hear 
Brigadier-General Thompson is to be here in a day 
or two. 
</p><p>
The sudden departure of the post prevents my saying  any thing at present relative to the situation of 
this place ; and will only inform you that last 
night three gentlemen landed here from on board a 
packet, nine weeks out from Falmouth. They say 
that seven regiments of foot, amounting to about four 
thousand men, were embarked and ready to sail from 
Cork, about the 6th of January, bound to the south 
ern Colonies ; that Great Britain had engaged four 
thousand Hanoverians and six thousand Hessians, for 
the American service, and were in treaty for ten 
thousand Russians ; that the French Ambassador at 
London had declared to the English Ministry, that 
his master did not mean to meddle with the quarrel 
between Great Britain and her Colonies, while it was 
carried on with its own force ; but that he could not 
be an idle spectator, if any foreign aid was made use of (it was not then known, in London, that the 
French had any troops in the West India Islands) ; 
that it was not likely any more British troops would 
be sent out, for they had them not to spare. 
</p><p>
If these things should be true, I am in hopes we 
shall have an easy summer's work to secure the 
whole Continent. The Commissioners, whose number 
is reduced to twenty, were to embark about the middle of January. It was said that they were to endeavour to treat with the Assemblies of Colonies 
separately, if possible ; and even to retail out corruption to single towns or families ; but if this could 
not succeed, they were to swallow the bitter pill, and treat with Congress. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear General ; the post waits. But yet, 
present my best regards to Mrs. <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>, Mr. 
and Mrs. Custis, Palfrey, &c. ; and I am, with the 
highest esteem and regard, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I received your letter, by express, of the 14th, 
and your letter of the same date to General Lee, 
which I opened and forwarded, agreeably to the directions he left me. I am happy to find that the 
aid I called in from New Jersey and Connecticut Exactly concords with your sentiments. 
</p><p>
The two regiments of Connecticut now here, consisting of about five hundred rank and file each, are 
impatient to go home, as many of them are farmers, 
who want to mark out their summer's work. The 
time of their engagement with General Lee ends 
next Monday. I have used my best endeavours to 
prevail on them to stay till their places are supplied 
from that quarter- but it is still doubtful whether 
they will consent to it. Of this I have apprised Governor Trumbull, and have requested him to supply 
their places, and to make the whole two thousand 
from that Colony. From New Jersey I have requested one thousand men; about two hundred of 
them are come in. About one thousand are ordered 
from the northern counties of this Province ; none of 
them are yet arrived. We have now in this place 
and in Long Island about twenty-five hundred men, 
including the above two Connecticut regiments. 
The militia in town amount to about as many more. 
Near one half of the whole are on fatigue every 
day, carrying into execution the plan of defence 
formed by General Lee. They go on with great 
spirit and industry. 
</p><p>
The Congress have ordered eight thousand men for 
the defence of this City and Province. The corps to 
make up this number are four regiments from Pennsylvania, one from New Jersey, and four of this province, none of which are yet arrived, and most of 
them are incomplete and unfit to march, especially the 
latter, of which not above two hundred are yet in 
town, and some of them I find are to be employed 
on Hudson's River, and the northern parts of this 
Province. From this state of the matter, you will see 
that, if the Ministerial troops leave <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> and move 
this way, how necessary it will be to detach a large 
part of your army to this place, which, undoubtedly, 
is the most important object in North America. 
</p><p>
On receiving your last letter, I had determined to 
detain at this place the eleven tons of powder designed for your camp ; but, lest the manoeuvres at 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> should prove a feint, I have ordered five tons 
of it to proceed to-morrow morning. The rest will 
follow according to the intelligence we receive. 
</p><p>
Ten o clock, P. M. Brigadier-General Thompson is 
arrived here this day, and of course takes the command. My utmost industry will be exerted to assist 
him in it. My most sincere and best wishes attend 
you. I have the honor to be, my dear General, 
Your most obedient, humble servant,

The bearer of this letter (Francis Dana, Esq., of

education, returned in the last packet from London, 
where he has been about a year. He has ever main 
tained an excellent character in his country, and a 
warm friendship for the American cause. He returns 
to share with his friends in their dangers and their 
triumphs. I have done myself the honor to give 
him this letter for the sake of introducing him to 
your acquaintance, as he has frequently expressed to 
me a desire to embrace the first opportunity of paying  his respects to a character so highly esteemed 
and so justly admired throughout all Europe as well 
as America. Mr. Dana Avill satisfy you that we 
have no reason to expect peace from Britain. 
</p><p>
I congratulate you, Sir, as well as all the friends 
of mankind, on the reduction of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>; an event, 
which appeared to me of so great and decisive importance, that the next morning after the arrival of 
the news, I did myself the honor to move for the 
thanks of Congress to your Excellency, and that a 
medal of gold should be struck in commemoration of 
it. Congress have been pleased to appoint me, with 
two other gentlemen, to prepare a device. I should 
be very happy to have your Excellency's sentiments 
concerning a proper one.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> in five days after I left the 
camp at Roxbury, at which place I have been detained to this time by reason of the Lakes being 
impassable. The troops here and at Lake George 
are about eleven hundred, and I hear some few are 
at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> and Crown Point, prevented going 
forward, as the Lakes are partly blocked up. What 
number are in Canada, I cannot ascertain; but am 
sensible, from the best intelligence, will be much short 
of the number required, as I find the regiments 
are very incomplete. General Schuyler thinks they 
will be much short of five thousand; and should the 
Ministerial troops there be reenforced, and Quebec 
remain in their hands, so small a number must be 
thought to be inadequate for the defence of that 
quarter. Your Excellency will judge whether a re-enforcement will not be necessary. 
</p><p>
The last from Canada was about the 25th of 
March, at which time things there remained in statu 
quo. Dr. Franklin and others, of the Committee of 
Congress, arrived here this morning. As the weather 
this day or two is moderate, I am in hopes the Lake

opening of the Lakes, have not yet arrived on this 
side; but as they are on their way, I hope to see 
them in a few days. 
</p><p>
I have endeavoured to inform myself from General 
Arnold, and other gentlemen in this city, of the state 
of our army before Quebec, and in other parts of the 
Province of Canada. I find that the troops, who 
engaged only to the 15th of April, are mostly on 
their return home, and cannot be prevailed on to 
continue longer in the country; and, by the information given me, have no reason to expect, that when 
those who are on their way here shall arrive, the 
whole will much exceed four thousand, exclusive of 
a small number of Canadians., who have and are 
likely to engage in the Continental service. The 
artillery, powder, c., are not yet arrived, and little 
or no preparation made, as I expected there would 
have been, for the defence of the country ; not an 
artificer, as I can find, for building boats or floating 
batteries, which are, in my opinion, very necessary 
to defend the river; nor a person who understands 
the use of artillery, except those who are confined in 
Quebec. 
</p><p>
The provisions are not more than sufficient to victual the troops to the 10th of May, and the Continental currency has but little credit, which makes it 
extremely difficult to discharge the debts contracted among the inhabitants, whose dispositions are not so friendly as heretofore, owing partly to their not being 
paid so punctually for their services as they were promised, and partly to their disappointment in not seeing the number of troops coming into the country, 
which they have been taught to expect. When I mention the quantity of provisions, I mean the provisions already here, exclusive of three hundred barrels 
of pork, which General Sclmyler is sending forward. 
</p><p>
The Committee of Congress have not yet arrived; and unless, on their arrival, they can give credit to the Continental currency, we shall be subjected to 
many inconveniences. I am not at present able to make out a perfect return of the troops here, but shall as soon as in my power. 
</p><p>
From this situation of things, your Excellency will judge, whether double the number of troops, mentioned above, will be more than sufficient for the 
defence of this Province, should there be a reenforcement of the Ministerial troops ; as there is the utmost reason to suppose there will be, as soon as the navigation of the river will permit, especially considering the little dependence that is to be made on the Canadians. 
</p><p>
I should have been happy, could I, consistently with truth, have given a more pleasing account of the state of our affairs in Canada; but it is my duty 
to represent facts as they are. I am, Sir, with the greatest respect, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant,

SIR, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 29th of April is just come to hand. Agreeably to your desire, I shall give an 
account of what has been done towards fortifying the harbour. The forts on Fort Hill in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, Charles-town Point, and Castle Point, are almost completed, 
with a number of heavy cannon mounted in each. 
A work is in good forwardness on Noddle's Island, 
and a detachment of the army is at work at Castle 
Island, repairing the batteries there. A number of 
hulks are preparing to sink in the channel. I have 
employed the troops here to the greatest advantage 
in my power; have ordered all the men, not on actual 
duty, to turn out upon fatigue every day, not allowing  any superfluous cooks nor waiters; and, upon 
receiving intelligence of the British fleet being on its 
passage this way, I directed all the officers to turn 
out with their men upon the works, which they cheerfully complied with, and are instantly upon fatigue with their men. I have set every wheel in motion, 
which I could move to advantage, and shall neglect nothing in my power in order to give the enemy a proper reception, if they should pay us a visit. 
</p><p>
I have inclosed a return of this division of the army. 
</p><p>
I am to inform your Excellency, that I have just 
received a letter from the President of the Congress, 
by which I am informed the Congress has accepted 
my resignation. The sooner I am relieved, the more 
agreeable it will be to me, as my health has declined 
much this spring. I am

Head- Quarters, Point Dechambeau, 8 May, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Immediately on my arrival at the camp before 
Quebec, which was on the 1st instant, I examined 
into the state of the army, and found, by the returns, 
there were nineteen hundred men. Of this number 
only one thousand were fit for duty, officers included; 
the remainder were invalids, chiefly confined with the 
smallpox. Three hundred of the effective were soldiers whose enlistments expired on the 15th ultimo, 
many of whom peremptorily refused duty, and all 
were very importunate to return home ; and two hundred others, engaged for the year, had received the 
infection of the smallpox by inoculation, and would, 
in a short time, be in the hospitals. Several posts 
were necessary to be supported by the small number 
able to do duty, at such distances from each other, 
that by means of rivers and other obstructions, not 
more than three hundred men could be rallied to the 
support of any one post, should it be attacked by 
the whole force of the enemy. In all our magazines 
there were but one hundred and fifty pounds of powder, nor more than six days provision ; the French 
inhabitants (as I hinted in my last) much disaffected, so that supplies of any kind were obtained with 
great difficulty from them. 
</p><p>
Considering these and many other disagreeable circumstances, I thought it expedient to call a Council 
of War; and the Council, consisting of Brigadier-General Wooster, and all the field-officers in camp, after 
mature deliberation, were unanimously of the opinion 
that, as, upon the first arrival of any reenforcement 
to the enemy, all communication by the river would 
inevitably be cut off by their armed vessels, it was 
absolutely necessary, for the safety of the invalids, 
immediately to remove them to Three Rivers, and to 
collect the artillery and other stores, in order to 
move them and the army further up the river, as 
soon as it could conveniently be done, to secure some 
posts where there would be a prospect of resisting 
with success. This was on the 5th instant, and, in 
the evening of the same day, I received certain intelligence of fifteen ships being forty leagues below 
Quebec. Early next morning, five of them, appeared 
in sight, and the wind and tide being favorable, they 
soon arrived before the city. We were at this time 
employed in carrying the sick on board the bateaux, 
removing the artillery, &c. ; the enemy, in landing 
their troops, and, as the event shows, in preparing to 
make a sally. Our movements were retarded by the 
change the arrival of these vessels produced in the 
inhabitants ; for they would neither furnish us with 
teams, nor afford us the least assistance, but kept 
themselves concealed. 
</p><p>
About one o clock, a considerable body of the enemy attacked our sentries and main guard, in consequence of which I instantly ordered the troops under arms, and detached a party to support the main 
guard, which was now coming off in good order. By the best judgment I could make, the enemy were a thousand strong, formed into two divisions, in columns six deep. 
</p><p>
The most that we could collect at this time, on 
the Plains, did not exceed a quarter of that number, 
with one field-piece, whereas the enemy were sup 
ported with a train of six pieces of cannon. 
</p><p>
No intrenchments had been thrown up, nor any lines formed, which would serve for a cover. We had no place of retreat, if we had been overpowered 
with numbers ; a defeat would have been decisive against the whole army in this encampment, and victory would have given us no considerable advantages, 
as the enemy might securely have retreated to their garrison, and their shipping entirely commanded the river. 
</p><p>
This being our situation, rather than contend on 
so unequal ground, with so little probability of reaping  emolument by the contest, by advice of the field-officers present, I gave orders for the army to march 
up the river, as far as this place, where the greater 
part came up yesterday. On my arrival, I without 
delay called a Council of War, a copy of the determinations of which I have inclosed, as I have of that 
held in the camp before Quebec. The result of the council was, as your Excellency will see, to advance still further up the river, and was founded on several 
reasons, some of which I will suggest. The ships of war were hastening forward with all possible despatch, and had already got up to Jacques Cartier, between 
two and three leagues distant from hence ; we had no cannon to prevent their passing the falls of Richelieu (the only advantageous post to fortify for this purpose) ; our provision would not more than subsist the army for two or three days. We should, 
therefore, labor under the same disadvantages at Dechambeau as before Quebec ; the men-of-war would run up the river, intercept all our resources, and soon oblige us to decamp. 
</p><p>
I shall, however, send the invalids forward, and remain here myself, with about five hundred men, until 
I receive advices from Montreal, whether such supplies can be despatched immediately, as will enable me to defend this post. 
</p><p>
The cannon in the bateaux were taken ; and near two tons of powder, which General Schuyler had for 
warded by Lieutenant-Colonel Allen, were unfortunately intercepted by a frigate, before it reached the camp. 
</p><p>
I hope my conduct, in these transactions, will meet with your Excellency's approbation. I have kept the 
importance of the cause in view, and acted according to the best of my understanding. I do not mean to 
reflect on any gentleman, who has had the command in this department; but, in my ideas of war, as there 
was nothing which promised success in the issue, it-would have been highly proper to have made this 
movement some weeks past, I am, with great respect, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient, humble servant,

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
By Mr. Harrison's letter, of the 2d instant, I am 
acquainted that yon have been informed "the regiments stationed on Dorchester Heights and Bunker's 
Hill have not been employed in carrying on the 
works for the defence of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>," which representation is an injurious falsehood; and I beg to be in 
formed who made it. I have paid the strictest attention to your instructions, and constantly employed the 
men, to the greatest advantage, in forwarding the 
works for the defence of the town and harbour of 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, that I could. Six companies of Colonel Sargent's regiment have been employed in demolishing 
the enemy's works on Bunker's Hill, and building the 
fort on Charlestown Point, until these were nearly 
completed. Since, the greatest part of them have been at work on Noddle's Island. Colonel Ilutchinson's regiment has been employed in the works on 
Dorchester Point, next to Castle Island, until that 
fort was nearly finished, and then I ordered part of 
the regiment to work on Castle Island in repairing 
the batteries there. I believe I can truly affirm that 
more work has never been done in the American army by an equal number of troops, than has been 
performed by the troops which are stationed here, in 
the same space of time ; but, because fifteen hundred 
men could not throw up works as fast as six or 
seven thousand had done in time past, there appeared 
to some people an unaccountable delay. 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to inform your Excellency 
that, on the 7th instant, Captain Tucker, commander 
of the armed schooner Hancock, took two brigs in 
the Bay (within sight of the men-of-war), and carried 
them into Lynn. One of them was from Cork, nine 
ty tons burden, laden with beef, pork, butter, and 
coal; the other was from the Western Islands, laden 
with wine and fruit, about one hundred tons burden. 
Neither of them gave any important intelligence ; 
they brought no papers nor letters that had any relation to public affairs. The master of the Irish vessel says he sailed from Cork the 1st of April ; that 
five regiments lay there ready to embark for America; that he heard that Hessians and Hanoverians 
were coming to America; but had not heard of any 
troops having sailed from Great Britain or Ireland 
for America this spring. I am

SIR, 
</p><p>
I am to inform your Excellency that yesterday afternoon, Captain Mugford, in the armed schooner 
Franklin, fell down in order to go out on a cruise, but ffot aground near Point Shhiev in the evening. 
</p><p>
Major Frazer's little armed schooner went down at 
the same time with the Franklin, and anchored not 
far from her. About midnight, a number of sail and 
other boats from the men-of-war attacked the two 
armed schooners. The people on board Major Frazer's 
cut their cable and came up. Captain Mugford was 
very fiercely attacked by twelve or thirteen boats, 
full of men ; but he and his men exerted themselves 
with remarkable bravery, beat off the enemy, sunk 
several of their boats, and killed a number of their 
men; it is supposed they lost sixty or seventy. The 
intrepid Captain Mugford fell a little before the enemy left his schooner; he was run through with a 
lance, while he was cutting off the hands of the pirates 
as they were attempting to board him ; and it is said 
that with his own hand he cut off five pairs of theirs. 
No other man was either killed or wounded on board 
the Franklin. 
</p><p>
These are all the particulars I have been able to 
collect, as but one man has yet come up from the 
schooner this morning. 
</p><p>
I am your Excellency's obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
ARTEMAS WARD. 
</p><p>
P. S. Mr. Mugford was not commissioned Captain 
of the Franklin, but master ; and, as the other officers 
had left the schooner, he took the command.

FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL THOMPSON. 
</p><p>
Camp at Sorel, 2 June, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The news of this country you will hear from the 
Honorable Commissioners of Congress. The prospect 
is rather unfavorable on our side at present, but I 
hope will clear up. 
</p><p>
On the night of the 31st ultimo, I received an account of General Carleton's having passed the Rapids 
of Richelieu, whilst I was at Chaniblee, attending a 
Council of War. I made no delay in setting out for 
this place, and arrived in time to prevent any bad 
consequences following the intelligence here. 
</p><p>
Having received information, that Colonel McLean, 
with about eight hundred regulars and Canadians, had 
advanced as for up as the Three Rivers, I have sent 
off Colonel St. Clair, with between six and seven 
hundred men, to attack his camp, if it can be done 
with the least probability of success. This may be 
a means to prevent the Canadians and savages from 
taking up arms against us, which they begin already 
to do, and might otherwise, in a little time, increase 
the number of the enemy to a very formidable force. 
Colonel St. Clair is an officer of great experience, 
and I make no doubt he will acquit himself well of 
his command. 
</p><p>
I have wrote to General Arnold, at Montreal, to 
send the Pennsylvania troops, in number about three 
hundred, from thence to join me here ; and likewise 
to the Baron, to send from St. John's the first regiment that arrives there. With those troops I may 
be able to make the most advantage of Colonel St. 
Clair's success, if he should prove fortunate, or support a retreat, if driven to that necessity. 
</p><p>
Had I arrived in this country two weeks sooner, with my reenforcement, I think we could have prevented General Carleton's passing Dechambeau this summer. Three thousand men could have defended Canada at that place, better than ten thousand can 
now we are out of possession of it. I now begin to 
entertain doubt of our ability to keep the Province. 
Our artillery is lost; and the New England troops 
are so much infected with, or afraid of, the small 
pox, as to almost prevent their doing duty. Could I 
have the command of the Jersey and Pennsylvania 
regiments, I still believe, if I could not keep the 
country, it would require at least five thousand men 
to oblige me to evacuate it, and that we could be 
easing the southern Colonies of so many enemies 
during the course of the campaign, and perhaps recover a little of the honor we have lately so lavishly 
thrown away. 
</p><p>
Mr. Chase is of opinion we may with safety break the capitulation made with General Arnold. T is extremely hard to give up all the fruits of the last 
year's campaign in Canada, which cost so much, and, what was still a greater loss to us, the life of General Montgomery, without even releasing our distressed friends in Quebec. But, if engagements of this delicate nature are broken, without the fullest testimony to support us, we shall be forever undone. 
</p><p>
I have sent off the sick and heavy baggage from hence, that, if I am reduced to the necessity of re treating, I can do it with little loss. 
</p><p>
Including the men that went with Colonel St. Clair, those employed in rowing his boats and gone 
to remove the sick, with fifty stationed on the opposite side of the St. Lawrence, the number of troops 
here is reduced to about two hundred. In a few days I shall be joined by Colonel Dehaas with his detachment. 
</p><p>
My greatest distress, at present, is on account of  
the unhappy situation of the Canadians, who have 
taken an active part with us, as I know not whether 
I shall long have it in my power to protect them 
from the vengeance of General Carleton, with which 
they are threatened. They apprehend the worst, and 
are truly objects of compassion. I am, my dear 
General, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate, humble servant,

SIR, 
</p><p>
I have to inform you that the Continental privateers brought into this port, the 18th instant, another 
Scotch transport, with a Highland company of grenadiers on board, consisting of upwards of an hundred, with their officers, with a few arms more than what 
belonged to the company. Each transport brings a considerable quantity of provisions for the troops. The prisoners are going into the country towns, 
agreeably to the order of Congress. 
</p><p>
The Colonel, mentioned in my last, is Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell, commander of one of General Frazer's battalions of Highlanders. He is a member of 
Parliament, and a gentleman of fortune. 
</p><p>
I must repeat my earnest request to be relieved 
immediately, as I have been so very ill for some time

prospect of recovering my health until I have a relaxation from business. I am,

</p><p>
GENERAL WASHINGTON, 
</p><p>
The most important matters are soon to be decided by arms. Unhappy it is, for the Massachusetts, and I fear for the whole Continent, that, at this season, 
we have a large and numerous Assembly. More than one half of the House are new members. Their decisions are most afflictingly slow, when every thing calls 
for the utmost ardor and despatch. The Lord have mercy on us ! This Colony, I imagine, will raise the men required by Congress before snow falls, but in 
no season for the relief of either <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> or Canada. 
</p><p>
Pray, Sir, consider what there is to be done. It 
is my clear opinion that there will not be a single 
company move in this Colony, for either of those 
places, these three weeks. I know, Sir, it will vex 
you; but your Excellency will not be alone in the 
vexation. My soul, at times, is ready to die within 
me at the delays; at others, my blood to press out 
at the pores of my body. But what shall be the 
expedients ? I never was good at them, but will 
venture to propose again the same I mentioned in 
my last; namely, that some, or all, of the five Continental regiments here be ordered to march, without 
one moment's delay, to Canada or <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, as the 
exigencies require. In such case they must be paid 
up their arrears, or nearly. In that way you will, in 
effect, get succours for <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> or Canada, or both, 
from this Colony. Our people are so jealous for their 
own safety (though you know, Sir, that I judge them 
at present in very little danger), that they will raise 
the militia for their own defence. 
</p><p>
I beg your Excellency to advert to the proposal a 
moment. Our own militia are as good, for all the 
intents answered, or to be answered here, by those 
regiments, as they are. They are much better for 
Canada or <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> than the militia. They are 
officered and organized, and well armed; the militia to be officered, armed and equipped. The differences 
are too many to be enumerated. If I may say it, I 
am astonished at the policy of Congress in ordering 
more regiments here, instead of ordering those which 
are here to parts where they are infinitely more 
needed. But my opinion is of little worth ; but, such 
as it is, I have given it. It may serve as a suggestion.

I am, may it please your Excellency, most sincerely yours,

The bearer, Mr. Joseph Belton, some time since

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I arrived here the 22d instant, after a tedious pas 
sage of sixty-six days from Quebec, on my parole of 
honor, to return when called for, a copy of which, 
together with my pass from General Carleton, is in 
closed. The original is in the hands of General Howe. 
I am to represent to your Excellency the situation 
of the unfortunate detachment that were made prison 
ers on the 31st December last. 
</p><p>
The number now in Quebec is about three hundred, 
including officers. The officers were confined in the 
Seminary, the soldiers in the Jesuits College, and 
were served with the same rations that were served 
to the garrison after the siege was raised. The officers had liberty to walk in a large garden that is 
adjoining the Seminary. The officers and privates are 
in great want of money, as they cannot procure clothing  without it, of which they are in great want. The 
officers are now considerably in debt for necessaries, 
exclusive of the garrison allowance. Generals Carleton and Howe have given their word for the protection of any private gentleman that may be sent with 
money, but will not admit that an officer of the army be sent. 
</p><p>
The prisoners bear their confinement with becoming fortitude, but are anxious for an exchange of prisoners, if it can be obtained consistent with the interest 
of their country. I am informed that Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell, of the Highlanders, has applied to General Howe for a cartel, and that Major French 
and others are anxious for an exchange. In February last, the officers, prisoners at Quebec, petitioned General Carleton for an exchange of prisoners, provided 
our country should approve it. The General received the petition, read it, and told the officer that presented it, that he would consider of it, but returned 
no other answer. 
</p><p>
I intended to have waited on your Excellency myself, but was advised, by the gentlemen in <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a> and this town, not to do it without your Excellency's advice, as it would be undoubtedly known to General Howe, and perhaps even represented that I had joined the army, or was giving intelligence, for 
which he might immediately demand me. When I gave my parole to General Carleton, he told me Major Skene, son to Governor Skene, had arrived at 
Quebec two days before, and that he should not employ him till he had the advice of the King of England. 
</p><p>
I have sent by the bearer a number of unsealed letters, which I brought from the prisoners at Quebec. I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, your Excellency's

Haerlem, 9 August, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
It is with peculiar pleasure that I acknowledge 
the receipt of your Excellency's favor of yesterday, 
since I cannot but consider it as an additional mark 
of that confidence with which your Excellency has 
hitherto honored me. I have made the proper use 
of it, and imparted it, in confidence, to the members 
of the Convention, on whose secrecy I thought I 
could most safely rely, and from whose influence I 
hoped to draw the most effectual assistance. 
</p><p>
I early foresaw what has since happened, and 
therefore made it my endeavour to enforce the drawing  out as much of the strength of this State as 
could possibly be collected. I cannot but hope that 
the good effect of this measure will very shortly appear. A considerable body of troops will, as we 
suppose, begin their march for King's Bridge to-morrow, and I flatter myself that in five or six days 
their number will be increased to sixteen or eighteen 
hundred men. Such is my idea of the importance 
of this post, that I could wish your Excellency to 
count as little as possible upon the raw troops we 
send there, but to send thither all you originally designed for that station. Your Excellency is best able 
to judge whether it can be rendered tenable without 
some cannon, gunners, and matrosses ; and how far it is prudent to supply that want under which it now 
labors, by sending them from some other place. 
</p><p>
Since I am upon this subject, I will take the 
liberty to hint what may possibly have escaped your 
Excellency's attention, in the multiplicity of business 
in which you are involved; I mean the possibility 
of the enemy's destroying the bridge (if their fleet 
should get above the town) by means of a body of 
troops sent up the creek in boats, before any assist 
ance could come in, unless some small work was 
thrown up there for its defence, which the situation 
renders very practicable. 
</p><p>
The troops raised on Long Island, and which we 
have subjected to your Excellency's command, and 
ordered to join General Greene's brigade, may amount 
to about eight hundred men; but as part of them 
are very remote, they may possibly not all arrive at 
their stations in less than eight days. 
</p><p>
We shall, this morning, endeavour to raise some 
more of our militia, to occupy the passes in the 
Highlands, and that of the northern counties, which 
we have hitherto reserved in case of any misfortunes 
happening to the army at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>. I fear they 
will not come in time to assist your Excellency at 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, if the enemy should be speedy in their 
attack, as they are very remote and ill armed. perhaps we may be able to send some of the neighbouring  militia to General Greene, to be dismissed when 
the Long Island levies are all come in. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency may be assured that the little 
influence I have shall be exerted to forward any 
operations which your Excellency may form, since I 
am fully satisfied that they will always be directed 
by that spirit of patriotism which has so deservedly 
secured to you the esteem of this Continent; and 
shall therefore think it a happiness to be honored 
with your commands. I have the honor to be, with 
the greatest esteem and respect, your Excellency's 
Most obedient, humble servant,

Lebanon, 31 August, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Adjutant-General Reed's letter, of the 24th instant, 
came to hand Tuesday morning, the 27th; yours, of 
the same date, yesterday. 
</p><p>
On receiving the former, I advised with my council. We concluded to send Benjamin Huntington, Esq., 
one of my Council, with direction to take with him 
Major Ely, at New London, an officer there well acquainted with the people on Long Island, to proceed 
there and consult and agree with some of the sure 
friends of our cause, with secrecy, as far as the circumstances would admit, for a number of their men, 
assured friends, and well acquainted on the Island, to 
join with a body from this State, if possible to accomplish your wishes, to cause a diversion to the enemy, to harass them on their rear, and to prevent 
24 
their excursions in pursuit of the provisions the 
Island affords. I hear they sailed for the Island 
yesterday. His return is expected the beginning of 
next week. 
</p><p>
If he succeeds according to our hopes, no exertion. of this State, I trust, will be wanting, at this 
critical conjuncture, to harass and keep the enemy 
at bay, to gain time and every advantage the case 
may admit. I shall give the earliest intelligence of 
our proceedings, that you may cooperate with our 
designs. The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong. It is nothing with God to help, 
whether many, or with those that have no power. 
He hath so ordered things, in the administration of 
the affairs of the world, as to encourage the use of 
means ; and yet, so as to keep men in continual dependence upon him for the efficacy and success of 
them ; to make kings and all men to know the reins 
of the world are not in their hands, but that there 
is One above who sways and governs all things here 
below. 
</p><p>
I am closing. A post comes in, and brings the 
letters, copies of which are inclosed. I now expect 
Mr. Huntington's speedy return. Have sent for my 
Council. My own thoughts, and such as come to 
me, are to send forward four or five of the compa 
nies now stationed at New London, with four field-pieces, I hope six pieces, to join those men which 
may be ready for the service on Long Island ; four 
or five companies to follow from New London as 
soon as they can be marched down; and also to or 
der on other companies to take the places of such 
as are removed from thence. 
</p><p>
I am inclined to think we shall fall upon some measure similar to what is mentioned. No delay can be admitted at this critical moment. Please to 
give me the earliest intelligence how we may best serve agreeably to your desires. 
</p><p>
Shall send in the morning this intelligence to Governor Cooke, of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, and ask his assistance 
in the best way he shall think the circumstances of that State will admit. 
</p><p>
September \st. Inclosed is a copy of another letter, dated yesterday, from Southold, that you may 
observe the contents. I hope to pursue our measures so as to stop the enemy getting into Suffolk 
county. I am, with esteem and regard, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient, humble servant,

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I have been confined two days by a fever, which 
has not yet left me ; it is a great mortification that I have it not in my power to attend at head-quarters. It would, however, have been impossible for 
any officers from this place to be in time at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. By some neglect of the messenger, your letter 
was not delivered till seven this morning. General Roberdeau waits on your Excellency to know the 
result of your determinations, and to inform you of the state of the troops in New Jersey. 
</p><p>
My ideas of the operations for this campaign are 
to prevent the enemy from executing their plan of a 
junction between the armies of Howe and Burgoyne, 
on which the expectations of the King and Ministry 
are fixed. We should keep <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, if possible, 
as the acquiring of that will give eclat to the arms 
of Britain, afford the soldiers good quarters, and furnish a safe harbour for the fleet. If it even could 
be retained a month or two, keeping the field so 
long in this climate may be supposed to affect the 
health of European troops very much. On the other 
hand, a free and safe communication with the countries, from whence supplies of men and provisions 
can come to your army, is a consideration of superior moment to any other. 
</p><p>
How far both those objects may be within the 
compass of your Excellency's force, I cannot pretend 
to judge, having a very inadequate knowledge of the 
particulars necessary to found an opinion upon. I 
have not seen Colonel Clark, but gave general orders 
at all the posts along the Jersey shore, that the 
troops from Maryland should proceed immediately to 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. I hope to be able, very soon, to effect 
some enterprise on Staten Island, when we have a 
sufficient number of men for the Flying Camp to 
dispose along the different posts ; but the militia are 
not the men for such a purpose. Four Colonels were 
with me some nights ago, to inform that their men 
would fight the enemy on this side, but would not 
go over to Staten Island. I have the honor to be, 
Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

</p><p>
MY DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Your favor of this morning is just put into my 
hands. In answer I must beg leave to inform you, that our conference with Lord Howe has been attended which no immediate advantages. He declared 
that he had no powers to consider us as independent States ; and we easily discovered that, were we still 
dependent, we should have nothing to expect from those with which he is vested. He talked altogether 
in generals; that he came out here to consult, advise, and confer with gentlemen of the greatest influence 
in the Colonies, about their complaints; that the King would revise the Act of Parliament, and royal instructions, upon such reports as should be made ; 
and appeared to fix our redress upon his Majesty's good will and pleasure. This kind of conversation 
lasted for several hours, and, as I have already said, without any effect. 
</p><p>
Our reliance continues, therefore, to be, under God, on your wisdom and fortitude, and that of your 
forces ; that you may be as successful as I know you are worthy, is my most sincere wish. 
</p><p>
I saw Mrs. <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> the evening before I left <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. She was well. I gave Mr. Griffin a letter from her for you. The gentlemen beg their

FROM SIR WILLIAM HOWE. 
</p><p>
Head-Quarters, York Island, 21 September, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I have the favor of your letters of the 6th and 
19th current. In consequence of the latter, direction. are given for Major-General Sullivan being conveyed to <a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a> on the earliest day, and I 
conclude Major-General Prescott will return in the 
same boat. 
</p><p>
The exchange you propose, of Brigadier-General Alexander, commonly called Lord Stirling, for Mr. McDonald, cannot take place, as he has only the 
rank of Major by my commission ; but I shall readily 
send any Major in the inclosed lists of prisoners, that 
you will be pleased to name, in exchange for him ; 
and, that Lord Stirling may not be detained, I would 
propose to exchange him for Governor Montfort 
Brown, although the latter is no longer in the military line.
</p><p>
Inclosed you have a list of the officers belonging 
to the army under my command, who are your prisoners. It is not so correct as I could wish, having 
received no regular return of the officers of the forty-second and seventy-first regiments, taken this year ; 
but beg leave to refer you to Lieutenant-Colonel 
Campbell, of the seventy-first, to rectify any omissions 
that may be; and I am to desire you will put, opposite to their names, such of your officers, of equal 
rank, as you would have in exchange for them. The names of the non-commissioned officers and privates, 
prisoners with you, are not sent, being unnecessary ; 
but the return, herewith inclosed, specifies the number, and I shall redeem them by a like number of 
those in my possession ; for which purpose I shall 
send Mr. Joshua Loring, my Commissary, to <a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a>, as a proper place for the exchange of prisoners, on any day you may appoint, wishing it to 
be an early one, wherein I presume you will concur, 
as it is proposed for the more speedy relief of the distressed. 
</p><p>
As it may be some time before Mr. Lovell arrives 
here from Halifax, though I took the first opportunity 
of sending for him after your agreement to exchange 
him for Governor Skene, I am willing to believe, 
upon my assurances of Mr. Lovell's being sent to 
you immediately on his arrival, that you will not 
have any objections to granting the Governor his 
liberty, without delay; and am induced to make the 
proposal for your compliance, neither of the persons 
being connected with military service. 
</p><p>
General Carleton has sent from Canada a number 
of officers and privates, as per return inclosed, to 
whom he has given liberty upon their paroles ; and 
in pursuance of his desire and their engagements to 
him, I shall send them to <a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a> on the 
earliest day. It is, nevertheless, the General's expect 
ation, that the exchange of prisoners, as settled by 
Captain Forster, in Canada, will be duly complied 
with; and I presume you are sufficiently sensible of 
the sacred regard that is ever paid to engagements 
of this kind, [not] to suffer any infringement upon 
the plighted faith of Colonel Arnold. 
</p><p>
It is with much concern, that I cannot close this 
letter without representing the ill treatment which, I am too well informed, the King's officers now suffer 
in common jails, throughout the Province of New 
England. I apply to your feelings alone for redress, 
having no idea of committing myself by an act of 
retaliation upon those in my power. 
</p><p>
My Aid-de-camp, charged with the delivery of this 
letter, will present you with a ball cut and fixed to 
the end of a nail, taken from a number of the same 
kind found in the encampments quitted by your troops 
on the 15th instant. I do not make any comment 
upon such unwarrantable and malicious practices, being  well assured the contrivance has not come to your 
knowledge. I am, with due regard, Sir,

Your most obedient servant,

<a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a>, 12 October, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I should do great injustice to the polite attention 
with which your Excellency has listened to the undigested opinions which I have sometimes offered, if 
I did not, without any apology, give my sentiments 
freely on the present alarming condition of this Colony, and submit to your Excellency's better judgment 
such measures as will, in my idea, be most likely to insure success. 
</p><p>
Since, upon experiment (contrary to the general 
sentiment), it appears that the passage of the river 
is not effectually obstructed, the present situation of 
the army, though not exactly similar, bears some 
resemblance to that in which it was at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
The enemy may land above and reduce your Excellency to the necessity of attacking them at their 
landing, or of suffering them to seize upon passes 
from which it will be impossible to dislodge them; 
nor (such is the peculiar situation of the country and 
the vicinity of the Sound) will it be very difficult 
so to station themselves as to render every supply 
going to our camp extremely precarious. This, too, 
may be done with a part of their forces, while the 
remainder, having their retreat secured, may, at their 
leisure, ravage the open country beyond the High 
lands, encourage the disaffected, and, by their assistance, carry their arms to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, which would, while 
it distressed the troops in your Excellency's camp, 
inevitably destroy the Northern army. 
</p><p>
To stay at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, without daily supplies, 
would be impossible ; a march to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> would be 
equally so, without carriages or horses to carry their 
provisions or stores, or a sufficient number of boats 
to transport them in time across Lake George. No 
other means would be left them but to retreat into 
New England, without stores, artillery, or provisions, 
in which case their strength would soon be dissipated 
by desertions, or the whole body separated through 
want of necessaries. 
</p><p>
These fears may appear ideal to those who do not 
reflect, that the distance from the Highlands to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> is but one hundred miles; that the road from 
<a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> is equally distant, through a 
broken and almost uninhabited country; that most of 
the militia of this State that can be armed, or depended on, are in your Excellency's camp ; and that 
all the men which we have at present ventured to 
call upon, in addition to those in service, do not Exceed three hundred, and even these we have little 
reason to expect that we shall obtain. Add to this, that bodies of men are already enlisted throughout 
this State, and, we have reason to fear, are already collecting under the direction of disguised officers in the Highlands. 
</p><p>
Those evils might, in my humble opinion, be fully 
guarded against by sending a single regiment with 
a good engineer, to take possession of the passes in 
the Highlands, and by forming two camps, the one 
to secure the passes into Connecticut (which might 
be done by the militia of the New England States), 
the other at or near the place where the ships now 
lie in the North River, which would reduce the enemy to the necessity of attacking the lines in front, 
or expose them, if they landed above, to the danger 
of being surrounded. The very reputation of such 
camp being formed, will prevent their making any 
such attempts, and, in case of any misfortune at New 
York, will afford a secure retreat, and effectually prevent the enemy from pushing their advantage, more 
especially if all stores, which are not absolutely necessary for the army, are removed to this place. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency has, I dare say, seen the necessity of laying up magazines of provisions, and collecting materials for barracks, at or near this place, 
that the want of them should not, in case of a defeat, oblige the army to separate. Were not the 
treasury of this State exhausted by the uncommon expense to which we have been put by the disaffection of our own people, the debt due from the continent, and the disappointment we have met with in 
striking money, the Convention of this State would 
have done something therein at their own risk. Mr. Hubbard promised to give your Excellency some in 
formation relative to the forts in the Highlands, and 
the General that commands. The subject is too deli 
cate for a letter. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency sees the opinion I have of your 
patience and good nature, by my venturing to obtrude upon them these crude and hasty remarks, 
which I have not even leisure to copy. Perhaps I 
might find some excuse for them in my anxiety for 
the great cause your Excellency supports, and my 
knowledge of a country which you have had no opportunity to explore. I have the honor to be, with 
the greatest respect, your Excellency's

<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 7 January, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1777">1777</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
We were this day honored with your favor of the 
5th instant, which arrived in time to forward the in-closures by post. We waited, with impatience, to 
learn the consequence of your late movements, and 
have been highly gratified; at the same time, we see 
plainly some important event is still to happen. The 
enemy must mean to evacuate the Jerseys, or give 
you battle. The latter may be ruinous in its consequences to either party, and therefore it is probable 
will only be sought for by those that have the superiority. This, we fondly hope, will fall to your lot, if 
joined by General Heath and General McDougall, 
and the Jersey militia, as we are taught to expect 
will be the case. Should they lo&o a battle, or evacuate Jersey, surely they cannot afterwards make out 
a decent paragraph for Gaines's infamous paper, after 
being outgeneralled and obliged to abandon the country they thought themselves securely possessed of. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will find inclosed a paper herein, 
drawn up by a Captain Gamble, lately a prisoner on 
board the fleet in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. He declares that the 
treatment of both sea and land prisoners, in that place, is shocking to humanity. This man deserves 
credit, and his account of their ill usage is confirmed 
by all the prisoners that come from thence. As to 
the information that he gives at the bottom of his 
paper, he says he will forfeit his life if every tittle 
of it is not as near to the truth as possible for an 
inquisitive man, in his situation, to come at. We 
think this would be a good time to remonstrate to 
General Howe and Lord Howe against the base usage 
our people meet with, and to threaten immediate retaliation on the British prisoners in our possession, if 
they do not alter their conduct. 
</p><p>
It is probable General Howe may say it is contrary to orders, and not with his knowledge, if our 
people suffer; but this is not sufficient. Our poor 
soldiers and sailors are perishing for want of food, 
fresh air, and cleanliness, whilst those of theirs, in 
our possession, are feasting on the fat of this land. 
They have said we treat them well through fear. It 
is time to convince them we are not afraid, although 
we are actuated by principles of humanity. But those 
principles HOAV dictate the necessity of severe usage 
to British officers in particular, that they may here 
after make it a point, for their own sakes, to see 
proper care taken of those that fall within their 
power. 
</p><p>
Depend on it, good Sir, we do not write in this 
style to gratify any feelings of our own. They are 
all repugnant to what we propose. Lieutenant Josiah 
has just called on us, and confirms the account of ill 
usage, &c. He says he was exchanged for Lieutenant 
Ball, and that no person has been given up for Lieu 
tenant Boger, now in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. There is a Captain 
Burke, that was formerly Captain Manly's Lieutenant 
in his successful cruise. Burke succeeded to the com-VOL. i. 28mand of Manly's vessel; was taken by the Liverpool 
frigate, to which Mr. Boger belongs; and Captain 
Bellen sent Burke to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> for the express purpose of having him exchanged for Boger; and, as he 
is said to be a very good officer, has been ill used, 
and suffered a good deal, we dare say your Excellency will demand his release by the first flag. We 
have the honor to be, Sir,

FROM WILLIAM DUER. 
</p><p>
Camp in Westchester Comity, 28 January, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1777">1777</a>. 
</p><p>
I beg leave to introduce to your Excellency's acquaintance Mr. Sacket, a member of the Convention 
of the State, a man of honor, and of firm attachment 
to the American cause. 
</p><p>
He will communicate to your Excellency some 
measures taken by him and myself, which, if properly prosecuted, may be of infinite utility to the present military operations. I have, therefore, recommended it to him to wait on you in person, in hopes 
that some systematical plan may be adopted and prosecuted for facilitating your manoeuvres against the 
British army. 
</p><p>
To say more in a letter, might be imprudent, I 
shall, therefore, content myself with observing, that 
Mr. Sacket is, as I know by experience, a person 
of intrigue and secrecy, well calculated to prosecute 
such measures as you shall think conducive to give 
success to your generous exertions in the cause of 
America. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency Avill likewise receive from Mr. 
Sacket a confidential account of our operations in 
this quarter. I wish I could say they had been conducted in such a manner as to create, either a diversion in favor of the army in Jersey, or, at least, to 
drive the enemy from this county. On the contrary, 
it is obvious to every discerning person, that we 
have been insulted by a handful of traitorous ban 
ditti, and that we run a risk of either being routed or 
cut off by a night surprise, or of abandoning this 
part of the country with disgrace. 
</p><p>
As I have been appointed, by the Convention of 
the State of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, a member of a Committee 
for cooperating in the design formed by your Excellency for driving the enemy from this quarter, I 
esteem it my duty to inform you, that I have no 
manner of doubt but it has been in our power to 
cut off the communication of Fort Independence with 
York Island, and to make ourselves masters of the 
garrison, with a loss noways proportionable to the 
benefits which would inevitably result from such a 
measure. This is still in our power; but how long 
it will continue so, I will not pretend to determine. 
Certain I am, that, unless a decisive and systematic plan is devised and prosecuted in a very short time, 
your success will be counterbalanced by our disgrace ; 
that many good officers and men, who have come 
down as volunteers, will return home; that the militia, should any come in, will grow languid ; that our 
enemies will triumph ; and that the timid Whigs, who 
have been roused from their late lethargy or despair, 
from your Excellency's successful efforts, will either 
relapse into the same supineness, or take an active 
part with our enemies. 
</p><p>
It would be needless and impertinent in me to 
point out to your Excellency the very great advantages, which would result from our making ourselves 
masters of this county. I shall only content myself 
with observing that, if no other purposes were to be 
answered by this expedition but those of laying up 
magazines of forage for the next campaign, the raising  of recruits for the Continental army, and preventing  the disaffected from taking part with the enemy, 
it is an object worthy our greatest exertions. 
</p><p>
Brigadier-General Parsons, who came down with us 
from <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>, is gone to Connecticut, not choosing, 
as I conceive, to run the risk of his reputation by 
a longer stay here. Colonel Dubois, who has come 
down with the York militia as a volunteer, and who 
has repeatedly offered his service to destroy King's 
Bridge, will, I fear, return to-morrow, despairing to 
see any thing effectual done. 
</p><p>
Should your Excellency wish to know to what our 
want of success is to be attributed, I must beg leave 
to refer to your own judgment of the character of 
men; observing only that it is my private opinion 
that, if measures could be devised, without injuring 
the public service, that either General Mifflin, General 
Parsons, or General Clinton, could direct our operation. in this part of the county of Westchester, that 
the enemy would not only be driven from this county, but other measures might probably be devised for 
pushing our success and harassing the enemy. At 
the request of General Heath, I devised means of 
his obtaining the best intelligence of the enemy's 
strength and disposition. Would to heaven we had 
profited by it! I write with an aching heart, and in 
a great hurry, so that your Excellency will excuse 
both my freedom and inaccuracy. I have long in 
tended to return; but shall wait the return of Mr. Sacket, in hopes that some more regular counsels 
may be formed, and more vigorous measures prosecuted, in this quarter. 
</p><p>
As I am informed that your Excellency is raising 
several new battalions, the officers of which are to be 
of your appointment, I beg leave to inform you that 
Mr. John Livingston, a son of Mr. Robert Livingston, 
lord of the manor of that name, is anxious to enter 
the service in a regiment to be commanded by Gentlemen. He is a young gentleman of a high spirit, 
of honor, and undoubted bravery. I have, therefore, 
no doubt but he will raise his own reputation, and 
do justice to your appointment, if you should think 
proper to give him the offer of a Lieutenant-Colonel's 
commission. I beg to know from your Excellency 
whether my application can be complied with. It is 
with great reluctance I ever venture to recommend; 
but I know this young gentleman so well, that I 
will risk my reputation upon his behaving himself 
with distinguished resolution, should he have an opportunity of embracing the military profession. I am, 
with great respect,

Permit me to acknowledge the receipt of your favor by Mr. Sacket, by which I esteem myself much 
honored. I wish I had it in my power to give you

imagine would have been successful beyond expectation, had it not been for certain reasons. When I 
found that it was all dwindled into a mere foraging 
business, that our little corps was headed by three 
Major-Generals and two Brigadier-Generals, while my 
command, in point of numbers, was reduced to that 
of a, Major, I thought it my duty, as well to save 
public expense as to be where I could be more useful, to return to the Convention. I left the command of my little handful to Major Fish, who, with another 
Major of this State, very early, a few mornings 
ago, surprised and killed three light-horsemen of the 
enemy out of six, wounded another, and took one 
horse ; and had it not been for the too great promptitude of the other Major, who killed one of the enemy with his own hand, the whole little party would 
probably have fallen into our hands. This effort, how 
ever, in a young man, though not altogether prudent, 
yet for a militia officer, whom I would much rather 
see rash than cowardly, is commendable. His name 
is Van Rensselaer. He was Major in my brigade, under Colonel Humphrey, in the last campaign. I am 
pleased to see our officers brave. Service will teach 
them discipline and prudence. 
</p><p>
I am sorry to be obliged to inform you that our 
Convention, in spite of my every effort to prevent it, 
have resolved to adjourn to Esopus, for no other reason than because their lodging here was inconvenient. 
The reasons of a public nature against the removal 
are weighty. Permit me, Sir, to mention them. First, 
the danger that the blocking up of the channel will 
be neglected. Secondly, the danger that the internal 
enemies in Duchess and Westchester will rise up 
in arms. Thirdly, the danger of the oppression, and 
therefore the loss, of the well-affected in those counties. Fourthly, the danger that our foraging will be 
discontinued. And, fifthly, the danger that the New 
York troops will not be properly equipped for the 
field. 
</p><p>
These, in my humble opinion, were sufficient to exclude from consideration every article of private 
convenience ; and you would be surprised were I to 
inform you who were the principal agents in bringing  about the resolve to adjourn. If, Sir, you should view the matter in the same light that I do, I am 
sure you would do every thing in your power to bring them back. I hope I may be honored in my 
opinion by a conformity of sentiments in you. Should this be the case, a line from you will, in consequence 
of the great deference I am sure they pay you, have the desired effect. Were the matter now to be moved, 
it could not be carried. They seized the lucky moment. If you should think it advisable to write to 
them on the subject, I beg you may do it without delay, and conceal the quarter from whence you obtained your information. 
</p><p>
You may think it vanity in me, Sir, to add my 
application to that of our Convention, for the Exchange of the four officers of my brigade, concerning 
whom they write to you. My only motive for doing 
it is, that perhaps my assurance of their merit, on a 
personal knowledge of them, may have some weight. 
I am, Sir, with every possible assurance of real respect 
and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant,

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I esteem it as a singular honor, done me by your 
Excellency, in offering me the post of Adjutant-General; and it pains me sensibly that I am obliged to 
decline it. It is an honor to which I did not aspire, 
because I did not account myself equal to the import 
ant business of the office. Your Excellency does not 
mistake my attachment to the interests of the United 
States. It is sincere and unalterable. But my military character, which you are pleased to mention as 
a motive to the appointment, is, in my own estimation, of no great account. I have, it is true, studied 
the rudiments of the military art, but have very 
small, or rather no pretensions to capacity and skill 
in the important scenes of war, and much fear I 
should disappoint your Excellency's expectations concerning me. 
</p><p>
I have domestic reasons and private concerns, which 
powerfully urge my staying at home ; but these I 
should not mention, did they exist alone. But, be 
side the command of a regiment of militia on the 
sea-coast, I hold divers civil offices, which are sufficient to engage my constant attention; those of 
Judge of one of the Maritime Courts, Judge of the 
Inferior Court of Common Pleas, acting Justice of 
Peace and Register of Deeds for the County of Es 
sex. The exercise of these offices I could, without 
any very great inconvenience, quit for a season ; and, 
therefore, at the time of making the late levy of militia, as there appeared some backwardness in the people, I encouraged their engaging, and stepped forth 
and offered my own personal service. 
</p><p>
Nevertheless, I would forever abandon all these 
employments, if I thought myself capable of doing 
more service to my country, by acting in the office 
to which your Excellency has been pleased to invite 
me. But, as I do not thus think of myself, and conceive it not difficult to find a person not otherwise 
employed, and, to say the least, as able to discharge 
the duties of the office as I, I must beg leave to decline it. I am, with the greatest veneration, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

Salem, 14 April, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1777">1777</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I sent, by the express, an answer to your letter 
respecting the office of Adjutant-General, and gave 
what appeared to me sufficient reasons to excuse my 
declining to accept it; but I have since been uneasy 
lest you should deem them otherwise, and that I was 
too willing, under the civil offices I sustain, to shelter 
myself from the dangers and fatigues of war; an 
opinion which, if it has taken place, I wish to remove. 
</p><p>
The case was this. I had concluded to accept the 
office ; but, meeting with a number of unavoidable 
interruptions in the way of business, was unable to 
give my answer to the express till the evening, at 
eight o clock, at which time I had directed him to 
call, and it was then, in fact, sealed up, and ready 
to be delivered ; the same which I now inclose to 
your Excellency. But the express delaying his coming  a full hour, I of course continued to revolve the 
matter in my mind, and, upon a review of the reasons 
on both sides of the question, those against my accepting the post, increased by the suggestions of my 
nearest friend, whose happiness and tranquillity of 
mind lay near my heart, preponderated, and occasioned the answer your Excellency has already received. 
Besides the reasons there given, others weighed with 
me, which I had not time to mention. The civil offices I sustain yield me an income that contents me, 
and, in a time of peace, would maintain my family. 
These I must have relinquished, without an expectation of resuming them. Consequently, had I taken 
the post of Adjutant-General, and some cause had arisen (an event far from impossible), rendering it 
expedient for me to quit the camp, I should have returned divested of the principal means of supporting my family. 
</p><p>
Whenever I thought of a military employment, the 
condition of my eyes was no small discouragement to 
me. I am so near-sighted that I, although placed in 
the best situation, cannot, with any degree of accuracy, 
discern the position of a body of men beyond the 
size of a single regiment. It is true, in viewing Distant objects, my spectacles help me to see nearly as 
well as people in general do with the naked eye ; 
but they are frail things; and rain or snow beating 
against them (I found in the winter's campaign) so 
obstructs the vision as to render them almost useless. 
My business as Register of Deeds had, by my absence, got behindhand ; it seemed to be daily increasing , and my office was riot in such order as I wished 
to leave it in to a successor. These, with the reasons 
mentioned in my former letter, and many others of 
lesser moment, determined my answer in the negative. I regretted the proposal could not have been 
made me while at head-quarters, where I could 
have inquired particularly into the nature and Extent of the office of Adjutant-General, and thence 
judged more certainly whether or not I was able to 
discharge the duties of it. The want of such information left doubts on my mind that were no small 
obstacle to my accepting it. 
</p><p>
On the other hand, I am sensible that to support 
the army is of essential importance ; that on the failure of it, besides the general calamity of my country, every prospect of advantage or enjoyment to me 
must vanish. I have been, therefore, ever ready to 
serve the public to the utmost of my power. But 
perhaps the comforts of civil life, the love of ease, 
the enjoyment of my friends, and the powerful allurements springing from the nearest connection on earth, 
have led me to mistake the object. From a sacred 
regard, therefore, to the interests of my country ; from 
the ardent desire I have to approve myself to your 
Excellency; from the pain it has given me to deny 
the request of the last of men to whom I would refuse any thing, I submit the whole matter to your 
Excellency's determination. If, upon a view of all 
circumstances, you judge it my duty to exchange 
the civil for a military life, I will do it. And then, 
should the office of Adjutant-General (for, from what 
conception I have of it, none would be more agreeable) 
be once more vacant, or any other post or employment present, to which you shall deem me competent, 
I will not again confer with flesh and blood, but instantly obey your Excellency's commands. 
</p><p>
I beg your Excellency's pardon for imposing on your patience this second long letter. But I feared lest, by my backwardness, I might have offended. 
And I was led to make the above tender of my services, because your Excellency's good opinion of me, and the urgency of your request, have raised me to 
sonic importance with myself. I am, with the highest veneration and esteem for your Excellency, your Excellency's

New Windsor, 18 April, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1777">1777</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Being from home when your Excellency's letter of 
the 31st ultimo was left at my house, prevented my 
answering it by the return of the express, and till 
now I have not had any other opportunity. Before 
the receipt of it, I had, in consequence of powers 
given me by the Convention of this State, ordered 
out about twelve hundred of the militia of this and 
Orange county; five hundred of them to relieve Colonel Pawling, at the post near Sydman's Bridge, and 
do the duties which had been assigned him, as the 
time for which his regiment stood engaged was Expired; the remainder to reenforce the garrison of 
Fort Montgomery, and carry on the works necessary 
for its defence. I also ordered from Dutchess county 
eight hundred, and three hundred and fifty from 
Westchester, to reenforce the garrisons on the west 
side of Hudson's River, and to give protection to the 
inhabitants of the latter county, into which, for want 
of a proper force, the enemy make frequent incur 
sions, and take off large droves of cattle, horses, and 
other supplies. 
</p><p>
The unhappy affair at <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> and apprehension, 
entertained by our Convention, that the enemy might 
surprise and take our forts in the Highlands, induced 
me to take this step without waiting to get your Excellency's approbation of the measure. I Avonld 
fain hope that it will not be disagreeable, as these 
troops, if wanted, are to continue in service till the 1st 
of August ; yet they may be dismissed at any time 
before, and great pains have been taken to draw 
them out in such a manner as to promote the recruiting  service, and I doubt not but it will be a means 
to complete our regiments for the standing army 
much sooner than they otherwise would have been. 
As yet, however, not above one half of the above 
number of militia have inarched, and I much fear the 
whole will not easily be got out, if ever so much 
wanted. 
</p><p>
I most sincerely thank your Excellency for the 
very polite and kind manner in which you are pleased to mention my appointment to a command in the 
Continental army. At the same time my precarious 
state of health, and want of military knowledge, 
would have rather induced me to have led a more 
retired life than that of the army, had I been consulted on the occasion, and at liberty of pursuing my 
own inclinations. But as, early in the present contest, I laid it down as a maxim not to refuse my 
best, though poor, services to my country, in any 
way they should think proper to employ me, on this 
principle I cannot refuse the honor done me by congress in the present appointment; and shall be happy 
if, in my best endeavours to serve my country in the 
military line, I shall at any time prove so successful 
as to merit your Excellency's approbation. 
</p><p>
We have, some considerable time since, drawn the 
chain across the river at Fort Montgomery ; and as 
the tide, as it is now fixed, has not the least impression on it, and it is greatly strengthened by a number of anchors and cables, I am in hopes it will 
answer some good end. The works in the river near 
this place go on well, and I have not the least doubt 
but they will be effectual when completed; and had 
the Convention suffered rne to have paid my whole 
attention to this business, it would have been the 
case nearly by this time. As it is, they are in great 
forwardness, and in a few days will become formidable. The companies for which I nominated officers, 
are successful in recruiting, two of them having already near thirty men each. I, through mistake, appointed a First-Lieutenant more than I was directed; 
and as he is an active person, and has enlisted a 
number of men, I wish he could be provided for. I 
am, with the highest esteem, 
</p><p>

SIR, 
</p><p>
The wind blowing fresh northerly on Monday, and 
likely to continue for two or three days, when I received a little provision for the men, I marched, at ten 
at night, with about twelve hundred, and one field-piece, towards Bedford, in hopes to fall in with the enemy there, from the intelligence contained in Number 
Eight of the inclosure. At ten the next morning, I 
arrived at the south end of the town, at the road 
leading from Ridgefield, which is ten miles from Bed 
ford. I had but just arrived there, when two Expresses came in, and informed me that the enemy 
had left Ridgefield that morning at daybreak, and 
inarched towards Norwalk, which is but seventeen 
miles from the former; and that they had met with 
no opposition all the morning. This intelligence deprived me of all hopes of coming up with them, in 
that distance, as they had rested at Ridgefield the 
night before, and we had inarched twenty-one miles, 
through very rough ground, without sleep or refreshment. Although I hoped the public and my superiors would justify iny risking this post, when there 
was some prospect of advancing the service, yet I 
considered it madness to risk it in a fruitless pursuit 
of the enemy, and therefore returned here this moment, after a very fatiguing march, which the troops 
endured with great patience. 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 26th found me at Bedford, and that of the 28th two miles south of Croton Bridge. 
The inclosures will give all the intelligence I am possessed of. I am

SIR, 
</p><p>
I had the honor to receive your Excellency's letter by Colonel Lee, conferring upon me the office of 
Adjutant-General; and since, notwithstanding all my objections, it is your Excellency's pleasure, I am happy to declare my acceptance of it. At the same 
time, I am constrained, from my real feelings, again to express my fears that I shall fall short of your Excellency's expectations. Few people are competent 
judges of military abilities ; and most are apt to form their opinions very superficially. Hence I have as 
often been mortified as pleased by the favorable sentiments which some have expressed concerning me, 
conscious that many times I did not merit their applause. I know not who have recommended me to 
your Excellency ; I wish they may not have judged too favorably of my abilities. However, I am deter 
mined to exert myself to the utmost to serve your Excellency and my country; and if, after all, I fail of executing the office with propriety, seeing I at first 
declined it. partly from an apprehension of inability, your Excellency will acquit me of presumption in accepting it at your repeated request. 
</p><p>
My affairs are complicated, but I will prepare to attend you with all possible despatch. General Glover accepts the post assigned him, and we shall 
doubtless go to head-quarters together. I am, Sir,

</p><p>
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 
</p><p>
We have examined the obstructions in the North 
River, and beg leave to observe, that the object is 
too important to be trusted to its present security. 
If those obstructions in the river can be rendered 
effectual, and the passes into the Highlands be properly guarded, which can be done with about four or 
five thousand troops, the rest of the army will be at 
liberty to operate elsewhere. 
</p><p>
To render the obstruction at Fort Montgomery complete, it will be necessary to have a boom across the 
river, and one or two cables in front of the chain, to break the force of the shipping before they come up 
to it. The two Continental ships should be immediately manned and fixed, and the two row-galleys 
be stationed just above the obstruction, which will form a front fire equal to what the enemy can bring against them. The fire from the ships and galleys 
in front, and the batteries upon the flank, will render it impossible for the shipping to operate there, if the obstructions in the river bring them up ; which, 
with the additional strength proposed, we have great reason to expect. 
</p><p>
The communication between the Eastern and Western States is essential to the Continent; and the 
advantages we shall have over the enemy by the 
communication, and the great expense that will be 
saved in transportation of stores, by having the command of the river, warrant every expense to secure 
an object of so great magnitude. We are very confident, if the obstructions in the river can be rendered effectual, the enemy will not attempt to ope 
rate by land, the passes through the Highlands are 
so exceeding difficult. We are, with the greatest 
respect and esteem,

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
By some accident Mr. Peters omitted sending me 
your favor of the 14th instant, so that I did not 
receive it till several days after he returned. I 
cannot sufficiently acknowledge the kind sentiments 
which your letter breathes, nor express the satisfaction it has given me. If I had been capable of the disingenuity, which might seem to appear, I should 
certainly have guarded it; but, as my letter, to which that was an answer, contained nothing that could make any caution necessary, none was used. While 
there was a prospect of General Lee's release, I purposely avoided an explanation, as I hoped my letter 
might have been preserved. Certain I am, it contained no other sentiments than lamenting the loss 
of Mount <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>, as occasioned, I frankly acknowledge, by hesitating too long between clashing 
opinions, the want of assistance . to enable your Excellency to bear the load of accumulated losses and 
misfortunes, and to enable you to extricate yourself 
from the difficulties which surrounded us. 
</p><p>
I pressed him to hasten with his troops to our relief, as necessary to raise the spirits of our broken 
army; and as General Greene's judgment had just 
then proved so erroneous, I urged General Lee, by 
every motive of regard to the cause, and his own 
honor and safety, to hasten his march, that his judgment and experience might, in some degree, supply 
that defect. To induce him to exert himself, I remember I told him that I knew you had a great 
confidence in his abilities as well as the public, and 
that the opinions of others had kept you in suspense. 
I believed your own judgment was fixed. His answer, 
you may recollect, followed these ideas, though mingled with those expressions, and a style which, you 
may recollect, was peculiar to himself. 
</p><p>
I gratefully remember the honor you often did me 
in hearing my sentiments, and should have been sufficiently encouraged to have expressed my apprehensions of any quality of the mind, whose operations 
might prejudice the service and your own honor, if 
my views and subject had led to it. But at that 
time I had nothing more upon my mind, or in prospect, than the affair of Mount <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>, and a 
speedy junction with General Lee. But I will not 
trouble you any farther upon this subject than to 
give you my most sincere thanks for the kind and 
obliging manner in which you have relieved my 
mind from the anxiety which the apprehended loss 
of your favor and friendship had occasioned. 
</p><p>
I saw Dr. Shippen yesterday, who surprised me 
very much by mentioning that you had received no 
letters from me on the subject of the late appointment. I assure you, my dear Sir, I wrote immediately on receiving information of your kind intention. ; and when I had determined, which I would not 
do hastily or without advice of my friends, I wrote 
immediately and sent the letter to Mr. Hancock s, as 
the proper place to be forwarded. I confess my inclinations led me strongly to accept, and more especially when I was assured of your favor and friend 
ship ; but, upon a calculation of the expense which 
would attend it, and for which the Congress have 
not made any special provision, I found that in two 
or three years I should probably sink my little for 
tune, and do injustice to the public or discredit the 
station. This, added to the many promotions made 
in the interior, were my principal reasons. My prospects in the civil line are considerable ; these I must 
also have sacrificed. 
</p><p>
For all these I am sure you will make due allowances, and, I hope, not disapprove my declining the 
honor you intended me. I can hardly flatter myself 
with the hope of contributing any thing to your ease 
or honor, but my prayers and wishes for both will 
ever be as sincere as my attachment and respect are 
lasting and ardent. I have this morning seen a copy 
of your letter to General Arnold, expressive of your 
plan and views of the enemy's intentions. It cannot 
be unacceptable to you to know that it is highly 
approved. I have lately had a collection of English 
papers, by way of France. I read, with great plea 
sure, the encomiums which the British officers have 
wrote to their friends, not only on the virtue of your 
private character, but conduct of the war. The praise 
of an enemy cannot be suspected. Be assured you 
stand high in the opinions of the first military characters in Europe. As far as my poor opinion can go, 
I think your present system and plan have the fairest chance of success, and will meet with it, if some 
of those unforeseen strokes, to which war is subject, do 
not intervene. We have had a letter published here, 
which says we must fight or forfeit our honor. It is 
said to be wrote by some General Officer. I cannot 
think he intended it for publication. Your letter 
contains different, and, I think, juster sentiments 
upon this important point. 
</p><p>
Colonel Moylan writes, that he thinks my know 
ledge of the country and people would be of use in 
the quarter where he is, and presses me to come up, 
which I shall do immediately, and pay my respects 
at head-quarters as soon as possible. I have been 
employed, for some time, in laboring an accommodation with the contending parties in this State, which, 
through General Armstrong's and Mifflin's influence, 
is at last effected, so as to afford the fairest prospects of bringing forth the force of this State. General Mifflin addressed the people at a town-meeting 
in your name, and requested them all to turn out; 
but, on trial, this was found impracticable. About 
four thousand, besides those in the field, will probably be the number, provided they can get arms, accoutrements, and tents ; but there is at present so lamentable a deficiency in these articles, that I very 
much fear difficulties will arise after the men are procured. General Armstrong is indefatigable in his endeavours, and I hope will be more successful than at 
present he seems to expect. 
</p><p>
I presume the hurry in which General Mifflin came, 
prevented a formal application from yourself to the 
persons in authority here. I would just hint it to 
your Excellency, as I observe they think themselves 
passed by in the mode which has been taken, and 
which, most probably, has been purely accidental. 
</p><p>
I am too well acquainted with your many engagements to take up more of your time. Allow me only 
to add, that I am, with the most sincere respect and 
attachment, my dear General, your most obliged, 
Affectionate, and obedient humble servant,

Summerville, 21 July, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1777">1777</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Having lately met with an ordinance of the King 
of France, passed last December, for establishing the 
corps of engineers, I made a hasty translation of it, 
from which I apprehend some useful hints may be 
taken for establishing such a corps in this country. 
And as I know of no better hands into which it may 
be put for this purpose, I have taken the liberty to 
send you a copy. 
</p><p>
You are doubtless informed of the four engineers 
sent over by Dr. Franklin and Mr. Deane, three of 
whom are arrived and taken into the service of the 
Continent, the first as Colonel, the second as Lieu 
tenant-Colonel, and the third as Major of engineers. 
What probability there is of their being men of Experience you will see by the inclosed ordinance, and 
the rank they held in the royal corps of engineers. 
Whether their being taken into the service as Colonel, &c., of engineers, will give them, rank of those 
heretofore engaged simply as engineers, with similar 
ranks, will, I presume, be left to your determination 
agreeably to the rules of the army. 
</p><p>
I congratulate you on the capture of General Prescott, and I hope soon to hear of the release of General Lee. The haughty instrument of tyranny will, I 
trust, abate his insolence, at least admit the propriety 
of now insisting on General Lee's release, "when 
you have an officer of equal rank to offer in Exchange." Though I must confess I should be very 
glad, before any exchange even now took place, that 
a cartel was settled on such plain arid equal principles as to remove all grounds of cavil. The Board 
of War have had the cartel settled between the 
French and English in the year 1759, lately reprinted, 
which you have undoubtedly seen. 
</p><p>
I cannot forbear thinking that the posts held in 
the army ought to be attended as much, if not more, 
than nominal rank. Without this, our enemy will 
have greatly the advantage. Their General Officers 
have all regiments, so that there are but few Colonels. Ought not, therefore, Lieutenant-Colonels, or 
even Majors, when they command regiments, to be 
estimated as Colonels ? 
</p><p>
But I am transgressing my line, and I fear trespassing on your time. I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your obedient, humble servant,

FROM JAMES LOVELL. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 24 July, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1777">1777</a>. 
SIR, 
</p><p>
So long ago as December 2d, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775">1775</a>, direction was 
given by Congress to the Committee of Secret correspondence to procure from Europe four good engi 
neers. This was not, however, accomplished till the 
13th of last February, when the bearer, the Chevalier 
Duportail, with M. La Iladiere, M. Gouvion, and one 
other officer, who is left sick in the West Indies, were 
engaged by Dr. Franklin and Mr. Deane to come over 
to America. I beg your Excellency to observe well, 
that these are the only officers, of any species, who 
have been procured from abroad by express direction 
of Congress. And this I do. because I am about to furnish you with several circumstances peculiarly with 
in my knowledge, relative to a point of equity well 
worthy of your Excellency's attention. 
</p><p>
The corps of engineers is very honorable in France, 
and officers from it are sought by different European 
powers. These gentlemen, who are come over into 
our service., made an agreement with our Commissioners to rise one degree from the rank they held at 
home, upon a supposition that the practice of Europe 
had been regarded here. But, when they arrived, 
they found instances very different with respect to 
officers in all other corps. It was their mishap, also, 
to see a Major of artillery affecting to be exalted 
four ranks, as a chief, in his proper line and theirs 
also. They made a representation of these circum 
stances, and appealed to the equity of Congress. But 
they had arrived at a time when the infatuation of 
some here, and the wild conduct of one abroad, had 
rendered a spirit of reformation absolutely necessary 
as to the point of rank. 
</p><p>
The ingenuous, however, must own, that there is 
singular hardship in the case of these gentlemen. 
The only officers ever sent for by us, procured by 
the real political agents of Congress, coming out with 
the good wishes of the French Ministry, being of undoubted rank and ability in their profession, find 
themselves in the dilemma of becoming the first Examples of our new reforming spirit, or else of going 
home during a campaign, which their high sense of 
honor will not allow. But, though the Chevalier Du-portail was not made a Brigadier, yet it appeared too 
gross to expose him to be directed, in his peculiar 
line, by such as will readily acknowledge his preten 
sions, by regular education and discipline, to be great 
ly superior to their own. His commission prevents 
this, and enables him so to distribute, in work, the 
others who came with him, as to prevent them who 
have been within a few months as long in service as 
himself, from being interfered with by such as never 
belonged to the Royal Corps of Engineers in France, 
or perhaps but a very short time to any other. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency cannot but wonder at the strange 
manner of wording the commission. I shall explain 
it with the greatest freedom. M. Ducoudray being 
employed as a good artillery officer to examine the 
arsenals in France, to see what cannon, &c., could be 
spared from them, acted with great industry in that 
employment, and much seeming regard to America. 
In the course of his transactions between the Compte de St. Germain and Mr. Deane, he was not blind to 
perceive that he might take occasion to serve him 
self. Besides being paid for his trouble and expenses 
in France, he procured an agreement from Mr. Deane, 
which has already been shown to your Excellency, 
and has affected you, doubtless, with the same surprise and indignation which it has excited in others, 
almost without a single exception. 
</p><p>
I shall omit any remarks upon that treaty, or a 
long too ingenious memorial presented to Congress 
with it, except such as are strictly connected with 
the occasion of this letter. M. Ducoudray, having 
created himself to the command of artillery and engineers, persuaded Mr. Deane that it would be impossible to get any from the military corps of engineers, 
now called royal, because their demands would be so 
exorbitant, and that it would be also unnecessary, be 
cause we ought not to build fortified places in America to serve as secure holds to our enemy, when 
once taken from us; and that, therefore, a few bridge 
and causeway-makers would answer all the ends of 
military engineers. Such he brought with him, who 
were quite ready to fall under the command of an 
artillery direction, when not the lowest officer of the 
Royal Corps of Engineers would have submitted to 
such a novel pretence. 
</p><p>
It is needless to inquire whether it be true, that Mr. Deane acknowledged he had been surprised into 
this uncouth compact. It is sufficient that Dr. Franklin made an after one, which Mr. Deane also signed. 
Is not this in fact tantamount to a disavowal of the 
first treaty, so far as relates to the orders of congress? For, if those orders were fulfilled by the first, 
why was a second treaty made ? The agents show 
that there had been a deception, or that there had 
not been any attempt to follow the instructions of 
Congress as to engineers, in all the train attending 
M. Ducoudray. 
</p><p>
Another remark may not be impertinent here. As 
these four engineers showed their treaty to the 
Compte de St. Germain, to whom they have also 
written from hence, it cannot be supposed that he 
would have permitted a Lieutenant-Colonel of the 
Royal Corps of Engineers, and two old Majors of the 
same, to come over hither to be under the immediate 
command of a young Major of artillery. It is not to 
be conceived. From whence I conclude that M. Ducoudray never let his exorbitant and whimsical treaty 
be knoAvn to that Minister of the War Department, 
who must have been shocked at the confusion of 
corps in the principles of contract. 
</p><p>
Excuse me, dear General, I will not again wander 
from the point which I said I would explain. M. 
Ducoudray has given full scope to his species of ingenuity here, as in the neighbourhood of Mr. Deane. 
I have been told that he has said, if he could not be 
employed himself, he would bring it about that these 
others should not. This may be an absolute false 
hood. But, I will own, it comes the nearest of any 
thing which I can conceive of, to explain the delays 
which have taken place in regard to these engineers, 
who ought, to have been sent to your Excellency 
long ago. They have remained subject to the crucifying expenses of this city, because their employment seemed to interfere with M. Ducoudray's pretensions, though those very pretensions had been reject 
ed. Your Excellency would doubtless smile, if you 
should ever hear, that even a number of peasants Disputed three days about the difference between the 
consequences of a man's being Colonel-in-chief, or 
First Colonel, or Colonel to take rank and command 
of all heretofore appointed, or Colonol-commandant of 
engineers. Would not a Brigadier or Major-General 
of engineers alike annul the supremacy of the differently-worded commissions? Or rather, do not the 
four different modes give like command? 
</p><p>
I shall pass from rank to pay. These gentlemen, 
not only far from the prophesied exorbitancy in demand of rank, never received one shilling in France 
as gratification; though others, who were not sent 
for, received large sums, and claim pay from their 
embarkation, and even pensions for life. But Dr. 
Franklin, supposing it would be less trouble to him 
self and more agreeable to the engineers to see to 
their own passages, stipulated their pay from the 13th 
of February. 
</p><p>
As no regulations have yet been made in regard 
to cavalry or engineers, these gentlemen have received five months pay as infantry, which will not refund 
the expenses of their voyage. I am really uneasy, 
when I find manly, honorable intentions do not meet 
with at least equal emoluments with artful, suspicious, 
tricking contractors. If these officers do not walk to 
camp, it is not because they were furnished by the 
Board of War with horses upon my application for 
them; and yet the nature of their profession demands 
M provision of the kind. Are they suddenly to reconnoitre a camp, a river, a shoal, or a whole neighbouring country, through which an army is to march, 
and to make the speediest return to the Generals, on 
foot? I trust your Excellency, when asking for engineers, had ideas of something beyond what the 
sinister views of an ambitious foreigner have sought 
to inspire us with here; which is, forming a causeway, 
or cutting a ditch, or planking a bridge. And I shall 
consequently rest satisfied that you will receive the 
officers, now presenting themselves to you, and secure 
to them such honors and emoluments as you shall 
find them to merit from their education and abilities, 
exemplified under your command. No one has been more 
backward than I in desiring to see foreigners in our 
service, to the slight of my countrymen. And, Except engineers, I could not admit the thought of our 
wanting any military strangers, other than one or 
two veteran Adjutants or Majors, who know our language well, and could serve as instructors at large to 
our spirited and well-attached young American officers. 
</p><p>
I wish these engineers could speak English better than they do ; but they can receive orders and give them in English, and will speedily learn to speak. 
</p><p>
I hope your Excellency will not think amiss of the 
freedom I have taken at this time, both as to the 
matter of my letter and the interruptive length of it. 
I do not write officially, as of the Committee on Fo 
reign Applications. In that capacity I have more than 
once communicated to you proceedings of Congress, 
in a style which might lead you to misconjecture my 
individual opinion. I write as a friend to my country, and the reputation of its Congress, its army, and 
agents abroad. I write as being well acquainted with 
your Excellency, or, in other words, as thinking I know you. In short, I write because I had determined it to be my duty so to write. That path once 
determined, I never ask myself whether there may not be a lion in the way. 
</p><p>
After the important kindnesses, which your Excellency has done me, I so far forgive the late injury 
of your apologizing for a short answer written by one of your hurried family, as not to revenge myself, by entreating you to excuse my rough, wwopied sheets to 
a violent headache. AUqiiando dormitat did not appear an unnatural charge against Homer. Nimium vigilat would have appeared so against Seipio or Marl-borough, and yet I am led by you to think they might have given provocation for it. With truest 
vows for your prosperity, I am your Excellency's Obliged friend and humble servant.

SIR, 
</p><p>
Edmund Randolph, Esq., communicated to me that 
part of your last letter to him, in which you are 
pleased to take notice of your lady's reception at this place. I beg you to be assured, that every expression of regard falls far short of that which I feel, and 
shall retain through life, for such distinguished merit. 
</p><p>
You are pleased also to observe, that you have not 
received any answer from me to your two favors of 
the loth of April and 17th of May last. The latter 
has never been received ; the former would have been 
answered, but really, when I have considered the Extent, variety, and importance of the things which occupy your attention, I have been afraid of pestering 
you with letters. The scheme of embodying volunteers was no more thought of after the receipt of 
yours, in which it appeared to be against your wishes. 
In that, as in every military measure, I shall be 
solely guided by your opinions. 
</p><p>
Upon the appearance of the British fleet, about 
three thousand militia were embodied. They have 
shown great alacrity. A third part of the militia of 
Prince William, Loudoun, Fairfax, Culpepper, Fau-quier, Berkeley, Dunmore, and Frederic, is ordered to 
rendezvous at Fredericktown, in Maryland, and there 
to await your orders. I have thought it of great 
consequence to throw some troops on the eastern 
shore. But it is rather disagreeable to the militia, 
and, for want of more regulars, two companies only are 
gone there. Colonel N. Gist, with seventeen Cherokees, being here, chose also to go over, and is gone. 
</p><p>
Although a good peace is made with the Cherokees, yet our south-western frontier is much harassed 
with small parties of Indians. General Hand expects 
pretty warm work about Pittsburg. 
</p><p>
Could any particular assistance to you be rendered 
by Virginia, at this juncture, I should be made happy. 
Early intelligence of the enemy's motions may be of 
the highest moment, should they come down the Bay. 
I beg leave to assure you of that perfect esteem, 
and high regard, with which I have the honor to be, 
Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant,

PATRICK HENRY.

Elizabethtown, 20 September, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1777">1777</a>; G o clock, P.M. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I wrote your Excellency this morning, since which 
I have had the honor of receiving your favor of yesterday's date. Your Excellency will be much surprised to hear there are not more than one thousand 
of our militia now embodied, all of which are at this 
post. Since the receipt of your Excellency's letters, 
I have been considering in what way I could most 
speedily reenforce the army under your Excellency's 
command, as that is the object; and I am clearly of 
opinion, that the most expeditious is, to march the 
troops from this post, and collect what numbers I can 
upon our march. I shall, therefore, order all the guards 
called in before day, and march, with the utmost Expedition, the routes directed. Your Excellency may 
be assured my utmost exertions shall not be wanting 
upon the present occasion. 
</p><p>
I flatter myself I shall be able, in a short time, to 
bring on a reinforcement of two thousand men. Had 
it not been for the late unlucky alarm in this State, I have great reason to believe, I should have crossed 
the Delaware with four thousand men. I have ordered General Wines to collect and march his brigade 
to this post, with all despatch. This State will be in 
a very defenceless situation, and there is little doubt 
but the enemy will soon be apprised of it, and make a visit. I am a little apprehensive many of the men 
will desert us before we cross the Delaware, having 
dreadful apprehensions from the vicinity of the enemy. Every precaution shall be used to keep them 
together, and bring them on speedily. I have the 
honor to be, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
In consequence of your letter of the 22d, directed 
to the President, or any member of Congress, I have 
conferred with William Henry, Esq., of this place, 
upon the most expeditious method of collecting the 
arms and accoutrements in the hands of the inhabit 
ants here; and he is of opinion that it may be accomplished by your warrant to him, grounded on the 
late resolution of Congress for that and other purposes. As there is not a prospect of having a congress, or Board of War, for several days, to give him 
authority, and the articles are immediately wanted, he has consented to proceed on the business without 
delay, in expectation that, on the receipt of this, you will give him full powers to justify his conduct, and 
date them the 22d, that the time of his transaction may comport with his commission. 
</p><p>
With wishes of success to your Excellency, and the cause in which you are engaged, I remain, Sir, very respectfully,

FKOM THOMAS MCREAN. 
</p><p>
Newark, [Delaware] 8 October, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1777">1777</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
By the captivity of President McKinly, of the 
Delaware State, on the 12th of last month, and the 
absence of the Vice-President, the command in chief 
devolved on me, as Speaker of the Assembly, agreeably to the Constitution. I had some time before accepted the office of Chief Justice of Pennsylvania, 
and, at the time this unfortunate event happened, 
was out of the Delaware State, but thought it my 
duty to my country to repair thither, which I did on 
the 20th following. On my arrival, I found that all 
the records and public papers of the county of New 
castle, and every shilling of the public money, together with the fund belonging to the Trustees of 
Newark Academy, and upwards of twenty-five thou 
sand dollars in the Continental Loan-Office, &c. &c., 
had been captured at Wilmington, at the same time 
the President was taken by the enemy. The people 
were dispirited and dispersed; and the Tories, and 
less virtuous part that remained, were daily employed 
in supplying the British troops, both in Wilmington 
and at Newcastle, on board the ships of war, with all 
kinds of provisions. 
</p><p>
Among other things, I called out the one half of 
the militia into actual service, and ordered the remainder to be in readiness to march at an hour's 
warning; and, to render the service as easy and as 
agreeable as possible, allowed the Colonel or commanding officer of every battalion in the State to 
assign posts to the militia within the bounds of the 
battalion. My intention was afterwards to reduce the 
number of posts, and to strengthen those nearest the 
enemy, and, if a sufficient force could be collected, 
to advance towards them. Above ten days were employed in this experiment, almost in vain. The Whigs 
in Sussex county are said to be rather too few to 
keep the Tories there quiet, the latter being most 
numerous. The same is said of Kent county, and the militia there absolutely refuse to march out on 
that county. In Newcastle county the lower class 
of the people have got an opinion that, by remaining  quiet, they will not be molested, and seem unwilling to join their officers, or that any troops should 
be assembled in their neighbourhood ; and many of 
the officers and better sort of the inhabitants apprehend that, by attempting any thing without the assistance of the others, they will expose themselves to 
certain destruction. 
</p><p>
This, Sir, is a true portrait of the Delaware State, 
at present, and I really fear a total defection, with 
out some effectual remedy is speedily applied. There 
are so many virtuous and brave men in the State, 
who will be sacrificed to their inveterate enemies, by 
leaving them in their present situation, that my blood 
runs cold at the reflection. The only remedy I can 
suggest is, to have a regiment of Continental troops 
forthwith despatched here to Newark. This will give 
new life to the virtuous, who will immediately join 
them; and, from their example and through their 
influence, I make no doubt most of the lower class 
will come forth. By this means, our internal enemies 
will be kept in awe, and, by securing some of them 
(which must be done), the spirit of the rest will be 
broken, and our foreign enemies will be no longer 
supplied with necessaries, and, very probably, be 
obliged either to throw in more troops to Wilmington, which will, in proportion, weaken their army opposed to you, or to abandon it entirely. If a greater 
force could be spared from the main army (say five 
hundred good men), Avith some officers of abilities, and 
some field-pieces, the reconquest of Wilmington might be meditated. 
</p><p>
Upon the whole, Sir, you will judge for yourself, 
and the common good, and do what you think best 
at this critical period. If you are in force, you will 
spare as many men as requisite ; if not, the Delaware State must take its fate, and not occasion the 
loss of a battle, which may prove more injurious to 
the common cause, though I shudder at the thought. 
</p><p>
With heart-felt gratitude to the Divine Disposer 
of all events, and next, to you, I received an account 
of your success on Saturday last, from some Quakers returning to Nottingham, in Chester county, and 
to Elkridge, in <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a> county, from their yearly 
meeting at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, which you broke up on Saturday night, by the actions of the day. These men 
would not relate a single word of any thing that 
happened at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, during the eight days they 
were there ; saying they did not go there to carry or 
to bring news, and seemed unwilling even to stop so 
long as to make this speech. However, I compelled 
them to stop, made them dismount, and examined 
them separately, and in private. They said, at first, 
they had no new r s, &c. I mention these minute circumstances to satisfy you that their account, being 
given with great reluctance, was that of the Tories 
and the English themselves. 
</p><p>
It is, in brief, as follows ; That you attacked the 
picket of the enemy, consisting of four or five hundred men, near Beggarstown, about three o clock in 
the morning, and drove them until supported by the 
British light infantry, at which time you had taken 
VOL. i. 38 
nine field-pieces, and killed or taken most of the 
picket ; that the infantry were driven near two miles 
into Germantown ; that they are all cut off except a 
very few; that, at Germantown,, there were thirty-five o f some English General's guard killed, and it 
was supposed he himself was taken prisoner ; that, 
during the action, all the British troops, except part 
of a regiment of grenadiers, not exceeding fifty, went 
from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and joined General Howe, who 
commanded in person ; that the main body of the 
enemy were at the end of Germantown next sadelphia, and, upon their advancing, were once repulsed by you ; but afterwards, about nine o clock, obliged the Americans to retreat to the ground they occupied the day preceding ; that General Agnew was 
killed ; and John Pierpoint, one of the examinants, 
said, he saw two Hessian Generals brought into the 
city wounded, one of them mortally, the other not so 
badly; that a great number of Colonels and many 
other officers were killed, and about a thousand men; 
that one hundred wagons, and upwards, came into the 
city after night, about nine o clock, with the wounded ; some had three, others seven, and between these 
numbers, in them, according to the severity of their 
wounds, as they were told ; that a Virginia regiment 
had grounded their arms, and, with others, amounting 
in the whole to five hundred rebels, were taken prisoners by the English, and that General Wayne was 
killed; but they heard of no other American officer of distinction that was. 
</p><p>
They further said, they heard that the English 
could never form until they joined their main body 
below Germantown, and that you had the advantage 
of the ground ; that a wounded Hessian told one of 
them, that he had fought French and Spaniards, but that the rebels would beat them both; and that he 
had never seen men fight as they did ; and, in fine, 
that though the English had got the ground, which 
they called the victory, it was agreed, on all hands, 
that the British had not met with so great a loss 
since they came to America. 
</p><p>
John Pierpoint, who seemed willing enough to tell 
all he knew, informed me that the Delaware frigate 
was given up by the pressed men on board ; that 
there were but two brass cannon, twelve-pounders, 
fired from the fort upon the frigate, and but one 
man killed in the fort, and one in the frigate ; that 
she was manned with English, and lay above the 
town on Sunday morning, when he came away; that 
the English had strong lines, some heavy cannon, 
and a fortification, about half way between German-town and the City, as he was told ; that the Quakers 
could get no provender but hay for their horses ; 
that butter had sold from three shillings and nine-pence to five shillings a pound; and that a famine 
was expected by the citizens in general, though some 
said they might subsist for a month. A Mr. Husbands told me he saw upwards of two thousand 
troops at Chester, on Monday last, escorting wagons, 
that were loaded from thirteen ships which lay there ; 
that four men-of-war were then at the chevaux-de-frise, 
and that he saw two hundred and fifty Hessians, 
who had crossed Schuylkill on the same day, proceeding down the neck towards Delaware, it was 
supposed, to forage, plunder, &c. This is all that 
seems, in any degree, worth communicating ; indeed, 
none of it is perhaps worth your reading; however, 
if any use can be made of it, you have it. 
</p><p>
If your Excellency attacks and disables a thousand of the enemy a week, and you are constantly 
reenforced equal to the numbers you lose, as I trust 
you will be, you must soon prove triumphantly victorious, and get the game, though you should not 
throw sixes. 
</p><p>
Your answer, by the express, will oblige one who prays for your success and happiness, and professes 
himself to be, with the utmost regard, your Excellency's most obedient 
</p><p>
And devoted humble servant, 
</p><p>
THOMAS McKEAN.

FROM THE REVEREND JACOB DUCHE. 
</p><p>
[<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>], 8 October, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1777">1777</a> 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
If this letter should find you in Council, or in the field, before you read another sentence, I beg you to take the first opportunity of retiring, and weighing 
its important contents. You are perfectly acquainted with the part I formerly took in the present unhappy contest, I was, indeed, among the first to bear my public testimony against having any recourse to threats, or indulging a thought of an armed opposition. 
</p><p>
The current, however, was too strong for my feeble 
efforts to resist. I wished to follow my countrymen 
as far only as virtue, and the righteousness of their 
cause, would permit me. I was, however, prevailed 
on, among the rest of my clerical brethren of this 
city, to gratify the pressing desires of my fellow-citizens, by preaching a sermon to the second city battalion. I was pressed to publish this sermon, arid reluctantly consented. From a personal attachment, of 
near twenty years standing, and a high respect for 
your character, in private as well as public life, I 
took the liberty of dedicating this sermon to you. I 
had your affectionate thanks for my performance, in 
a letter, wherein was expressed, in the most delicate 
and obliging terms, your regard for me, and your 
wishes for a continuance of my friendship and approbation of your conduct. Farther than this I intended 
not to proceed. My sermon speaks for itself, and 
wholly disclaims the idea of independency. My sentiments were well known to my friends. I communicated them, without reserve, to many respect 
able members of Congress, who expressed their warm 
approbation of it then. I persisted, to the very last 
moment, to use the prayers for my Sovereign, though 
threatened with insults from the violence of a party. 
</p><p>
Upon the declaration of independency, I called 
my vestry, and solemnly put the question to them, 
whether they thought it best, for the peace and welfare of the congregation, to shut up the churches, or 
to continue the service, without using the prayers for 
the Royal Family. This was the sad alternative. I 
concluded to abide by their decision, as I could not 
have time to consult my spiritual superiors in England. They determined it most expedient, under such 
critical circumstances, to keep open the churches, that 
the congregations might not be dispersed, which we 
had great reason to apprehend. 
</p><p>
A very few days after the fatal declaration of in 
dependency, I received a letter from Mr. Hancock, 
sent by express to Germantown, where my family 
were for the summer season, acquainting me I was 
appointed Chaplain to the Congress, and desired my 
attendance next morning, at nine o clock. Surprised 
and distressed, as I was, by an event I was not prepared to expect; obliged to give an immediate attendance, without the opportunity of consulting my 
friends, I easily accepted the appointment, I could 
have but one motive for taking this step. I thought 
the churches in danger, and hoped, by this means, 
to have been instrumental in preventing those ills I 
had so much reason to apprehend. I can, however, 
with truth, declare, I then looked upon independency rather as an expedient, and hazardous, or, in 
deed, thrown out in terror em, in order to procure some 
favorable terms, than a measure that was seriously 
persisted in, at all events. My sudden change of 
conduct will clearly evince this to have been my 
idea of the matter. 
</p><p>
Upon the return of the Committee of Congress 
appointed to confer with Lord Howe, I soon Discerned their whole intentions. The different accounts 
which each member gave of this conference, the time 
they took to make up the matter for public view, 
and the amazing disagreements between the news 
paper accounts and the relation I myself had from 
the mouth of one of the Committee, convinced me 
there must have been some unfair and ungenerous 
procedure. This determination to treat on no other strain than that of independency, which put it out 
of his Lordship's power to mention any terms at all, 
was sufficient proof to me that independency was the 
idol they had long wished to set up, and that, rather 
than sacrifice this, they would deluge their country 
with blood. From this moment I determined upon 
my resignation, and, in the beginning of October, 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>, sent it, in form, to Mr. Hancock, after having 
officiated only two months and three weeks; and 
from that time, as far as my safety would permit, 
I have been opposed to all their measures. 
</p><p>
This circumstantial account of my conduct, I think 
due to the friendship you were so obliging as to Express for me, and, I hope, will be sufficient to justify 
my seeming inconsistencies in the part I have acted. 
</p><p>
And now, dear Sir, suffer me, in the language of 
truth and real affection, to address myself to you. 
All the world must be convinced you are engaged in 
the service of your country from motives perfectly 
disinterested. You risked every thing that was dear 
to you, abandoned the sweets of domestic life, which 
your affluent fortune can give the uninterrupted enjoyment of. But had you, could you have had, the 
least idea of matters being carried to such a dangerous extremity? Your most intimate friends shuddered at the thought of a separation from the mother 
country, and I took it for granted that your sentiments coincided with theirs. What, then, can be the 
consequence of this rash and violent measure, and 
degeneracy of representation, confusion of councils, 
blunders without number ? The most respectable characters have withdrawn themselves, and are succeeded by a great majority of illiberal and violent men. 
Take an impartial view of the present Congress, and 
what can you expect from them ? Your feelings 
must be greatly hurt by the representation of your 
native Province. You have no longer a Randolph, 
a Bland ; or a Braxton, men whose names will ever 
be revered, whose demands never ran above the first 
ground on which they set out, and whose truly glorious and virtuous sentiments I have frequently heard 
with rapture from their own lips. Oh ! my dear Sir, 
what a sad contrast of characters now presents ; others, whose friends can never mingle with your own. 
Your Harrison alone remains, and he disgusted with 
the unworthy associates. 
</p><p>
As to those of my own Province, some of them 
arc so obscure, that their very names were never in 
my ears before, and others have only been distinguished for the weakness of their understandings, 
and the violence of their tempers. One alone I Except from the general charge ; a man of virtue, drag 
ged reluctantly into their measures, and restrained, 
by some false ideas of honor, from retreating, after 
having gone too far. You cannot be at a loss to Discover whose name answers to this character. 
</p><p>
From the New England provinces can you find 
one that, as a gentleman, you could wish to associate 
with, unless the soft and mild address of Mr. Hancock can atone for his want of every other qualification necessary for the seat which he fills? Bankrupts, attorneys, and men of desperate fortunes, are 
his colleagues. Maryland no longer sends a Tilghman and a protestant Carroll. Carolina has lost her 
Lynch ; and the elder Middleton has retired. Are 
the dregs of Congress, then, still to influence a mind 
like yours ? These are not the men you engaged to 
serve ; these are not the men that America has chosen 
to represent her. Most of them were chosen by a 
little, low faction, and the few gentlemen that are among them now are well known to lie on the balance, and looking up to your hand alone to turn the 
beam. Tis you, Sir, and you only, that support the 
present Congress; of this you must be fully sensible. 
Long before they left <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, their dignity and 
consequence were gone ; what must it be now, since 
their precipitate retreat ? I write with freedom, but 
without invective ; I know these things to be true, 
and I write to one whose own observation must have 
convinced him that it is so. 
</p><p>
After this view of the Congress, turn to the army. 
The whole world knows that its only existence depends upon you ; that your death or captivity Disperses it in a moment, and that there is not a man 
on that side the question, in America, capable of succeeding you. As to the army itself, what have you 
to expect from them ? Have they not frequently 
abandoned you yourself, in the hour of extremity ? 
Can you have the least confidence in a set of undisciplined men and officers, many of whom have been 
taken from the lowest of the people, without principle, without courage ? Take away them that surround your person, how very few are there you can 
ask to sit at your table ! As to your little navy, of 
that little, what is left ? Of the Delaware fleet, part 
are taken, and the rest must soon surrender. Of 
those in the other provinces, some are taken, one or 
two at sea, and others lying unmanned and unrigged 
in your harbours. 
</p><p>
And now, where are your resources ? Oh ! my 
dear Sir, how sadly have you been abused by a faction void of truth, and void of tenderness to you and 
your country ! They have amused you with hopes of 
a declaration of war on the part of France. Believe 
me, from the best authority, it was a fiction from the 
first. Early in the year <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>, a French gentleman 
was introduced to me, with whom I became intimately acquainted. His business, to all appearance, 
was to speculate in the mercantile way. But, I believe, it will be found that in his country he moved 
in a higher sphere. He saw your cause. lie became 
acquainted with all your military preparations. He was 
introduced to Congress, and engaged with them in a 
commercial contract. In the course of our intimacy, 
he has frequently told me, that he hoped the Americans would never think of independency. He gave me 
his reasons. "Independency can never be supported, 
unless France should declare war against England. 
I well know the state of her finances. Years to 
come will not put them in a situation to enter upon 
a breach with England. At this moment, there arc 
two parties in the Court of Versailles ; one enlisted 
under the Duke de Choiseul, the other under the 
Count Maurepas. Choiseul has no chance of succeeding , though he is violent for war Maurepas must get 
the better; he is for economy and peace." This was 
his information, which I mentioned to several members of Congress. They treated it as a fable, depending  entirely on Dr. Franklin's intelligence. 
</p><p>
The truth of the matter is this ; - - Dr. Franklin 
built upon the success of Choiseul. Upon his arrival 
in France, he found him out of place, his counsels 
reprobated, and his party dwindled into an insignificant faction. This you may depend upon to be the 
true state of affairs in France, or the court of Dr. F. ; 
and, further, by vast numbers of letters found on 
board prizes taken by the king's ships, it appears 
that all commerce with the merchants, through whom 
all your supplies have been conveyed, will be at an 
end, the letters being full of complaints of no remittances from America, and many individuals having generally suffered. 
</p><p>
From your friends in England you have nothing to 
expect. Their numbers have diminished to a cipher ; 
the spirit of the whole nation is in activity ; a few 
sounding names among the nobility, though perpetually ringing in your ears, are without character, 
without influence. Disappointed ambition has made 
them desperate, and they only wish to make the deluded Americans instruments of revenge. All orders 
and ranks of men in Great Britain are now unanimous, and determined to risk their all with content. 
Trade and manufactures are found to flourish, and 
new channels are continually offering, that will perhaps more than supply the loss of the old. 
</p><p>
In America, your harbours are blocked up, your 
cities fall one after another; fortress after fortress, 
battle after battle is lost. A British army, after 
having passed unmolested through a vast extent of 
country, have possessed themselves of the Capital of 
America. How unequal the contest ! How fruitless 
the expense of blood ! Under so many discouraging 
circumstances, can virtue, can honor, can the love of 
your country, prompt you to proceed? Humanity it 
self, and sure humanity is no stranger to your breast, 
calls upon you to desist. Your army must perish for 
want of common necessaries, or thousands of innocent 
families must perish to support them ; wherever they 
encamp, the country must be impoverished ; wherever 
they march, the troops of Britain will pursue, and 
must complete the destruction which America herself 
has begun. Perhaps it may be said, it is better to 
die than to be made slaves. This, indeed, is a splendid maxim in theory, and perhaps, in some instances, 
may be found experimentally true ; but when there 
is ilio least probability of an happy accommodation., 
surely wisdom and humanity call for some sacrifices 
to be made, to prevent inevitable destruction. Yon 
well know there is but one invincible bar to such an 
accommodation; could this be removed, other obstacles 
illicit readily be removed. 
</p><p>
It is to yon, and yon alone, your bleeding country 
looks, and calls aloud for this sacrifice. Your arm 
alone has strength sufficient to remove this bar. May 
Heaven inspire you with this glorious resolution of 
exerting your strength, at this crisis, and immortalizing yourself as friend and guardian to your country ! Your penetrating eye needs not more explicit 
Lmjmagc to discern my meaning. With that prudence and delicacy, therefore, of which I know you 
possessed, represent to Congress the indispensable necessity of rescinding the hasty and ill-advised declaration of independency. Recommend, and you have 
an undoubted right to recommend, an immediate cessation of hostilities. Let the controversy be taken 
up where that declaration left it, and where Lord 
Howe certainly expected to find it left. Let men of 
clear and impartial characters, in or out of Congress, 
liberal in their sentiments, heretofore independent in 
their fortunes, and some such may be found in 
America, be appointed to confer with his Majesty's 
Commissioners. Lot them, if they please, propose 
some well-digested constitutional plan, to lay before 
them at the commencement of the negotiation. When 
they have gone thus far, I am confident the usual 
happy consequences will ensue ; unanimity will immediately take place through the different provinces ; 
thousands who are HOAV ardently wishing and praying for such a measure, will step forth, and declare them 
selves the zealous advocates for constitutional liberty ; and millions will bless the hero that left the field of 
war, to decide this most important contest with the 
weapons of wisdom and humanity. 
</p><p>
Oh! Sir, let no false ideas of worldly honor deter 
yon from engaging in so glorious a task. What 
ever censures may be thrown out by mean, illiberal 
minds, your character will rise in the estimation of 
the virtuous and noble. It will appear with lustre in 
the annals of history, and form a glorious contrast to 
that of those who have fought to obtain conquest, 
and gratify their own ambition by the destruction of 
their species and the ruin of their country. Be as 
sured, Sir, that I write not this under the eye of any 
British officer, or person connected with the British 
army, or ministry. The sentiments I express are the 
real sentiments of my own heart, such as I have long 
held, and which I should have made known to you 
by letter before, had I not fully expected an opportunity of a private conference. When you passed 
through <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, on your way to Wilmington, I 
was confined, by a severe fit of the gravel, to my 
chamber ; I have since continued much indisposed, 
and times have been so very distressing, that I had 
neither spirit to write a letter, nor an opportunity to 
convey it when written ; nor do I yet know by what 
means I shall get these sheets to your hands. 
</p><p>
I would fain hope that I have said nothing by 
which your delicacy can be in the least hurt. If I 
have, I assure you it has been without the least 
intention, and, therefore, your candor will lead you to 
forgive me. I have spoke freely of Congress and of 
the army; but what I have said is partly from my 
own knowledge, and partly from the information of 
some respectable members of the former, and some 
of the best officers of the latter. I would not offend the meanest person upon earth; what I say to you I 
say in confidence, to answer what I cannot but deem 
a most valuable purpose. I love my country ; I love 
you but to the love of truth, the love of peace, 
and the love of God, I hope I should be enabled, if 
called upon to the trial, to sacrifice every other inferior love. 
</p><p>
If the arguments made use of in this letter should 
have so much influence as to engage you in the glorious work which I have warmly recommended, I shall 
ever deem my success the highest temporal favor that 
<a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> could grant me. Your interposition and 
advice, I am confident, would meet with a favorable 
reception from the authority under which you act. 
</p><p>
If it should not, you have an infallible recourse 
still left ; negotiate for your country at the head of 
your army. After all, it may appear presumption, as 
an individual, to address himself to you on a subject 
of such magnitude, or to say what measures would 
best secure the interest and welfare of a whole continent. The friendly and favorable opinion you have 
always expressed for me, emboldens me to undertake 
it, and which has greatly added to the weight of this 
motive. I have been strongly impressed with a sense 
of duty upon the occasion, which left my conscience 
uneasy, and my heart afflicted, till I fully discharged 
it. I am no enthusiast ; the course is new and singular to me ; but I could not enjoy one moment's 
peace till this letter was written. With the most 
ardent prayers for your spiritual as well as temporal 
welfare, I am your most 
</p><p>
Obedient and humble friend and servant,

MAJOR JOHN BROWN TO GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 
</p><p>
Crown Point, 14 August, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775">1775</a>. 
</p><p>
MAY IT TLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 
</p><p>
On the 24th of last month, by the General's order, I set out 
for Canada with four men, with directions to penetrate the country, and get all the intelligence that could be had in regard to 
the military preparations making there by the king's troops, Canadians, or Indians ; what the situation of St. John s, Chamblee, 
Montreal, and Quebec ; how many troops at each place ; whether 
the Canadians designed to take up arms against us ; whether any 
reinforcements had arrived in the Colony, &c. 
</p><p>
I arrived in Canada on the 30th. Had a tedious and fatiguing 
march through a vast tract of swamp lying on the west side of 
the Lake, in which I lodged three nights. But I pass by the 
particulars of the adventure ; how pursued and surrounded by a 
large party of the enemy, when in a house ; escaping out of a 
back window, and pursued two days, on my return ; notwithstanding  which I continued in the country four days, being protected 
by the Canadians, who, I can assure you, are our friends, with 
out whose protection I must have fallen into the hands of the 
enemy. It is impossible for me to describe the kindness received 
from the French, as also their distressed situation, being threatened with destruction from the king's troops by fire and sword. 
Though they refuse to take up arms against the Colonies, they 
wish and long for nothing more than to see us, with an army, 
penetrate their country. They engage to supply us with every thing in their power. The Indians are determined to act in conjunction with the Canadians. Colonel Guy Johnson has arrived 
at Montreal with a party of three hundred, mostly tenants, unacquainted with arms. There are also some Indians arrived with 
him, via Oswego. They held a Council with the Iroquois and 
St. Louis, and are determined to act with the Canadians, except 
it be to go on discovery. 
</p><p>
The regulars are fortifying St. John's ; have raised two batteres, which mount nine guns each. They have intrenched and 
picketed out some distance from their other works. Two large 
row-galleys, of sixty or eighty feet in length each, are on the 
stocks, and will be finished soon. They mount twelve guns each. 
There are about seven hundred of the king's troops in Canada ; 
near three hundred at St. John s, about fifty at Quebec, the remainder at Montreal, Chamblee, and at the upper posts. Now, 
Sir, it is time to carry Canada. It may be done with great ease 
and little cost, and I have no doubt but the Canadians would 
join us. There is great defection among them. They have lately 
raised a mob, seized on the French officers lately appointed, and 
taken away their commissions. They were under arms several 
days, and it seemed that the king's troops durst not resent it ; 
but their captain, with one of my men (a Canadian) whom I 
sent to Montreal to do business, are both taken prisoners and in 
close hold. This, I imagine, will raise the resentment of the 
Canadians to a higher pitch than any thing that has yet been 
done. 
</p><p>
I left the country on the 3d instant, being informed by the 
Canadians that two scouts, of fifty men each, were sent out often ; 
the one up the Lake, the other to Montreal. I steered to the 
east north-east three days, and came to the Bay of Missisco, 
where I got a small canoe ; and, on the 10th instant, arrived at 
the Point. 
</p><p>
Should a large reinforcement arrive in Canada, it will turn 
the scale immediately. The Canadians must then take up arms, 
or be ruined. 
</p><p>
It seems that some evil planet has reigned in this quarter this 
year, for notwithstanding the season far advanced, and a fine opportunity presents of making ourselves masters of a country, with 
the greatest ease, which, I fear, may cost us much blood and treasure, if delayed, <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> have acted a droll part, and are determined to defeat us, if in their power ; they have failed in men 
and supplies. 
</p><p>
I beg your Honor's pardon for troubling you with this letter; 
but, as every friend and well-wisher to the success of our arms 
is curious as to the probability of the success, I have taken it 
on me to acquaint your Honor of the state of Canada, which 
doubtless you may have from the General in a more perfect 
manner. It is by Mr. Bennet's motion, in part, that I give your 
Honor this trouble. I hope, as my paper, ink, and eye-sight are 
bad, that you will pass by mistakes. I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Honor's most obedient, humble servant,

COLONEL ETHAN ALLEN TO GENERAL SCHUYLER. 
</p><p>
September 14, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775">1775</a>. 
</p><p>
Wednesday, the 6th of September, set out from Isle-aux-Noix. 
On the 8th instant, I arrived at Chamblee; found the Canadians 
in that vicinity friendly; they guarded me under arms night and 
day, escorted me through the woods, as I desired, and showed me 
every courtesy I could wish for. The news of my being in this 
place excited many Captains of the militia, and respectable Gentlemen of the Canadians, to visit and converse with me, as I 
gave out I was sent by General Schuyler to manifest his friendly 
intentions towards them, and delivered the General's written 
manifesto to the Chiefs of the Caghnawaga Indians, demanding 
the cause why sundry of the Indians had taken up arms against 
the United Colonies. 
</p><p>
They sent two of their Chiefs to me, who plead that it was 
contrary to the will and orders of their Chiefs. The king's troops 
gave them rum, and inveigled them to fight General Schuyler ; 
that they had sent their runners and ordered them to depart 
from St. John s, averring their friendship to the Colonies. Mean 
while the Sachems held a general council, sent two of their Captains and some beads of a wampum belt as a lasting testimony 
of their friendship, and that they would not take up arms on 
either side. These tokens of friendship were delivered to me, 
agreeably to their ceremony, in a solemn manner, in the presence 
of a large auditory of Canadians, who approved of the league 
and manifested friendship to the Colonies, and testified their good 
will on account of the advance of the army into Canada. Their 
fear, as they said, was, that our army were too weak to protect 
them against the severity of the English government, as a defeat 
on our part would expose our friends in Canada to it. In this 
dilemma, our friends expressed anxiety of mind. 
</p><p>
It furthermore appeared to me, that many of the Canadians 
were watching the scale of power, whose attraction attracted them. 
In fine, our friends in Canada earnestly urged that General 
Schuyler should immediately environ St. John's ; that they would 
assist in cutting off the communication between St. John's and 
Chamblee, and between these forts and Montreal. They further 
more assured me that they would help our army to provisions, 
&c.; and that, if our army did not make a conquest of the king's 
garrisons, they would be exposed to the resentment of the English government, which they dreaded, and consequently, that the 
attempt of the army into Canada would be to them the greatest 
evil. They furthermore told me, that some of the inhabitants, 
that were in their hearts friendly to us, would [resolve] to Extricate themselves and take up arms in favor of the crown ; and, 
therefore, it was of the last importance to them that the army 
immediately attack St. John s, which would cause them to take 
up arms in our favor. 
</p><p>
Governor Carleton threatens the Canadians with fire and 
sword, except they assist him against the Colonies, and the Seignieurs urge them to it. They have withstood Carleton and them, 
and keep under arms throughout most of their parishes, and are 
now anxiously watching the scale of power. 
</p><p>
This is the situation of affairs in Canada, according to my most 
painful discoveries, given under my hand, upon honor, this 14th 
day of September, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775">1775</a>.

Laprairie, 27 September, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775">1775</a>. 
</p><p>
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR HONOR, 
</p><p>
I have the disagreeable news to write to you, that Colonel Allen 
hath met with a defeat by a stronger force, which sallied out of 
the town of Montreal, after he had crossed the river about a 
mile below the town. I have no certain knowledge of Allen as 
yet, whether he is killed, taken, or fled. But this defeat hath 
put the French people into great consternation ; they are much 
concerned for fear of a company coming over against us. Furthermore, the Indian Chiefs were at Montreal, at the time of 
Allen's battle, and there was a number of the Caghnawaga Indians 
in the battle against Allen, and the people are very fearful of 
the Indians ; there were six in here last night, I suppose sent as 
spies. I asked the Indians concerning their appearing against us 
in every battle ; their answer to me was, that Carleton made 
them drunk, and drove them to it ; but they say they would do 
so no more. 
</p><p>
I should think it proper to keep a party at Longueil, and my 
party is not big enough to divide, if I tarry here. I should be 
glad of my regiment, for my party is made up with different 
companies, and different regiments, and my reputation is not so good as I could wish for. Subordination to your orders is my 
pleasure. I am, Sir, with submission,

P. S. This morning arrived, from Colonel Allen's defeat, Captain Duggan, with the following intelligence. Colonel Allen is 
absolutely taken captive into Montreal, with a few more, and 
about two or three killed, and about as many wounded. The 
living have not all come in. Something of a slaughter made 
among the King's troops. From yours to serve,

</p><p>
Montreal, 19 October, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775">1775</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I had the pleasure to write you from Quebec, the 18th ultimo, 
per the Cillery, Captain Hardie ; since which I have been much 
alarmed by a letter from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, dated the 5th ultimo, advising 
of Halifax being taken ; but I was soon relieved by a letter 
from Mr. Butler, dated the 1st September, which was soon followed by others of the 16th and 21st, by which I learn, to my 
great comfort, that the Province was not in any immediate danger. Nor do I conceive these people will be so mad as to send 
a body of men, where, let their success be ever so great, they 
cannot winter them. Indeed, the Admiral's orders to destroy their 
vessels will, if executed, effectually prevent their crossing the Bay of Fundy. 
</p><p>
It is my opinion General Gage cannot winter the army in 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and that he will soon be obliged to quit it. If so, part 
of them must winter at Halifax, and part at Quebec, where they 
are indeed much wanted ; for such is the wretched state of this 
unhappy Province, that Colonel Allen, with a few despicable 
wretches, would have taken this city on the 25th ultimo, had not 
its inhabitants marched out to give them battle. They fought, 
conquered, and thereby saved the Province for a while. Allen 
and his banditti were mostly taken prisoners. He is now in 
chains on board the Gaspee. This little action has changed the 
face of things. The Canadians before were nine tenths for the 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>ians. They are now returned to their duty, many in arms for the King, and the parishes, who had been otherwise, are 
daily demanding their pardon, and taking arms for the Crown. 
St. John's is still invested. They have in the fort eight hundred 
men, well fortified and appointed. There is little danger of its 
being taken ; yet I cordially wish for a few battalions of the 
King's troops to chase them out of the country. Our weather 
has been remarkably fine and mild, or they would soon be 
moving. 
</p><p>
The Adamant is nearly loaded. I hope to sail from Quebec 
about the 10th of next month, and to arrive in England before 
Parliament shall adjourn for the holidays. Let me entreat you 
to remit the balance of Mr. Louberbahler's account. Every shilling is a relief at this time of general distress. 
</p><p>
My good wishes attend Mrs. Franklin and the children; and I pray you to believe, that I am, dear Sir,

THE COMMISSIONERS IN CANADA TO GENERAL SCHUYLER. 
</p><p>
Montreal, 10 May, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>. 
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Colonel Campbell arrived here early this morning from Quebec, lie informs that five ships of war arrived there last Monday, the 5th, about sunrise, namely, two large ships, two frigates, 
and a tender. The enemy made a sally on Monday, between 
ten and eleven o clock, in a body, supposed not to be less than a 
thousand. Our forces were so dispersed, that not more than two 
hundred could be collected at head-quarters. 
</p><p>
In this situation a retreat was inevitable, and made in the utmost precipitation and confusion, with the loss of our cannon on 
the batteries, provisions, five hundred stand of small arms, and 
a bateau load of powder, going down with Colonel Allen. Colonel Campbell believes the loss of men inconsiderable, except the 
sick in the respective hospitals, amounting in the whole to about 
two hundred, so ill as not to be removed, who have fallen into 
the enemy's hands. 
</p><p>
Our army are now on their way to the mouth of the Sorel, where they propose to make a stand. Colonel Greaton's battalion is arrived there ; and we expect the residue of the brigade under the command of General Thompson, is arrived before this at St. John s. From the present appearance of things it is very probable we shall be under the necessity of abandoning Canada, at least all except that part which lies on the Sorel. We may certainly keep possession of St. John's till the enemy can bring up against that post a superior force, and an artillery to besiege it. 
</p><p>
A further reinforcement will further increase our distress ; an 
immediate supply of provisions from over the Lakes is absolutely 
necessary for the preservation of the troops already in this province. As we shall be obliged to evacuate all this country, Except that part of it already mentioned, no provisions can be drawn from Canada ; the subsistence, therefore, of our army will entirely depend on the supplies it can receive, and that immediately, from <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>. 
</p><p>
We need not mention the propriety of immediately fitting out 
the vessels at the place to bring over our provisions, and the 
sending off bateaux, and constructing more, for drawing the troops 
out of Canada, should we be constrained, by superior force, to 
take that measure ; and in the interim to bring provisions. 
</p><p>
It is probable, a considerable part of the bateaux now on the 
St. Lawrence will be destroyed, or fall into the enemy's hands. 
We mention this circumstance to show the necessity of constructing  more. 
</p><p>
We can form no opinion of the force brought into Quebec by 
the enemy. Colonel Campbell mentions that information, received 
at our camp before Quebec, was, that fifteen sail of ships were 
in the river, though only five were come up, as before mentioned. 
</p><p>
We received your favor of the 2d instant, directed to B. F. 
We are, with great respect and regards, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servants,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
We are fully sensible of the great risk of taking post at De-chambeau. We have suggested, in writing, the difficulties and 
reasons which have occurred to us against that measure, to General Arnold. Our army's remaining at Dechambeau, will depend in great measure on the strength of the enemy's land forces, 
and their activity and diligence in following up the blow they 
have already given our small and shattered army. Before this, 
no doubt, General Thomas has received some information of the 
enemy's numbers and of their motions. We arc inclined to think 
a retreat will be made, first to St. John's and then to the Isle-aux-Noix. 
</p><p>
Our letter to General Schuyler will give you all the information 
we have in our power to give, respecting the possibility of subsist-ting our army in Canada. We are of the opinion, that General 
Sullivan's brigade ought to be stopped at Fort George, till General 
Schuyler can send over with them a sufficient supply of pork, 
not only for the subsistence of that brigade, but of the rest of 
the army in Canada. Flour we are in hopes of procuring in 
sufficient quantities to support the army, at least for four months, 
provided we can keep possession of the country adjacent to the 
River Sorel, for the space of three weeks. 
</p><p>
"We sincerely wish the perfect reestablishment of your health. 
Our stay at this place is uncertain. We shall be cautious to retreat in time to St. John s. We understand there is but a very 
small garrison there, and exceedingly negligent. No sentries 
posted in the night. This information we had from Mr. Price, 
who was an eye-witness of this negligence. Do speak about it. 
We are, with great esteem, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate, humble servants, 
</p><p>
CHARLES CARROLL, of Carrollton.

SAMUEL CHASE AND CHARLES CARROLL TO GENERAL THOMAS.

Montreal, 20 May, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
We are favored with yours of yesterday from Chamblee. We 
went to Sorel on purpose to learn the condition of our army, 
and to know the sentiments of the General Officers respecting the 
future operations of the campaign. We expected to have had 
the pleasure of meeting with you there. On our way to Sorel, 
we were informed of your being taken ill with the smallpox, and 
that you had left the camp. We hoped to have found you at 
Chamblee ; and to converse with you on the state of our affairs 
in this country, was the principal end of our journey thither. 
Unluckily, we passed you on the road. 
</p><p>
In the present situation of the army, we think it would be impracticable to occupy and fortify the posts of Dechambeau and 
Jacques Cartier. We are sorry to find so little discipline in the 
army, and that it is so badly provided in every respect. We 
have some time since written pressingly to Congress for hard 
money, without which we believe it impossible to relieve our 
wants. The most immediate and pressing necessity is the want of flour. We have advised General Wooster to issue an order 
to the Town Major to wait on the merchants or others having 
provisions or merchandise for sale, and request a delivery of 
what the soldiers are in immediate want of, and pledge the faith 
of the United Colonies for payment; and have given it as our 
opinion, that, on refusal, our necessity requires that force should 
be used to compel a delivery. We have advised the General to 
issue a similar order to Messrs. Price and McCarty. The General has complied with our advice in both instances, and yesterday evening despatched an express to St. John s, with a letter 
to those gentlemen. We wrote to them by the same opportunity 
our sentiments. Flour is not to be procured in any considerable 
quantity on this Island, unless immediate steps be taken to se 
cure large quantities of wheat, and have it ground up into flour 
with the utmost despatch. The army will be reduced to the 
greatest straits for want of bread. We most earnestly entreat 
you to turn your attention to this matter, and to use all the 
means which your prudence will suggest to procure flour for the 
troops. None is to be expected, at least for some time, from 
over the Lakes. Our soldiers will be soon reduced to the dreadful alternative of starving, or of plundering the inhabitants. The 
laUcr will surely happen, if our troops should not be supplied 
with bread in a regular way. Their other immediate wants may 
in some measure be relieved by compelling a delivery of some 
goods on the same terms with wheat and flour. This, however, 
we confess a violent remedy, which nothing can justify but the 
most urgent necessity, and therefore cannot be long pursued with 
out drawing on us the resentment of the inhabitants. In short, 
Sir, without a speedy supply of hard money, it appears to us 
next to impossible to remain in Canada, even if we had no enemy but the inhabitants to contend with. 
</p><p>
We have already mentioned the bad discipline of the army. 
It is no doubt, in a great measure, owing to the cause assigned 
in one of your letters, the short enlistments ; but there appear 
to us other causes. The officers are not sufficiently active ; nor 
do they seem actuated by those disinterested principles and Generous sentiments which might be expected from men fighting in so 
just and glorious a cause. We would not be understood to cast 
a general reflection. There are many officers, we are satisfied, 
who act upon the noblest motives ; but it gives us pain to assert, 
on the best information, that there are several whose conduct 
has too plainly proved them unworthy of the character and trust 
conferred on them by their countrymen. 
</p><p>
We have mentioned our sentiments with freedom. We shall 
always give our opinions with the same. We mean not to dictate, but to advise with you and the general officers on the most 
effectual ways and means of extricating ourselves from our present difficulties, and promoting the general service. As by this 
time the virulence of your disorder, we hope, is abated, we recommend a meeting of the General Officers at Chamblee, to consult about and agree upon the future operations of the war in 
Canada. The inclosed copy of General Arnold's last letter will 
give you the best intelligence respecting the affair at the Cedars, 
and the actual state of the enemy, and our forces on this Island. 
Colonel Dehaas marched yesterday evening from this town, at 
six o clock, with four hundred men to La Chine. "We flatter 
ourselves we shall drive the enemy off the Island, redeem our 
prisoners, and recover our post at the Cedars. We are, with 
sincere wishes for your speedy recovery, 
</p><p>
Sir, your most obedient, humble servants, 
</p><p>
SAMUEL CHASE, 
</p><p>
CHARLES CARROLL, of Carrollton.
