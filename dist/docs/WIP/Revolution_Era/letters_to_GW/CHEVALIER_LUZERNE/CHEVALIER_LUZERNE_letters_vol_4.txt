Sir, 
</p><p>
The <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> has delivered to me 
the letters of your Excellency, and I am extremely 
flattered by this mark of your attention and of your 
remembrance. I have executed your commissions near 
his Majesty and the Royal Family, and the King is 
concerned that your domestic affairs deprive him of 
the satisfaction to see a man, whose talents and virtues have procured the happiness of his country, and 
excited the admiration of all others. 
</p><p>
I thank you heartily for the news your Excellency has been pleased to give me of America. The 
present excellent formation of Congress gives me 
great hopes that the public debt will be secured, 
and that all the other branches of administration will 
take a more regular form. A nation, which has done 
so great things as yours, during ten years, is expected to crown its achievements by acts of justice. 
This qualification is so common in America, that I am 
persuaded its voice will be heard in all your assemblies, and America will be at last as just in time of 
peace, as it has been patient and brave during the war. 
</p><p>
Since my arrival in Europe, the different Cabinets 
have been much agitated. The Emperor has produced 
some pretensions against Holland, which are not yet 
adjusted. He has likewise manifested a desire to 
annex the Duchy of Bavaria to his dominions, and to 
cede, by way of exchange, to the Elector the Austrian possessions in the Netherlands. This arrangement seems to displease very much the different military powers in Europe. Preparations of war are going on at Vienna, at Berlin, in Holland, and in 
France. It is, however, very probable that the war 
will not take place in the course of this year. But 
a general flame is certainly very near to break out; 
and though France and England be very far from 
wishing for war, it will be very difficult to prevent 
the troubles of Germany, if the Emperor does not, 
of his own accord, give up his pretensions. The Imperial Court seems to be intimately united with that 
of Russia ; two powers, rich in resources, and full of 
ambition ; and as they are not happy enough to 
have, like America, at their head a man who prefers 
the welfare of mankind to his private advantage, 
there are great apprehensions of a general war in 
Europe. The events of it will be read by your Excellency, in your retreat, with a small degree of satisfaction; for you will observe that, far from giving 
liberty to some nation, this war will only serve to 
increase the miseries of several countries during many years. 
</p><p>
I am very thankful for the interest you are pleased to take in my fate, which is not yet decided. If 
I was allowed to follow my own inclination, I should 
wish to return to America, and to be happy with my 
old friends ; but a consequence of my profession is to 
accept of the destination which is prescribed to me. 
Whatever it may be, I shall never forget the attention and friendship of your Excellency. I beg you 
to continue in those sentiments, and to honor me 
sometimes with your letters. With the most sincere 
and respectful attachment and acknowledgment, I 
have the honor to be. Sir, your Excellency's 
Most obedient and very humble servant,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I dare to flatter myself, that your Excellency does justice to the very tender and respectful attachment which I have long entertained towards you and that 
you will be persuaded of the great pleasure with 
which I have learned the success that has followed 
the first movements of your administration. After 
having given freedom to your country, it was worthy 
of the virtues and great character of your Excellency, 
to establish her happiness on a solid and permanent 
basis, which is assuredly the result of the new Federal Constitution, in framing which you assisted by 
your counsel, and which you now support as much 
by the splendor of your talents and patriotism, as 
by the eminent situation confided to you by your 
fellow-citizens. They possess the advantage of enjoying more particularly your beneficence, and the 
honor of having you born among them. But I dare 
to assure you, that the consideration which you enjoy throughout Europe, and particularly in my country, yields not even to that which you have obtained 
in your native land ; and, notwithstanding the prejudices of the people with whom I live here, there is 
not one among them who does not pronounce your 
name with sentiments of respect and veneration. All 
are acquainted with the services you have rendered 
to your country, as their General, in the course of 
the war, and with those, perhaps still greater, which 
you now render as a statesman, in peace. 
</p><p>
The love of glory and of freedom, which led the 
Americans to surmount such great difficulties, must 
still prevail, after surmounting them, to establish the 
principles of justice towards those of their fellow citizens and strangers who assisted them in their 
distress ; and I have seen, with great pleasure, that, 
from the first moment in which you have appeared at 
the head of the Federal Government, the credit of 
the American nation has been established in every 
country of Europe, and that the confidence in her 
resources and means is infinitely better founded, 
than in many of the older powers. It is beyond 
doubt that it will take still greater consistency, and 
that the freest country in the world ought also to be 
that which should enjoy the most extensive public 
credit. 
</p><p>
I am too well acquainted with your sentiments for 
France, not to be convinced of the interest which you 
take in her present position. The vices of an ancient 
and vitiated administration could not be reformed, 
even by the virtues of a King, who loves his people, 
and who has many qualities to make them happy. 
Some revolution was required in the form of the monarchy, and, above all, in setting bounds to the Ministerial authority in matters of finance. It was likewise necessary, that the liberty of the citizen should 
be assured, by a conclusive law, of which we were 
totally destitute. It is this which induced the King 
to assemble the States-General, who might easily have 
made some useful reforms, leaving the monarchy to 
subsist, or at least reforming it but slowly and partially. But the love of liberty, and still more the 
exaltation of opinions, have carried us too far ; they 
have overturned every thing, without rebuilding any 
thing, which has reduced us to a very disagreeable 
situation for the moment. I hope that time will a 
little moderate opinions, and that we shall recur to 
true principles; and that, in assuring the liberty of 
the citizen, they will restore the authority of the 
Executive power, which is the soul of a great empire. 
If we can arrive at that state of things, I am persuaded the subject will have gained infinitely, and 
that even the position of the King will be more happy than it formerly was. But, unfortunately, to attain 
this situation we must reiterate a very thorny career; 
and our French heads are little fitted for such proofs. 
</p><p>
Your ancient friend, the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>, finds 
himself at the head of the revolution ; and it is indeed a very fortunate circumstance for the State that 
he is, but very little so for himself. Never has any 
man been placed in a more critical situation. A 
good citizen, a faithful subject, he is embarrassed 
by a thousand difficulties in making many people 
sensible of what is proper, who very often feel it not, 
and who sometimes will not understand what it is. 
</p><p>
He has occasion for all the aid of that wisdom and 
prudence which he acquired under your tuition; and 
assuredly he has hitherto proved himself worthy of 
his master, having supported the most difficult situation with the rarest talents and most astonishing foresight. I have the honor to be, with a very sincere 
and very respectful attachment, your Excellency's 
Most humble and most obedient servant.
