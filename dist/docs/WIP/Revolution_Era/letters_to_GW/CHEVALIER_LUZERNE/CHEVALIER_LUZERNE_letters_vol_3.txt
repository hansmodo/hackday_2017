Sir, 
</p><p>
I inclose to your Excellency a letter for <a href='/results.php?tla=cdt' rel='colleague'>M. De Ternay</a>, in which you will see what measures I have 
taken to fulfil the intentions, which you imparted to 
me on the 27th instant. I beg you will seal this 
packet, and send it to his address by the first opportunity. 
</p><p>
Congress have put under your orders the frigates, 
in directing them to come into the Delaware. You 
will be able to judge, after your arrangements with 
the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdt' rel='colleague'>Chevalier De Ternay</a>, whether these vessels, or 
one of them, may not accomplish the commission desired Their cruise may then be useful to the commerce of the United States. I know not whether <a href='/results.php?tla=cdt' rel='colleague'>M. De Ternay</a> will communicate to them any signals, by means of wMcli they may approach the coast without 
danger. Your Excellency may be able, should you 
think it necessary, to suggest it to him. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to he, &c.,

Sir, 
</p><p>
I flattered myself that the clothing, destined for 
the army under the command of your Excellency, 
had at length arrived in the river, in the vessel of 
Paul Jones, or in one of those coming under his 
convoy; but I regret that you have not yet had 
that satisfaction. A passenger, who arrived in one of 
this convoy, told me that when this little squadron, 
which left France on the 8th of October, should arrive, they would bring but little clothing, being in 
great part laden with arms and ammunition; but he 
added that the Serapis is destined to bring the 
remainder of the clothing, and that we may hope 
to see the vessel arrive soon in our ports. I am 
anxious to have an opportunity of giving your Excellency notice of the arrival of these articles. 
</p><p>
I have received certain intelligence that an expedition, composed of four thousand troops, convoyed 
by eight vessels of war, departed on the 16th of October from the Havana to attempt an expedition 
against Pensacola. But it is thought that the terrible tempests, which they may have experienced on 
the passage, may have retarded the fleet. 
</p><p>
Another expedition was to depart in the month of 
December, to attack St. Augustine. It was to be 
composed of ten thousand men, regulars and militia, 
and twelve vessels of war. I wish, sincerely, that the 
operation may meet with success, and thus make an 
advantageous diversion in favor of the United States 
in that quarter. 
</p><p>
The Chevalier de Chastellux and the officers who 
had the honor of visiting you at head-quarters, desire 
me to present their respects to you. They hope to 
have the honor of seeing you again on their return.

I am, &c.,

Sir, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to send to your Excellency an open packet for the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague met'>Count De Rochambeau</a>. You will 
there find the copy of a letter to me from M. Destouches. I lament the ill success of an expedition. 
which, if it had succeeded, would have been doubly 
agreeable to us by its utility to our allies, and by 
the honor it would have reflected upon the arms of 
the King. As to the rest, it appears that our Commanders have fulfilled this latter point; and all the 
world is satisfied that, having a superior force to 
contend against, the manner of the contest has been 
highly honorable to them. 
</p><p>
I wait for happier events. Sir, from the campaign 
which is now about to open ; and I doubt not the 
<a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague met'>Count De Rochambeau</a> has given you, in detail, the 
news which he has received from France. 
I have the honor to be, &c.,

</p><p>
I embrace the first moment after my return from 
Virginia; to comply with the request of the principal 
officers of our army in tendering you their sincere respects. I have already forwarded to your Excellency 
a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague met'>Count De Rochambeau</a>. On my return 
here, I found letters from my Court, dated in February last. They do not announce any thing pacific on 
the part of our enemies. No progress is made in the 
mediation of the Courts of Vienna and Petersburg ; 
and the Court of London seems determined to risk 
the event of another campaign, in which they will 
employ all the strength they have left. The plan 
for the campaign was not yet finally decided ; it depending on some arrangements which were yet to be 
made with the Court of Madrid, and on some advices 
which were expected from the Antilles. It nevertheless seemed to be the intention to act vigorously for 
the assistance of the United States; and though no 
particular assurances could be given me on this head, 
yet, from what they write me, it is probable that 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> or <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, or perhaps both, will be 
the object of their efforts next campaign. 
</p><p>
I think it, however, proper to inform you that, at 
the same time they announce to me their general 
views, they observe that it is an unhappy circumstance that the American army is so weak as it is ; 
and they seem to fear that it will not be in a condition to second their efforts, when it shall be necessary to strike a decisive stroke, or to undertake operations in which such extensive means are required 
as in a siege. 
</p><p>
I beg your Excellency would enable me to give 
my Court the necessary information on a matter so 
important as this is. I am not curious to know any 
of the particular details relative to your army, which 
it may be necessary to keep secret j but the military operations of France and America are so intimately connected, that it is indispensable for us to 
know what is the actual force and means which you 
have, in order to calculate, with any degree of probability, what enterprises can be undertaken. Our 
ignorance in this respect cannot but be very prejudicial to our affairs, because if, from false information, 
we consider your army as weaker than it really is, 
it will prevent our forming plans which it would be 
possible to execute ; and if, on the contrary, we 
are led to believe it stronger than it really is, we 
run the risk of forming plans impracticable in their 
execution. It is from these considerations that I beg 
you to confide to me such information on this head 
as you may think proper, both with respect to the 
actual force you have at the different parts of the 
Continent, and what it will probably be in the course 
of the campaign. It is equally interesting to know 
the force of the enemy, both in regulars and militia. 
I beg you to rest assured of the discretion with 
which I shall make use of these communications. 
</p><p>
I cannot refuse myself the pleasure of communicating to you the sentiments with which our Court and 
the nation at large are inspired, from the reports of 
the French officers, respecting your Excellency, on 
their return to Versailles. Their testimony could 
add nothing to the universal opinion of the great 
services you have rendered your country j but to the 
esteem and admiration of the French, is now added a 
sentiment of affection and attachment, which is the 
just return for that attention our military experienced 
from you, and the progress they made in their profession by serving under your orders. I have the 
honor to be, with sentiments of the most respectful 
and inviolable attachment, Sir, your Excellency's 
Most humble and most obedient servant,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received the letter which your Excellency 
did me the honor to write on the 23d of the past 
month, and that of the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague met'>Count De Rochambeau</a>, with 
which it was accompanied. 
I wait with extreme impatience the news of the 
arrival of the French division before <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>; and 
no one can desire more warmly than I do to see it 
under your immediate command. I hoped most fervently that you would have been this spring in the 
command of a more considerable body of auxiliaries. 
The causes which have hindered the execution of 
that plan have been so urgent and so decisive, that I 
am sure you will approve them, after I shall have 
had the honor of making you acquainted with them. 
I have nevertheless been much pained that I could 
not explain to you this change of measures; and my 
attachment to the cause which you defend has made 
me feel, as sensibly as any citizen of America, all the 
delays which could happen to the assistance which we 
wish to give to the thirteen States. 
</p><p>
I am impressed with the necessity of maintaining 
a perfect confidence with your Excellency upon these 
different points, and I shall seize the first occasion 
which presents itself to visit your army. 
</p><p>
In the mean time, I am going to transmit to the 
Count de Grasse what your Excellency did me the 
honor to communicate. Be persuaded that I shall 
use the most pressing motives to determine him, and 
I shall do it with so much the more zeal, as I feel 
the necessity of it. I shall transmit to that General an extract of your letter; and nothing appears to me 
more likely to give weight to the demand which I 
shall make from him. 
</p><p>
The King has charged me, Sir, to inform Congress, 
that he grants them a gratuitous subsidy, to enable 
them to make the greatest efforts in the course of 
this campaign. This subsidy, amounting to six millions of livres tournois, is to be employed in the 
purchase of arms, ammunition, and clothing ; and it is the intention of the King, that the surplus shall he 
at the disposal of Congress. I have not been instructed, as to what will be the exact amount of this 
surplus; but in the mean time it is determined that 
one million and a half shall be employed by the Superintendent of Finances of the thirteen States, according to the directions which you shall give him, 
and after the arrangements which you shall make 
with him in the visit which he intends making you. 
I have informed Congress, and I intrust it to your 
Excellency, that the Emperor and the Empress of 
Russia have offered their mediation to the Court of 
London, which has accepted it. It has also been offered to the Court of Versailles and that of Madrid. 
But they have given for answer, that time must be 
left to Congress to determine, if it suits them to put 
the interests of the thirteen States into the hands of 
the Mediators. In any event, it is of the greatest 
importance that the allies make all their efforts to 
drive the enemy from This Continent; and nothing will 
be more likely than the success of the confederate 
arms, to make a successful negotiation. 
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
