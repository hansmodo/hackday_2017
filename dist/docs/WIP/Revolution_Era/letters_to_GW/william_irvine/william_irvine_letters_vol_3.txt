</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
At the time Congress directed me to repair to this place, I took for granted your Excellency would have 
information thereof through different channels ; and 
knowing how very particularly you were at that moment engaged, I did not think proper to give unnecessary trouble. This, I flatter myself, will excuse 
me to your Excellency for not writing sooner. Previous to my arrival, Colonel Gibson had received 
your letter directing him to take the command, which 
was acquiesced in by <a href='/results.php?tla=dab' rel='colleague'>Colonel Brodhead</a> ; and things 
went on in the usual channel, except that the dispute occasioned Colonel Gibson's intended expedition 
against Sandusky being laid aside, and perhaps it the intention of Congress by consulting with and employing the assistance of the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>, in accelerating the supplies which 
may be afforded by his Most Christian Majesty for the use of the United States ; 
</p><p>
" That the Superintendent of Finance, the Secretary for Foreign 
Affairs, and the Board of War, make such communications to the 
<a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>, touching the affairs of their respective departments, as will best enable him to fulfil the purpose of the two resolutions immediately preceding ; 
</p><p>
" That the Superintendent of Finance take order for discharging the 
engagement entered into by the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> with the merchants of <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>, referred to in the act of the 24th of May last. 
</p><p>
" Ordered, That the Superintendent of Finance furnish the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> with a proper conveyance to France; 
</p><p>
" That the Secretary for Foreign Affairs report a letter to his Most 
Christian Majesty, to be sent by the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>." 
</p><p>
When Lafayette was marching from the Head of Elk to Virginia, 
the citizens of <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a> contributed very liberally to assist him in 
furnishing supplies of clothing to his troops. On the 24th of May, the 
following resolve, alluded to above, was passed; â€” 
</p><p>
" Resolved, That Congress entertain a just sense of the patriotic and 
timely exertions of the merchants of <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>, who so generously supplied the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> with about two thousand guineas, to 
enable him to forward the detachment under his command; 
</p><p>
"That the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> be assured that Congress will take 
proper measures to discharge the engagements he has entered into with 
the merchants." 
</p><p>
also prevented many other necessary arrangements. 
The examination of evidences, on the charges against <a href='/results.php?tla=dab' rel='colleague'>Colonel Brodhead</a>, are still taking, and I am informed will continue some weeks. 
</p><p>
Agreeably to my orders from Congress, to retain 
no more officers here than sufficient for the men, I 
have made the following arrangements. Reformed the 
remains of the late eighth Pennsylvania regiment into 
two companies, and call them a detachment from the 
Pennsylvania line, to be commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Bayard. <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron Steuben</a> had some time as-o 
directed Colonel Gibson to reform his regiment also 
into two companies, retaining with him the Staff of 
the regiment; and to send all the supernumerary 
officers down into Virginia. The reformation w\is so 
made ; but the officers were so distressed, for want of 
clothing and other necessaries, that they were not 
able to proceed ; however they are now making exertions, and I hope will soon set out. I have ordered 
the supernumerary officers of the Pennsylvania line 
to repair forthwith to their proper regiments in the 
line. The whole of the troops, here, are thrown into 
four companies. I have been trying to economize ; 
but every thing is in so wretched a state, that there 
is very little in my power. I never saw troops cut 
so truly a deplorable, and at the same time despicable, a figure. Indeed, when I arrived, no man would 
believe, from their appearance, that they were soldiers ; nay, it would be difficult to determine whether 
they were ivldte men. Though they do not yet come up to my wishes, they are somewhat better. 
</p><p>
As it does not rest with me to decide on the propriety or impropriety of any person's conduct, I shall 
only make a few general observations. The consumption of public stores has, in my opinion, been enormous ; particularly military stores. And I fear the reasons given for it will not be justifiable ; namely, that 
the militia would all fly, if they had not powder and 
lead given them, not only when in service, but also 
to keep in their houses. It is true, the County Lieutenants, and others who are called responsible men, 
have promised to be accountable; but I am certain, 
that not an ounce can ever be again collected. I 
find, by the returns, that near two thousand pounds 
of powder, and four thousand pounds of lead, have 
been issued to the militia since the dispute commenced between Colonels Brodhead and Gibson, chiefly 
by orders of the former, beside arms, accoutrements, 
&c., and not a man called into actual service. The 
magazine is nearly exhausted. There is not now as 
much remaining as has been issued since the first of 
last September. 
</p><p>
I presume your Excellency has been informed by the Governor of Virginia, or General Clark, of the 
failure of his expedition. But lest that should not 
be the case, I will relate all the particulars that have 
come to my knowledge. Captain Craig, with the detachment of artillery under him, returned here the 
26th instant. He got up with much difficulty, and 
great fatigue to the men, being forty days on the 
way, occasioned by the lowness of the river. He 
was obliged to throw away his gun-carriages, but 
brought his pieces and best stores safe. He left 
General Clark at the Rapids ; and says the General was not able to prosecute his intended plan 
of operation, for want of men, being able to collect, 
in the whole, only about seven hundred and fifty, 
and the buffalo meat was all rotten; and adds, the 
General is apprehensive of a visit from Detroit, and 
is not without fears the settlement will be obliged to 
break up, unless reenforcements soon arrive from Virginia. The Indians have been so numerous in that 
country, that all the inhabitants have been obliged to 
keep close in forts, and the General could not venture 
out to fight them. 
</p><p>
A Colonel Lochrey, Lieutenant of Westmoreland 
county, in Pennsylvania, with about one hundred men 
in all, composed of volunteers, and a company raised 
by Pennsylvania for the defence of said county, followed General Clark, who, 'tis said, ordered Lochrey 
to join him at the mouth of Miami, up which river 
it had previously been agreed on to proceed. But 
General Clark, having changed his plan, left a small 
party at Miami, with directions to Lochrey to proceed on to the Falls after him, with the main body. 
Sundry accounts agree that this party, and all Lochrey's, to a man, were waylaid by Indians and regulars 
(for it is asserted they had artillery), and all killed 
or taken. No man, however, escaped either to join 
General Clark or return home. When Captain Craig 
left the General, he could not be persuaded but that Lochrey with his party had returned home. These 
misfortunes throw the people of this country into the 
greatest consternation and almost despair, particularly 
Westmoreland county, Lochrey's party being all the 
best men of that frontier. At present they talk of 
flying early in spring to the eastern side of the 
mountain, and are daily flocking to me to inquire 
what support they may expect. 
</p><p>
I think there is but too much reason to fear that 
General Clark's and Colonel Gibson's expeditions falling through, will greatly encourage the savages to 
fall on the country with double fury, or perhaps the 
British, from Detroit, to visit this post, which, instead 
of being in a tolerable state of defence, is in fact nothing but a heap of ruins. I need not inform 
your Excellency that it is, at best, but a bad situation for defence. I have been viewing all the ground 
in this vicinity, and find none equal for a post to 
the mouth of Shirter's Creek, about four miles down 
the river. This was pointed out to me by Captain 
Hutchins before I left <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, who says there 
is no place equal to it anywhere within forty miles of <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a>. 
</p><p>
I think it best calculated on many accounts. First, 
the ground is such that works may be constructed to 
contain any number of men you please, from fifty to 
one thousand. It is by nature almost inaccessible on 
three sides, and on the fourth no commanding ground 
within three thousand yards. Secondly, as it would 
effectually cover the settlement on Shirter's Creek, 
the necessity of keeping a post at Fort Mcintosh 
will of course cease. In case of making that the 
main post. <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a> should be demolished, all except 
the north bastion, on which a strong block-house 
should be built. A small party in it would as effectually keep up the communication with the settlements on Monongahela, as the whole garrison now 
does; for the necessary detachments to Fort Mcintosh, Wheeling, &c., so divide the troops, that no one 
place can ever be held without a large body of troops. 
Indeed, I do not like Fort Mcintosh being kept a 
post in the present situation of things. 
</p><p>
If the enemy from Detroit should take into their 
heads to make us a visit, that would be an excellent 
place for them to take by surprise; from whence 
they could send out Indians and other partisans to 
lay the whole country waste before we could dislodge 
them. We have (I think idly) too much of our 
stores there. I have been making efforts to bring up the greater part; but, though it is almost incredible, yet 'tis true that, of all the public boats 
built here, not a single one was there to be found 
when I came here, except one barge and one flat. I 
expect two boats up, loaded, this day. It is, I believe, universally agreed that the only way to keep 
Indians from harassing the country, is to visit them. 
But we find, by experience, that burning their empty 
towns has not the desired effect. They can soon 
build others. They must be followed up and beaten, 
or the British, whom they draw support from, totally 
driven out of their country. 
</p><p>
I believe, if Detroit was demolished, it would be 
a good step towards giving some, at least temporary, ease to this country. It would take at least a 
whole summer to rebuild and establish themselves ; 
for, though we should succeed in reducing Detroit, I 
do not think there is the smallest probability of our 
being able to hold it; it is too remote from supplies. 
I have been endeavouring to form some estimates; 
and, from such information as I can collect, I really 
think that the reduction of Detroit would not cost 
much more, nor take many more men than it will 
take to cover and protect the country by acting on 
the defensive. If I am well informed, it would take 
seven or eight hundred regular troops, and about a 
thousand militia; which number could pretty easily 
be obtained for that purpose, as it appears to be a 
favorite scheme over all this country. The principal 
difficulty would be to get provision and stores transported. As to taking a heavy train of artillery, I 
fear it would not only be impracticable, but an incumbrance ; two field-pieces, some howitz, and perhaps 
a mortar. I do not think, especially under present 
circumstances, that it would be possible to carry on an expedition in such a manner as to promise success 
by a regular siege. I would therefore propose to 
make every appearance of sitting down before the 
place, as if to reduce it by regular approaches ; as 
soon as I found the enemy fully impressed with This 
idea, attempt it at once by assault. 
</p><p>
I mean to write Congress for leave to go down the 
country in January, to return in March, if they make 
a point I should continue here. I can scarcely think 
they will wish me to remain with four companies of 
men. The power of calling out the militia of this 
country, is more ideal than real, especially till the 
lines between Virginia and Pennsylvania are determined, and actually run. Neither civil nor military 
law will take place till then. Whether I am to be 
continued here or not, I am pretty certain it might 
be of use for me to go down, in order the better to 
concert measures proper to be taken, either with your 
Excellency or Congress ; for, as matters now stand, it 
is clear to me this country must be given up. The 
militia, however, promise pretty fair, and I have had 
no ground for differing with them yet. There is no 
provision laid in, nor is there even sufficient from day 
to day. The contract made by <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague'>Mr. Morris</a> for supplying this post, has not been fulfilled on the part of 
the contractor in any tolerable degree ; nor would the 
contract answer here, even if complied with. However, as I must write particularly to the Board of 
War on this subject, and have exceeded moderate 
bounds for a letter, I fear I have already tired, and 
taken up too much of your Excellency's time. I have 
the honor to be, Sir, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wli" rel="me">William Irvine</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I have been told of three persons who were 
prisoners with the enemy, and have hitely made their 
escape. I have sent in search of them, but could not 
find them out. The Lieutenant of Washington county has promised to bring one of them to me as soon 
as possible. If they have any material accounts, I shall 
inform your Excellency the earliest possible. They 
have come from different places, and I am told all 
agree that great preparations are making to attack 
this country, at several places, at the same time. 
Speaking of prisoners, leads me to beg your Excellency's opinion or instructions respecting an exchange 
in this quarter, or a negotiation carried on with the 
Commander at Detroit. I find numbers of poor people are taken in this district ; some were taken at 
the commencement of the war, and are yet languishing in prison, in Canada, for they send all down to 
<a href='/results.php?city=quebec' rel='city'>Quebec</a> or <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'><a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a></a>. I cannot learn that any attempt 
has ever been made, on either side, to exchange them. 
</p><p>
John Hynds and Myndat Fisher have both been 
confined here a whole year, and are under sentence 
of a Court-Martial. I request your Excellency's orders 
respecting them. I am informed the proceedings of 
the Court were sent to head-quarters a considerable 
time since. W. I.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
The present strength of the garrison at <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a> 
is two hundred and thirty. At least thirty of these 
are unfit for field duty, and several, even garrison 
duty From this number, detachments are made to 
garrison Forts Mcintosh and Wheeling, the first distant thirty miles, the latter eighty. <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a> is in a 
bad state for defence ; Fort Mcintosh, pretty easily repaired. If <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a> were in the best state, the work 
is too extensive for less than a garrison of at least 
four hundred and fifty men, to make a tolerable defence. Fort Mcintosh would take one hundred and 
fifty to defend it properly, and be able to send patrolling parties towards Wheeling. 
</p><p>
Wheeling should have twenty-five or thirty men, 
and an equal number at some intermediate post. From 
<a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a> to the Laurel Hill, northwards, it would take 
two hundred men in actual service, from the first of 
April to the last of October, to guard that quarter 
from the incursions of the savages. By this arrangement, it would take nine hundred and fifty men to 
act on the defensive The whole of the summer season. 
The number of militia in Washington county is said 
to he two thousand; in Westmoreland, one thousand. 
The inhabitants are dispirited, and talk much of making their escape early in the spring to the east side 
of the mountain, unless they see a prospect of support. 
</p><p>
The Indians have all left us, except ten men ; and, 
by the best accounts, are preparing to make a stroke 
in the spring, either against General Clark, at the 
Rapids, or on <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a>; which, my informant could 
not with certainty say, but was positive one or the 
other was intended. I am apprehensive, from the 
steps taken by the Commandant at Detroit, that something serious is intended. First, thirteen nations of 
Indians have been treated with, in the beginning of 
November; at the conclusion, they were directed to 
keep themselves compact, and ready to assemble on 
short notice. Secondly, the Moravians are carried into captivity, and strictly watched, and threatened with 
severe punishment, if they should attempt to give us 
information of their movements. Thirdly, part of five 
nations are assembled at Sandusky. The Shawanese 
and lowas have settled nearer Detroit than formerly. 
There is no magazine of provision laid in at any of 
our posts, to hold out a siege ; ammunition exhausted ; 
no craft to transport materials for repairing the fort, 
or to keep up a communication with Fort Mcintosh 
or Wheeling, or to supply these posts with provision 
or stores, in case of exigence. 
</p><p>
To carry on an expedition against Detroit would 
take two thousand men, to give a tolerable certainty 
of success ; the time would be three months, and the 
best season to march from <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a>, the 1st of August. Then the waters are low; morasses, and soft, rich 
meadows dried up ; by land totally, preferable to any 
part by water, the enemy having entire command of 
the lake with armed vessels ; the navigation of rivers 
uncertain ; besides, the number of boats, and waste of 
time, would make it more expensive than land carriage. Pack-horses to carry provision would be better 
and more certain than wagons ; but, as a road must 
be cut for artillery, the ammunition and military stores 
would be transported with greater facility and more 
safety in wagons. One thousand horses would carry 
flour for two thousand men for three months. Beef 
must be driven on foot. Twenty-five wagons would 
carry military stores sufficient for the train, which 
should consist of two twelve-pounders, two sixes, one 
three-pounder, one eight-inch howitzer, and one royal. 
At least one half should be regular troops. If it is 
necessary to keep half the number of troops to act 
on the defensive that it will to act offensively, and 
three months are sufficient to complete the expedition, 
then the only difference in the expense will be transportation of provision and stores; as acting on the defensive, seven months will be the least, and the same 
quantity of provision will be consumed, and ammunition wasted. If we act offensively, it will draw the 
whole attention of the enemy to their own defence, 
by which our settlements will have peace; and such of 
the militia, as do not go on the expedition, will have 
time to raise crops. On the contrary, continual alarms 
will keep them from these necessary duties. The garrison at Detroit is three hundred regular troops, the 
militia (Canadians), from seven hundred to one thousand ; the number of Indians that could assemble in 
ten days' notice, to a certain point, about one thousand. 
</p><p>
Query. Should we be able to take Detroit, shall we hold it ? If not, what advantage will the bare reduction of the place be of, if immediately evacuated ? 
</p><p>
Answer. The reduction of Detroit, in the fall of 
the year, will prevent an intercourse with the Western 
Indians for a whole year, as it would be late in the 
succeeding summer before the British could reestablish 
themselves, during which time we might either open 
a trade with such savages as would ask for peace, or, 
by frequently penetrating into, and establishing posts 
in their country, oblige them to retire to such a distance as would put it out of their power to harass 
the back inhabitants. It would be attended with 
great expense, and vast risk, to support a garrison at 
Detroit, as long as the British possess the lower part 
of Canada, and have the command of Lake Erie. 
</p><p>
The present garrison is too weak to repair the fort, 
and perform other necessary duties ; no cash to pay 
artificers ; the troops in bad temper for want of pay ; 
under very bad discipline; too long in one station, as 
they have formed such connections as make them tenacious of the rights of citizens, while they at the 
same time retain all the vices common to a soldiery. 
What is contained in the foregoing report, is all that 
occurs to my memory at present, necessary to trouble your Excellency with. I have the honor to be, 
with perfect respect. Sir, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I arrived here the 25th of March. At that time 
things were in greater confusion than can well be 
conceived. The country people were, to all appearance, in a fit of frenzy. About three hundred had 
just returned from the Moravian towns, where they 
found about ninety men, women, and children, all of 
whom they put to death, it is said, after cool deliberation, and considering the matter for three days. 
The whole were collected into their church, and tied 
when singing hymns. On their return, a party came 
and attacked a few Delaware Indians, who have yet remained with us, on a small island close by this 
garrison, killed two who had Captain's commissions in 
our service, and several others ; the remainder effected 
their escape into the fort, except two who ran to the 
woods, and have not since been heard of. There was 
an officer's guard on the island at the same time, but 
he either did not do his duty, or his men connived 
at the thing; which, I am not yet able to ascertain. 
This last outrage was committed the day before 1 
arrived ; nothing of this nature has been attempted since. 
</p><p>
A number of wrong-headed men had conceived an 
opinion, that Colonel Gibson was a friend to Indians, 
and that he must be killed also. These transactions, 
added to the then mutinous disposition of the regular 
troops, had nearly brought on the loss of this whole 
country. I am confident, if this post was evacuated, 
the bounds of Canada would be extended to the Laurel Hill in a few weeks. I have the pleasure, however, to inform your Excellency that things now 
wear a more favorable aspect. The troops are again 
reduced to obedience, and I have had a meeting, or 
Convention, of the County Lieutenants and several 
Field-Officers, with whom I have made arrangements 
for defending their frontiers, and who promise to exert themselves in drawing out the militia, agreeably 
to law, on my requisitions. The few remaining Indians, chiefly women and children, are exceeding troublesome to us, as they dare not stir out of the fort ; 
not one of the warriors will even venture on a reconnoitring party. I think they would be better in 
some more interior part of the country, where they 
could be both cheaper fed and clothed. Besides, it 
is not only inconvenient, but improper, to have them 
among the troops, who are, without them, crowded in dirty, bad barracks. I beg your Excellency's instructions how to dispose of them. Their Chief, Killbuck, 
has a son and brother at <a href='/results.php?city=princeton' rel='city'>Princeton</a> College, whom he 
is anxious to see. 
</p><p>
Captain Springer, of the Virginia line, marched, 
some time since, with three Indians and as many 
white men, towards Sandusky, for the purpose of 
gaining intelligence ; but the Indians proved too timid 
for him to venture to go all the way. He of course 
returned, without being able to accomplish any thing. 
I thought it too great a risk, but it was by his request, and that of the Indians, who were very solicitous. It was proved on one of the party, named 
Eells, that he intended betraying Captain Springer, 
and all the party, into the hands of the enemy. I 
directed a Board of Officers to inquire into his conduct, who were of opinion he should suffer death. I 
ordered him executed ; he was shot on the 12th instant, seemingly much to the satisfaction of the other 
Indians. 
</p><p>
Civil authority is by no means properly established 
in this country, which I doubt proceeds in some degree from inattention in the Executives of Virginia 
and Pennsylvania. Not running the boundary line 
is, I think, a proof of this, which is at present an 
excuse for neglects of duty of all kinds, for at least 
twenty miles on each side of the line. More evils 
will arise from this neglect, than people are aware of 
Emigrations and New States are much talked of 
Advertisements are set up, announcing a day to assemble at Wheeling, for all who wish to become 
members of a new State on the Muskingum. A certain Mr. Johnson is at the head of this party ; he is 
ambitious, restless, and some say disaffected. Most 
people, however agree, he is open to co|ruption ; he 
has been in England since the commencement of the 
present war. ShoukI these people actually emigrate, 
they must be either entirely cut off, or immediately 
take protection from the British, which I fear is the 
real design of some of the party, though I think a 
great majority have no other views than to acquire 
lands. As I apprehended taking cognizance of these 
matters would come best from the civil authority, I 
have written to the Governors of Virginia and Pennsylvania on the subject, which I should not have 
done, till I had first acquainted your Excellency thereof, but for this consideration, namely, that the 20th 
of May is the day appointed for the emigrants to 
rendezvous ; consequently a representation from you 
would be too late, in case the States should think 
proper to take measures to prevent them. I am 
much embarrassed by the scanty and irregular supply of provision. I intend to write to <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague'>Mr. Morris</a> on 
this head. I have the honor to be. Sir, 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,

Sir, 
</p><p>
A number of the principal people of this country 
made application to me, about two weeks since, for 
my consent to their collecting a body of volunteers 
to go against Sandusky, which I agreed to on these 
express conditions; â€” that they did not mean to extend 
their settlements, nor had any thing in view but to 
harass the enemy, with an intention to protect the 
frontier, and that any conquests they might make 
should be in behalf and for the United States; that 
they would be governed by military laws as militia; 
that they must collect such numbers as might probably be successful ; and, lastly, that they would equip 
themselves and victual at their own expense. They 
are accordingly assembling this day at the Mingo 
bottom, all on horseback, with thirty days' provision. 
They have asked of me only a few flints, and a small 
supply of powder.

As they will elect their officers, I have taken some 
pains to get Colonel Crawford appointed to command, 
and hope he will be. He left me yesterday, on his 
way down to the place of rendezvous. He does not 
wish to go with a smaller number than four hundred; 
whether this number will assemble, I cannot say. He 
pressed me for some officers. I have sent with him 
Lieutenant Rose, my Aid-de-camp, a very vigilant, 
active, brave, young gentleman, well acquainted with 
service ; and a surgeon. These two are all I could 
venture to spare. Several were solicitous for my going, but I did not think myself at liberty, consistent 
with the spirit of your Excellency's instructions ; nor 
are we in such a situation that I could take a single 
Continental soldier along, particularly as the volunteers are all mounted. If their number exceeds three 
hundred, I am of opinion they may succeed, as their 
march will be so rapid they will probably, in a great 
degree, effect a surprise.

I cannot find a man in This country, who has a 
tolerable knowledge of the road to Niagara. There 
are numbers who are acquainted to the heads of Alleghany; from thence I think the people of the State 
of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> are better acquainted than any this 
way. I have the honor to be, with perfect respect,

P. S. The volunteers have sent requesting my instructions (which I will send) for the officer who may 
be appointed to command. The troops behave remarkably well, since a few examples have been made.

Sir, 
In my letter of the 21st of May, I mentioned to 
your Excellency that a body of volunteer militia were 
assembling at the Mingo Bottom, to go against Sandusky. The inclosed letters, one from Colonel Williamson, second in command, and the other from 
Lieutenant Rose, my Aid-de-camp, contain all the particulars of this transaction which have yet come to 
my knowledge. I am of opinion, had they reached 
the place in seven days, instead of ten, which might 
have been done, especially as they were chiefly mounted, they would have succeeded. They should also 
have pushed the advantage evidently gained at the 
commencement of the action. They failed in another 
point, which they had my advice, and indeed positive 
orders for, namely, to make the last day's march as long as possible, and attack the place in the night; 
but they halted in the evening, within nine miles, and 
fired their rifles at seven in the morning, before they 
marched. These people now seem convinced that 
they cannot perform as much by themselves as they 
some time since thought they could. Perhaps it is 
right that they should put more dependence on regular troops. I am sorry I have not more, to afford 
them assistance. I have the honor to be. 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,

Sir, 
</p><p>
Dr. Knight, a surgeon I sent with Colonel Crawford, returned the 4th instant to this place. He brings 
an account of the melancholy fate of poor Crawford. 
The day after the main body retreated, the Colonel, 
Doctor, and nine others, were overtaken, about thirty 
miles from the field of action, by a body of Indians, 
to whom they surrendered. They were taken back to Sandusky, where they all, except the Doctor, were 
put to death. The unfortunate Colonel, in particular, was burned and tortured in every manner they could invent. 
</p><p>
The Doctor, after being a spectator of this distressing scene, was sent, under guard of one Indian, to the 
Shawanese Town, where he was told he would share 
the same fate next day; but fortunately found an opportunity of demolishing the fellow, and making his 
escape. The Doctor adds, that a certain Simon Girty, 
who was formerly in our service, and deserted with McKee, and is now said to have a commission in the 
British service, was present at torturing Colonel Crawford, and that he, the Doctor, was informed by an 
Indian, that a British Captain commands at Sandusky; 
that he believes he was present, also, but is not certain; but says that he saw a person there who was 
dressed and who appeared like a British officer. He 
also says the Colonel begged of Girty to shoot him, 
but he paid no regard to the request. A certain Slover has also come in yesterday, who was under sentence at the Shawanese Town. He says a Mr. William 
Harrison, son-in-law to Colonel Crawford, was quartered and burned. Both he and the Doctor say they 
were assured, by sundry Indians they formerly knew, 
that not a single soul should in future escape torture ; 
and gave, as a reason for this conduct, the Moravian 
affair. A number of people inform me, that Colonel Crawford ought to be considered as a Continental officer, and are of opinion retaliation should take place. 
These, however, are such facts as I have been able 
to get. Dr. Knight is a man of undoubted veracity.
</p><p>
Slover was employed as a guide to the party under Colonel 
This account has struck the people of this country 
with a strange mixture of fear and resentment. their 
solicitations for making another excursion are increasing daily, and they are actually beginning to prepare 
for it. I have the honor to he, with perfect respect, 
Sir,
